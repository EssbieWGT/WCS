(Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)One year into his first term as Pennsylvania’s attorney general, Dave Sunday touted a list of accomplishments, including illegal firearm recoveries, fentanyl seizures and combating scammers. 
“This first year as your attorney general was full of unique challenges and achievements, including progress in defending Pennsylvanians from modern-day threats, such as artificial intelligence and online environments that expose our children and older residents to physical, mental, and financial harm,” Sunday said in a release. “Technology and criminal methods are advancing quickly, but our great team embraces the hard work that comes with protecting people, families, and their assets.” 

An eight-minute video posted to his YouTube channel included portions of Sunday’s inaugural speech as the state’s top law enforcement officer and clips from various press conferences. A top focus was the seizure of more than 56 million fentanyl doses and 100,000 fentanyl pills, with an estimated street cost of $58 million. 
Much of that dangerous drug came from Philadelphia and its collar counties, as detailed at a press conference in October, but the issue impacts thousands of Pennsylvanians. In 2023, 4,719 Pennsylvanians died from an overdose and there were 37,371 nonfatal suspected overdoses, according to the state Department of Health. 
“But enforcement alone isn’t enough. We cannot just arrest our way out of this crisis,” Sunday said in the video, pivoting to highlight the Law Enforcement Treatment Initiative. 
The program offers an alternative to incarceration for non-violent offenders and is available in 33 counties. Initially tailored for those with substance use disorder, some counties chose to expand its reach to include mental health resources.

Additionally, 539 illegal firearms were recovered by task forces led by the Attorney General’s Office, including guns that were illegally trafficked, had no serial numbers or were possessed by individuals prohibited from buying firearms — either due to a prior felony conviction or for another reason. 
Other accountings included in the release: 

120 defendants charged with fraud, abuse or criminal waste related to the Medicaid system, leveraging more than $40 million in restitution. Another 550 cases and investigations are active. 
100 new investigations into large-scale theft and fraud under the Organized Crime Retail Unit.

After growing up in Ottumwa and graduating from Indianola’s Simpson College, I worked in South Dakota at the start of my career. I enjoyed my years in the Mount Rushmore State, but their higher education system pales in comparison to Iowa’s, and the same is true of other surrounding states. So I’m grateful to have spent the last 18 years in Iowa’s higher education system.
Iowa is the envy of other states when it comes to our full complement of higher education options: three top-notch Regents institutions, 15 excellent community colleges, and 26 nonprofit, private colleges and universities that each contribute to the economy, culture and quality of life in the communities they call home. Iowans are blessed to have access to each of these options, and we desperately need all three to continue flourishing. 
And yet, Iowa’s House of Representatives is poised to advance a bill that will likely lead to the closure of some of Iowa’s private colleges. If House Study Bill 533 becomes law, Iowa taxpayers will be on the hook for $20 million (for starters) to enable Iowa’s community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees, something the state’s three public universities and 26 private colleges already do exceedingly well.
The argument is not valid 
The proposal’s key argument is that there are higher education “deserts” in Iowa. That’s just not true. Through Iowa’s public and private four-year colleges, all of Iowa is covered for in-person and online, undergraduate and graduate education. Moreover, Iowa already has a statewide transfer guarantee that enables students from all 15 community colleges to seamlessly complete a bachelor’s degree at Iowa, Iowa State, UNI, or nearly any Iowa private college. Northwestern is a proud participant in this program.
Rationale for the proposal’s key argument is embarrassingly weak. The report submitted to the House education subcommittee contains sparse anecdotal data with no concrete research or analysis to back its claims. No degree start-up costs or economic impacts to Iowa private colleges or their communities are identified. Alarmingly, despite this inadequate data and little meaningful input from the private colleges that have been providing four-year degrees (at zero taxpayer cost) for more than 170 years, the bill is moving recklessly forward.
At the same time, higher education faces a well-documented “enrollment cliff.” Due to declining birth rates during the 2008 recession, the number of high school graduates nationwide will decrease by 15% in the next decade. This is precisely the wrong moment to spend taxpayer dollars enabling community colleges to duplicate degrees already offered by Iowa’s four-year institutions.
‘Isn’t competition good?’
Competition is good, if the terms are fair. Despite supporters’ generous investment in private colleges, our institutions will not be able to compete with a glut of state-funded bachelor’s degrees if community colleges begin offering them too. More of Iowa’s private colleges will experience decline and closure, like Iowa Wesleyan University did in 2023.
A solution without a problem 
We need our community colleges to continue doing what only they can do! They are critical producers of the diverse workforce we need in Iowa. Many employers already can’t find enough welders, powerline workers, and other tradespeople to hire. Iowa already has three public universities and 26 private, nonprofit colleges that are superbly educating students who want bachelor’s and graduate degrees.
Iowans like a good deal. We already have a great deal with our outstanding system of higher education. Let’s not waste taxpayer dollars attempting to fix a problem that simply doesn’t exist.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Northwestern-College-photo-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The state’s newly expanded charter school co-location program could be limited after the Florida Department of Education received “a lot of feedback,” an administrator said.
The department hosted a rule development meeting Monday, soliciting feedback for Schools of Hope rules, the program that lawmakers vastly expanded in the waning hours of the 2025 legislative session.
Since the last-minute change approved by lawmakers, traditional public schools have been overwhelmed by newly-enabled charter school operators applying to open inside unused portions of public schools.
The department had not finalized rule language as of Monday. The state said it anticipates the language will be posted this week to the state’s website and that the state Board of Education will review language during its Feb. 20 meeting in Key West. The state website provides room for members of the public to submit feedback. 
Adam Emerson, director of the Office of School Choice at the department, was the only speaker during a teleconference Monday. He said since the state implemented the expansions in the fall, there has been “a lot of feedback.”
According to Emerson, some “high-level components that we will consider” in further Schools of Hope administrative rules include:

Limits around the number of building notices submitted by a single Hope operator. “We are limiting the number of building notices in this particular rule development.”
“We are looking at greater assurances around a Hope operator’s proposed co-location with a district school.”
More provisions with mutual management plans “with a goal of offsetting some of the costs that are associated with that co-location.”

“We will be looking at tweaking the criteria to approve the Hope operator” and setting timelines for operators to submit notices of intent to co-locate, Emerson said. 
The Schools of Hope program was created under former House Speaker Richard Corcoran to allow charter schools to open near “persistently low performing” schools, but the 2025 Legislature expanded the area and scope that these publicly funded and privately operated charter schools that may open in areas adjacent to “persistently low performing” traditional public schools may serve.
It allows these schools to open in low-income zones or even outside such zones if there is a suitable underused, vacant, or surplus facility, and in the attendance zone of a “persistently low performing school.”

Under the new law, “hope operators” are allowed to open in vacant spaces inside public schools at no cost. School districts must provide custodial, maintenance, safety, food, nursing, and transportation services if the school of hope requests it.
In September, the day after the Board of Education implemented the law, Gov. Ron DeSantis and billionaire Ken Griffin announced that a New York-based charter operator would open in Miami.
Less than a week after the rule went into effect last fall, the Florida Policy Institute, a non-partisan policy research organization, reported that charter operators had sent 690 “letters of intent” to co-locate inside of public schools in 22 counties.
Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas defends the program, and the GOP-led Legislature has not indicated a move toward addressing school concerns in this legislative session, although Democratic legislators have proposed changes to the laws passed less than a year ago.

(Getty Images)Wolverines in the lower 48 States were trapped, hunted and poisoned to near extinction in the late 1800s and early 1900s and have not recovered, just the opposite in fact. It took court action by the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and other conservation groups to finally get the dwindling population listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in 2023.
The federal government is legally required to designate “critical habitat” to protect ecosystems for the recovery of threatened and endangered species, but has failed to do so for wolverines, which are hanging on by the thinnest of threads. To stave off extinction, we need to protect the habitat in which they can survive — a challenge now further exacerbated by an increasingly hot climate diminishing the deep snows they require for denning and food storage. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service stated that wolverines can no longer be found in New Mexico but wolverine habitat currently exists in portions of northern New Mexico, Utah, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada and Washington. Efforts are underway to reintroduce wolverines to the Southern Rockies (which include north-central New Mexico). Evaluating lands in that region for protection as critical habitat will only benefit that effort and help restore the species to the region.


It’s estimated there are only 318 wolverines remaining in the entire lower 48 States. Scientists believe the “effective population,” which is the number of individuals capable of reproducing and contributing to the next generation, is likely less than 40. 
You read that right, fewer than 40 wolverines are currently capable of keeping the species from going extinct in the contiguous U.S. And what is the U.S. Fish and Wild Service doing to recover wolverines as required by law? Not much.
The Fish and Wildlife Service noted that wolverine populations are relatively small, fragmented and isolated from larger populations in Canada. In Montana, the areas required for wolverines range from 193 to 588 square miles for males and 55 to 148 square miles for females.
To protect the ecosystems upon which wolverines depend, the Endangered Species Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to designate “critical habitat” — the areas that provide the secure habitat where they are protected from threats like incidental trapping and can successfully reproduce.
The designation of “Critical Habitat” includes those areas occupied by the species at the time of listing that possess the physical and biological features such as food, water and shelter needed for survival and recovery. These areas may also include areas not yet occupied but needed for future population growth.
Because critical habitat designation is essential to the conservation of the species, special management consideration or protections may be required.  The designation also guides federal actions to prevent destruction or modification of this habitat, thereby increasing species’ chances of recovery, 
Unfortunately the Fish and Wildlife Service has not followed the law, has not designated critical habitat, and is shirking its duty to keep wolverines from extinction — which is why the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and our fellow plaintiffs recently filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Montana. 
Although the majority (95%) of wolverine habitat in the lower 48 states is federally owned and managed by the Forest Service, there are no regulatory mechanisms or standards in Forest Service Land and Resource Management Plans to protect wolverines and their habitat. Not only is nothing being done to protect and restore wolverines and the ecosystems upon which they depend, the Forest Service has announced a massive 25% increase in national forest logging, in effect, destroying what critical habitat may be left on public lands. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service has failed — and continues to fail — to comply with its mandatory, non-discretionary, duty to designate critical habitat for wolverines as required by Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act. To maintain and recover the species our choice was either take the delinquent agency to court or watch wolverines dwindle into extinction. We sided with the wolverines and are being represented by the Western Environmental Law Center.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wolverine-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A state appeals court ordered a lower court Monday to restart proceedings over whether a casino exemption in New Jersey’s indoor smoking ban violates the state’s constitution, finding procedural deficiencies had denied the case a fair hearing.
The decision is the latest in a yearslong fight over the 2006 Smoke-Free Air Act, which banned indoor smoking statewide but allowed it to continue inside casinos and their simulcasting facilities. Casino floor workers represented by the United Auto Workers union have for years pushed to end the exemption.
A lower court judge in 2024 dismissed a complaint filed by the union and an antismoking advocacy group, but Monday’s decision dings that judge for improperly addressing the plaintiffs’ equal protection challenge and for not performing detailed fact findings. The lower court judge decided the case based on written briefs alone and no testimony, according to Monday’s ruling.
“On remand, the court shall allow the record to be developed and litigated to address the hotly contested projections of revenue loss, and for the court to make appropriate findings of fact concerning the reliability and credibility of the competing expert projections. Such findings are especially crucial to the ultimate disposition of plaintiffs’ state equal protection arguments, with the health of thousands of casino employees and, perhaps, millions of dollars at stake,” Judge Jack Sabatino wrote for the three-judge panel.
Rep. LaMonica McIver to appeal judge’s decision on her assault charges

The casino workers sued after legislative pushes to close the exception — ones that enjoyed broad support among lawmakers — stalled over concerns about the effect an indoor smoking ban would have on gambling houses’ profitability.
The workers alleged the law unconstitutionally singled them out to face the harms of secondhand smoke.
They charged it violated constitutional rights to safety and equal protection and was unconstitutional special legislation — laws that improperly single out an individual or group and do not apply to others similarly situated.
When he was governor, Phil Murphy banned smoking inside casinos for about 11 months during the pandemic, though that ban was lifted in June 2021 (Murphy left office last week).

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)
The trial court judge in August 2024 ruled there was no constitutional right to safety, found provisions in the New Jersey Constitution related to Atlantic City and its casinos allowed special legislation, and dismissed the workers’ equal protection claims.
The workers harmed by secondhand smoke could just find other jobs, the trial judge ruled, and casino revenue demanded that the indoor smoking exception be allowed to continue.
That judge, who denied preliminary restraints to bar casino smoking and dismissed workers’ challenge to the law, erred repeatedly, the appellate court found Monday.
The trial court used the wrong test to weigh the constitutionality of the smoking exemption, asking whether a rational basis existed for such a ban rather than employing the three-part balancing test used in equal protection cases lodged under New Jersey’s Constitution, Monday’s ruling says.

The trial judge also improperly deferred to the findings of a casino-funded report that found banning indoor smoking would significantly reduce gambling houses’ revenue. That report found the ban would cut revenue by diverting smokers to casinos in other states or forcing them to interrupt their gaming for cigarette breaks.
UAW and Casino Employees Against Smoking Effects, which joined the union as a plaintiff, pointed to a separate study that found smoking and non-smoking casinos perform similarly.
The lower court took the casinos’ study at face value and did not appear to consider the one raised by smoking opponents, Monday’s decision says.
“The trial court improvidently accepted at face value respondents’ disputed economic contentions and the untested premise that ending the smoking exemption will inexorably result in drastic revenue and job losses, without a development of a fuller record,” Sabatino wrote.
The appeals panel declined to weigh whether the state’s constitution creates a right to safety, saying that matter falls outside the scope of its review and is better left to a higher authority.
“If such a sweeping right is recognized for the first time, it should be by the Supreme Court as the ultimate arbiter of our State Constitution,” wrote Sabatino.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 19:42:05+00:00,CT Mirror,CT legislators to pitch bill to allow lawsuits against federal agents,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/ct-legislators-to-pitch-bill-to-allow-lawsuits-against-federal-agents/,CT Democrats said they will propose a bill allowing residents to sue federal agents for violations of their constitutional rights.,"Connecticut state lawmakers said Monday that they will propose a bill allowing CT residents to sue federal law enforcement agents for violations of their constitutional rights. 
The bill’s proposal is in response to the shooting of Alex Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Saturday. Pretti is the second protester killed by federal immigration authorities in Minnesota this month, after Renee Good was shot and killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7. 
“I’ve heard from many of my constituents who are concerned that this could happen here and who are looking to the state and our state leaders and to provide some assurance that Connecticut is doing what we can to protect our residents,” said Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, during a press conference on Monday. 
Connecticut would join several other states that have enacted similar laws, including California, Massachusetts, Maine and, most recently, Illinois. 
“This is a well-established thing that we can do to make sure that if constitutional rights are violated, that the residents of the state can do something about it and can bring a lawsuit and can achieve justice,” said Lesser.
In 1983, a federal law was passed allowing for lawsuits against local and state officials in the case of a violation of constitutional rights. But there is no equivalent law allowing people to sue federal officials. In response, states began to create what are called “converse 1983 laws,” allowing for lawsuits against federal agents. 
The 1971 Supreme Court case Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics found that individuals do have a right to sue federal officials for damages relating to violations of people’s constitutional rights. But the court has not allowed a lawsuit under Bivens to proceed in more than 30 years, and a 2017 Supreme Court decision tightened its use even further. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, noted that the Westfall Act, a 1988 law that protects federal employees from personal lawsuits for their conduct while carrying out their professional duties, further limits individuals’ recourse. 
“I think it’s important for folks to be able to rest assured that the Constitution of the United States means something. If that doesn’t mean something, I don’t know who we are, what this country is,” said Winfield. 
Sen. President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said it was possible the law could be challenged by the federal government. The federal government sued the state of Illinois last month, claiming that a law allowing people to sue federal immigration agents went against the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says that federal law overrides state law. 
But Looney disagreed that the proposed Connecticut law was at odds with the U.S. Constitution. 
“These actions actually further the ultimate supremacy of the federal constitution by helping people vindicate their fundamental federal constitutional rights,” said Looney. 
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, welcomed debate on the proposed law in a statement he issued Monday. 
“Anyone who breaks state or federal laws should be held accountable for their actions. In the meantime, the amped up rhetoric and the violence must end. Anyone who doesn’t like how the law is enforced is free to advocate for different laws, and to protest peacefully,” said Harding. 
Democratic lawmakers said they had been working with the Connecticut chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union to draft the legislation. 
There have been constitutional violations in Connecticut as ICE increased its presence here, said Chelsea Infinity-Gonzalez, ACLU-CT’s director of public policy and advocacy.  
“ There’s operations ramping up all around us, in New York and Massachusetts, most recently in Maine. And so it truly is only a matter of time,” said Gonzalez. 
Gonzalez said the ACLU was also working on legislation that would regulate the use of license plate readers so that the data collected was not used to assist federal law enforcement. 
At the federal level, Connecticut politicians have widely criticized the shootings in Minnesota, and several have called for an independent investigation into the shooting. State investigators were not allowed access to evidence in the shooting of Good, and Drew Evans, superintendent of Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which investigates police shootings, told reporters Saturday that federal officers had blocked his agency from the scene of Pretti’s shooting even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday, calling on him to share records on the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to repeal “sanctuary policies” and allow detention centers to cooperate with ICE, and to provide the federal government with access to the state’s voter rolls. 
Connecticut, along with 22 other states, has been sued in federal court by the Trump Administration for its voting records. The state in July joined 20 other states in a lawsuit pushing back against a directive from the federal government to provide data on people enrolled in SNAP. 
In response to a question from CT Mirror, spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office Elizabeth Benton said the state “has not received such a letter” from Bondi and referred to earlier comments in which she said that any statements about hypothetical requests for data from the federal government would be “premature” and depend on the exact data requested. 
Duff said during the press conference that the federal government was targeting Democratic-led states, and that Connecticut would “resist feverishly.”“The federal government does not run elections, and we’re not going to give them data in order to try to make a mockery of our residents, our voters, and anyone else for their cruel and dangerous policies,” he said. 
Connecticut’s congressional delegation last week voted against a bill that would fund the federal Department of Homeland Security. The bill passed the House of Representatives and is now headed to the Senate.

Fisackerly added that continued freezing temperatures could cause more outages.

Electric Cooperatives of Mississippi 
Twelve of the Electric Cooperatives of Mississippi’s 26 operations have requested restoration assistance with additional crews coming from out of state. According to a Monday press release, travel is dangerous in parts of the state that have been hardest hit and it is difficult to say when everything will be back on.
Tishomingo County Electric Power Association
“It’s a war zone out here,” said Cody Durham, CEO of Tishomingo County Electric Power Association. Around 80% of Tishomingo Electric’s customers are without power. 
Durham said restoring power to the county’s electric water pumps is the first priority. He hopes water would be restored by Monday night. 
“We’re doing the best we can to work through these tough conditions,” Durham said. Because of cold and icy conditions, he said it’s impossible to know the exact extent of the damage. He requested additional crews to help clear trees and repair lines. He urged people to check for warming shelters that are being set up in the county and go there if the roads are passable.
Tippah, Alcorn, Benton and Union counties 
The Tippah Electric Power Association, which serves 13,927 customers in Tippah, Alcorn, Benton, and Union counties in Mississippi as well as Hardeman County in Tennessee, reported Monday that all but six of its customers had lost power. The provider said Sunday it is looking at “weeks instead of days to restore power” to everyone.
The utility is one of several in north Mississippi that buys power from the Tennessee Valley Authority.
“Tippah EPA still does not have feed to 5 of our substations,” the utility wrote on its Facebook page. On Sunday, the provider wrote that its power distribution system had “suffered catastrophic damage.”
“TVA and local power company crews are working around the clock to restore service as safely and quickly as possible,” TVA spokesperson Julia Wise told Mississippi Today on Monday. “We are making progress despite difficult conditions for workers, including fallen trees, deep snow, icy roads and frigid temperatures. Crews are on the ground and in the air assessing storm damage and repairing transmission lines.”
TVA serves 346,000 customers in northeastern Mississippi, through local public utilities and cooperatives.
Officials in Ripley, the county seat of Tippah County, reported both gas and water outages in addition to the power troubles. “Most areas” of Ripley dealt with water issues after an outage at a pump station, city officials wrote on social media. 
On Sunday, the city also reported a “major gas line break” between Ripley and Blue Mountain that left “many residents” without gas. Officials Monday said repairs were still in progress.
Water and generator system failures
Local newsrooms report boil-water notices for Quitman County, Panola County and Holly Springs. The Mississippi State Department of Health’s Bureau of Public Water Supply is working with local water systems to clear the boil advisories, according to department spokesperson Greg Flynn. 
He said no contamination has been reported, but water systems need to check their quality whenever a power outage causes a drop in water pressure. Because there may be no power to boil water in some places, Flynn said people might need to use bottled water.
County emergency management contacts in Quitman County, Panola County and Marshall County did not immediately respond to Mississippi Today’s calls Monday. Scott Simmons, Mississippi Emergency Management Authority’s external affairs director, said MEMA is working with local governments and the state Department of Transportation to take 64,000 bottles of water to north Mississippi communities that lack access to fresh tap water. 
The authority was sending the water and 30 generators to Camp McCain in Grenada before distributing them to communities.
Simmons said the generators would go to health buildings serving vulnerable groups — long-term care facilities, hospitals, nursing homes and warming centers. He said multiple locations had generators that failed during the weekend, and only some had started working again by early Monday. 
“It’s going to be a challenge, but that’s the challenge we’re tackling right now,” Simmons said.
David Kenney, a spokesperson for the state transportation department, said the agency was continuing to clear fallen trees from highways and interstates.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/25122912/oxford-storm-20260125-1027.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Shockwaves from the shooting death of an anti-ICE Minneapolis protester over the weekend are reverberating throughout the Republican Party and even dividing conservative leaders within Florida — the most ICE-friendly state in the nation.
The cracks in the resounding GOP support for the Department of Homeland Security are both rare and a first under President Donald Trump, whose promise of mass deportations helped him win in November 2024. But the tactics employed to carry out that agenda have begun to raise concerns, even among the president’s most ardent of supporters.
“Distorting, politicizing, slandering — justifying what happened to Alex Pretti contradicts the American values the administration campaigned on,” Republican state Sen. Ileana Garcia posted on social media Monday morning. The Miamian co-founded “Latinas for Trump” in 2016.
Ileana Garcia via Florida Senate
“He was neither a domestic terrorist nor an assassin. … Allowing individuals like Stephen Miller, among others, who represent the government and make hard-line decisions, to make such comments will have long-term consequences,” she warned. “This is not what I voted for!”
This is the second time Garcia, the daughter of Cuban exiles, has criticized the Trump administration’s actions on undocumented immigration. In June, she similarly blasted Trump’s homeland security adviser, Miller, for his “inhumane” approach to mass deportations.
Other Republicans like U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar offered more muted criticisms. 
“Washington’s failure on immigration is hitting our streets. Minneapolis is the result of Washington refusing to fix a broken immigration system and continuing to enforce outdated laws,” she wrote on social media, calling for an end to “chaos” and “tragedy.” 
“There is precisely one bipartisan bill … that revamps our immigration system, including ICE enforcement policy, so they don’t need to be out in large-scale operations in our communities,” she added.
Florida Republicans have long-touted how the Sunshine State is the most friendly in the nation to Trump’s mass deportation agenda. This includes multiple state-run migrant detention centers, all 67 counties partnering with ICE, and laws (although contested) preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the state.
What happened?
On Saturday, 37-year-old VA ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed during a struggle with Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. Pretti, who had a revolver stowed in his belt, approached an officer while recording. The agent had just shoved a woman to the ground, videos show.
Pretti was quickly swarmed by five officers. According to video footage, one officer appears to take Pretti’s revolver out of his waistband before another discharges his weapon and kills him.
DHS offered another version of events.
“An individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun. The officers attempted to disarm the suspect, but the armed suspect reacted violently,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed.
This was the second videoed death of an ICE protester in Minneapolis in a matter of weeks. On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE while fleeing in her vehicle. Officials say she was attempting to run over an agent with her car, prompting the lethal action.
 Growing call for action

Garcia isn’t the only Republican demanding answers. U.S. Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican chairing the House Homeland Security Committee, is requesting ICE and CBP testify in front of his panel.
Other congressional members from Texas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Maine, and Alaska are also calling for an investigation. Even Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Nebraska Republican and staunch Trump supporter, has asked for a “transparent investigation.” Others like the National Rifle Association have criticized the administration in the surrounding chatter of Pretti’s death.
This came after FBI Director Kash Patel claimed, “You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.” That’s false, and the NRA said as much.
But not all Republicans are breaking ranks. Gov. Ron DeSantis blamed Minnesota’s Democratic leadership for its “toxic environment,” although he didn’t mention Pretti’s death specifically. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Pretti.
“What we’re not doing is what people like [Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz] and what this Mayor are doing, which is basically trying to sabotage the enforcement operations,” DeSantis said during an unrelated press conference Monday morning. “ They’re creating a toxic environment where they’re really inciting people to go out and show hostility to the agents who are doing this. That is not a recipe for success. That is not the way that you do business.”
Pretti’s death has even been reflected into the looming Florida gubernatorial race. Democrat David Jolly, a former Republican member of Congress, called the shooting a “murder” and demanded Noem be removed from her post.
“We know what we saw. An American citizen practicing civil disobedience was disarmed and then shot 10 times in the street, and his body lay lifeless and he was murdered,” Jolly said during a campaign event, Florida Today reported.
But his opponent and favored candidate to replace DeSantis, U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, saw the situation differently. On an appearance with Fox News, Donalds — endorsed by Trump — apologized to immigration agents for “having to deal with all these protests.”
“We stand behind you, we want you to continue to do your job on behalf of the United States of America,” he said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alexpretti-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)For the fourth consecutive year, Utah lawmakers rejected a proposal aimed at holding gun owners accountable when an improperly stored firearm ends up being used by a minor to commit a crime. 
In a 9-2 vote, the House Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Committee shot down HB80, sponsored by Rep. Andrew Stoddard, D-Millcreek. The bill would have created a class C misdemeanor penalty for unsafe firearm storage. The bill would not punish adults for gun accidents or if the firearm is used for self defense, suicide, or if it is reported stolen. 
“This isn’t for the tragic situations where there is a loaded firearm that’s not secured, a child gets it, and then dies from an accidental shooting,” Stoddard, the bill sponsor, said during the committee meeting. “In order to qualify under this proposed statute, it would have to be used intentionally in a fight or a quarrel.”
Republican committee members raised concerns about gun owners accessing their firearms in case of a home invasion, saying “seconds count” in dangerous self-defense situations. They argued secure gun storage can delay access and hinder self-defense.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stoddard said HB80 is similar to a Florida law that holds gun owners liable when a minor uses a firearm “in a public place” or “in a rude, careless, angry or threatening manner.” Twenty-seven states and Washington D.C. have secure storage laws aimed at preventing children from accessing a firearm, according to a Johns Hopkins study. 
“This is just one small step to try to help it so that we don’t have to be so reactive, that we can be proactive in stopping school shootings with the side effect of stopping firearm suicides,” Stoddard said. 
The same Johns Hopkins study found that child access prevention “was associated with reductions in youth gun suicide rates.” As Utah’s high youth suicide rate continues to increase, Stoddard sees HB80 as a helpful mechanism to reduce that tragic statistic.
“You can see that the data is clear,” Stoddard said. “These types of laws help.”
A narrower bill every year
For the last four years, Stoddard has sponsored some version of a gun storage bill without success, narrowing the legislation every year in an effort to respond to lawmakers’ concerns.
“I’ve worked with the drafting attorneys year after year to try to get this as narrow as possible,” Stoddard said in an interview with Utah News Dispatch. “There’s really nothing else we can do to make it more narrow, other than drop it to an infraction, which at this point just seems ridiculous.”
HB80 includes four requirements, all of which must be met to proceed with criminal prosecution of a firearm owner in the event a minor uses it to commit a crime:

A gun owner fails to secure a loaded firearm in a “box, case, chest, locker, safe, or similar receptacle that is secured in such a manner so as to prevent an individual from accessing the contents of the container.”
A gun owner “knows or reasonably should know that a minor is likely to obtain possession of the loaded firearm.”
The minor obtains access to the firearm in violation of “Section 76-11-211, possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor.”
The minor “possesses, exhibits, or uses the firearm in a public place; or draws, exhibits, or unlawfully uses the firearm” as a “dangerous weapon in (a) fight or quarrel.”

For third year in a row, Utah lawmakers shoot down secure firearm storage law  

“It is a very strict statute. You saw four separate requirements that had to have been met,” Stoddard said. “This isn’t just, ‘oh, I didn’t lock up my gun. Now you can charge me with a crime.’ This is, ‘I didn’t lock up my gun. I knew a kid could get it. Kid got it, kid did something illegal with it.’”
Despite multiple failed attempts, Stoddard said he plans to “keep bringing back” similar legislation in the future. “I feel very strongly about it, both in terms of gun violence, safety and also mental health,” he said. “It should be a higher crime, but I wanted to pass something the committee would be comfortable with in terms of bill language and bill level.”
“At this point, there’s nowhere else to go,” Stoddard added. “It’s either we want kids to be safe and we’re willing to deal with what might be an inconvenience of locking up our firearms and requiring people to do the same, or we’re just OK with it because we don’t want to step into that role.”
Violent gun crime
During public comment, Brett Robinson, chief policy adviser for the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s office, spoke in favor of the bill, citing trends in youth violence. 
“Up until five years ago, the demographic that committed the most homicides in our state was those who are 20 to 29 years of age at 150 homicides,” he said. “You flash forward to the last 10 years, the demographic with the most homicides are those who are 10 to 19 years of age, with 164.”
Robinson thanked the committee for previous legislation aimed at reducing youth crime, but emphasized HB80 could serve as an additional preventative tool. 
“This is another avenue that perhaps can decrease that number, and that’s just to stem the flow of these guns that get in the hands of children,” he said. “Many of the cases that we prosecute involve minors, and many of them get these guns or access to them within their own homes. Doing something to encourage responsible ownership is something that we believe will decrease the amount of cases that we need to prosecute.”

University of Utah freshman Ivy Manno expressed concern for mass shootings during public comment, referencing her experience with a school shooting that targeted a neighboring high school in Denver. 
“My generation knows all too well the devastation that gun violence can wreck in someone’s life,” she said. “My experience leads me to emphasize how important safe storage is today.”
Manno is a member of Students Demand Action, a student-run, anti-gun violence activist group. She spoke with Utah News Dispatch after the committee meeting and expressed frustration with the vote. 
“I think there was a slight misunderstanding of the bill in a lot of cases,” she said. “It can be construed in a different light, to make it sound like they’re trying to criminalize gun owners, but that really is not the intent.”
Opposition to the bill
The bill was voted down along party lines, with the nine Republican committee members who opposed it citing home defense and rural gun ownership. 
“I don’t know that we’re in a position where we should be mandating (firearm storage),” said Rep. Matthew Gwynn, R-Farr West, pointing to concern about “defending the sanctity of the home.” 
Referencing his own experience as a firearm owner, Gwynn said his family does not lock up all their firearms. 
“I don’t know that I can support a bill that’s going to make myself in violation of the statute,” he added. “This bill will make me a criminal. That’s the reality … we live in a world where sometimes we get threats.”
Clark Aposhian, board chairman for the Utah Shooting Sports Council and the organization’s registered lobbyist, spoke in opposition to the safe storage bill. He expressed concern that the bill would shift the “burden of proof in criminal law from (the) state to the individual.”
“HB80 shifts the legal burden in a very concerning way,” Aposhian said. “It includes an affirmative defense clause, so gun owners now must prove they comply with the state’s safe storage expectation if a minor acts as a firearm.”
Stoddard responded to Aposhian’s claims when he spoke with the Dispatch. “That’s 100% inaccurate. We have so many statues with affirmative defenses, and it’s not something that’s novel to this bill,” he said. “We have a lot of criminal statutes that have affirmative defenses. So it doesn’t shift the burden. It’s essentially a way out.”
Stoddard also emphasized that the bill’s narrow scope would prevent frequent prosecution under HB80. “This isn’t something that would get charged very often, and if it was, it would be in a justice court where someone could come in and say, ‘hey, look, here’s how I had this locked up.’ (The) prosecutor can see it and dismiss the case, and that’s why we provided that escape valve.”

Phaneuf discuss his article about Susan Keane, who is retiring after four decades.","Susan Keane spent four decades shaping fiscal policy in Connecticut. This will be the first year the General Assembly will convene without her since 1983.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Keith Phaneuf to discuss his article, “Susan Keane, champion of open budgeting in CT, calls it a career,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Keith’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Keith. Over the years, most of us have turned to you to help explain the intricacies of Connecticut state budgets. So it’s fascinating to hear about Susan Keane, the person behind the scenes who helped shape Connecticut budgets for more than four decades. She was your guide to understanding the state’s budget. Tell us about Susan and about how you first met her.
KP: Well, I first met Susan Keane back in the early 1990s, 1993 to be exact, when I was literally just in my first session trying to understand how the Appropriations Committee works. I think a lot of reporters tend to think, Well, the first thing I have to do is get to know the legislators. But what I learned early on is that good, non-partisan staff are what make every committee work. They’re the folks who handle the records, who gathered the research for legislators, who organized the meetings. And it was Susan Keane who first really showed me how that process worked. And it took me a while to realize how much I was benefiting just from how seriously she took that process.
WSHU: Now, you say that she kept things on track; she pretty much kept things moving. And crafting a budget is a very complicated business. Could you just tell us what goes into it and how she was able to keep on top of it?
KP: I can tell you what goes into it, if you want me to explain how she was able to pull it off — I still haven’t learned. It’s a very long process. We tend to think most folks, when they think of the budget, of the budget or the state budget, they just think of a book or the money that’s spent, but really it’s, it’s the product of months and months of work. The legislature’s Appropriations Committee, which has roughly 50 members, one of the largest committees, has a dozen subcommittees, and at any given time, its members can also be assigned to different task forces. They will, over the course of about two to two and a half months, be conducting dozens of hearings, not just the committee proper, but all of the different subcommittees. They break the budget down, and one subcommittee will deal with human services, and another with transportation, and so on. And I mean, most news organizations have one or two folks covering the capital. You can’t even get to all those meetings, so you’ve got to be able to go back, look at the minutes, and try to figure out what’s important. Meanwhile, in some sessions, hundreds of bills move through a committee, all of which, if they have any fiscal impact, ultimately become part of the budget. The fact that Susan has a system that allows you to get that information pretty much at your fingertips is amazing.
WSHU: Well, that’s really amazing. Let’s talk a little bit about Susan, the person. How did she get into this in the first place?
KP: Susan sort of got into it by accident. She was attending the University of Hartford. She wasn’t intending to work in government, but there was an opportunity for an internship at the state capitol. State Representative at the time in the late 1970s, Tom Serrani of Stamford, picked her for that internship, and within two years, he had asked her to run the Transportation Committee. A few more years after that, her mentor insisted that she apply for an opening with the Appropriations Committee, and she very quickly, not only got the job, but developed a close friendship with the house chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee at the time, a state representative named Janet Polinski, who really instilled in Susan a deep appreciation for open government.
WSHU: Now, you know, you say that she did not particularly care for the Appropriations Committee. She felt it was something that would be difficult for her to understand. How did she warm up to it?
KP: Well, what she said originally was, because Susan’s very loyal, and she was working on the Transportation Committee, and she noticed that the Appropriations Committee killed a lot of their bills, meaning whatever the Transportation Committee legislators were asking for money. The way Susan recalled it, appropriation said no, but I think appropriation, some folks call it the feeling committee. It is really where, probably more than any other committee, the public consistently reaches out. I mean, the average person may never testify in their life before the General Assembly, or maybe once or twice, but when you get that issue, that drives you to the point where you may want to drive to Hartford, or nowadays, thanks to Susan Keane, there are sometimes opportunities to testify online, or even if you submit something in writing, usually there’s dollars attached to it, which means, sooner or later, it goes through the Appropriations Committee, and I think, dealing with the public and seeing how people needed a way to connect with their legislators. And Susan saw herself as the facilitator of that connection, and I think that’s what drew her to the job and kept her on the job.
WSHU: How did she make that process open to the general public? What exactly did she do?
KP: Again, so many ways. I’ll just give you a few examples. Okay, if there were challenges in testifying. Let’s say you were a community college student, and you really wanted to talk to the General Assembly about some cutbacks, but just because of your classes, nine to five wasn’t working, Susan would find a way to make sure that there might be evening hours. There were instances, at times, where folks with mental illness, perhaps because of anxiety or other issues, really had trouble staying in a crowded room, so she’d have different procedures to stagger the testimony. Traditionally, a lot of times, committees let public officials go more quickly than the general public. Susan reversed it the other way and said, okay, the folks who have the mental health needs, we’ll take care of them. First, one of the things, if you’ll permit me, though, I want to also point out, as a member of the media, that was huge. You know, if you’re trying to cover an issue, it’s hard enough, it’s complicated enough. But if legislators are discussing a document, say a draft section of a portion of the budget, and you want to follow along. It’s hard enough to follow the discussion, but imagine if you’re following it and you don’t have a copy of the document they’re discussing. Now you might get it afterward. But Susan made sure you could get it while they were talking about it. She said, I know reporters will be coming to me saying, Can I get a copy so I know when they turn to page 43, What the heck is on page 43. Susan already had copies ready. She had an organized process to make sure the copies didn’t run out.
WSHU: Wow, I can really identify with that. You say that during COVID, she took the helm and made it possible for the hybrid hearing system to be developed, where you would have online people testifying online. Could you just tell us a little bit about how that evolved and how she took charge of that?
KP: Susan had been involved for years in taking the lead on training legislative staff, new legislators, providing an orientation for them, and assisting lobbyists to try to understand how the process works. So it was natural that during the coronavirus pandemic, when the pandemic struck, legislative leaders turned to her to basically say, please take the lead and try to set up a process. I mean, we’ve always had, I shouldn’t say, always, for a long time now there’s been the Connecticut Network, the internet news and cable news system for the legislature, and they have most of the hearing rooms in the Legislative Office Building wired for sound, and there are cameras, but it’s not interactive. You can watch something on CT-n, but it’s not like you can speak to legislators through your computer screen. So we had to set up with, you know, remote technology systems.
And I’m not saying like, for example, that. Susan Keane invented Zoom. But if you think about it, the legislature has very specific rules, for example, on how you conduct a meeting and how you vote, and you can’t just assume Jane Doe voted, because I think I heard some sound in the ether, and Susan set up a process to keep the things going, keep the debates going, keep the votes going, where folks would have to almost like, I think I compared it to a game of Simon Says. First, Simon says, turn on your computer camera, show your face. Then Simon says, state your full name. Then Simon says, state how you’re going to vote. Then wait to make sure the committee administrator has confirmed it. And at the beginning, folks continue to forget what Simon said and Sue with without ever any arrogance, would gently, sort of steer them back, go through it all. She also set up tons, most folks don’t even know of YouTube channels for General Assembly committees, which also creates another record. So if you miss a meeting, you can go back. Say you just wanted to watch. But for some reason, the event wasn’t on the Connecticut Networks’ main news feeds. You could find it on YouTube.
And just one last point, I’m sorry to drag this out. This system is still very much in play. There will be a lot of hybrid meetings. Most meetings now are hybrid, where some folks are in attendance, some aren’t. There will be times when the legislature, a legislative committee, really can’t schedule enough votes unless they have remote attendance, and it makes committee meetings so much more efficient, because you can gather them relatively quickly, because folks don’t all have to drive in from Hartford.
WSHU: Now you say that Susan will be missed at the Capitol for her Irish wit and fiery red hair, not to mention a deep appreciation of music and dance. Could you tell us about the music and dance aspect?
KP: Well, she was an Irish step dancer as a child, actually very accomplished at that in the 80s and 90s. And I’m feeling old here, because I definitely remember the 90s with the General Assembly session, and there was a really big party after midnight, after they gaveled out. And Susan always enjoyed her dance. Her knowledge of music, though, is staggering. I mean, like I said, if you want to talk classical, if you want to talk big band, if you want to talk hip hop, if you want to talk 70s pop, or 70s funk, or 80s pop. It does not matter. Susan Keane is right there with you.
WSHU: And you say she will always be remembered for her laughter and sense of humor.
KP: Yes, Susan certainly was always very focused on the job. But there were a few times when, if we let’s put it this way, she never shortchanged a laugh. Susan did not. There was not a little mild chuckle. If she was going to laugh, she committed full-scale. She commits full scale to that laugh.
WSHU: Well, thank you so much, Keith. I really appreciate this behind-the-scenes look at the administrative staff that makes the Capitol work.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0109_SR_SusanKeane_085-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

“One of our main focuses is on educating community, and we want to bring dynamic speakers who have radical imaginations that are rooted in the fight for human rights,” said Candace Abdul-Tawwab, MSJW’s co-founder and executive director.
C.J. Lawrence, co-founder and CEO of Black With No Chaser, said, “It’s very rare that you would get the opportunity to do this. I think it’s important that we seize the moment while we can to connect with a revolutionary person and icon like Professor Angela Davis.”
Abdul-Tawwab said that partnering with Tougaloo College made sense because of the institution’s legacy as a hub for civil rights activists. Several people who work at Black With No Chaser are Tougaloo alumni.
In the 1960s and 70s, Davis was a prominent activist and member of the Communist Party of the United States of America and associated with the Black Panther Party. She previously spoke at Tougaloo College in 2015. Davis, a Birmingham native, was previously a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and vice presidential nominee.

James Comer received praise from President Donald Trump for a weekend interview where the congressman had suggested the president should consider removing federal immigration agents from Minnesota. 
Comer, who represents Kentucky’s 1st Congressional District, was critical of Democratic Minnesota leaders, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, for “getting people jacked up” about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in the state on Fox’s Sunday Morning Features with Maria Bartiromo. Comer contrasted the situation in Minneapolis with Washington, D.C., where Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration has cooperated with federal law enforcement and National Guard troops deployed by Trump to fight crime. 
ICE agents fatally shot a 37-year-old man, Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis on Saturday. The death comes roughly two weeks after an ICE officer shot 37-year-old Renee Good. 
“If I were President Trump, I would almost think about, ‘OK, if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way, and there’s a chance of losing more innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide: Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals? Are we going to allow our governor, attorney general and mayor to get away with this?”
Comer continued, adding that he thinks Minnesotans would “rebel against their leadership” over illegal immigration. 
Trump wrote on Truth Social Sunday afternoon that Comer “was GREAT in his Interview” on Fox, adding that Comer had “said it all” about Minnesota and other topics. 
“Jamie is doing a fantastic job!” the president said. 
The president announced on Monday that he would send U.S. border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota following Pretti’s death. 
On Fox, Bartiromo also asked Comer if ICE officers saw Pretti was armed during Saturday’s incident. The Kentucky Lantern’s sister outlet, the Minnesota Reformer, reported that a local official said the victim in the shooting was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. 
“I’ve watched that video dozens of times in slow motion. I’ve tried to determine whether he actually pulled a gun out or not,” Comer said. “I don’t know. I just know that the situation’s bad there.”
Comer then blamed sanctuary policies in Minnesota for illegal immigration in the state.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fancyfarm_001-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

The new version of the state’s Work-Based Learning Tax Credit, approved in 2025, took effect this month. It replaces two prior incentives and supports learning requirements in Louisiana’s new school accountability system. 
The nonprofit Leaders for a Better Louisiana advocated for the tax credit changes because few employers took advantage of the old ones, chief policy officer Barry Erwin said.
“The change in the accountability system has prompted school districts and superintendents to consider more ways to involve students in internships and other work-based learning experiences in high school, so hopefully it will be a win-win,” Erwin said in an email, “Help meet school performance goals for students and provide employers a stronger incentive to hire them.” 
In 2024, Louisiana’s Board of Elementary and Secondary Education approved a school accountability system that places a greater emphasis on high schools offering work-based learning experiences to their students. The system went into effect for the 2025-26 school year. A student who takes part in a work-based learning program under the accountability system also qualifies their employer for the tax credit.
The credit is available to businesses who make eligible hires in 2026. The amount of the credit is $2.50 per hour worked, up to a maximum of $2,500 per eligible worker per year. Students must work for their employers for at least 100 hours in the tax year for the business to qualify for the credits. The old credit offered $1.25 per hour worked and required businesses to employ the student for at least 250 hours per year. 
In certain circumstances, the credit can apply to workers up to age 24 who are not in high school. It is non-refundable, but any credit that exceeds a company’s Louisiana tax liability can be carried forward for up to five years.
Employers can claim the credit on their tax returns beginning in 2027. Total tax credits are capped at $1 million the first year but are allowed to grow to a maximum of $7.5 million in future years if participation grows.
Louisiana lags well behind other Southern states in the number of young people participating in internships and apprenticeships. Only about 5% out of the more than 40,000 Louisiana high school students who graduate annually hold an internship credit each year. The percentage is up to five times higher in Georgia and Tennessee, according to a Leaders for a Better Louisiana report last year. 
The same goes for apprenticeships. Louisiana has fewer apprenticeships than many of its neighboring states, and they pay the least. Only three out of every 1,000 Louisiana students graduate high school with apprenticeship experience, compared with nine in Arkansas. Apprenticeships in Louisiana pay an average of $14.90 per hour, comparable to the Arkansas wage but much less than Mississippi’s $21 per hour, according to the Leaders for a Better Louisiana report. 
Applications for Louisiana’s tax credit will be approved on a first-come, first-served basis and must be submitted between Jan. 1 and Feb. 28 each year through the Louisiana Taxpayer Access Point, known as LaTap for short. 
More information can be obtained from the Louisiana Department of Revenue.

(Bryce Dix/KUNM)Two bills that aim to strip the Mexican gray wolf of its federal endangered species protections are now snaking their way through the federal lawmaking process.
The Republican-led pieces of legislation – the “Pet and Livestock Protection Act” introduced by U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, (R-Colo.) and the “Enhancing Safety for Animals Act of 2025” authored by U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, (R-Ariz.) – would essentially do the same thing: delist the Mexican gray wolf from the Endangered Species Act.
If successful, the delisting would shift management back to the states of New Mexico and Arizona, potentially create “opportunities” for lobo hunting and trapping (depending on individual state regulations), and halt genetic diversification efforts.
While similar attempts to delist the animal have failed in the past, the current political atmosphere has advocates worried about what might happen if Congress decides the wolf doesn’t need help anymore.
Leia Barnett, a conservation advocate with the New Mexico-based environmental non-profit WildEarth Guardians, said she is stunned these bills are sailing through Congress, and wants politicians to ground themselves in the science of consistent management of the species, not political bickering.
“We’re not going to see that if we’ve got a patchwork management scheme that’s based on individual state agencies determining what’s right, rather than a larger national plan that can work towards meaningful, robust recovery,” Barnett told KUNM.
On Thursday, Rep. Gosar’s bill went through a “committee markup” meant to tweak language before a bill is sent to the House floor.
There, Gosar made the claim that the wolf “has been recovered” and his constituents are “paying the price” for increasing livestock depredations.
“Ranchers are losing cattle, horses and dogs,” Gosar said. “Families who have been stewards for the land for generations are being driven out of business.”
Although the species was almost completely wiped off the landscape from trapping and hunting, the Mexican wolf population has made a significant comeback thanks to coordinated recovery efforts and the broad protections of the Endangered Species Act.
At the same time, as wolf numbers continue to grow, data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shows that cattle kills have been proportionally dropping since 2019.
[data-viz src=”
Despite these discrepancies, Gosar said the federal management of the wolf is costing taxpayers and ranchers lots of money.
“This is not an anti-conservation bill, it is a pro-science, pro-law and pro-people bill,” Gosar said in support of his own legislation. “It acknowledges success where success has been achieved, and rejects the notion that federal agencies should operate without limits or consequences.”
To conservationists like Barnett, it’s not as black and white.
“There is robust science that tells us what we need to have a healthy, thriving, resilient lobo population,” Barnett said. “That includes 750 wolves at a minimum, dispersed across three interconnected sub populations of 200 wolves.”
A recent survey count estimates there are around 286 wolves in New Mexico and Arizona.
Additionally, research shows that the genetic diversity of the species is dangerously low – so much so, the whole population is as genetically related as siblings.
After the brief debate about the lobo’s recovery – ranging from the population’s growth, to the loss of rancher livestock from depredations, to science – the House Committee on Natural Resources ultimately decided to leave most of Gosar’s bill untouched, and recommended the full House pass the measure when it’s taken up for a vote.
The language of this bill, in particular, is alarming to Barnett because it would make any future attempts to relist the wolf much harder by preventing wildlife managers from considering the recovery status of lobos south of the border.
“That’s vindictive and malicious,” Barnett said. “It’s not based upon the needs of that species.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Boebert’s attempt at delisting the wolf is much farther along in the legislative process. It has already cleared the House and is now moving through Senate committee assignments.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brycedixphoto-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 13:57:12.861996

(Photo by Meghan Riley)A lawsuit filed by more than 15 conservation organizations says that the federal government has stalled in its plans to save wolverines. The lawsuit asks a court to compel the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to lay out specific plans to protect the threatened species’ habitat, the first part of the conservation project.
Biologists and conservation organizations have long lobbied scientists and politicians to place the wolverine on the Endangered Species List as a “threatened species,” a designation that focuses on a species’ habitat and ranges. The Biden administration did that in February 2023.
After an animal or plant is placed on the list, federal law allows the government a year to determine its range — the places that need to be protected and given special consideration in order to stop further losses. The federal government may extend that time by one year, if it needs, according to the lawsuit.
However, more than two years have passed, and the conservation organizations say that the federal government is violating its own laws by not moving forward on the process, even as the Trump administration looks to remove protections for other species, like grizzly bears and gray wolves.
“The service has yet to initiate the process of designating critical habitat for wolverines,” the lawsuit said. “The service is not actively working on a proposed rule to designate critical habitat for wolverines.”
 Wolverine populations in the West

The lawsuit said organizations included in the lawsuit have been commenting, and reminding the federal government, about the deadline. Now, they say the courts have the power to act and compel the federal government to begin the process.
“The (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) determined wolverine warranted listing under the ESA, primarily due to ongoing and increasing impacts of climate change and associated habitat degradation and fragmentation,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit said science proves wolverines need the snow of high elevations in order to den and rear their kits. Those areas are being impacted by both climate change and more human encroachment, the lawsuit states.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that 50 wolverines occupy the Idaho/Montana linkage area and 63 are in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, as of November 2023. Furthermore, it estimated just a few more than 200 wolverines in the Lower 48 states beyond those in and around Montana’s ranges.
“Wolverine populations, though widespread, were relatively small, fragmented and isolated from larger populations in Canada,” the lawsuit said.
The groups say that the service has not been able to provide any documentation that process has even begun, now more than two years after the designation.
“Wolverines are just hanging on — down to roughly 300 individuals. They deserve and desperately need all the protections guaranteed by law after being recognized as threatened, including critical habitat” said Matthew Bishop, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center. “Having areas set aside as critical habitat is a major — if not the most important — factor in helping threatened and endangered wildlife recover. Given wolverines’ small population size and climate change quickly shrinking the snowy habitat they rely on to survive, time is of the essence.”
The groups who are suing the federal government include: Friends of the Bitterroot, WildEarth Guardians, Friends of the Wild Swan, Swan View Coalition, Oregon Wild, Cascadia Wildlands, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Cottonwood Environmental Law Center, George Wuerthner (as an individual), Footloose Montana, Native Ecosystems Council, Helena Hunters and Anglers Association, Wilderness Watch, Trap Free Montana, and Friends of the Clearwater.

Ron DeSantis. (Screenshot via the governor's X livestream)Candy for Valentine’s Day?
Maybe not.
The administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday that it had tested 46 types of candy and that more than 60% of them (28) contained elevated arsenic levels that, consumed over time, could put children at an increased risk of cancer. 
This is the second announcement this month the DeSantis administration has made about its testing efforts and the results being posted on the Healthy Florida First website. The governor and First Lady Casey DeSantis announced Florida had tested 24 infant formulas and found that 16 contained heavy metals or chemicals.
Those efforts followed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s, directive to the federal Food and Drug Administration to look at ingredients used in infant formula. Before he joined the administration of President Donald Trump, Kennedy promised to look at whether there were toxic metals in infant formula.
Although the DeSantis administration purports that 28 candies showed high levels of arsenic, the first lady stressed that not all test results were bad. For instance, she said none of the candy the state tested showed elevated levels of lead, mercury, cadmium, or “other problematic carcinogens.”
She also highlighted the candy that didn’t contain higher levels of arsenic, including Hershey Milk Chocolate Bar, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Whoppers, M&M’s, Twix, and Milky Way.

“Our goal really has been, as the governor has articulated, to support the federal [Make America Healthy Again] movement by working as force multipliers, to be able to drive accountability through testing,” she said Monday during a press conference at The Villages. 
“The [Food and Drug Administration] primarily works as a reactionary force, stepping in after problems are identified, and while that role is very important, Florida is really working to change the system by supporting the FDA to not only continue to get in front of these problems by testing, but also by leading a coalition of states to trust but verify the integrity of our food supply.”
Florida tests 24 formulas; purport that 16 have at least one heavy metal

Florida tested candy from 10 different manufacturers. The Florida Phoenix reached out to six of the companies for comment but none of them immediately responded.
Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo joined the governor and first lady at the press conference and thanked the pair for providing him with the support to conduct the tests. He also thanked them for having the “vision” to know the testing should be conducted.
“There’s a lot more to go. There’s plenty of dirt, unfortunately, to uncover,” Ladapo said.
Arsenic is a naturally occurring element. It is a confirmed carcinogen and long-term exposure can increase the risk of skin, bladder, lung, and liver cancer. Kidney and prostate cancers may also be tied to high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic is “everywhere” and “in all foods,” Ladapo said, but added that it tends to be in low concentrations.
“I was really shocked by the levels of arsenic in common candies, the levels of arsenic in common candies are much higher, two, three, four times higher than even foods that we know have high levels of arsenic in general, like rice,” Ladapo said. “And compared to foods, just typical foods that people eat, the levels of arsenic were 20, 30, 40, times higher. It’s just unbelievable.” 
While elevated arsenic levels in a single piece of candy may not be harmful, the first lady stressed that it becomes harmful when taken into context of how candy is marketed and consumed.
For example, she said, Nerds Grape and Nerds Strawberry candy both showed elevated arsenic levels. The DOH determined that a child could safely eat roughly 96 pieces of Nerds candy in a year with no worries. 
“But 96 Nerds, as we well know, is not typically what comes in a box. When you think about it, a typical smaller box can contain about 2,000. If you get one of those big boxes that you get, like a movie theater, that’s about 8,000 Nerds,” she said. “Asking families to stop at 96 pieces over a year is not realistic when it’s viewed against how the product is packaged, marketed, and then consumed.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-26-at-9.45.40-AM-1024x553.png,,,2026-01-26 13:57:12.861996

(Kenneth Ferreria/Lincoln Journal Star)LINCOLN — Former State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst is sticking with his not guilty plea in court after resigning from the Nebraska Legislature to avoid the risk of being expelled.
A procedural hearing in Lancaster County Court on Monday set the date for McKeon’s bench trial for March 19. McKeon faces a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace, which comes with a maximum sentence of three months in jail, a $500 fine or both.
McKeon arrived late to his rescheduled hearing Monday after first trying to participate via Zoom from his attorney Perry Pirsch’s Lincoln office. Pirsch told Lancaster County Court Judge Matthew Acton that they intended to be there in person, but a prior Cass County Court case Pirsch was involved with was delayed.

Acton said parties must receive permission ahead of time to attend hearings using Zoom and ordered McKeon and Pirsch to travel to the courthouse before they proceeded.
“Court rules for both the district and county court states that all court hearings are presumed to be in person, sir,” Acton said. “And you did not ask for permission prior to appear via Zoom, so get down here.”
McKeon resigned from the Legislature this month minutes before debate was set to begin on a resolution to possibly expel him, which would have been a first in Nebraska history. He faced expulsion proceedings over allegations that he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer during an end-of-session party last year and what the Legislature’s Executive Board described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior,” based on the results of an internal investigation.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A separate criminal investigation after the incident led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency by the Nebraska State Patrol in October. Prosecutors have since charged him with misdemeanor disturbing the peace.
The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
McKeon missed his first court date in December. Pirsch said McKeon initially intended to plead no contest and sought to file that plea through a waiver, but Acton said that wasn’t allowed and ordered the arraignment be rescheduled for Monday and ordered McKeon to attend in person.
McKeon later changed his mind and pleaded not guilty in response to the Legislature’s Executive Board recommended he be expelled in a unanimous vote.
In a social media post Jan. 20, McKeon addressed his district saying that the process that led to his departure was “painful, frustrating, and at times unfairly portrayed in the headlines.”
“A series of political maneuvers reached a point that forced my resignation before an expulsion vote could occur,” McKeon said in a since-edited Facebook post.
McKeon had faced calls to resign since October when he was initially cited, including from Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials. McKeon said multiple times that he would not resign.
Multiple lawmakers — including one who supported McKeon — corroborated that there were enough votes to successfully expel McKeon, had the debate taken place. It takes 33 votes to expel a sitting senator.
The day after McKeon’s resignation, Pillen appointed State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul to represent District 41 in central Nebraska. Meyer had previously been appointed to the same seat by Pillen to replace Tom Briese, who resigned to serve as state treasurer.
Later this year, a special election will decide who serves the remaining two years of McKeon’s term. The Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office confirmed that no candidates have filed for that election as of Monday.

Carolyn Caiharr, an Edwardsville Republican, questioned a proponent of a bill that would allow lenders to charge a prepayment penalty to real estate investors. (Screen capture from the House Financial Institutes and Pensions Committee)TOPEKA — Real estate investors buying residential buildings in Kansas could be charged a penalty for paying off their mortgages early under proposed changes to the Kansas Contracts and Promises statute. 
The statute currently bars lenders from charging prepayment penalties on “any home loan” paid off after six months from the day the loan was taken out, the House Financial Institutions and Pensions Committee heard Monday. It doesn’t specify whether those loans are for individual homeowners or for real estate investors buying properties to rent or lease. 
House Bill 2497 would add language that allows lenders to charge prepayment penalties for investment properties but leave the ban in place for consumer personal loans.
Michael Stidham testified for Rocket Mortgage in favor of the bill, which he said would give investors more financing options. 
Rocket sets lower interest rates for loans that have a penalty for paying off early versus loans with no prepayment penalties, Stidham said. 
“A higher interest rate is always going to be required to offset the potential returns if that loan is paid off earlier than anticipated by the investor,” he said.
Allowing lenders to offer lower interest rates and include a prepayment penalty gives real estate investors flexibility to determine the best option for their financial situations, Stidham said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/House-finance-1-26-26-1024x612.png,,,2026-01-26 13:57:12.861996

Some additional information requested from petitioners was received as recently as January 9,” DEQ spokesperson Madison McGeffers wrote in an email. “In addition, 2025 laboratory results from DEQ’s own monitoring were recently received and will be incorporated into the assessment after quality assurance checks are performed.”
In the letter, Waterkeeper says that the state isn’t using nutrient pollution and dissolved oxygen concentrations in their river assessments. Low oxygen levels can happen at night, which are sometimes caused by algae blooms. Most plants don’t photosynthesize and produce oxygen at night.
In the draft DEQ water report, oxygen concentrations are specifically addressed:
“DEQ also will not be including dissolved oxygen (DO) assessments during this Integrated Report. Upon initial implementation of a draft DO assessment method, DEQ identified many instances in which Montana’s DO standards do not fully account for natural variability in DO conditions, leading to potential impairment designations even in areas with little to no human influence.”
Waterkeeper and other organizations it has worked with have done extensive monitoring on the Big Hole River.
“Nothing is preventing local groups and residents from taking actions to address water quality issues in the Big Hole River watershed right now. The entire watershed is eligible for 319 funding (DEQ’s 2026 call for applications open through Feb. 20) to address nonpoint source pollution,” McGeffers wrote. “Thanks to previous monitoring and watershed restoration planning, DEQ and local partners have already identified nutrient issues in the greater Big Hole watershed and have a good understanding of pollution sources as well as the types of strategies that can be implemented to address them.”
Montana, following legislation passed in 2021, does not base nutrient assessments upon the numeric nutrient criteria, instead using what’s called “narrative standards,” which Waterkeeper says is less accurate. The Environmental Protection Agency rebuffed Montana’s use of narrative standards under the Biden administration, but it’s been implied this appears to have changed under the second Trump administration.
“We note the Department withheld publishing a draft 2022-24 Integrated Report until winter 2025/26, almost a full year after the 2024 field season and after EPA’s approval of Montana’s repeal of numeric nutrient standards,” the Waterkeeper letter reads. 
The DEQ’s assessments also do not include assessments of excessive algal growth, nitrate and nitrite, total nitrogen, as well as total phosphorus, the draft report states.
“DEQ has a mandatory duty under federal law to identify unhealthy waters based on available data,” Guy Alsentzer, executive director of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, said in a statement. “Instead of using existing, undisputed science to identify problems and initiate restoration planning for degraded waterways, the agency is pretending very real nutrient pollution problems don’t exist.”
The letter also states the agency’s actions on the Big Hole are “contrary” to the requirements of the Clean Water Act, saying it’s not assessing “nutrients and nutrient impairments.”
It goes on to say the Clean Water Act requires all currently available data be used.
“The Department’s refusal to assess our and others’ scientific evidence and make a determination of attainment or nonattainment in the Big Hole River — or any other river for which the Department possesses nutrient science — is unlawful, as it frustrates and undermines the purposes and intent of the CWA and Montana WQA, and citizens’ right to a clean and healthful environment under the state constitution,” the letter reads.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Senate President Ben Albritton was hospitalized overnight Sunday with a blood clot in his lung, his office announced Monday morning.
The Wauchula Republican, now in “good spirits,” began experiencing chest pains Sunday morning. He was taken to the emergency room at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, where physicians discovered a small blood clot in his lung.
“The President is in good spirits and has been in frequent communication with staff via phone and email yesterday and today,” the Senate’s office wrote in a statement. “All previously scheduled Senate business will proceed as planned this week.”
Although Albritton is still in the ER under observation and awaiting further testing, his office expects him to return to his office later this week.
The 57-year-old Senate president was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2010 and then to the Senate in 2018. In Oct. 2023, during the first Senate presidential term of Republican Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, Albritton was unanimously selected president-designate.
He took over the role in November 2024, presiding over his first session as president in the coming months. Albritton’s top priority legislation was a “Rural Renaissance” package designed to revitalize housing, education, healthcare, business, and agriculture in Florida’s farmlands.
Although it failed, the bundle has been resurrected for the 2026 session.
“The President and Mrs. Albritton are grateful to the physicians and staff at Tallahassee Memorial for the excellent care the President is receiving,” the statement continues. “He looks forward to returning to the office later this week. The President and Mrs. Albritton would be very grateful for your prayers.”
The Florida Senate is expected to hold a floor session on Thursday at 9 a.m. This is the only legislative meeting that Albritton presides over.

Kevin Stitt, is calling on the federal government to reassess their immigration enforcement policies. 
Stitt, chair of the National Governors Association, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, vice chair of the organization, issued a joint statement Sunday calling for federal and state governments to work together and reset strategy following the death of a second Minnesotan by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

“As governors, we urge leaders at all levels to exercise wisdom and consider a reset of strategy toward a unified vision for immigration enforcement,” Stitt, a Republican, and Moore, a Democrat, said in a statement. “We believe there are criminals in our country who must be held accountable, but moments like this demand thoughtful leadership, coordination, and clarity. Scenes of violence and chaos on our streets are unacceptable and do not reflect who we are.”
Across the country, including in Oklahoma, the Trump administration has ramped up deportation efforts amid growing protests. The Trump administration has focused heavily on Minnesota, which officials have said has the “worst of the worst” criminals in the country illegally. The federal government has sent over 3,000 federal agents there, five times the number of Minneapolis police officers.
President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he is sending Tom Homan, the White House Border Czar, to Minneapolis. He also wrote that deportation efforts are going “peacefully and smoothly” in Republican-run cities and states, including Texas, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana. 
He said those states have had “zero protests, riots or chaos” because local police and ICE were “cooperating and working together.” Multiple media reports in those states show residents in those states are protesting immigration enforcement.
There have been three shootings by immigration officers in Minnesota in as many weeks, most recently on Saturday when 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti was killed.

The shootings have led to increased demonstrations and protests in Minnesota and in cities around the country. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said Pretti was armed and officers fired in an act of self-defense. Videos of the shooting, captured by bystanders, shows Pretti wrestled to the ground by multiple officers before more than 10 shots are fired. 
Minneapolis’ chief of police has said Pretti was a lawful gun owner.
Earlier in the month, authorities said ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good, 37, on Jan. 7 as Good was protesting. A week later, federal agents shot a Venezuelan man in the leg during what ICE called a “targeted traffic stop.”
Stitt and Moore, on behalf of the National Governors Association, asked for the federal government to work with state and local law enforcement with a “transparent strategy” and a unified approach. 
“Clarity of purpose is essential to maintaining public trust, ensuring accountability, and avoiding unintended escalation,” they said. “The use of federal authority should be guided by a transparent strategy that complements — rather than supplants — state and local efforts to uphold the law.
Stitt also said on CNN that the death of Americans causes “deep concern” and called the situation a tragedy. He said Americans “don’t like what they’re seeing right now.” 
“So what’s the goal right now,” he said. “Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want. We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.”

Murkowski said on Sunday, POLITICO reported, “ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.”
Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee have also called for testimony from leaders at ICE, along with Customs and Border Patrol and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services leadership. While Huizenga does not sit on that committee, he reposted the GOP caucus’s announcement of that request.

As a faculty member for 12 years and a North Carolina resident for more than 20, this delights me. I always recommend my home institution, NC State, but I’m enthusiastic about our entire system, rightly known as one of the best in the country. Our sixteen public universities offer comparatively lower tuition than neighboring states, and our extraordinary faculty include Nobel Prize winners, MacArthur Genius grantees, Pulitzer Prize winners, and more.
But a college education is still expensive — for most families, it’s like buying a new car every year for the next four years. Ideally, the expense will be worth it, launching students into financially, intellectually and culturally rewarding lives and careers.
But parents and students, would you knowingly buy a new car (or four new cars) with a failing engine?
As the president of the North Carolina Conference of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), I fear that unless we work to protect the academic freedom of our public universities, we may be asking you to do just that.
More than anything that draws students to our campuses — more than winning sports teams and fancy dining halls, state-of-the-art labs and well-stocked libraries — academic freedom is what makes our universities work. It is the engine of knowledge creation, creativity, and excellence.
Yet this engine is under more strain than ever before — almost all of it unnecessary. For UNC system professors, Trump’s second term began with savage and censorious DOGE cuts to the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Last spring and summer, right-wing activists ambushed our UNC campuses, targeting faculty and staff with secret recordings, and then pressured administration to fire staffers. Also last summer, our flagship institution delayed tenure votes for 33 faculty members, most of them in the humanities and social sciences, for no reason other than an objection to tenure itself. Then in December, UNC System President Peter Hans hastily announced a plan to make all our syllabi public records. Not only that, but UNC schools will also be forced to create a publicly searchable database of all of our syllabi, inviting right-wingers to target faculty for doxxing and harassment.
AAUP NC objects to and fights back against all of these attacks on academic freedom, and so should you.
We define academic freedom as “the freedom of a researcher in higher education to investigate and discuss the issues in his or her academic field, and teach or publish findings without interference from political figures, boards of trustees, donors or other entities.” Simply put, academic freedom is the freedom of teachers and researchers at colleges and universities to do the work of educating students and advancing knowledge in their fields.
It’s strongly connected to academic tenure, the indefinite appointment of faculty that happens after a set period of time, usually six years of excellent research and teaching. Tenure, which in the UNC system comes with a modest raise, allows faculty to expand their research, without fear of reprisal or job loss, in ways that are important to their department and university.
But academic freedom is also more than tenure — it’s also the freedom to discuss, without censorship, relevant issues in the classroom, to research and publish creative and scholarly work, and the freedom from institutional censorship when critiquing their institution or system (as in this op-ed) or other things happening in society. Like all freedoms, academic freedom calls for responsible and ethical use. Faculty must be respectful of the views of students as they guide their thinking, and model its responsible and ethical use.  
If you care about the reputation that backstops your child’s diploma, you should care about that institution’s commitment to academic freedom. North Carolina’s public universities have traditionally attracted some of the best professors and researchers in the world. Their work factors strongly into university rankings. These professors will not continue to come here — and, in fact, many will leave —  if they can’t access a fair and transparent tenure system, a university system invested in their protection, and university leaders unwilling to bend to politically-motivated demands.
And finally, do you want your child to finish their degree and leave the state, or to choose among opportunities offered by a thriving North Carolina economy? That’s also connected to academic freedom. UNC System schools contribute billions of dollars to our state’s economy, create thousands of jobs and hundreds of patents, attract start-ups and established companies to our state, and serve all of our one hundred counties through extension work in agriculture and healthcare, and through research and cultural programming.
As parents and prospective UNC system families, your voices matter. You can write directly to your chosen university’s admissions office. You can share your support for academic freedom — and your concerns about cuts, firings and tenure delays — through social media and parent networks. You can encourage your students to speak up, too — their voices are even more powerful, because their education is our core work and mission.
I hope your students get into their dream schools, and I also hope they know what makes those schools dreamed-of destinations in the first place. Let’s work together to protect academic freedom and keep our state universities healthy and thriving environments for all our students.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Paying ballot-question petition circulators would be prohibited in South Dakota by a bill the House State Affairs Committee approved Monday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Rep. Travis Ismay, R-Newell, introduced House Bill 1087 in response to several questions that appeared on the 2024 general election ballot with help from paid petition circulators.
“This bill that I am bringing honors the will of the people and not out-of-state interests,” Ismay said.
Petitioners in South Dakota need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law, which is known as an initiative, and the same number of signatures to put a bill passed by legislators on hold for consideration by voters, which is known as a referendum. The number of signatures required to propose a state constitutional amendment is 35,017.
Amid complaints about big-money ballot measures, new reports show $12 million spent in 2024

Under Ismay’s bill, if a court determines a campaign compensated a petition circulator — with money or gifts — the petition would be declared invalid. 
The bill passed with a 9-4 vote, which means it will go to the full House of Representatives.
Opponents said the bill would trigger a legal challenge if enacted and cost thousands of taxpayer dollars to defend. Opponents included the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, South Dakota Advocacy Network for Women, and the South Dakota Education Association.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, echoed their concerns.
“We’re not going to give our teachers a pay raise, we’re out of money, and we’re going to pass a bill that we know is going to cost the taxpayers millions of dollars,” Reisch said. “I’m going to be a ‘no’ on this.”
Rep. Spencer Gosch, R-Glenham, said the cost of potential legal battles would be worth the attempt to level the playing field, rather than allowing the ballot measure process to be a “money game.”
“I am limiting one person’s ability to have more speech over mine just because they have more money,” Gosch said. “That one individual could hire multiple entities because they can afford to do so. I could not. Therefore, my vote is less important than their vote.”
The committee also approved Senate Bill 5, which would require the state attorney general’s official ballot-question explanations to include whether a ballot question was placed on the ballot by legislators or by citizen petitioners.

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Attorney Chris Madel released a blistering statement Monday about the federal government’s current surge of immigration officers as he announced he is dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination for Minnesota governor. 
Madel said in a video posted to X that he’s dropping out, in part, because he can’t stand by the Republican Party’s support of the federal immigration crackdown in Minnesota, where many U.S. citizens  walk the streets in fear and carry documentation to prove their citizenship. 
“I cannot support the national Republican’s stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so,” Madel said, whose defense of a state trooper charged with murder raised his profile in recent years. “Operation Metro Surge has expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threats.” 
His statement underscores the increasing unease Minnesota Republicans — which now includes several swing-district lawmakers — are expressing about the surge of federal officers.
In recent weeks, Madel has performed well in local GOP party straw polls, especially for a candidate with little name recognition and no political experience. Madel pitched himself as a political outsider who could win voters over using the communication skills he’s developed from his decades as a defense attorney.
Madel’s announcement comes after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday — the third shooting by immigration officers in three weeks and the second to end in death. The Trump administration has called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” who wanted to physically harm law enforcement. Videos taken at the scene belie the Trump administration’s claims. 
In the video announcing the suspension of his campaign, Madel criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s use of administrative warrants, which do not require a judge’s sign-off, to unlawfully enter people’s homes and “weaponizing criminal investigations against political opponents.”
“I personally have spoken to several law enforcement officers, some Hispanic and some Asian, who have been pulled over by ICE on pretextual stops. Driving while Hispanic is not a crime, neither is driving while Asian,” Madel said. “At the end of the day, I have to look my daughters in the eye and tell them, ‘I believe I did what was right,’ and I am doing that today.” 
Madel represented State Patrol Officer Ryan Londregan, who was charged with murder and manslaughter after he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II in 2023. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty wound up dropping the charges against Londregan.
Earlier this month, Madel provided legal counsel to Jonathan Ross, the federal agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good.
In addition to his criticism of Operation Metro Surge, Madel said he was dropping out because “national Republicans have made it nearly impossible for a Republican to win.” 
Madel said he doesn’t believe President Donald Trump has been given enough credit, including negotiating a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza. He also criticized Minnesota Republicans for failing to properly investigate fraud in the state’s public programs.
Madel said he will return all the donations made to his campaign for governor.
“God bless you, and God bless Minnesota,” Madel concluded. “We certainly need it.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/P1163918-scaled-e1764617500172-1024x635.jpg,,,2026-01-26 11:58:05.727687

Gov. Tate Reeves on Tuesday will deliver his State-of-the-State Address.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The focus of the 2026 Mississippi legislative session so far has been the gulf between Republican House and Senate leaders over school choice, or, more pointedly, the House proposal to spend millions of tax dollars on private schooling.
Senate leaders vow opposition to the omnibus House Bill 2 because of this facet. But House Bill 2 is a kitchen-sink measure, with many other education proposals thrown in. And, it would appear, the Senate leadership is open to many of these. Its education panel passed a slew of them in separate bills on to the full Senate last week. These include measures to expand the state’s successful literacy and math programs into higher grades, promote prayer in school and allow homeschooled children to play in public school sports. And as for school choice, both chambers appear onboard with allowing public school students to switch schools or districts more easily.
But will the standoff over private-school vouchers prevent agreement on other measures? A full-court political press is on. Local governments and school officials continue to lobby against HB2, while some apparently well-funded and organized proponents are sending out robo-texts to constituents in home districts of Republican lawmakers who oppose the measure. Even the White House has been applying pressure on Mississippi Republicans for passage of the voucher measure.
Otherwise, lawmakers face a busy couple of weeks, with key deadlines approaching. Importantly, a first major “killing deadline,” one that will likely weed out hundreds of bills, is Feb. 3, the deadline for committees to pass or kill bills from their own chamber. 
Other major debates to watch this session are:

Ballot initiative. This has become a perennial issue since the state Supreme Court nullified this right for Mississippi voters in 2021. Lawmakers can’t seem to get together on the particulars, although many proclaim they want to restore voters’ ability to sidestep the Legislature and put measures to a statewide vote. The 2027 state elections loom, and lawmakers face pressure to resolve this before reelection time.


Online sports betting. This is a major House initiative, and its leaders have tried to sweeten the pot for a reluctant Senate, proposing to earmark tax revenue from mobile gambling to shore up the state’s government employee retirement system.


Campaign-finance reform. Another perennial issue facing more urgency with the 2027 elections looming, the state’s lax, confusing, conflicting and often unenforced campaign-finance laws leave our elections open to an unchecked flow of dark money and special interest influence. But it appears two main players in potential reform, the secretary of state and attorney general, are getting on the same page.

In Brief
Prison health reform proposed
A slate of bills from House Corrections Chair Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, would revamp the delivery of health care in state prisons.
The proposals come after Mississippi Today’s “Behind Bars, Beyond Care” series, which has documented the alleged routine denial of health care in state prisons and deadly outcomes.
Currie’s bills would establish a corrections ombudsman to investigate health care complaints, establish hepatitis C and HIV treatment programs, provide kiosks for prisoners to request medical attention and require correctional officers to wear body cameras. But most of the bills have been double-referred, meaning they would have to pass through two committees. That’s sometimes a sign that a bill doesn’t have the support of a chamber’s leadership. – Michael Goldberg
Bill would provide benefits for gig workers
A growing number of Americans are working as independent contractors and “gig” workers. 
They often do not receive employer-provided benefits such as health care and retirement.
House Bill 1072, the “Voluntary Portable Benefit Plan,” aims to help these workers access benefits. Authored by Rep. Lee Yancey, a Republican from Brandon, the bill would create a separate type of benefit that follows workers across jobs. A hiring firm could make tax-deductible contributions to the account and it would not be counted as taxable income for the worker. Similar portable-benefit accounts have been created in other states, such as Alabama and Tennessee. – Katherine Lin
Gov. Reeves to deliver State of the State address
Gov. Tate Reeves will deliver his State of the State Address to a joint session of the Mississippi Legislature on Tuesday.
The address, which will be aired live by Mississippi Public Broadcasting, will be delivered at 5 p.m. in the second-floor rotunda at the state Capitol. Read a transcript of Reeves’ 2025 address here. – Mississippi Today
DeSoto board wants power to remove member
HERNANDO — Some DeSoto County School Board members want a legal process by which an elected school board member could be ousted for concerns including malfeasance and abuse of power. They passed a resolution in November formally asking lawmakers to consider granting that authority in the current legislative session.
Sen. Kevin Blackwell, a Republican from Southaven, has filed Senate Bill 2068, which would allow a school district’s local governing authority, by majority vote, to remove a school board member for breach of public trust, neglect of duty and abuse of authority. The school board would first have to vote on a recommendation.
Rep. Kimberly Remak, a Republican from Olive Branch, is the primary author of House Bill 573, the House mirror of Blackwell’s bill.  – Leonardo Bevilacqua
Earlier teacher procurement cards proposed
The Senate Education Committee on Thursday passed a bill that would distribute procurement cards, which teachers use to pay for classroom supplies, in July instead of August.
A report from the state Auditor’s office last summer showed that the card is activated too late to be useful, and that many teachers are forced to spend their own money on supplies.
The cards provide every teacher $748.
Sen. Scott DeLano, a Republican from Biloxi, said the new date would be tight, given that the state’s fiscal year starts in July. But he said the change is necessary because school districts are starting earlier and earlier. – Devna Bose
Bill would prohibit secret government settlements
Sen. Angela Hill, a Republican from Picayune, filed a bill that would prohibit government bodies from entering into private settlements and ban judges from sealing settlements, especially if they involve tax money. 
Hill told Mississippi Today that the legislation is about promoting transparency and allowing the public to know if taxpayer dollars are paying settlements. She said government bodies can redact the identities of people involved, if necessary. 
“We’re not talking about making private identities public — this is talking about tax dollars,” Hill said.  – Taylor Vance
Truancy officers would see pay raise
A bill pending before the Senate would give truancy officers a significant pay increase.
School attendance officers, under current law, are paid at least $24,000 a year. The new bill would raise the minimum by $10,000.
The bill also expands the responsibilities of attendance officers to dropout prevention and establishes a more robust framework to combat absenteeism, an issue that Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann has said is one of his top priorities.
Chronic absenteeism, or missing at least 10% of a school year, has more than doubled in Mississippi since 2018. – Devna Bose
Boyd wants local governments to livestream
The Senate Government Structure Committee last week advanced a bill that would require all government bodies in the state to livestream meetings and post agendas on their website. 
Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford, filed the legislation and told Mississippi Today that requiring public bodies to do this would not cost them a significant amount of money and should not be a significant burden on them because several agencies and local governments already do this. 
“It’s important for everyday citizens to find out what’s going on in our local boards and commissions,” Boyd said. – Taylor Vance
By the Numbers
$100 million
Amount the University of Mississippi Medical Center is asking the Legislature to provide for what hospital officials hope will become a “gold standard” cancer center. UMMC has already raised $90 million of the estimated $250 million total cost.

Mikie Sherrill said the Trump administration is ""wholesale lying"" to Americans about the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis nurse.","Gov. Mikie Sherrill said the Trump administration is ""wholesale lying"" to Americans about the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis nurse. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Mikie Sherrill on Monday called for Congress to “immediately” impeach U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the wake of the fatal shooting of a Minnesota man by a border patrol agent.
The comments from New Jersey’s Democratic governor, who took office last week, come one day after Nevada Sen. U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D) called for Noem’s impeachment.
“I think that has to happen immediately,” Sherrill said in an interview with WNYC. “There needs to be a stand-down from duty, because all of these agents are acting completely outside the scope of their duties. It’s dangerous, and it should not be acceptable to anyone — Democrat, Republican alike, should all be calling for this to end immediately.”
Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse from Minneapolis, was shot dead Saturday during an altercation with federal immigration agents, marking the second fatal shooting by agents this month in Minneapolis. The Minnesota city has been flooded with immigration agents as part of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort.
After Murphy, some lawmakers want limits on clemency powers

Noem alleged that Pretti approached agents with a gun to “inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” and an agent shot and killed Pretti in an act of self-defense. Videos of the episode appear to show an agent disarming Pretti before another agent shoots him multiple times. Minneapolis officials have said Pretti was legally allowed to be carrying a firearm.
Sherrill in her WNYC interview accused the Trump administration of “wholesale lying to American people, making up stories about the people that this police force is killing on the streets.”
“Make no mistake, if you look at that video, it is hard to escape the understanding that that was a crime committed by that police force,” she said. “There’s no accountability. They are completely backed up by the president’s administration in their wrongdoing in their actions against the American people.”
Immigrant advocates in New Jersey have been pushing the Legislature to pass a package of bills aimed at limiting when local law enforcement and other public officials can cooperate with federal immigration agents. Sherrill’s predecessor, Phil Murphy, signed one of the bills last week but vetoed two others before leaving office, saying he worried they would conflict with federal law or leave the state open to legal challenges.
The advocates are now hoping the Legislature will advance the two vetoed bills and send them to Sherrill for her signature. It’s unclear whether she supports them.
One of the bills would codify the Immigrant Trust Directive, a state attorney general order from 2018 that restricts state and local cooperation with immigration agents.

The day after federal immigration agents fatally shot Minneapolis protestor Alex Pretti, Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott condemned the violence of federal immigration agents. 
“Enough…it’s not acceptable for American citizens to be killed by federal agents for exercising their God-given and constitutional rights to protest their government,” he said in a statement Sunday. 
On Saturday, federal agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse who was protesting President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good in the city.
In the wake of Pretti’s killing, video analyses by national media have contradicted the claims of federal officials, who asserted that officers shot Pretti in self-defense after he approached officers with a firearm. Video footage shows that Pretti approached the officers holding his phone — not a gun. 
In videos of the scene, half a dozen officers wrestled Pretti to the ground in tactical gear. Though Pretti did have a semiautomatic pistol on him, officials said he was licensed to carry it. And videos show that officers knocked away his gun before fatally shooting him. Pretti was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, according to the Minneapolis police chief. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security called its crackdown in the city the largest immigration operation in the department’s history earlier this month, marking a significant escalation since first targeting Somali immigrants in December. 
In his statement, Scott called on Trump to change course in Minnesota. 
“The President should pause these operations, de-escalate the situation, and reset the federal government’s focus on truly criminal illegal immigrants. In the absence of Presidential action, Congress and the Courts must step up to restore constitutionality,” he said. 
The two most recent killings of U.S. citizens in Minnesota are far from the first violent incidents involving federal immigration agents. Immigration agents also shot and wounded two people in Oregon, fatally shot one person in Chicago and shot at least eight civilians in vehicles since July. 
“At best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices, training, and leadership,” Scott said. “At worst, it’s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans. Again, enough is enough.”

All across the country, ICE and Border Patrol agents have conducted police-state-style raids and other actions that have terrorized communities and raised constitutional issues of profound importance.
At the same time, numerous changes to immigration policy – many of them adopted without public knowledge or input – have made an already complex system more opaque and confusing than ever.
At such a challenging moment, the nation is blessed to have a small and courageous cadre of nonprofit advocates who work each day to monitor and shine a light on the system and advocate for basic American values like due process. And recently Newsline got a chance to talk with one of the most able and best-informed attorneys working in this arena, American Immigration Council Deputy Legal Director, Raul Pinto.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation with American Immigration Council Deputy Legal Director, Raul Pinto, we delved into some of the most worrisome front burner issues related to immigrants and immigration policy currently afflicting the nation – including the deeply disturbing mass raids, arrests and violence launched by the Trump administration in numerous communities across the country.
In Part Two of our chat, we dug deeper into some of these and related issues, including the matter of transparency and accountability in the immigration law system and an ongoing effort by Pinto and his colleagues to compel the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to simply provide immigrants with their own immigration records.

(Kentucky Transportation Cabinet photo)Kentucky officials are investigating three deaths that may be related to the weekend’s severe snow and ice. 
In a Monday morning press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear said at least one fatality may be a result of running a generator indoors. 
“Check on your neighbors, just make sure they’re OK,” the governor said. “What a good time to live out the parable of The Good Samaritan. All it takes is a phone call or knocking on their door, just see if they’re all right.” 
Beshear also emphasized that Kentuckians should use caution when shoveling snow, as the activity can increase risk of heart attacks. Last year, six Kentuckians died while shoveling snow.
Over the weekend, Kentucky was blanketed with snow and ice, making roads hazardous and causing power outages. Beshear said the state was down to 47,123 power outages from 73,590 at the height of the storm Sunday. 
For the week ahead, Kentucky is forecasted to have extremely cold temperatures. Beshear said that wind chills as low as negative 20 degrees statewide are expected. 
“Tomorrow morning is going to be the worst. It is going to be dangerously cold,” the governor said. “Tomorrow morning being outside for just 10 to 30 minutes could result in hypothermia or frostbite, so we need everyone to take precautions.” 
The Kentucky General Assembly had canceled its meetings Monday because of the weather. All eight of Kentucky’s public universities canceled classes or moved to online instruction options. 
Beshear said in his briefing that while all Kentucky counties had “major impacts,” Barren, Pulaski, Allen and Monroe counties were among the hardest hit by the storm. 
A few hundred Kentuckians are being sheltered, the governor added, and that number is being updated as more people are transported to assistance. About 150 people were evacuated from London hotels without power. Some guests were also evacuated from Barren River State Park. 
Secondary roads across the state were “still impassable,” as of Monday morning, Beshear said. While interstates had “significant process,” he continued, drivers should slow down while traveling.. 
Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray said a tractor-trailer had jackknifed on I-75 southbound near Clays Ferry Bridge, which is between Madison and Fayette counties. Information on injuries was not immediately available. 
“Our focus today is on priority routes, crossovers, ramps, turn lanes and secondaries,” Gray said of the road crews’ plans for Monday. “We’re taking advantage of what sunlight we have before the onset of this bitter and brutal cold tonight.” 
On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for several states, including Kentucky, due to the weather. Beshear declared a state of emergency for Kentucky Friday. 
In light of the weather, Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office is taking reports of suspected price gouging at its hotline, 1-888-432-9257, or online. 
Kentuckians should call 911 in emergencies or life-threatening situations. If someone has immediate needs that aren’t life-threatening, like little to no heat or phone issues, they can complete the online Rapid Needs Assessment Form or call 502-607-6665.

The Trump administration is planning to use artificial intelligence to write federal transportation regulations, according to U.S. Department of Transportation records and interviews with six agency staffers.
The plan was presented to DOT staff last month at a demonstration of AI’s “potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings,” agency attorney Daniel Cohen wrote to colleagues. The demonstration, Cohen wrote, would showcase “exciting new AI tools available to DOT rule writers to help us do our job better and faster.”
Discussion of the plan continued among agency leadership last week, according to meeting notes reviewed by ProPublica. Gregory Zerzan, the agency’s general counsel, said at that meeting that President Donald Trump is “very excited about this initiative.” Zerzan seemed to suggest that the DOT was at the vanguard of a broader federal effort, calling the department the “point of the spear” and “the first agency that is fully enabled to use AI to draft rules.”
Zerzan appeared interested mainly in the quantity of regulations that AI could produce, not their quality. “We don’t need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don’t even need a very good rule on XYZ,” he said, according to the meeting notes. “We want good enough.” Zerzan added, “We’re flooding the zone.” 
These developments have alarmed some at DOT. The agency’s rules touch virtually every facet of transportation safety, including regulations that keep airplanes in the sky, prevent gas pipelines from exploding and stop freight trains carrying toxic chemicals from skidding off the rails. Why, some staffers wondered, would the federal government outsource the writing of such critical standards to a nascent technology notorious for making mistakes?
The answer from the plan’s boosters is simple: speed. Writing and revising complex federal regulations can take months, sometimes years. But, with DOT’s version of Google Gemini, employees could generate a proposed rule in a matter of minutes or even seconds, two DOT staffers who attended the December demonstration remembered the presenter saying. In any case, most of what goes into the preambles of DOT regulatory documents is just “word salad,” one staffer recalled the presenter saying. Google Gemini can do word salad.
Zerzan reiterated the ambition to accelerate rulemaking with AI at the meeting last week. The goal is to dramatically compress the timeline in which transportation regulations are produced, such that they could go from idea to complete draft ready for review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in just 30 days, he said. That should be possible, he said, because “it shouldn’t take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini.”
The DOT plan, which has not previously been reported, represents a new front in the Trump administration’s campaign to incorporate artificial intelligence into the work of the federal government. This administration is not the first to use AI; federal agencies have been gradually stitching the technology into their work for years, including to translate documents, analyze data and categorize public comments, among other uses. But the current administration has been particularly enthusiastic about the technology. Trump released multiple executive orders in support of AI last year. In April, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought circulated a memo calling for the acceleration of its use by the federal government. Three months later, the administration released an “AI Action Plan” that contained a similar directive. None of those documents, however, called explicitly for using AI to write regulations, as DOT is now planning to do.
Those plans are already in motion. The department has used AI to draft a still-unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule, according to a DOT staffer briefed on the matter.
Skeptics say that so-called large language models such as Gemini and ChatGPT shouldn’t be trusted with the complicated and consequential responsibilities of governance, given that those models are prone to error and incapable of human reasoning. But proponents see AI as a way to automate mindless tasks and wring efficiencies out of a slow-moving federal bureaucracy.
Such optimism was on display in a windowless conference room in Northern Virginia earlier this month, where federal technology officials, convened at an AI summit, discussed adopting an “AI culture” in government and “upskilling” the federal workforce to use the technology. Those federal representatives included Justin Ubert, division chief for cybersecurity and operations at DOT’s Federal Transit Administration, who spoke on a panel about the Transportation Department’s plans for “fast adoption” of artificial intelligence. Many people see humans as a “choke point” that slows down AI, he noted. But eventually, Ubert predicted, humans will fall back into merely an oversight role, monitoring “AI-to-AI interactions.” Ubert declined to speak to ProPublica on the record.
A similarly sanguine attitude about the potential of AI permeated the presentation at DOT in December, which was attended by more than 100 DOT employees, including division heads, high-ranking attorneys and civil servants from rulemaking offices. Brimming with enthusiasm, the presenter told them that Gemini can handle 80% to 90% of the work of writing regulations, while DOT staffers could do the rest, one attendee recalled the presenter saying.
To illustrate this, the presenter asked for a suggestion from the audience of a topic on which DOT may have to write a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, a public filing that lays out an agency’s plans to introduce a new regulation or change an existing one. He then plugged the topic keywords into Gemini, which produced a document resembling a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. It appeared, however, to be missing the actual text that goes into the Code of Federal Regulations, one staffer recalled.
The presenter expressed little concern that the regulatory documents produced by AI could contain so-called hallucinations — erroneous text that is frequently generated by large language models such as Gemini — according to three people present. In any case, that’s where DOT’s staff would come in, he said. “It seemed like his vision of the future of rulemaking at DOT is that our jobs would be to proofread this machine product,” one employee said. “He was very excited.” (Attendees could not clearly recall the name of the lead presenter, but three said they believed it was Brian Brotsos, the agency’s acting chief AI officer. Brotsos declined to comment, referring questions to the DOT press office.)
A spokesperson for the DOT did not respond to a request for comment; Cohen and Zerzan also did not respond to messages seeking comment. A Google spokesperson did not provide a comment.
The December presentation left some DOT staffers deeply skeptical. Rulemaking is intricate work, they said, requiring expertise in the subject at hand as well as in existing statutes, regulations and case law. Mistakes or oversights in DOT regulations could lead to lawsuits or even injuries and deaths in the transportation system. Some rule writers have decades of experience. But all that seemed to go ignored by the presenter, attendees said. “It seems wildly irresponsible,” said one, who, like the others, requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. 
Mike Horton, DOT’s former acting chief artificial intelligence officer, criticized the plan to use Gemini to write regulations, comparing it to “having a high school intern that’s doing your rulemaking.” (He said the plan was not in the works when he left the agency in August.) Noting the life-or-death stakes of transportation safety regulations, Horton said the agency’s leaders “want to go fast and break things, but going fast and breaking things means people are going to get hurt.”
Academics and researchers who track the use of AI in government expressed mixed opinions about the DOT plan. If agency rule writers use the technology as a sort of research assistant with plenty of supervision and transparency, it could be useful and save time. But if they cede too much responsibility to AI, that could lead to deficiencies in critical regulations and run afoul of a requirement that federal rules be built on reasoned decision-making.
“Just because these tools can produce a lot of words doesn’t mean that those words add up to a high-quality government decision,” said Bridget Dooling, a professor at Ohio State University who studies administrative law. “It’s so tempting to try to figure out how to use these tools, and I think it would make sense to try. But I think it should be done with a lot of skepticism.”
Ben Winters, the AI and privacy director at the Consumer Federation of America, said the plan was especially problematic given the exodus of subject-matter experts from government as a result of the administration’s cuts to the federal workforce last year. DOT has had a net loss of nearly 4,000 of its 57,000 employees since Trump returned to the White House, including more than 100 attorneys, federal data shows.
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency was a major proponent of AI adoption in government. In July, The Washington Post reported on a leaked DOGE presentation that called for using AI to eliminate half of all federal regulations, and to do so in part by having AI draft regulatory documents. “Writing is automated,” the presentation read. DOGE’s AI program “automatically drafts all submission documents for attorneys to edit.” DOGE and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
The White House did not answer a question about whether the administration is planning to use AI in rulemaking at other agencies as well. Four top technology officials in the administration said they were not aware of any such plan. As for DOT’s “point of the spear” claim, two of those officials expressed skepticism. “There’s a lot of posturing of, ‘We want to seem like a leader in federal AI adoption,’” one said. “I think it’s very much a marketing thing.”

Maura Healey's 2026 State of the Commonwealth speech. They compare her tone and policy position to earlier years, review reactions to the speech, and look ahead at what this says about Healey's run for reelection.","EPISODE INFO
HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Chris Lisinski






MAURA HEALEY’S FINAL State of the Commonwealth speech in her first term as governor, delivered last Thursday, had to do several things: burnish her record as she runs for re-election, reassure the state that she has made progress on systems in crisis like housing and transportation, roll out a few policy proposals, and set the stage for a year of unpredictable federal actions after President Trump spent his first year back in office taking direct shots at Massachusetts priority areas like green energy and higher education. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon senior reporters Chris Lisinski and Jennifer Smith dig into Healey’s speech, comparing the governor’s tone and policy position to earlier years, reviewing reactions to it, and looking ahead at what it says about Healey’s second run for the corner office. 
Affordability was the theme of the evening, but Healey also devoted a good chunk of the speech to taking aim at Trump and the impact his policies are having on the state.  
“The first and most striking thing for myself, and frankly, I think most of the other attendees and those in the press corps, was not so much about policy or promises, but about tone,” Lisinski said. After a year of Trump’s “never-ending stream of impacts causing headaches for Massachusetts,” Healey’s speech was a departure from her 2025 State of the Commonwealth, delivered days before Trump’s return to office, in which the governor did not say his name once.  
This year, Lisinski noted, “She really sought to contrast herself from the federal government, and to pitch Massachusetts as, I guess, a bulwark or a shield against overreach by the Trump administration.” 
While groups including Planned Parenthood lauded the governor for her commitment to reproductive choice, progressives bristled at the lack of specific policy promises to address what Healey described as needlessly aggressive US Immigration and Customs Enforcement action chilling entire communities.   
Jonathan Cohn, policy director of Progressive Massachusetts, said after the speech that “the governor offered nothing. Let’s be clear: reining in ICE violence is a kitchen table [matter], as there is no such thing as affordability when families are being broken apart and workers are being kidnapped on the way to work.” 
On affordability, Republican gubernatorial hopefuls savaged Healey’s plan to reduce utility bills during the costly heating season, which depends in large part on utility companies simply delaying payments until spring and summer. 
“Gov. Healey’s ‘plan’ for energy relief is basically a payday loan scam,” Mike Kennealy said in his response. He called the speech a “masterclass in political spin” and slammed Healey’s commitment to a “climate agenda” that he blamed for the state’s high utility rates.  
On energy, Healey touted the now-operational high-voltage transmission line bringing hydroelectricity from Quebec into the Bay State. But Smith noted the absence of comment on wind power, after the governor in 2024 touted the state as “leading the clean energy revolution” with the Vineyard Wind project and looked ahead at reviewing offshore wind proposals that “could equal up to 25 percent of our energy needs.”  
Trump has identified offshore wind as a target, halting construction on major projects by citing national security concerns and throwing offshore wind plans across New England coasts into limbo. 
“Those sorts of pivots aren’t always apparent in the speech itself in front of you,” Smith said of the governor’s wind omission this year and last, “but when you can track it year over year, you can tell that since 2024, Healey has sort of seen that it’s going to become a lot harder to promise wind projects going forward.” 
Healey gestured at the difficult path ahead, even while declaring the state of the Commonwealth to be strong, saying there’s “no doubt it may get worse before it gets better.” Her plans to “do what we have to do to make it better” should come into sharper relief this week as the governor rolls out her annual budget proposal.

(Photo: Nevada Gold Mines presentation to investors)The price of an ounce of gold traded for more than $5,000 an ounce for the first time in history Monday.
The milestone was the latest in a series for precious metal markets that have been on a tear. Less than a year ago, in March, gold’s price surpassed $3,000 an ounce. Then it broke the $4,000 threshold in October.
The price of silver, which increased by an even larger percentage than gold in 2025, has also continued to soar in 2026, and topped $100 an ounce Friday.
Since the start of the year the price of gold has increased by 17%, and silver’s climb continues to outpace it, rising 55% since January 1.
Nevada is the nation’s largest gold producer, and the second largest producer of silver, after Alaska.
The rush to precious metals over the last year has been attributed to a so-called “sell America” trade wherein investors are seeking shelter amid geopolitical volatility, fear of inflation, and the declining value of the world’s dominant currency, the U.S. dollar, which dipped to a four-month low early Monday.
Financial market nervousness has only been heightened so far in 2026 by a steady stream of tumult, including Donald Trump rupturing relations with Europe with his intentions to gobble Greenland, his continuing on-again off-again tariff threats, and his Department of Justice launching an investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as part of Trump’s effort to effectively seize personal control of the the world’s most powerful central bank and with it, the power to set U.S. interest rates.
The share prices of Nevada’s largest mining corporations were also boosted in early trading Monday. That too is a continuation of last year, when global economic anxiety helped Newmont Corp.’s share price to soar by more than 180%, and Barrick Mining Corp’s to shoot up more than 200%. Newmont stock is already up 26% since the start of the new year, while Barrick’s was up slightly more than 20% year to date as of Monday morning.
Barrick is the operator of Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture with Newmont. Last year, the venture accounted for more than two-thirds of the gold mined in Nevada.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-3-10-25-at-5.49-PM-1024x612.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 10:58:51.209138

Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh after a hearing on Wednesday promised he would rule by Feb. 10 on whether to issue a preliminary injunction to block elections on property tax caps that must be held in April in 97 counties.
A second hearing in the case, originally filed by two taxpayers, six school districts and a fire district, will be held next week as attorneys for the plaintiffs seek a summary judgment in their favor.
And in a Jan. 16 decision certain to be appealed, Limbaugh denied standing — the right to sue — and dismissed a case brought by two lawmakers and a conservative activist arguing the wide-ranging legislation violated procedural rules for passing bills.
The bill approved by lawmakers in a June special session offered up to $1.5 billion in incentives to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals in Missouri. It also expanded a program of tax credits as an incentive for major amateur sports competitions, offered tax credits for disaster relief and set the property tax caps in 97 of the state’s 114 counties.
In 75 counties, voter approval would limit future increases in tax property tax bills to 5% or the rate of inflation, whichever is greater. For 22 counties, voter approval would mean individual property tax bills could not increase.
The tax base would be reset when a property changes hands. The caps allow tax bills to increase when a new or increased tax is approved by voters.
Feb. 10 is a key date because that is when April ballots must be certified by local election authorities. Twenty-seven counties joined the lawsuit after it was filed, arguing that the cost of the election is an unfunded mandate that violates the Missouri Constitution.
Attorney Jim Layton, who represents several of the original plaintiffs, said Limbaugh must decide whether the property tax caps are improperly passed special laws or violate constitutional provisions requiring uniformity in taxation and equal rights.
Lawmakers opted their counties into the legislation during a late-night floor session, deciding what level of relief they wanted for their area. Many of the state’s largest counties were excluded, leaving Boone, Greene, Jackson, St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis out of the law.
“There’s no rational basis for the lines that it drew, or for designating some counties, particular counties, as 0% or 5% or unaffected counties,” Layton said in an interview with The Independent.
The state is defending the law by saying it will provide cover to local assessors who have been reluctant to bring property values up to the current market because of its impact on tax bills, Layton said.
Neither the original plaintiffs nor the intervening counties challenging the tax caps are asking Limbaugh to throw out the entire law. That was the goal of the lawsuit that was dismissed Jan. 16, filed by state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, and state Rep. Bryant Wolfin, a Republican from Ste. Genevieve, and Ron Calzone, a conservative activist who has challenged several laws for violating procedural rules in the Missouri Constitution. 
Moon and Wolfin “claim that they have legislative standing to challenge (the law, but) this court is unaware of any Missouri statute or case law conferring such standing upon petitioners Moon and Wolfin,” Limbaugh wrote.
Calzone, who claimed standing as a taxpayer who would be damaged by having public funds spent, failed in that argument, Limbaugh wrote. Tax credits to promote major amateur sporting events are not a “direct expenditure to be made by the state,” and payments for bonds on stadiums are subject to appropriation, which means they are not automatic.
“There is no ‘direct expenditure of funds generated through taxation’ that could confer taxpayer standing,” Limbaugh wrote.
Calzone, in an interview, said Limbaugh made a mistake because the tax credits for amateur sporting events are refundable — meaning the state will write a check if the credits exceed what the taxpayer owes the state.
The ruling also cited an incorrect version of the law on amateur sporting event tax credits, he said. The section cited is the one that existed, with lower credit amounts, before the special session law was enacted.
The options for the plaintiffs are to ask Limbaugh to reconsider based on what they believe are errors in the decision or take the case to higher courts on appeal, Calzone said.
“That is something we are still trying to determine,” he said. “But absolutely, one way or another, we will end up in the Missouri Supreme Court.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_colecountycourt2-scaled-e1757967844893-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-26 10:58:51.209138

Federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross, killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a mother and poet, Jan. 7. Multiple videos captured the killings of both Good and Pretti, further sparking outcry from the community.Several congressional Democrats over the weekend coalesced to oppose any funding for the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement, increasing the chances of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week. For nearly two months, 3,000 federal immigration officers have descended on Minneapolis, dwarfing the city’s police force of roughly 600. The Trump administration deployed the officers for immigration enforcement after right-wing media influencers resurfaced instances of fraud in Minnesota’s social service programs. Trump, in his Monday social media post, blamed the massive protests in Minnesota on “Welfare Fraud that has taken place in Minnesota, and is at least partially responsible for the violent organized protests going on in the streets.” Homan, who is expected to be in Minnesota by the evening, is the former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement head of removal operations during the Obama administration and served as acting ICE director during the first Trump administration.",,,,2026-01-26 09:57:06.399873

(Mark Olalde/ProPublica)The state of New Mexico is accusing three Texas oil executives of orchestrating “a fraudulent scheme” to pocket revenue from hundreds of oil and gas wells in New Mexico and offload the cost of plugging and cleaning up the wells onto the state’s taxpayers. The suit, filed in late December by the New Mexico attorney general’s office, is the latest salvo in the state’s fight against oil and gas executives accused of foisting old wells onto the public.
The 72-page complaint alleges a yearslong pattern of fraud and self-dealing in which the oil executives — Everett Willard Gray II, Robert Stitzel and Marquis Reed Gilmore Jr., all of Midland, Texas — repeatedly transferred wells among “a series of shell corporations, LLCs, and partnerships they created.” On multiple occasions, the men placed companies into bankruptcy protection, only to move their profitable wells to other companies they owned or managed outside the bankruptcy proceedings, the suit said.
New Mexico faces millions of dollars in costs to plug wells the companies shed through the bankruptcies. Unplugged oil and gas wells can emit climate-warming methane and carcinogenic gases and often leak briny, radioactive wastewater, as ProPublica and Capital & Main detailed in a 2024 investigation. The newsrooms uncovered Gray, Stitzel and Gilmore’s early business dealings and use of bankruptcy proceedings.

This story was originally published by ProPublica and co-published with Capital & Main.

“I will not stand by while bad actors take advantage of the system — avoiding responsibility, burdening the state with costly remediation, and recklessly endangering the health of New Mexicans,” Raúl Torrez, the state’s attorney general, said in a statement.
As part of ProPublica and Capital & Main’s 2024 investigation, the news organizations toured dozens of wells belonging to Remnant, the group of companies through which the men launched their enterprise. Some wells leaked such high volumes of methane that, if ignited, the air could explode; others emitted hydrogen sulfide at potentially lethal concentrations; and several were surrounded by oil and wastewater spills. At the time, the owner of an oil field services company that had worked on Remnant’s wells said that the men filed for bankruptcy protection without paying his company what it was owed.
The recent lawsuit is “meritless” and built on “baseless claims,” Gray said in a statement responding to questions from ProPublica and Capital & Main. “I have always acted ethically and never been involved in any activities to defraud the state of New Mexico. I strongly deny any wrongdoing in this matter,” he said.
New Era Energy & Digital, one of Gray’s companies named in the state’s complaint, ended up with 87 of the group’s best gas wells, and the company said in a press release that those “no longer align with the Company’s business model.” New Era is focused instead on building an AI data center powered by a yet-to-be-built nuclear power station, it said.
Stitzel and Gilmore didn’t respond to requests for comment.
The tactics alleged by the attorney general are commonly used in the industry to squeeze profits from old wells before companies go bankrupt. Oil and gas executives so frequently follow a similar pattern that environmentalists call it “the playbook.”
Oil companies and trade groups argue that most orphan wells are from an earlier era and that modern operators are helping address the problem by paying into various government-managed funds that pay for the plugging of some old wells.
The exact number of orphan wells awaiting cleanup nationwide is unknown, but the figure is believed to be in the hundreds of thousands, if not higher. New Mexico faces as much as a $1.6 billion bill to plug such wells, according to a June 2025 Legislative Finance Committee report.
“As the oil boom is aging and a lot of the wells are becoming low-producing, the risk is increasing,” said Mandy Sackett, the lead New Mexico campaigner for environmental group Earthworks. The potential for taxpayers to be saddled with plugging oil companies’ orphan wells, she said, “poses such a massive financial risk.”
 “Out of the Dark Ages”

The problem of Remnant and other companies leaving wells as orphans is informing a broader reckoning among legislators and regulatory agencies about the inadequacy of New Mexico’s safeguards.
Oil companies are required to set aside funds, called bonds, that the state can call on to pay for well plugging and environmental cleanup. These bonds are meant to protect taxpayers from shouldering such costs in the event that a company goes bankrupt or walks away.
But like all oil-producing states, New Mexico’s bonds cover only a fraction of the true cost of cleanup. A 2024 ProPublica and Capital & Main analysis found that the 15 states that account for nearly all the nation’s oil and gas production held bonds that would cover less than 2% of the projected $151.3 billion cost to plug the wells in their states.
In New Mexico, a fresh attempt at bonding reform kicked off with hearings in October, as the state’s Oil Conservation Commission began updating bonding rules. The proposed amendments, which are backed by a coalition of environmental groups, would require companies to put forward a $150,000 bond for each inactive or low-producing well. Research has shown that these are disproportionately likely to become orphans and the state’s responsibility to plug.
The proposed regulations target companies with large collections of these risky wells and would require companies whose portfolios are made up of at least 15% inactive or low-producing wells to buy bonds for each of their wells. The proposals would also place other layers of regulatory scrutiny on sales of wells to poorly capitalized companies and limit the time that wells could remain idle before needing to be plugged.

Oil Conservation Division officials said in a statement that “the interested parties are currently engaged in settlement talks” for the bonding rulemaking. The agency declined to comment on the attorney general’s lawsuit.
​​New Mexico’s State Land Office, which oversees the state’s publicly owned land, recently initiated a similar process to increase the amount of money set aside in bonds to plug wells within its jurisdiction. The agency estimates that there are 15,000 unplugged oil and gas wells on land it manages.
Ari Biernoff, general counsel of the State Land Office, said that these reforms would bring bonding requirements “out of the Dark Ages” and closer to what the agency would need to fund cleanup should companies walk away.
“Any reasonable observer would conclude we have grossly inadequate bonding,” Biernoff said.
Industry groups have expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed rules.
The New Mexico Oil & Gas Association and Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico submitted counterproposals with significantly reduced bonding increases. The latter said in comments submitted to the state that its suggestion “will keep smaller operators from going out of business.”
“We do not believe it’s in New Mexico’s best interest for the State Land Office to kill a lot of smaller, state-based, good operators to leave only a handful of supermajors,” Jim Winchester, executive director of the Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico, wrote to the agency.
 Remnants of the Oil Industry

Beginning in 2015, Gray, Stitzel and Gilmore aggregated several hundred wells in southeastern New Mexico under the Remnant companies, subsequently racking up regulatory violations, including having too many inactive, unplugged wells. The state’s Oil Conservation Division gave Remnant a deadline of July 2019 to plug some of its wells. Fifteen days before the deadline, the men placed the company into bankruptcy protection.
Remnant’s dissolution kicked off a complex and disputed series of transactions among the three men. According to the attorney general’s complaint, Stitzel and Gilmore created several companies under the name Acacia and purchased most of Remnant’s wells from themselves. Gray, meanwhile, created Solis Partners — a wholly owned subsidiary of Gray’s New Era — and ended up with 87 of the group’s most lucrative gas-producing wells. The bill of sale that landed the wells with Gray’s company was for $10, and Gray signed on behalf of Remnant a change-of-operator application that sent wells to Solis Partners.
Then, in December 2024, a major oil company that the state had asked to plug some of Acacia’s wells sued Acacia to force it to clean up its own mess. Two weeks later, Acacia filed to liquidate through bankruptcy.
Of Remnant’s and Acacia’s wells, 172 ended up as the responsibility of the State Land Office, according to the agency. Eleven of those have been plugged, all but one by other oil companies that hold leases with the agency and stepped up to do the work. Based on the state’s estimated per-well cleanup cost, the remaining wells could cost a total of more than $25 million to plug.
The agency was able to claim a single bond from Remnant worth $20,000.
“This is a very vivid demonstration of why we need an upgrade to the bonding rule,” said Biernoff, the State Land Office general counsel.
The most lucrative wells from Gray, Stitzel and Gilmore’s foray into New Mexico’s oil and gas industry belong to Solis Partners. But even that company appears at risk of leaving them as orphans, as it has about 120 inactive wells on state trust land, according to the State Land Office. Its parent company, New Era, which is pitching plans for a 3,500-acre AI data center campus in southeastern New Mexico, said it is selling the wells.
“Having enriched themselves with the profits from Solis Partners’ and Acacia’s oil and gas production, the Individual Defendants are once again seeking to walk away from the plugging and remediation costs,” the attorney general’s complaint alleged.
Charlie Barrett is an ecologist with environmental group Oilfield Witness who has chronicled pollution at Remnant’s and Acacia’s wells for years. “They’re old, they’re just falling apart,” he said. They are also, he said, emblematic of the small oil and gas operators that represent the final stage of the industry leaving its wells as orphans.
“I wish I could say that it’s unique,” Barrett said, “but it isn’t.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MO-PP-IMG_6626-copy_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 09:57:06.399873

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts led five of her colleagues in urging the respective heads of Rural Development at the Department of Agriculture and the Administration for Children and Families at the Department of Health and Human Services to offer up more information on their “current capacity to support child care, particularly in rural communities.” Joining Warren are Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, Alex Padilla of California and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. “Despite child care being one of the biggest costs American families face, the Trump administration has taken a wrecking ball to the federal programs that aim to make child care more accessible and affordable, including ACF and USDA’s Rural Development Office,” the senators wrote to acting Under Secretary for Rural Development Todd Lindsey and ACF’s Assistant Secretary Alex Adams. USDA Rural Development and ACF work to expand access to child care in rural areas. The senators pointed to a September poll from First Five Years Fund, a federal advocacy group, which found that 4 out of 5 rural Americans “say the ability of working parents to find and afford quality child care is either in a ‘state of crisis’ or ‘a major problem.’” The group said the administration’s slashing of staff at agencies and programs that support affordable child care, including ACF and Rural Development at USDA, are raising concerns that the administration is “failing families across the country and adding to the affordability crisis facing working-class families.” Cuts from federal child care fund to Dem statesThe senators raised alarm over some of the administration’s most sweeping actions regarding child care programs, including attempts to cut off nearly $2.4 billion from the multibillion-dollar Child Care and Development Fund, or CCDF, to California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York earlier in January. All are led by Democratic governors and the administration cited concerns about allegations of fraud.CCDF — administered within the Office of Child Care under ACF — provides federal funding to states, territories and tribes to help low-income families obtain child care.The five Democratic-led states sued in a New York federal court over the freeze, which also included $7.35 billion from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and $869 million from the Social Services Block Grant — totaling more than $10 billion when combined with CCDF. A judge temporarily blocked the administration from freezing the funds earlier this month. A separate judge extended that order Friday. “States are challenging the legality of this freeze, but the consequences would be devastating should the courts permit the administration to permanently withhold the funds,” the senators wrote. Days prior to the announced freeze, the administration said states had to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers to get those dollars.That demand followed allegations of fraud in Minnesota child care programs, which had prompted HHS to freeze all child care payments to the state.The administration also announced earlier in January it would be rescinding multiple Biden administration child care rules that “required states to pay providers before verifying any attendance and before care was delivered.” Head Start in rural AmericaThe Democrats argued that President Donald Trump has also “attacked Head Start at every turn since his inauguration.” ACF administers Head Start, which provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families. The senators noted that “Head Start is especially crucial in rural communities, where it is often the only licensed child care program available.” During the record-long government shutdown in 2025, scores of Head Start centers experienced lapses in funding grants as a result.  Even prior to the shutdown, Head Start already experienced chaos during the Trump administration, such as reports of delays in accessing approved grant funding, regional office closures and firings at ACF’s Office of Head Start.Flood of workers departing USDA Meanwhile, USDA saw more than 20,000 employees leave in the first half of 2025, according to a report from the agency’s Office of Inspector General. More than one-third of the agency’s Rural Development unit left during that time.  “Instead of strengthening the programs that aim to address the rural child care crisis, President Trump is firing the people who administer them,” the senators wrote. On top of that, the agency in March confirmed it would be slashing around $1 billion in previously announced funding for programs to help child care facilities, schools and food banks purchase from local farmers. USDA also faced backlash during the shutdown for refusing to tap into a multibillion-dollar contingency fund in order to keep benefits flowing for the country’s main food assistance program known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.The senators urged Lindsey and Adams to respond to their inquiries by Feb. 16. USDA and ACF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",,,,2026-01-26 09:57:06.399873

(U.S. Army Photo by Master Sgt. Justin P. Morelli) A Democratic state lawmaker from Anchorage loudly denounced the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s surge in Minnesota while speaking on the Alaska House floor on Friday.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, is a military veteran and co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Armed Services Committee. 
“The facts are that our government is out of control. Norms have been broken at an alarming rate, and the world is watching us in shock,” he said.
Gray’s remarks were met by loud desk-thumping — a form of applause — and came on a day when thousands of Minnesotans marched in subzero weather and held a general strike to show their opposition to ICE efforts in their state.
Tensions are particularly high after several shootings by federal officers, including one in which an officer killed a mother of three.
The remarks came one day before federal agents fatally shot another Minneapolis resident on Saturday, prompting nationwide protests throughout the weekend. 
On Friday, Gray questioned Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s decision to provide National Guard administrative support for ICE in Alaska and President Donald Trump’s threatened use of regular U.S. Army troops in Minnesota. 
Up to 1,500 active-duty troops of the U.S. Army’s 11th Airborne Division, based in Anchorage, have been ordered to stand by for possible deployment to Minneapolis — Minnesota’s largest city — according to National Public Radio. 
Gray and Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks and the other co-chair of the Joint Armed Services Committee, have sent letters to Alaska’s congressional delegation and Brig. Gen. John P. Cogbill, commander of the 11th Airborne.
In those letters, Gray and Kawasaki say they are receiving “enquiries … from the Alaskan people” and pose a series of questions.
How long will the 11th Airborne be in Minnesota? How does a deployment fit in the division’s mission to defend the United States against foreign threats? Could soldiers be detaining suspected undocumented people? Would the 11th Airborne fight the Minnesota National Guard if Gov. Tim Walz activates it to defend protesters?
“Fifteen hundred active-duty soldiers may be sent from Alaska to Minnesota to protect ICE agents as they continue their efforts to arrest and detain suspected undocumented immigrants,” Gray said, “But who really needs the protection? Is it the ICE agents, or is it the folks who are terrified to leave their homes, to go to work, to pick their kids up from school or to actually show up at their immigration appointments?”
While Gray’s comments appeared to have the support of many legislators in the chamber — judging by the desk-pounding applause — there was at least one dissenting voice.
Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, is a veteran, the spouse of a veteran, and a Latina, she said, explaining that she had also sent a letter to Gen. Cogbill, but her letter was to remind him that he is not legally obligated to answer the Legislature’s questions or testify in the Capitol.
Allard said she has been deployed overseas with the military and with the U.S. State Department.
“I experienced things when I worked for the US State Department, of women being abused, hit — watched them get their teeth knocked in, where I had to stand by and couldn’t do anything,” she said.
“We have a lot going on in our country, dividing, saying we’re this or we’re that. We’re all Americans, but it doesn’t mean that it’s okay to have riots across our country. If the military and the federal government and the Department of War and the 11th Airborne Division decide that it’s best to go to Minnesota, that’s what we need to do,” she said.
Allard’s comments were met by quieter but noticeable desk-pounding, with the loudest coming from Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake.
He said afterward that he thinks Gray incorrectly described some aspects of ICE’s work in Minnesota. For example, Gray said ICE detained a five-year-old in Minnesota.
“There’s a little bit more to the story, McCabe said.

As Vermont grapples with education reform and rising property taxes, one partnership, among many in the Vermont Care Partners (VCP) network, is proving that innovation through collaboration can address both student mental health needs and affordability concerns in the Northeast Kingdom. This year, St. Johnsbury School District and Northeast Kingdom Human Services (NKHS), a Designated Agency (DA), started a pilot program – Catamount Community Connections (C3P) – a new program that demonstrates how effective school-DA partnerships can keep students in their community, improve outcomes, and generate cost savings for taxpayers.
The creation of C3P was intentional, achieved through partnership, and centered on the local community. After 18 months of collaborative development, the result is a program that embodies the kind of integrated partnership Success Beyond 6 was designed to create, where schools and mental health agencies combine their unique strengths to create something neither could accomplish alone.
In the C3P model, NKHS brings ownership and renovation of the facility, along with specialized mental health services rooted in trauma-informed, evidence-based approaches. Their Board-Certified Behavioral Analysts (BCBAs) and clinicians provide supervision and quality oversight that schools simply cannot replicate on their own. Additionally, NKHS enables the leveraging of federal Medicaid funding through Success Beyond 6, reducing costs and the local tax burden. St. Johnsbury School District contributes its special education expertise, individualized education programs, educational curriculum and instruction, and the vital connection to students’ home schools and community. Together, what’s created is an environment where students can access their education in the least restrictive setting, stay connected to their families and community, and ultimately work toward returning to their local public school – all while costing significantly less than traditional out-of-district placements.
C3P leverages Success Beyond 6, Vermont’s established framework for school-DA partnerships, which isn’t a new or untested concept, but rather an evolution of a proven model. Success Beyond 6 has been operating since December 1992 and was created specifically as a partnership between mental health, education, students, and families. By 2019, 77% of Vermont’s public schools participated in the program, which was designed from the beginning to be driven by local needs and responsive to local conditions.
The partnership model works for several interconnected reasons: Success Beyond 6 uses local education funds as a state match to draw down federal Medicaid dollars, so schools pay only a portion of the cost of each service while the federal government contributes the rest.  Beyond financial mechanics, DAs provide mental health services including behavioral intervention, trauma treatment, and clinical supervision. State oversight through the Department of Mental Health (DMH) ensures adherence to quality standards and the measurement of outcomes throughout.

Vermont faces converging crises in student mental health and school affordability that require innovative, cost-effective solutions. The statistics driving the need for a program like C3P, paint a picture that would benefit from creative intervention.

34% of Vermont high school students report poor mental health – stress, anxiety, and depression – most of the time. 
Vermont ranks first nationally among students with Individualized Education Plans (IEP) for emotional disturbance, and over five percent of Vermont students with IEPs are placed in separate schools, more than double the national average of 2.4%. 
Schools across the state report that they lack the in-house capacity, staffing, and specialized resources to respond effectively to these growing needs.

The special education and budget pressures compound these challenges. 

Students with IEPs have increased from 17.9% to 19.6% between 2019 and 2024, while the four-year graduation rate for students with IEPs has fallen to just 67%, compared to 86% for students without IEPs. 
Property tax increases have reached as high as 18.5% in some districts, driven in part by the extraordinary costs of out-of-district placements and transportation. 

These pressures are particularly acute in the Northeast Kingdom and serve as the catalyst for C3P’s creation.
Locally, the partnership with schools and NKHS has made both a financial and clinical difference. Students served through NKHS’s school-based programs have made significant progress in treatment. 
The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) is a point-in-time assessment designed to help educators and mental health professionals understand both the challenges and strengths of each student within the SB6 program. It enables a student’s care team to evaluate key areas such as academic performance, attendance, peer and teacher relationships, and school behavior, identifying both needs and strengths. 
An analysis of data from 2023 to the present for active SB6 students shows that 84% of NKHS school-based clients developed skills that reduced needs across one or more CANS domains.
The following data represent students who initially scored a high need and later dropped to a low need on their most recent assessment:

50% of students enhanced skills that increased academic persistence and engagement in learning.
75% of students demonstrated improvement in reducing tardiness and arriving at school/class on time.
75% of students improved skills that contributed to fewer school discipline issues.
53% of students with a high need score demonstrated improved attention skills, enabling them to stay focused more effectively.

In addition to clinical benefits for students, the partnership model can reduce costs for schools. Traditional out-of-district placements can cost up to $120,000 per year in specialized school tuition, with transportation adding up to another $100,000 per year per student. That’s up to $220,000 annually for a single student. Although not every student placement costs this much, out-of-district placements are more expensive than keeping students in their local communities. The C3P partnership model, by contrast, provides in-district alternative programming with integrated mental health support at significantly lower costs. The local placement eliminates long-distance transportation costs entirely, while Success Beyond 6 Medicaid funding provides a federal match, meaning schools pay only a portion of each dollar spent on services, with the federal government contributing the rest. Savings from this program, if expanded, could be significant. 
Currently, the C3P pilot program serves fewer than 10 students, but over the next few years, it is hoped that the capacity will increase to 30. This has the potential to support students in their local community and save an estimated $1 million – $4 million in costs.
It’s important to emphasize that C3P doesn’t replace specialized independent therapeutic schools – Vermont needs those programs, too. Rather, C3P fills a critical middle ground: intensive enough for students with significant needs, local enough to maintain family and community connections, and cost-effective enough to be sustainable over the long term.
The St. Johnsbury School-NKHS partnership through C3P is more than just one program serving a small student group. It’s a proof-of-concept for how Vermont can address its dual challenges of student mental health needs and affordability pressures. It provides:

specialized mental health expertise that schools need but cannot build alone,
creates a pathway back to traditional school settings, 
directly addresses Vermont’s first-in-nation rates of emotional disturbance, 
leverages federal Medicaid match to reduce the local burden,
creates local capacity that can serve multiple districts, 
generates measurable savings that benefit taxpayers directly. 

Innovation happens through partnership rather than isolation and creates opportunity. The C3P model is a program that other regions across Vermont could replicate.
Vermont’s challenges are real. Student mental health needs are high, special education costs are rising, and property taxpayers are strained. Singular programs are not a silver bullet, but as C3P demonstrates, effective partnerships between schools and VCP network agencies offer an opportunity to solve some of the pressing needs facing the Vermont education system. 
St. Johnsbury School District and NKHS have shown what’s possible when partners commit to working together, leverage established frameworks like Success Beyond 6, and innovate to meet local needs. This example points toward solutions that are both educationally sound and fiscally responsible. As Vermont considers education reform, the C3P model offers a critical reminder: some of our best solutions come not from choosing between quality and affordability, but from partnerships that deliver both.

She says the next step is to blend Blueprint for Literacy with the Kansas State Board of Education's literacy program known as Every Child Can Read. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature directed the Kansas State Board of Education and Kansas Board of Regents to implement separate laws enacted during the past four years to elevate reading skills of public school students.
Both the 2022 Every Child Can Read Act in the hands of the K-12 Board of Education and the 2024 Blueprint for Literacy organized by higher education’s Board of Regents recognized the threat of failing a majority of 450,000 students enrolled in Kansas classrooms.
“Reading and literacy, reading and writing, are the fundamental skills in which all other learning is built,” said Cynthia Lane, director of the Blueprint for Literacy. “Literacy is directly related to health outcomes and the ability to secure high quality jobs. I like to say literacy is opportunity. It’s also about justice and freedom, because in order to have true freedom you need to have the skills so that you can make decisions for yourself.”


Evidence for urgency to the state’s work on child literacy wasn’t difficult to find. Testing showed 55% of Kansas students in third through 10th grades read at the limited or basic levels, which meant they couldn’t handle the content independently. Put another way, state exams revealed less than half read at the proficient or advanced levels.
In an interview for Kansas Reflector’s podcast, Lane said she was convinced the Legislature should weave the two literacy programs into a coordinated set of policies aimed at improving reading success in the classroom. She said educators and students would benefit from coalescing around a single vision.
“We have no common plan,” she said. “No common goals. No common accountability. And, frankly, having two laws has created confusion amongst our legislators about who’s doing what and how can we know if we’re making progress. We are advocating for a comprehensive implementation plan that brings both the pre-K-12 system and the higher education system into alignment.”
Lane said she was impressed by the Board of Education’s commitment to K-12 reforms outlined in Every Child Can Read. It required school districts to make students read proficiently by third grade by relying on evidence-based instruction. It mandated universal screening of students, better communication with parents and targeted student interventions, including one-on-one tutoring or summer school classes in reading.
“The state Board of Education and the Department of Education has done really powerful work,” Lane said.
Blueprint for Literacy required discredited reading methodologies to be abandoned by Kansas universities and to be replaced by phonics-based approaches. The law created two undergraduate college courses focused on application of structured literacy by students preparing to become school teachers in Kansas. So far, nearly 2,000 students have gone through those courses at a private or public college in Kansas. Another 1,000 expect to finish by July.
The bipartisan Blueprint for Literacy law also established two graduate courses in reading literacy. All of the state’s 18,000 elementary educators in the field must pass both courses, or a comparable curriculum, to retain a professional license in Kansas. Approximately 9,000 completed the State Board of Education’s LETRS program, which has been offered for several years.
During the past nine months, Blueprint for Literacy paid the cost of tuition for 500 teachers who enrolled in the two foundations of reading graduate-level courses. In addition, Blueprint for Literacy provided each teacher with a professional mentor to help implement reforms in their classrooms.
“The resounding feedback is that the coach has made the difference in transforming what they’re doing in their classes every day,” Lane said.
The state’s goal for Blueprint for Literacy would have 90% of third- through eighth-grade students reading at the basic level and at least 50% of those students at the proficient level by 2033. In Kansas, assessments of reading placed students on a four-level, low-to-high scale of limited, basic, proficient or advanced.
“There is urgency to move because every parent wants the teacher in the classroom to have the top skills,” she said.
Lane, the former superintendent of schools in Kansas City, Kansas, said she understood at a personal level what it meant to be a low-skill reader. She said she didn’t learn to read until the seventh grade, in part because methods at that time tended to require children to memorize words based on pictures or other cues.
“It was devastating to be in an elementary school and not read,” she said.
Lane, who went on to earn a doctorate in education, said research demonstrated the brain worked in such a way that explicit instruction in phonics — sounds that letters make — did a better job of building reading fluency and comprehension among children.
“Based on all the science and the research that’s been done, we know how to teach every child to read,” she said. “But they need instruction that first identifies what kids know and where there gaps are and design the instruction specifically to what every individual child needs.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cynthia-Lane-2-20260122_130806-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-26 09:57:06.399873

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is arguing that the U.S. Department of Justice’s demand that Minnesota hand over its state voter information as a precondition for ending immigration operations in that state underscores that the federal government is “inflicting violence in order to create chaos and control our states and elections.”
In a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote the state could end the federal law enforcement surge if it repealed pro-immigrant “sanctuary” policies, and turned over Medicaid and food assistance records as well as voter data to the federal government.
“I am confident that these simple steps will help bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans,” Bondi wrote in the letter, sent after a federal agent shot and killed Alex Jeffrey Pretti Saturday.
Pretti’s killing, captured from multiple angles by witnesses recording on their cell phones, was the second shooting death of a U.S. citizen by immigration agents in Minneapolis during the weeks-long federal operation there. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched an immigration operation in Maine last week, detaining several lawful residents.
Bellows, a Democrat running for governor, has twice rejected requests to provide the DOJ with sensitive voter data, including driver’s license numbers, partial social security numbers and full dates of birth, along with names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance, the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship and voter registration applications from  specific time periods, among other information.  
The DOJ has argued the data is necessary to assess states’ compliance with the statewide voter registration list maintenance provisions of the National Voter Registration Act. 
Maine is now among the states being sued by the federal government over its failure to comply.
In a motion to dismiss filed last month, the state argued that the lawsuit should be discharged because the DOJ failed to support a valid legal case as to why it is justified to such information, and that its data requests violate federal privacy law. 
The motion also noted voter registration databases contain information about people’s choice of political party and in which elections they chose to vote, which are activities protected by the First Amendment. Bellows and other secretaries of state have also raised concern about the federal government using voter records for citizenship probes. 
In a statement Sunday, Bellows said, “Maine will never turn over our voter rolls as a ransom payment to get ICE to end its unconstitutional assault on our state. 
“Our founders designed a system where states and local governments, not the federal government, oversee elections to safeguard us from exactly this — a tyrannical, power-hungry president trampling on our constitutional rights,” she wrote. 
Bellows said as the state’s top election official, she will stand with Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, who described the letter as “an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday called for U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to resign and Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino to be fired a day after federal immigration enforcement officers shot at another U.S. citizen in Minneapolis multiple times, killing him.
Weeks after the death of Renee Good, Border Patrol agents killed Alex Pretti on Friday, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse who worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. During an altercation in which Pretti was observing and documenting federal agents beforehand, multiple officers tackled Pretti to the ground. Pretti reportedly had a gun, for which he had a lawful permit to carry. After one agent took away the gun while Pretti was pinned on the ground, officers appear to have fired at him at least 10 times.
Immediately after the shooting, members of the Trump administration called Pretti a domestic terrorist. First Assistant U.S. Attorney and former California Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli defended the agents, arguing that there “is a high likelihood” law enforcement officers “will be legally justified in shooting you” if you approach them with a gun — an assertion that the National Rifle Association called “dangerous and wrong.”
On Sunday President Donald Trump also blamed Democrats and sanctuary laws, such as those in California, for the two deaths in Minneapolis.
In response, Newsom called for Border Patrol officers to return to the border, ending the militarization of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and investigations into “every single federal agent who is breaking the law.” His office also posted a know-your-rights guide for dealing with local police and immigration enforcement officers.
But the governor’s statements are part of a political calculus that is playing out as he makes a likely bid for the presidency. After Good’s death, Newsom’s team responded that ICE is “state sponsored terrorism.” Newsom eventually walked back this description during an interview with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.
Meanwhile, as Congress weighs a spending deal that would include billions of dollars more for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Assemblymember Isaac Bryan of Culver City called for a general strike to oppose ICE, similar to the large-scale walkout organized in Minneapolis.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta also filed a brief supporting Minnesota’s lawsuit opposing the federal government’s immigration campaign in the state. Along with 19 other attorneys general, the brief argued that the “government’s unlawful conduct … infringes upon (Minnesota’s) constitutionally-guaranteed state sovereignty,” and that without legal intervention the government “will no doubt threaten other States and local communities across the nation.”

Fewer homicides in CA for second year in a row

Homicide rates in California have dropped for the second year in a row, consistent with a nationwide trend after a crime surge during the pandemic, reports CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
In the city of Los Angeles, homicides dropped by more than 18% to 230 in 2025, and San Francisco had its lowest rates since 1954. Besides major cities, homicides have also been down in cities including Oakland, Fresno, Richmond and Lodi, though Kern County’s remains the state’s highest.
The declines mark a milestone after California experienced a rise in homicides during the pandemic, though crime in 2020-21 nationally and in California was still notably lower than the highs seen in the early 1990s.
Many factors could be at play for the falling numbers, crime researchers say. Magnus Lofstrom, policy director of criminal justice at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, said the pandemic-era homicide spike may have been the result of various social disruptions such as school shutdowns, unemployment and the pausing of public services.

The U.S. Department of Justice has agreed to drop its demand for medical records of more than 3,000 young transgender patients at the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, writes CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
In July 2025 the Justice Department said it sent subpoenas to more than 20 medical providers that offered gender-affirming care for minors. Hospitals were directed to provide a wide array of documents, including ones “sufficient to identify each patient … who was prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy,” court documents show.
The department said it was probing doctors and clinics for potential “healthcare fraud” and “false statements.” But the department never provided evidence of fraud, said the director of one of the law firms representing families who sued the department in a class action lawsuit to stop the subpoenas. 
Under the agreement the Justice Department will rescind its requests through 2029 for documents that identify patients or their families.

California policymakers must continue to fund trauma recovery centers — where trained staff members help survivors of crime heal from trauma — now that the passage of Proposition 36 has put funding streams for such programs at risk, writes Kathy Brown-Lowe, a crime and trauma survivor who lives in L.A.

,California,2026-01-26 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California cities just saw their lowest homicide rates in decades. It’s not clear why,Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2026/01/california-homicide-rate/,"Homicides in California surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, killings are down to historic lows in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and many other cities.","In summary
Homicides in California surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, killings are down to historic lows in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and many other cities.


For the second year in a row, Gov. Gavin Newsom is celebrating California’s declining homicide rate while using it as a cudgel against his political foes. 
“Your state’s homicide rate is 117% higher than California’s,” he told a Missouri congressman who needled Newsom on social media last summer. 
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders caught his attention, too. “Your homicide rate is literally DOUBLE California’s,” he wrote on social media addressing her. 
What’s been clear for the last three years is that homicides are down in Los Angeles and San Francisco — but also in Fresno, Oakland, Richmond and Lodi. 
“California cities are seeing record-low homicide rates,” Newsom said in his state of the state speech earlier this month. “Oakland, the lowest since 1967; LA, the lowest since 1966; and San Francisco, the lowest since 1954.”
After a spike during the early days of the pandemic, homicides are in fact down nationwide. 
The reason why is far less clear. To put it in the language of crime researchers, the answer is “multifactorial.” 
Magnus Lofstrom, policy director of criminal justice at nonpartisan think tank the Public Policy Institute of California, said the spike of homicides during the pandemic may have been the result of disruptions in government activities: Schools were shut down, people were out of work, community-based programs for violence prevention and many basic public services were put on pause, Lofstrom said. 
The 2020 numbers were a shock. After years of decline, the homicide rate in California surged by 31% in 2020 to 5.5 homicides per 100,000 people. In 2021, it rose again, to about 6 per 100,000 people. 
But that trend began to turn in 2022, when the number of homicides dropped by 7%, then in 2023 by 14% and in 2024 by another 12%. By the end of 2024, the homicide rate in California was down to 4.3 per 100,000 people. 
California’s population was about 20 million people the last time the state recorded such low homicide numbers, half of what it is today. 
At the same time the homicide numbers were climbing, the percentage of cases cleared by police was falling. A police department’s “clearance rate” compares the number of crimes reported to the number of arrests made. 
Lofstrom said that the homicide clearance rate statewide was 64.7% in 2019, and that it had dropped to 54.6% in 2021 – though the rates can vary dramatically among police departments.  
“What we see now in the data up to 2024 is that we’re back up over 64% for homicide clearances,” Lofstrom said. 
Half as many homicides in Oakland
Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said homicides are down along with major gun crimes including robberies and assaults with firearms. Oakland’s 67 homicides in 2025 were its lowest since 1967. It had 134 homicides in 2021.
In Los Angeles, homicides dropped by more than 18% to 230 in 2025, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of LAPD data. 
The numbers documenting the recent decline in homicide rates, and the earlier spike, come with a major asterisk: The way crime data is collected is inconsistent. Law enforcement agencies self-report to the FBI, which each year publishes data under the Uniform Crime Reporting Program. The California Department of Justice then produces statewide reports from those numbers. 
But not every department reports its statistics. And among those that do, some don’t report all their data — or report the information differently. For example, some jurisdictions only report crimes that lead to incarceration. 
Homicide numbers in California are provided by the state Justice Department near the end of the fiscal year in June, so the most recent statistics are from 2024. The Justice Department declined to provide CalMatters with updated numbers through 2025. 
The drop in homicide rates wasn’t as pronounced in Orange and Orange and Ventura counties, which never experienced a significant pandemic spike, and Kern County, where the homicide rate maintains a stubborn hold as the state’s highest. 
Nationwide drop in crime
A long-range look at crime statistics, particularly homicide data, shows that the 2020-21 crime rate nationally and in California was still a fraction of its highs in the early 1990s. Simply counting the year-over-year changes belies a larger truth: Crime throughout the 2020s has been down significantly compared to the rate 20 or 30 years ago. 
As with the long-term homicide rate declines, the recent tapering in California is part of a nationwide trend. A report published Thursday by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C., think tank found that among 35 major cities nationwide, homicides dropped by 21% between 2024 and 2025. 
When the FBI publishes its crime statistics later this year, Council on Criminal Justice researchers said in the report that the national homicide rate could drop to 4 per 100,000 people, which would be the lowest homicide rate ever on record. 
Shani Buggs, an associate professor at UC Davis and public health researcher, said in the report that cities with major decreases in their homicide rate tended to spend federal pandemic funds on violence prevention and have police departments that focused on people with repeated allegations of violent crimes, helping them quickly resume pre-pandemic clearance rates.
“We do not have reliable, multi-sector data or comparable contextual information available across jurisdictions to definitively identify — now or perhaps ever — what drove these declines,” Buggs said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/010318-Oakland-PD-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555

Kathy Brown-Lowe 
Kathy Brown-Lowe is a crime and trauma survivor who lives in Los Angeles


Ten years ago, I hit bottom.
For more than 50 years I had been trying to work my way through traumas that had accumulated throughout my life. As a child, I, along with one of my sisters, was abused by my step-father. When I was a young woman, my mother and my biological father died, and a number of other close family members, including several sisters and brothers, also died prematurely. I’ve been a victim of extreme episodes of domestic violence. 
My pain caused me to fall into despair, ultimately using an array of drugs and, in middle-age, falling into homelessness. I became estranged from my family. I ended up staying at the Midnight Mission, in downtown Los Angeles. I cried every day.
While I was at the mission, friends told me to check out the Downtown Women’s Center, which has helped provide housing for thousands of women experiencing homelessness for nearly half a century. They offer dignity to people who too often have been deprived of any sense of their own worth. 
I started visiting the center nearly every day, talking with their case workers, eating in their cafeteria, receiving medical assistance and — eventually — getting linked with mental health therapists and counselors at the on-site Trauma Recovery Center, which provides services and support to victims of crime.
That’s crucial because nearly 3 out of 4 people experiencing homelessness in California have endured physical violence, and more than 9 in 10 are crime or trauma survivors. 
The Trauma Recovery Center provided me with a community of caregivers willing to go the extra mile on my behalf. I always said I needed a village to help me get whole, and the center staff were willing to be that village.
At the center I finally began to grapple with the pain that has haunted me since I was a child. It was in that safe space — where people didn’t judge me and didn’t make me feel small — that I was able to start talking about my fears and anxieties. I found that as I talked more about the traumas that were so deeply embedded in my life story, and that I had bottled up inside of me for so long, I began relying less on the drugs that I’d been using as a form of self-medication.
It didn’t happen all in a rush, but over time my life began to make more sense. 
There are 24 Trauma Recover Centers in other communities across California. They are places where dedicated, trained staff work tirelessly to help survivors of crime heal from the psychological traumas and damage that have accumulated over many decades and that impact their ability to function fully and happily on a daily basis. 
As anyone who’s been through the trauma I have knows, you usually don’t make good decisions if you don’t feel safe.
Sadly, after the passage of Proposition 36 last year, the funding stream for programs such as the Trauma Recovery Centers at the Downtown Women’s Center is at risk. I can’t imagine anything more shortsighted than not making sure these centers have the resources they need to get victims immediate access to the help and support they need and deserve.
I understand the frustration of voters and politicians who want quick fixes to social problems and who are angered by continual waves of crime, drug addiction and homelessness. It’s tempting to reach for punishment over treatment and crime prevention when you are angry and disappointed at the actions of other people. 
But in a zero-sum world, where more money spent on incarceration means less money available for California’s growing network of Trauma Recovery Centers, that’s a bad bargain. 
The Trauma Recovery Center has given me a second chance at life and the ability to give back to the community of which I am a part. 
Today I’m 68, living in my own apartment again. I have strong relationships with my children, four grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and many of their friends — all of whom consider me to be their honorary great-grandmother and call me their “G.G.” I couldn’t have done any of that without the work of the people at the Trauma Recovery Center.
I hope California’s legislators and governor understand the importance of these centers to thousands of men and women like me around the state, and that they continue to allocate dollars to allow their vital work to go on.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/100824_Inside-Safe_CS_CM_41.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After years of waiting, several immigrants in Utah were just days or moments away from making their case for asylum in the United States. 
But before judges considered their arguments earlier this month, their cases were dealt a major blow, their attorneys said.  
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security filed motions to “pretermit” their cases, or dismiss them before the long-anticipated hearing and deport them to a “safe third country” where they don’t have ties to seek asylum there instead. 
“It’s a complete nightmare,” said South Jordan immigration attorney Carlos Trujillo.

Trujillo noted that in October, an immigration appeals board effectively ruled the burden is on immigrants to prove they are likely to be persecuted or tortured in the third country and therefore should be allowed to stay in the U.S. 
“There is no way to save the case, because there is no way to demonstrate that you will be persecuted in a country that you have never been in,” Trujillo said. 
But he will try anyway at upcoming hearings where he said he will have 15 minutes to make such a case on behalf of clients originally from Venezuela. 
It comes as the Trump administration carries out mass deportations and seeks to clear a backlog of asylum cases. More than 2 million immigrants are awaiting asylum hearings, according to Syracuse University’s TRAC database. 
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to email requests for comment from Utah News Dispatch. It has previously said it is “using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system.” It has also referred to “lawful bilateral arrangements” allowing unauthorized immigrants to seek legal protection in other nations that have agreed to adjudicate their claims.

The United States has a longstanding third-country agreement with Canada but signed more recent agreements with countries including Ecuador, Guatemala and Honduras.  
“They’re saying, ‘Hey, because we have the agreements with these countries, they’re not even eligible to apply for asylum here. Let’s ship them to Honduras or Ecuador and see if they’ll grant them asylum instead,’” said Utah immigration attorney Nicholle Pitt White.  
The government’s practice of filing “pretermission motions” intensified nationally in November after the appeals decision, with thousands filed. Use of the legal strategy seems to have started growing in Utah in recent weeks, according to Trujillo and Pitt White. 
The attorneys can count the number of cases in their offices on one or two hands, but suspect more are being filed. 
What we know about how ICE arrests have increased in Utah under Trump

“It’s very possible they’ve done it in other cases where people don’t have attorneys, and we just wouldn’t hear those stories,” Pitt White said. 
In and outside of Utah, lawyers are trying to get creative in how they fight against the maneuver. One argument, Pitt White said: The United States’ third-country agreement with Ecuador isn’t in full force because specific criteria for who will and will not be accepted under the accord hasn’t been set.  
Pitt White noted Ecuador has one of the highest homicide rates in South America and Honduras has in recent years had the highest rate of people fleeing and seeking asylum in the U.S. 
She believes one of her clients who’s currently being held in a detention center had a strong case before the change in the government’s strategy. 
“But because of the timing when this policy came out, the motion being filed, we got stuck in a bad spot for our client,” Pitt White said. “It feels kind of hopeless.”

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has threatened to freeze funding helping low-income families pay for child care. “Most child-care centers depend on the child-care subsidies, if they're taking in a lot of subsidies, to pay their staff,” she said. “And if it goes away, then they would have to rely on their savings – period. And if they don't have savings, then they don't have a center.” (Courtesy Camille Bennett)When Talia Shelby heard on the radio the federal government was freezing a program that helps pay for her 3-year-old daughter’s child care, she had to turn the volume down.
“I’m scared to even think about it,” Shelby said. “That’s another anxiety for me to have. It’s hard when you’re a single parent and you’re just trying to figure it out, and then the government fights with each other.”
In a Dec. 30 X post, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced a freeze in funding that assists low-income families with child care costs and promised rules changes that could reduce payments to child-care providers in a Jan. 5 press release.
The catalyst for the announcements was an unverified, viral video by a right-wing influencer that purports to show day-care centers in Minnesota that are receiving federal funds but aren’t serving children.
Details about the federal government’s plans and how they will affect states across the nation remain uncertain. State agencies administer the federal child-care funds, and administrators in some states, including Alabama, say the federal government hasn’t notified them of any changes. A spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Human Resources said Friday the agency received a payment from the federal government on Jan. 21.
“Alabama DHR has not received any official guidance/correspondence from the Office of Child Care regarding this matter,” a  Jan. 7 statement from Alabama DHR reads. “Also, we have not received any notification of funds being frozen.”
Mississippi Today and a Georgia House of Representatives member reported similar responses from administrators in those states.
But based on the sparse information the U.S. Health and Human Services Department has shared publicly, child-welfare advocates and policy analysts in Alabama said the consequences of threatened actions could be devastating for child-care businesses and the families they serve. Employers and the state’s economy also could suffer if parents drop out of the workforce, they said.
Shelby, who lives in Florence, Alabama, and has worked at an area hotel for nine years, said if her child-care subsidy payments were interrupted or the center her daughter attends closed due to changes in how providers are paid, she likely wouldn’t be able to keep her job. Shelby’s daughter has autism and is non-verbal. The daycare where she’s enrolled full time is the only one Shelby could find that participates in the subsidy program and employs teachers trained to work with children who have autism.
“That’s hard, taking away the ability for us to pay them,” she said.
Sa-Vaughnie Johnson, senior program director of early care and education services with the Family Guidance Center of Alabama, which helps families secure child care assistance, said potential funding changes would deal a significant blow to all child-care providers in Alabama that participate in the subsidy program – and a vast majority do. Those in rural and high-poverty areas are especially vulnerable, she said.
“I don’t know if they could sustain themselves if that happened,” Johnson said. “We know that centers that take subsidy really need that subsidy to survive. They have to pay their workers, they have to feed these kids.”
The Family Guidance Center is one of a handful of nonprofit child-care management agencies that partner with the Alabama Department of Human Resources to administer the federally funded subsidized child-care program. Qualifying families receive assistance on a sliding scale based on income, Johnson said. Parents have to be working or in school full time, and they pay a portion of child-care costs. Alabama DHR covers the rest by making subsidy payments directly to providers using federal funds.
The average annual cost in Alabama for a toddler in center-based care was $8,424 in 2024, according to Child Care Aware of America.

Attempts to freeze funds met with lawsuits

The X post by HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill states: “Starting today, all ACF payments across America will require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.”
“ACF” is the Administration for Children and Families, a division of HHS that oversees the Child Care and Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Social Services Block Grant – all federal funding sources for states to assist families with children. The Child Care and Development Fund subsidizes child care for 1.4 million children nationwide and 40,226 in Alabama, according to the HHS website and Alabama DHR, respectively.
HHS announced Jan. 6 it had sent letters to the governors of five states led by Democrats – California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York – notifying them that access to all three funding streams was restricted pending further review. The decision followed “serious concerns about widespread fraud and misuse of taxpayer dollars in state-administered programs,” according to a press release.
The federal government asked those states to provide data including the names and Social Security numbers of those who received benefits from some programs going back to 2022.
The five states filed a lawsuit challenging the freeze, and a federal judge ruled on Jan. 9 funding must continue for at least two weeks while arguments play out in court.
In a Jan. 13 statement to the Alabama Reflector, HHS said the department is asking for records of attendance, inspections, complaints and internal state discrepancies for centers suspected of fraud in Minnesota.
“For those centers NOT suspected of fraud in Minnesota or in other states, there is still additional verification, but not as extensive,” the statement reads. “Other child care centers will be expected to provide administrative data.”
The federal government typically distributes CCDF funds to states in quarterly installments, although the grants are awarded annually, according to the First Five Years Fund, a nonprofit that works to build federal-level bipartisan support for quality child care and early learning programs.
Any delay in payments would be a stressor for many child-care providers in Alabama, said Camille Bennett, an advocate and co-owner of two child-care centers.
“Most child-care centers depend on the child-care subsidies, if they’re taking in a lot of subsidies, to pay their staff,” she said. “And if it goes away, then they would have to rely on their savings – period. And if they don’t have savings, then they don’t have a center.”
More than 50 state and national organizations issued a joint statement Jan. 13 asking Congress members to ​​ensure federal child-care resources continue to reach eligible families.
“We urge leaders to act with urgency to ensure that the Administration for Children and Families disburses CCDF funding without further disruption, while working in partnership with states as they deliver CCDF funding efficiently and responsibly,” said the statement, submitted during a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education.

Attendance verification and fraud monitoring

DHR said in a statement that it implemented a child-care management system last February which, among other things, tracks attendance and includes several new safeguards to prevent fraud.
“We continue to explore other measures to ensure protocols are in place and followed,” the statement said.
The new system involves QR codes parents scan with their phones when they drop off and pick up their children, said Joycelyn Williams, director of the KinderCare center in Hoover, Alabama.
“We don’t have to do anything with it,” Williams said of the attendance data. “We just print out the code and it goes straight to DHR.”
Johnson said child-care providers receive a new QR code each day as an anti-fraud measure.
“That was just a cleaner, more efficient way of making sure that we are doing with the funds what we should be done with funds,” she said of the QR-code system.
The Family Guidance Center requires families to provide Social Security cards, birth certificates, drivers’ licenses and pay stubs through its application process, Johnson said.
Currently, if a child is absent 10 consecutive days, based on electronic attendance records, they are automatically unenrolled from the subsidy program and parents have to reenroll them to restore payments, according to Alabama DHR.
Carol Gundlach, senior policy analyst with Alabama Arise, said fraud is extremely rare in Alabama’s child-care subsidy program. She said she’s worked with DHR for 30 years in various capacities, including as an advocate, a contractor and through her tenure on the state’s child-care advisory council.
“We certainly know what children are getting funded under the child care block grant because there are contractors with DHR whose job it is to certify families and children as eligible to receive a subsidy,” she said. “So the idea that there are providers out there who just are not submitting plans or documentation or keeping records is simply incorrect.”
By law, state oversight mechanisms include internal controls, state audits and inspector general reviews, fraud detection and investigations and provider monitoring, according to the First Five Years Fund.
States essentially apply for CCDF funds through state plans they submit to the federal government, according to the statement Alabama DHR provided. Those plans include sections in which states must disclose any fraud they’ve uncovered and describe measures they take to prevent fraudulent activity.
According to Alabama’s 299-page 2025-2027 state plan, the most recent analysis found no improper payments that were a direct result of fraud in 2022. Twenty-two parents and two child-care providers were disqualified from the program for intentional program violations during 2023, per the state plan.
Proposed changes to provider pay could cause closures

In the midst of controversy over funding freezes, HHS announced Jan. 5 it was starting a rule-making process to change how providers are paid.
HHS said it was rescinding Biden-era rules that require states to pay child-care providers in advance and based on enrollment rather than attendance and that favored contract slots with providers over parent-directed vouchers.
“When controls are not in place, bad actors can bill for children who aren’t there,” said Alex Adams, HHS assistant secretary for family support. “Families and taxpayers deserve proof that services are being delivered to children. These rule changes emphasize the critical role federal investments in child care play for the American workforce.”
But child-care advocates say a switch to attendance-based billing could push parents out of the workforce and cause child-care centers to close.
In Alabama, child-care subsidies are paid to providers based on enrollment, not attendance, according to the 2025-2027 state plan.
“I’m pretty sure that we have always paid on enrollment, because paying on attendance – it just doesn’t make a lot of sense because the centers’ income would fluctuate drastically,” Gundlach said. “I don’t know how you can operate that way.”
Billing based on enrollment is vital to child-care providers’ financial stability because most of their costs don’t change when children are sporadically absent due to sickness, doctor appointments, family vacations and more, she said. Fixed costs include worker wages, rent or mortgage payments, utility, insurance and tax bills, building maintenance, food expenses and more. Providers typically charge all families, including those who don’t use the subsidy program, based on enrollment vs. attendance to cover these costs, Gundlach said.
“It would be a nightmare if a child doesn’t attend for one day or two days and we’re not getting paid for that,” said Bennett, whose centers receive subsidies for 49 of the 50 children they serve. “That’s ridiculous, because you have to think about it: We’re working with primarily children birth through five. Do you understand how much they get sick? It’s not a viable solution.”
Johnson gives an example of a center with more than five infants enrolled. By law, two teachers would have to be assigned to the infant room in a licensed center. If just three children were present on a given day, only one teacher would be required.
“So now I’ve got to make the decision whether I’m going to send this person home for the day,” Johnson said. “I don’t know how I’m going to pay her because I’m only getting paid for three kids.”
And if absences don’t affect the required teacher-child ratio, sending an employee home isn’t even an option.
If providers were paid subsidies based on actual attendance, the burden to make up the difference in monthly costs initially would fall to parents, said Anita Williams, the Family Guidance Center’s CMA director for Montgomery and Dothan regions.
“And the parent can’t afford to pay the difference,” she said. “That’s why they’re on subsidy.”
Those parents might have to remove their children from care, said Joycelyn Williams of Hoover KinderCare, which receives subsidies for 30% of children in its program. “It would mean a lot of hardship and stress,” she said. “It will cause a lot of problems.”
Alabama already faces a shortage of child-care providers. According to the Buffett Early Childhood Institute at the University of Nebraska, there’s a 41% gap in child-care supply vs. potential need in Alabama.
“That’s going to be trouble on the economy also because a lot of our parents depend on subsidy to go to work or go to school,” Anita Williams said.
The long-term economic impact of Alabama’s current child-care supply gap is between $3.9 billion and $5.9 billion per year, according to the Buffett Early Childhood Institute.
Ultimately, children would suffer if providers closed or their parents couldn’t afford care, Bennett said. Many parents can’t quit work, so their children would likely stay with relatives or neighbors – whoever was available on a given day – with no consistency or educational curriculum, which is required for licensed child-care providers, she said.










I think it would look like a crisis for children. I think it would look like children not receiving educational preparation for pre-K and kindergarten. 


– Camille Bennett, child care center operator


“I think it would look like a crisis for children,” Bennett said. “I think it would look like children not receiving educational preparation for pre-K and kindergarten. I think you’ll see behavioral issues as well. A lack of consistency for children, particularly birth through five, is never a good thing.”

Other changes not likely to affect Alabama

Paying child care providers in advance also helps with business stability, Gundlach said, and that was the reasoning the Biden administration gave for the 2024 rule change. Alabama, however, did not implement the upfront payment model, DHR said in its statement. The agency said in its 2025-2027 state plan that it had requested a waiver to give the state more time to implement the policy change.
The state currently pays providers on a three-week delay, Anita Williams said. DHR also did not implement a model to steer clients toward contract providers, the agency’s statement said.
“It remains up to the parents as to which provider they choose for their child(ren),” the statement reads.
Families using the subsidy program are somewhat limited in that they have to choose a provider that participates in the voluntary program. According to DHR, 1,675 of 1,915 licensed centers and licensed home daycares in Alabama participated in the subsidy program as of Dec. 31. Most families who sign up for subsidies have options to choose among, but their selected provider might have a waitlist, Anita Williams said. Because of a severe shortage in rural areas, some families don’t currently have a choice, she said.

What’s next

Once the proposed rules changes are published in the Federal Register, a 30-day public comment period will ensue.After HHS reviews comments, it could publish a final rule, with an effective date 30 days after publication.
Some language in HHS’s press release says states “may” require payment based on verified attendance and “may” provide payment after care is delivered. It’s possible current law doesn’t allow HHS to make the proposed changes mandatory, Gundlach said, which would leave states to decide what route to take.
Wording in the formally proposed rules should provide clarity, she said.
Alabama DHR said it would make changes as necessary to follow federal law. Alabama’s subsidy program operates pursuant to its state plan, which is written to follow federal requirements in place at the time it’s submitted, DHR said.
“If the rescissions are finalized, the state plan will be amended in compliance with the new rules,” the agency’s statement continued.
Shelby said she wishes government officials making those decisions could see things from the perspective of those who will be affected.
“They’re basing everything on money, but not considering the kids’ lives, not considering the help that this actually gives the parents to get up and go to work,” she said. “Everybody always talks about parents sitting at home. We are the working class, just needing the help. It’s our children that affect us most.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Camille-Bennett-for-Jan-26-2026-newsletter-02-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Clark and Washoe counties are gearing up this week to resume an early-morning count of the number of unsheltered folks in an effort to better grasp the number of people experiencing homelessness. 
Strict guidelines by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development on who should and shouldn’t be included mean the findings won’t reflect a full accounting of people experiencing homelessness and precarious housing. 
The point-in-time-count, a snapshot of homelessness on one particular night in January required by HUD, instructs cities across the country to tally street-level homelessness as well as those staying in temporary emergency shelters and transitional housing. 
Other often overlooked unhoused populations that won’t be reflected in the final numbers include those experiencing homelessness who were incarcerated at the time of the count and unhoused people in emergency rooms and hospitals. 
“There’s an even larger number of people who are in precarious or kind of less than optimal living situations that are not included in the PIT count,” said Catrina Peters, the Homeless Services Coordinator with Washoe County. 
Neither Clark nor Washoe conducted a count of its unsheltered population in 2025. HUD doesn’t require jurisdictions to conduct a full count of its unsheltered population every year, though they are required to provide data of sheltered populations.
The most recent report from HUD found in 2024 homelessness increased by 17% in Nevada, on par with the 20% increase seen across the country.
Southern Nevada’s 2024 PIT count identified 7,906 unhoused people, a 20% increase from the previous year. Washoe County found 1,760 in 2024, which was a 4% increase from the 1,690 found in 2023.
Both jurisdictions think numbers will likely increase this year. 
Even with stringent guidelines from HUD, Clark County is working with neighboring jurisdictions to ensure the number of unsheltered people counted is the most reflective of the population, said Brenda Barnes, social services manager with Clark County. 
The county has refined its counting methodology in recent years to enhance accuracy, but there will “always be an undercount,” Barnes said. 
One reason officials anticipate higher counts this year is an influx of people entering homelessness due to higher rents, Peters said.
As housing becomes less affordable, eviction rates increase, and housing insecurity becomes more prevalent.
“The one data point that continues to persist is that in communities where rent is extremely high, those are the communities that struggle with high homeless rates,” Peters said. “I think it just really brings it all back to the fact that we desperately need to increase the number of affordable housing units in our community.”
Barnes also attributes a part of the increased numbers in previous years to better methodology of counting people.
“I think this year I already assume that our numbers are going to be higher because of the time we’ve taken to do better,” Barnes said.  “If we consistently do better, we’re going to capture more individuals. It doesn’t mean that we’re failing the community in that area. It just means we’re at least doing better accounting for those who are experiencing homelessness.”
Southern Nevada is starting a portion of its count at 3 a.m. within the Corridor of Hope in the City of Las Vegas, the area of downtown Las Vegas with the majority of homeless services and congregate shelters. 
The other deployment sites around Clark County will begin counting around 5 a.m.
Clark County currently has more than 200 volunteers signed up, on par with previous years. The goal this year is to get at least 400 volunteers to ease the counting process. 
Rather than relying on volunteers, Washoe works more deliberately with nonprofits and other homeless service agencies to conduct the count, Peters said. She added this approach is needed especially for hard to reach areas of Washoe that can’t be accessed without four-wheel drive vehicles.  
Some groups of people in unstable housing won’t be reflected in the data when it’s released later in the year. 
“We have folks who are in situations like maybe they’re living in a hotel room, maybe they’re doubled up with family,” Peters said. “Those don’t meet the HUD definitions of homelessness, but are definitely folks who are in very precarious living situations.”
Members of the Southern Nevada Continuum of Care Board, a coalition of government agencies and nonprofits, are exploring doing a separate tally of those incarcerated, Barnes said. Nothing has been finalized and it won’t be conducted during Thursday’s count. 
Because HUD has specific reporting guidelines, counties usually limit data collection during the PIT count to what is specifically required or mandated. 
“We’re making sure that everything is aligned with specifically the requirements of HUD and HUD standards, not asking anything too far beyond that, just given, given the landscape that we’re in,” Barnes said. 
The Trump Administration has increased rhetoric attacking the transgender community since returning to office in 2025.
One of the HUD changes was around data collection for PIT included restricting questions around gender ideology, Barnes said.
While the question will be optional for volunteers to ask, the county won’t be including those results on trans people experiencing homelessness in their final report to HUD, Barnes said. 
Washoe also plans to ask the question and include the data in the county’s final HUD report. 
The PIT count is returning for the first count since the majority of jurisdictions have enacted  anti-homeless camping bans that restrict and criminalize people from sleeping, camping and living in cars. 
Neither county official was entirely sure what type of impact that could have on identifying the unhoused.
Clark County, Barnes said, had since expanded non-congregate shelters, adding there are more options for people to go when encampments are cleared. 
“I think we’re going to see an increase in sheltered homelessness just because of some of the breakup of the encampments,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/imageedit_1_4591747131-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555

I remembered this last week after the Alabama House Democrats outlined their priorities for the 2026 session. It wasn’t an explicit campaign event, but you wouldn’t be wrong to make the connection.
They talked about slashing Alabama’s nation-leading levels of gun violence. Making voting easier. And most of all, improving affordability.
This is all reasonable. The narrative is that President Donald Trump got reelected in 2024 because the price of eggs mattered more to voters than felony convictions and blatant racism. And if Democrats do well this year, the polls say, a growing disappointment with Trump’s handling of the economy will play a big role.
So Democrats, including likely Alabama gubernatorial nominee Doug Jones, are leaning into it.
And it would seem to give them an edge. Alabama Republicans, after cutting grocery taxes while blaming inflation on President Joe Biden, have fallen silent on the issue. The GOP-controlled Legislature is in a hurry to get the budgets passed and get its members back on the campaign trail. Beyond raises for state employees and some efforts to avoid cost increases in their insurance plans next year, there’s really not anything from the party addressing food prices, electricity prices or housing.
But even if these issues are popular, we all know they may not matter in November.  Republicans often need to do little more than be Republicans to win office.
This is partly structural. When qualifying closed on Friday, Democrats had candidates in 21 of the state’s 35 Senate districts and 54 of the state’s 105 House districts.  It’s fine to run on issues that matter to people. But many Alabama voters won’t hear the pitch this year.
But it’s also obvious that Republicans feel no need to talk about actual issues in Alabama. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, our supposed gubernatorial inevitability, has been spending much of his time attacking Muslim Americans. He recently criticized Virginia’s new lieutenant governor for taking her oath of office on a copy of the Quran.
And up and down the Republican state candidate list, you will find an obsession with immigration and voter fraud, two things that are not happening to any significant extent in our state.
If Republicans thought affordability would make or break the 2026 election, odds are we’d be hearing a lot more on the topic from the Legislature. But we’re not. GOP candidates have decided that they can focus on the religious convictions of Virginians more than the daily struggles of Alabamians.
And for now, it’s a good bet. Look who casts ballots in Alabama.
Over the past 16 years, Alabama voters have elected lawmakers who terrorize immigrants. Who attack transgender youth. Legislators who put pregnant women in danger. And put all of us at higher risk of getting shot.
In the face of this cruelty, these lawmakers keep returning to office.
You can say that Alabamians deserve the poor governance that results from electing leaders who prioritize baseless rage. But this is too simplistic. Most Alabamians aren’t going to the polls. Just 37% of eligible voters cast ballots in the 2022 election. The number of registered voters in Alabama who sat out the 2024 presidential election (1.8 million) was larger than Trump’s vote total in the state (1.46 million).
Some of that nonparticipation comes from the obstacles Republicans have thrown up to voting in recent years. But a good part of it stems from a lack of choices and a feeling that casting a ballot is pointless. The profoundly pathetic campaigns of 2022 — with Democrats struggling to outraise Libertarians and Republicans bullying immigrants and transgender youth — certainly gave Alabamians reasons to sit the election out.
That’s where the opportunity for Alabama Democrats lies. Not in peeling off Republican votes, which seems unlikely. Democrats have to pull those alienated voters back to the polls. To restore their faith in voting as a positive act. And to accept the Democrats as a viable vehicle for governance.
It’s a lot to ask for a party that’s still trying to find its feet in the state. All too often, a vote for a Democrat feels like a waste in a solidly red state.
But the path to an Alabama government that actually reflects the needs of the state — whatever party it may be — means pulling the disaffected voters back into the process. And taking it back from those who use the ballot as a cudgel.
Otherwise, we’ll keep our miserable disconnect between what Alabamians want and what state government gives them.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Huntsville-voters-for-Nov-8-2024-story.jpg,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How will CDC vaccine schedule changes affect CT residents?,Laura Tillman and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/cdc-vaccine-schedule-changes-ct/,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced updates to its recommendations for childhood vaccines. Here's what to know.,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced updates to its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Jan. 5. In the aftermath, Connecticut elected officials have been communicating the implications to the public, including assuring parents who may be confused about how the changes affect their child’s scheduled vaccinations.
Here’s what to know about the changes and how they impact the way vaccinations are done and paid for in Connecticut.
What changes were made to the CDC’s childhood vaccine recommendations?
At the end of 2024, the CDC’s childhood vaccination schedule recommended 17 immunizations for all children. On Jan. 5, that changed to 11 broadly recommended vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV), and chickenpox. 
Some vaccines are recommended to high risk groups: RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, two types of bacterial meningitis, and dengue. Finally, the CDC says that for children who are not high risk, the decision as to whether to administer vaccines for rotavirus, COVID, the flu, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and bacterial meningitis should be left up to “shared clinical decision-making,” or conversations between people and their doctors. 
The CDC’s recommendations are not requirements and families have a choice as to whether they continue to follow the previous vaccine schedule, the new recommendations, or some combination of the two.
Why were these changes made? 
Major changes to leadership have been made over the past year at the Department of Health and Human Services, including to the panel of experts that provides recommendations on vaccines. Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr has long promoted views that cast doubt on the safety of vaccines. He has also advanced the idea that vaccines are linked to climbing autism rates, although the majority of health experts say there is no proven link between vaccines and autism. 
In December, President Donald Trump directed HHS to align the childhood vaccine schedule with peer advice and the schedule of other developed countries. The new recommendations are more closely aligned with Denmark’s schedule, according to HHS, but U.S. experts say the comparison is misguided since the two countries have little in common when it comes to the spread of preventable diseases like hepatitis B.
How have Connecticut officials responded? 
Connecticut Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani, along with other public health officials, have affirmed that Connecticut’s vaccine recommendations have not changed. That means children must be fully up to date on the Connecticut vaccine schedule to enroll in public school, a list identical to the previous federal schedule. 
No religious exemptions are allowed; only medical exemptions via a certificate from a health care provider allow children enrolled in Connecticut public schools to forgo vaccines.
Will my insurance still pay for childhood vaccinations that are no longer recommended by the CDC? 
In short, yes. In a fact sheet published recently, the federal government clarified that, despite the recommendation changes, all vaccines would continue to be available to anyone who wants them through Affordable Care Act plans, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Vaccines for Children program. 
“Families will not have to purchase them out of pocket. Among peer nations, the U.S. will continue to offer the most childhood vaccines for free to those who want them,” stated the fact sheet.
Interim state insurance commissioner Josh Hershman reiterated this message to Connecticut residents on Jan. 6. 
“The vaccines referenced in the CDC announcement were not removed from the immunization schedule. Instead, they were moved from a routine recommendation to clinical decision-making recommendation,” Hershman stated. “Because these vaccines remain on the CDC schedule, they continue to be covered by health insurance plans regulated by the CID.”
However, KFF Health News has reported that because the CDC has changed its recommendation for the HPV vaccine from two doses to one, insurance companies are no longer required to cover the second dose. 
Why does it matter if the CDC changes its recommendations?
According to health care professionals, including Juthani, the changes to the vaccine schedule have a number of concerning repercussions. For one, some of the vaccines  that are no longer recommended by the CDC can prevent diseases that cause serious illness and even death.
There are also concerns, officials say, that the motivations for changing the schedule are misguided and based on bad science. 
While all 17 vaccines are still required for students enrolled in Connecticut public schools, some families outside of that system may opt-out. As federal authorities and states diverge on their recommendations, communities may see a resurgence of preventable illnesses like hepatitis B, which is easily spread through bodily fluids. “Remember all 17 of these diseases are worth protecting your child against,” Juthani said at a press conference on Jan. 12.
“We really don’t need to go backwards,” said Dr. Robert Dudley, a longtime pediatrician of the Community Health Center of New Britain, recalling a serious RSV season he saw at the beginning of his career. “We don’t want to see those days, nothing made me happier than seeing a vaccine come out that mothers could take, infants could take, people over 50 could take to keep them from getting this horrible disease.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24248694401334-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Two Democrats who joined the state Assembly last week are the first in decades to represent Hudson County without the backing of the powerful party organization.
Assembly members Ravi Bhalla and Katie Brennan ran for the Assembly last June in a six-person race that saw them defeating two opponents who had the support of the Hudson County Democratic Organization and one incumbent assemblywoman. They cruised to victory in November in the largely Democratic 32nd Legislative District, which includes Hoboken and parts of Jersey City.
Bhalla and Brennan say they’re focused on addressing issues like housing and transparency, rather than playing party politics.
“At the end of the day, we’re all Democrats. I want to be a team player, and I want to make sure that we can work together to advance common objectives,” said Bhalla.
Union County Democrats who flipped GOP Assembly seats eye affordability

The district is represented in the state Senate by Sen. Raj Mukherji, a Democrat who backed two of Bhalla’s and Brennan’s opponents in last June’s primary. Bhalla and Brennan say they’ve put the primary in the rearview mirror and already have several initiatives they want to work on with Mukherji, including his plans to reintroduce two immigrant protection bills that were vetoed last week by outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy.
“We’re all adults, and we’ve all had jobs. Sometimes you don’t agree with people. Sometimes it’s rough,” Brennan said. “I, believe it or not, don’t relish being a kind of flamethrower. I really just want to get things done, and I think that Raj is ready to work with us on that.”
Mukherji called Bhalla and Brennan both “intellectuals,” and said the three have the potential to be one of the strongest delegations in the Legislature.
“The world has changed so much since the politics of a primary a year ago. Our democracy is in a state of disrepair,” Mukherji said.

Bhalla is an attorney who was elected Hoboken mayor in 2017 after previously serving on the city’s council for two terms. He’s garnered national attention for the square-mile city’s Vision Zero project, which has resulted in zero pedestrian deaths since 2017.
He said his first priority now is economic justice for marginalized communities. He wants to explore whether the state could provide a guaranteed basic income, create more incentives to boost the construction of affordable housing, and build more resilient climate infrastructure across the Garden State.
For years, storms in Hudson County meant widespread flooding in Hoboken, and Bhalla says that through resiliency projects, flooding risks have been reduced so they are weeks or months apart now instead of days.
“That’s done through innovation, and that innovation can be applied through other parts of the state,” he said.

Brennan is bringing a different background to the Golden Dome in Trenton. A Jersey City resident, she built her career in housing policy and previously worked at the state Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. She’s also been an advocate for survivors of sexual assault.
In 2018, she went public with claims that she was raped by a fellow member of Murphy’s campaign team and that the campaign and state officials failed to properly investigate her case. During the primary last year, one of her campaign ads said she would “turn my experience into our results.”
Brennan said she, like Bhalla, wants to back housing initiatives in the Assembly. The two have already worked on a bill that would call for a statewide right to counsel for housing issues, and they plan to tackle “unconscionable” rent increases. She also wants to beef up transit, particularly in South Jersey.
Brennan called herself a “proud progressive” in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, but said her experience in government agencies has also led her to be practical.
“I think there is a mandate that everybody has now of recognizing the need for affordability. And voters in general — they just want to see stuff get done,” she said. “I know that words matter, things being funded matters, and it matters how it’s being implemented.”

Chad Gibbs, College of Charleston
Joe Engel was and remains an icon in Charleston, South Carolina. Born in Zakroczym, Poland, he survived Auschwitz and several other concentration camps and fought with the resistance before landing on American shores as a refugee in 1949.
After retirement from his dry-cleaning business, Engel focused his later years on Holocaust education.
As part of these efforts, he took to sitting on downtown park benches wearing a name tag that read “Joe Engel, Holocaust Survivor: Ask me questions” — becoming the city’s first public memorial to the victims of Nazi genocide.
Knowing he would not be here to impart his message forever, Engel and his friend and fellow survivor Pincus Kolender led a drive to install the permanent memorial that now stands in Charleston’s Marion Square park.
In 2021, I moved to the city to take up my role as a professor and director of Holocaust studies at the College of Charleston. I arrived just in time to meet Engel and to teach many local students who had met him.
He died the following year, at age 95.
For years, historians, educators and Jewish groups have been considering how to teach about the Holocaust after the survivors have passed on. Few of today’s college students have ever met a Holocaust survivor.
Those who have likely met a child survivor, with few personal memories before 1945. American veterans of the war are almost entirely unknown to our present students; many know nothing of their own family connections to World War II.
Time marches on, distance grows, and what we call “common knowledge” changes.
One alarming study from 2018 revealed that 45% of American adults could not identify a single one of the over 40,000 Nazi camps and ghettos, while 41% of younger Americans believe that Nazi Germany killed substantially less than 6 million Jews during the Holocaust.
According to a 2025 study by the Claims Conference, there are somewhat more than 200,000 survivors still alive, though their median age is 87. It is sadly expected that 7 in 10 will pass away within the next decade.
With their absence near, how can educators and community members bring this history home, decreasing the perceived distance between the students of today and the lessons of the Holocaust?
Bringing history home
One method that shows promise is helping students realize the connections of their own home and their own time to a genocide that might seem far away — both on the map and in the mind.
A letter dated Dec. 27, 1938, sent from Malie Landsmann to her cousin Minnie Tewel Baum of South Carolina. (Photo courtesy of the Jewish Heritage Collection, Addlestone Library, College of Charleston)
In classes on the Holocaust, I now use a set of letters sent by a family of Polish Jews to their relatives in Camden, South Carolina.
The letters themselves are powerful sources demonstrating the increasing desperation of Malie Landsmann, the main writer. In 1938, she reached out to her cousin Minnie Tewel Baum, seeking help to escape Adolf Hitler’s Germany.
Even though the two had never met, Minnie tried everything to help her cousin and her family.
In the end, however, she was not successful.
American immigration barriers and murderous Nazi policy took their toll, with Malie, her husband, Chaim, and their two children, Ida and Peppi, all killed at Auschwitz.
These haunting letters demonstrate the connections of the war to small-town South Carolina. They give the Holocaust a real human face and a connection to places students know.
Letter collections like these are not rare. The College of Charleston holds a second, far larger group of letters, the Helen Stern Lipton Papers, which runs to over 170 pages of correspondence between family members in South Carolina, German-occupied Europe, Russia and even Central Asia.
When I was a doctorate student, I participated in classes using the Sara Spira postcards sent from a series of ghettos in Poland to rural Wisconsin. Further archives exist all over the United States. Most communities have connections to the Holocaust, whether via artifacts, people with direct ties or both.
The important thing is to teach in ways that can break down the mental barriers created by time and space. It is indeed the same reason that the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum created a traveling exhibit called “Auschwitz. Not Long Ago. Not Far Away.”
Learning from descendants
As teachers and professors attempt to bridge these divides, they often invite the descendants of Holocaust survivors to their classes to speak.
Descendants can retell the stories of their parents’ or ancestors’ perseverance and survival, but what is more important is their ability to put a human face on these events and show how they remain relevant in the lives of so many.

I take these short visits a step further in a class where students train as oral history interviewers, then conduct recorded conversations with a descendant of survivors.
These meetings encourage discussion of family Holocaust history, but only after the student asks the descendant about how they learned about what happened to their parent, grandparent or great-grandparent, and how this might have weighed on their own life years after the war.
This is truly the point here. The most impactful parts of these recordings are almost always the discussions of legacies, of how the families that students meet still live with the enormity of Holocaust trauma.
When a descendant tells students about the past, that is important. But when a descendant speaks of what that past means for them, their family and their community, that is so much more.
Students gain firsthand knowledge of intergenerational trauma; the difficulties of rebuilding; the prevalence of anxiety, worry and depression in survivor homes; and so much more.
All of this shows students in no uncertain ways how the Holocaust still has bearing on the lives of people in our communities.
History after memory: a path forward
What’s most heartening about these methods and their successes is what they reveal about what today’s students value.

In the age of artificial intelligence, Big Tech and omnipresent social media, I believe it is still — and maybe even more than ever — the real human connection.
Students are drawn in by the local connections and open up to the stories of real people, brought to them in person. Often, they launch their own research to better understand the letters.
One of my students even helped turn them into classroom materials, now used well beyond our own college.
Another did the painstaking work to have four new Stolpersteine, or Stumbling Stone, memorials installed in Berlin to commemorate the Landsmann family.
Never having witnessed them myself, I can only imagine the impact of Joe Engel’s conversations on those park benches in downtown Charleston.
Nothing will ever truly replace the voices of the survivors, but I believe teachers and communities can carry on his work by making history feel local and personal.
As everything around us seems to show each day, little could be more important than the lessons of these people, their sources and the Holocaust.

Homeowners received higher deductions, but businesses — especially those with substantial personal property — saw significant reductions in tax liability.  
Let’s compare the two. A family who owns a $400,000 house would see a $300 cut, the maximum, each year. A business that owns $400,000 worth of personal property would see their taxes cut by $12,000 a year.  
In the short run, these changes might be popular. In the long run, however, they will likely weaken municipal governments across the state and undermine the very economic growth the law was meant to encourage.
Property taxes are not simply another revenue source. They are the primary funding mechanism for local government in Indiana. Police and fire protection, street maintenance, parks, libraries, and much of public education depend on property tax revenue. When those revenues fall, local governments do not gain new efficiencies by default; they lose capacity.
SEA 1 reduces assessed values and effective tax rates across much of the property tax base. While the legislation phases in these changes, the cumulative effect is substantial. Cities and towns will collect significantly less revenue over the coming decade, even after accounting for modest economic growth. This is not speculative. Local fiscal officers across Indiana have already projected sizable structural deficits as the law takes effect.










While homeowners receive modest, broadly distributed relief, the most dramatic change are sweeping business tax cuts.


– Michael Hicks


The design of SEA 1 matters. While homeowners receive modest, broadly distributed relief, the most dramatic change are sweeping business tax cuts. In many communities, this removes a large share of the commercial tax base entirely. The result is a sharp decline in taxable value that cannot be offset by growth alone.
Supporters of the law argue that local governments can replace lost revenue through local income taxes. That option exists, but it is far from costless. Local income taxes are paid by workers, not property owners, and they are far more sensitive to economic cycles. Communities with slower job growth or lower incomes will struggle to raise sufficient revenue, even at higher rates. Others will simply choose not to increase taxes, forcing cuts instead.
These tradeoffs are not evenly distributed. Large cities with diverse tax bases may absorb some of the loss. Small cities and towns cannot. For many rural and mid-sized communities, even modest revenue reductions translate into fewer police officers, delayed infrastructure maintenance, or closed public facilities. Over time, those cuts accumulate.
The economic consequences of this erosion are well-documented. Public safety, infrastructure quality, and school performance are among the strongest predictors of local economic growth. Businesses do not locate in places with crumbling roads, understaffed emergency services, or struggling schools simply because taxes are low. They locate where public services are reliable and labor markets are strong.
Indiana school leaders warn property tax reforms are destabilizing public education budgets

The fallout of this will happen fairly soon. I expect close to 100 municipal governments will declare fiscal emergencies because personnel cuts will be so dramatic. But, there is a grimly humorous side of this. The number of Indiana local government employees is near a record low, and lower than in every year before 2020 for which we have data.  
This brings us to education. While the state now provides most operating funding for K-12 schools, property taxes still play a critical role in capital projects and transportation. Reduced local revenue means deferred maintenance, fewer facility upgrades, and growing disparities between districts. Over time, this affects workforce quality—Indiana’s most important long-term economic asset.
The lesson here is not that tax relief is inherently harmful. Indiana’s earlier property tax reforms succeeded because they were paired with stable replacement revenues and realistic assessments of local fiscal capacity. SEA 1 breaks from that tradition. It cuts deeply into the local tax base without providing a durable, statewide mechanism to replace what is lost.
Fiscal policy is ultimately about tradeoffs. Lower property taxes today mean fewer public services tomorrow. If those services are central to economic growth—and they are—then the policy choice becomes clearer. Indiana has managed to a few hundred dollars per household in the short run at the cost of weaker communities and slower growth in the years ahead.
The second grimly funny aspect of this is that with these lopsided property tax cuts, local governments are going to have to raise local income taxes.  SEA1 was hastily put together, and relied so heavily on a study that favored business interest over objective fact.  The result was a huge business tax cut that will almost surely cause an overall tax increase for most families.  
Hoosier families need to think long and hard about the fallout of SEA1, and have some frank conversations with both businesses and legislators about the state’s future.

Pictured: capture and storage facilities in Bergen, Norway, on Dec. 16, 2024. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images)Hoosier leaders plan to take over federal review of a pipeline of contentious projects to inject carbon dioxide deep underground.
Nine applications for Indiana sites are before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to an agency tracker of Class VI permits.
They’re one of six classes of wells the EPA regulates under an Underground Injection Control program, for substances like oil, gas and now, the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide.
CO2 capture and storage proposals have faced intense local opposition in Indiana.
‘Too many unknowns’: As company forges on with carbon sequestration project, residents mobilize

A bill under consideration by the Indiana General Assembly would require the Department of Natural Resources’ autonomous board to seek primary enforcement authority over Class VI wells. House Bill 1368 also outlines a state-level regulatory scheme.
“Wherever you stand on sequestration … First of all, we want to keep Indiana competitive, bring in business and jobs,” said Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso.
“Second of all, we want to be prepared to pivot with whatever happens in Washington, because Washington has been like a pendulum on a clock and it’s bouncing off the sides,” he said.
Soliday, the bill’s author, spoke during a committee hearing last week that featured enthusiastic industry testimony.
But some skeptics fear the state isn’t fully equipped to carry it out.
Primacy’s popularity
Six states already hold primary enforcement authority for Class VI wells, according to an EPA table: Arizona, Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.
“They have to demonstrate that they will administer the program up to the standards that EPA, the federal government, would do it,” said Janet McCabe, a visiting professor at Indiana University and a former EPA deputy administrator.
An increasing number of states are considering joining.


As of October, Alaska was involved in primacy pre-application activities, while Colorado was working on proposed rulemaking, per an EPA graphic. Six others were in pre-application to revise their programs to include Class VI primacy: Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah.
Some successful Class VI applications took months, while others took years.
“Procedurally, it would follow the same steps” as other well types, McCabe said, “but how the wells would be used would dictate the kind of information that you would need.”
“If you’re going to be using a well to extract oil and gas, people have been doing that for years … and that’s a relatively straightforward and well-understood process,” she continued. “But storing CO2 underground is new, the technology is new. It just hasn’t been done as much. And there are all kinds of other questions that come into play.”
Timelines, proximity
One Indiana project has already obtained a Class VI permit: Wabash Valley Resources, which plans to produce ammonia fertilizer at a a former coal gasification plant — and pump the emissions underground. It’s a pilot with its own state laws and rules.
Others want in, too.
Sequestration would allow ethanol producers, for instance, to “fulfil(l) global and domestic demand for cleaner fuels,” said Tim Phelps, a lobbyist with Hathaway Strategies, who represented the Indiana Ethanol Producers Association in committee.
“While thorough review is vital to the public interest,” he said, the application process under the EPA has been “inconsistent,” causing “significant delays.”
“We are supportive of initiatives which seek to streamline this permitting process, to allow these projects — which involve significant investments of time and capital — to come to fruition,” Phelps said.
Association member POET, which bills itself as the world’s largest producer of bioethanol, is pursing Class VI permits at each of its five Indiana plants.

“We … support any effort to streamline permitting timelines,” said Hamilton Smith, a lobbyist for Ice Miller representing POET.
DNR has also made the case for pace.
“By accepting primacy for Class VI permitting, Indiana will be best positioned to work with all stakeholders to ensure that applications are reviewed with speed and efficiency, following all federal and state regulations,” spokesman Marty Benson said. 
“Instead of relying upon an out-of-state regulator, questions can be addressed by DNR staff in Indiana,” he added — an argument industry leaders echoed.
“Generally, we prefer working with DNR,” said Mark Shublak, a Taft law firm partner representing fuel company CountryMark.
He cited familiarity with the agency’s handling of oil and gas wells, hopes staff would process applications “timely,” and accessibility to “Indiana market participants.”
Home ties also played into DNR General Counsel Stephanie Flittner’s testimony.
Primacy would “ensur(e) these decisions are made in Indiana — closer to Indiana geology, Indiana communities and Indiana stakeholders,” she said.
Trust, resources
Others are skeptical of a switch.
Kerwin Olson, the executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said his ratepayer advocacy organization and peers think agencies like DNR can be too lax.
“Us and many others have sort of viewed Indiana environmental authorities as, you know, nothing more than pay-to-play sort of permit-issuing agencies,” he said. They worry the “streamlined” timeline a firm may seek could come at a cost.

“There’s a reason for that bureaucracy, those regulations, because there’s significant risk with these commercial facilities, and a thorough review with expertise is a good thing,” Olson said.
That’s not to say he had the utmost confidence in even the EPA.
“There’s permits that have been issued that we thought never should have been issued,” he said. “So I don’t know that it’s that we have any more confidence, per se, in outcomes at the EPA … but it’s a matter of staffing levels, expertise, resources, time.”
DNR’s Benson said staff “do not anticipate a fiscal impact” from running a Class VI program, noting the agency already has primacy for oil and gas wells. He also cited that experience in defending personnel “expertise and professionalism.”

According to the Census Reporter, there are roughly 3.7 million people living in the metro area and there may already be 3,000 militarized federal agents occupying our city. An additional 1,500 active duty troops from the army’s 11th Airborne Division are on standby, ready for deployment to Minnesota. 
Let’s put that in perspective. During the last year of his first term, President Trump negotiated a full withdrawal from Afghanistan, which at the time was a nation of 39 million people, to be completed in early 2021. In 2019, there were between 12,000 and 13,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. At the start of the Biden administration, there were only 2,500 U.S. soldiers remaining there. 
I say this because the Trump administration has decided to send more armed federal agents to the Twin Cities than Joe Biden inherited in Afghanistan. That’s too many armed federal agents under any circumstances. 
Two U.S. citizens have already been killed who would be alive today absent the occupation. Many U.S. citizens have been detained and physically abused, and many more such instances have been endured by legally authorized immigrants. 
We are about to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The Founders of the United States were intensely suspicious of standing armies in peace time. If they were British citizens, the colonists asked, why were the Red Coats stationed in Boston? They included, among their reasons for dissolving their ties to King George, the following:
“He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.”  
In 1787, at the Constitutional Convention, future President James Madison made the following observation: 
“A standing military force, with an overgrown executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.” 
It was clear to the nation’s Founders that federal forces were meant to fight foreign enemies and defend the United States from other nations. Among their first actions after the end of the Revolutionary War was to disband the Continental Army. Federal forces were never meant to occupy American cities and rural areas. 
Some might suggest that the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States constitute a foreign invasion. Hogwash. The undocumented here come from many nations and arrived for as many reasons. It was not and is not an organized foreign invasion. 
U.S. federal forces are meant to protect us from foreign threats, not to occupy the streets and farms of America in unmarked cars and wearing masks and picking up people without judicial warrants based on how they look, or speak, or what neighborhood they live in, or how they get to work, or where they work. 
What is happening in Minnesota is un-American. It would make the Founders wonder what has become of their project. After 250 years, we now resemble the British more than we do the Patriots, except the Red Coats had the courage to show their faces.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-113858681.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Majority Democrats in the state Legislature are pushing changes they say will restore integrity to Washington’s venerable initiative process.
Opponents contend the moves will effectively block residents’ direct path to the ballot to pass laws of their own making.
Bills introduced in the House and Senate would bar paying a person for each signature they collect. And they would allow legal action against those suspected of violations.
The legislation also would add a new step at the front end of the process by requiring a person, at the time they fill out paperwork and pay the fee for an initiative, to also submit signatures of 1,000 registered voters as a show of support for a proposed measure. 
The debate, which played out in Senate and House committees last week, appears to be a byproduct of Democrats’ and their allies’ vexation with Let’s Go Washington and its multi-millionaire founder Brian Heywood.
Two years ago, the conservative political group, largely underwritten with Heywood’s money, sent six initiatives to the Legislature, each aiming to repeal or revise a major policy enacted into law by Democrats over the objections of Republicans.
Two more dealing with parental rights and transgender athletes are on track to reach the ballot this year. Democratic leaders say they won’t hold hearings on this year’s measures.
Sen. Javier Valdez, D-Seattle, said he drew up Senate Bill 5973 out of concern that this form of direct democracy has been co-opted by big money interests.
“Anyone with enough money to bankroll their way through the initiative qualifying process can force statewide votes on any issue that’s personal to them,” he said at a hearing on the bill in the Senate Committee on State Government, Tribal Affairs and Elections. Valdez is the committee chair.
The allure of making money for each signature incentivizes gatherers to use “aggressive, misleading tactics” to pad their totals to boost their compensation, he said.
Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma, sponsor of the House legislation, said initiatives are a powerful tool of the citizenry and the bill is about making the initiative process “more perfect.” 
“It is more important to me that the initiative process remains accessible to members of the community to exercise their power and their voice,” she said at a public hearing of the House State Government and Tribal Relations Committee that she chairs. 
Former Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican, denounced the legislation as a “voter suppression bill.” 
“It’s an attempt to make it even more difficult for citizens to participate in the government process. You’re doing this because you think there’s fraud? Frankly, you’re wrong,” he said.
Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, opposes the legislation, saying it would further burden those pursuing an initiative.
He told lawmakers he’s responded to concerns about frivolous filings with steps like hiking the fee to $156 from $5. If there’s concern with misbehaving signature gatherers, increase penalties for breaking the law, he said.
On Friday, the Senate committee advanced Valdez’s bill on a 4-3 party-line vote. Before the vote, they removed the requirement for 1,000 signatures for referendums, which send bills approved by the Legislature to the ballot.
Republican senators offered 12 amendments, most seeking to remove the requirement for pre-filed signatures or prescribe limits on citizens taking legal action over alleged violations. They did not oppose the ban on paying by signature. Democrats rejected them all.
“Basically, I hate this bill with a passion,” said Sen. Phil Fortunato, R-Auburn, author of half the amendments.
Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Tukwila, teetered but said that while he didn’t like the mandate for providing 1,000 signatures upfront, removing the potential issues created with the pay-per-signature method needs addressing.
“I hate raising barriers to the (initiative) process but I think getting money out of politics is the most important thing right now,” he said, before voting for the bill.
Let’s Go Washington’s Heywood told the Senate panel that because Democrats have been unable to deter or derail the group’s endeavors, they came up with this bill to “destroy the process.”
There’s no evidence of fraud with signature-gatherers, he said. “We have no incentive to pay for invalid signatures because it’s wasted money.”
House Bill 2259, sponsored by Mena, received a hearing last Wednesday. No date for a committee vote has been announced.
Checking addresses
This isn’t the only Democrat-sponsored bill targeting the initiative process.
House Bill 2260 would add a requirement for individuals gathering signatures to sign each petition they submit.
It also directs the Secretary of State’s Office to verify that the residence address listed by the person signing a petition matches the address on their voter registration. Adding this chore will nearly halve the number of signatures verified per hour, according to the secretary of state.
At a hearing Wednesday, supporters said the bill will provide much-needed accountability for signature collection. Opponents, including Hobbs and Reed, said it could lead to petitions getting tossed out simply because a legal voter moved at some point after signing.
As part of the verification process, the state does a 3% random sample of submitted signatures for accuracy. Address verification would be added to that process, so not every submitted signature will need to be checked.
A fiscal analysis projects it will cost $3 million this budget and $4.78 million in future bienniums to pay for added staff and equipment.
This bill has not been scheduled for a committee vote and there is currently no companion bill in the Senate.
Hundreds of thousands of signatures are required to qualify either an initiative to the Legislature or one for the ballot. Work is now underway to verify signatures and certify two Let’s Go Washington-sponsored measures for this fall’s election. 
Supporters turned in 30,717 pages of petitions containing 418,666 signatures for IL26-001 focused on parental rights, the secretary of state’s office reported. There were 32,078 pages and 444,434 signatures for IL26-638 to bar transgender athletes from girls’ sports.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Texas supplied the most new residents of any U.S. state for Mississippi and eight other states, despite having the biggest population growth this decade, according to newly released figures from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Texas was the top source of new residents for Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Oklahoma, according to the 2024 state-to-state migration flows, which track where someone lived in the previous year and where they currently live. The Census Bureau released the numbers last week.
With 31 million residents, Texas ranks second in population among U.S. states. Between 2020 and 2024, Texas gained 2.1 million people.
“The obvious and primary answer is size,” said Dudley Poston, professor emeritus of sociology at Texas A&M University. “There’s got to be more people leaving Texas than leaving other states because of the population size of Texas.”
Thousands of Mississippians are also migrating to Texas. Roughly 5,500 people moved from Hinds County, Mississippi, to the Lone Star State from 2017 to 2022, according to Internal Revenue Service data analyzed by researcher Jake McGraw at Rethink Mississippi. McGraw, who conducted the analysis for Mississippi Today, said Dallas and Houston were the top destinations for the relocating Mississippians. 
Other large producers of residents who moved to other states included the nation’s other most populous states: California, Florida and New York.
California, the most populous U.S. state with 39 million residents, supplied the most new residents to the western states of Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Washington. But it also was the top supplier of domestic residents to Tennessee, home to Nashville, which has established a pipeline to Southern California’s entertainment industry.
Florida, the third most populous U.S. state with 23 million residents, dominated the number of new residents in the southeast states of Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina but also Ohio. Florida has gained 1.8 million residents this decade, the second most of any state.
Although the Sunshine State’s size played a primary role, other factors may be involved too, such as Florida’s escalating real estate and homeowners’ insurance prices and the more plentiful job opportunities for recent college graduates in cities like Atlanta and Charlotte, according to Richard Doty, a research demographer at the University of Florida.
“It is no longer as affordable a relocation/ retirement option as it once was,” Doty said in an email.
New York was the top source of new residents in Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts and New Jersey, while Illinois provided the most new residents for Midwestern neighbors Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin.
“The states with the largest out-migration numbers — California, Florida, Texas, and New York — are also the states with the largest populations. That’s not a coincidence,” said Helen You, interim director of the Texas Demographic Center. “Large populations naturally generate large volumes of both in-and-out migrants.”
Some migration patterns were no real surprises, such as former Massachusetts residents being the biggest source of new Mainers, New Hampshirites, Rhode Islanders and Vermonters. Former Wisconsinites made up the largest number of new Minnesotans, and former North Carolinians were the biggest source of new South Carolina residents.
In most states in 2024, before the immigration crackdown of the second Trump administration, people arriving from a foreign country were the top source of new residents. Among the exceptions, where international migration wasn’t large compared to people moving from individual U.S. states, were Idaho, Kansas, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/23182418/AP26022521514192.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

But the 10-member caucus appears to have coalesced around a simple two-pronged strategy: absolute opposition to increasing the sales tax and a willingness to slow the Senate to a crawl (Getty Images).Let’s talk about how the first three weeks of Missouri’s legislative session are going.
In short: Gridlock in the Senate. Scandal in the House.
Senate Democrats entered the year divided after a contentious leadership fight. But the 10-member caucus appears to have coalesced around a simple two-pronged strategy: absolute opposition to increasing the sales tax and a willingness to slow the Senate to a crawl.
Normally, opposing tax increases would put Democrats squarely on Republican turf. This year, it’s the Republican governor pushing a plan that would move Missouri away from income taxes and toward higher sales taxes — a change Democrats argue would shift the tax burden onto the working poor.
Democrats have also taken aim at the Senate’s pace. So far, they have delayed the only official business the chamber has attempted this year, twice filibustering to block votes on gubernatorial appointments.
Part of the obstruction is payback. Last year, Republicans invoked a rarely used rule four times to cut off debate and push through bills repealing expanded paid sick leave, gerrymandering the state’s congressional map, changing the initiative petition process, and reimposing an abortion ban.
But Democrats are also using the gridlock to argue that the GOP supermajority has been moving too fast and making costly mistakes. A handful of examples have become staples of Democratic filibusters.
A wildly inaccurate cost estimate for legislation eliminating the capital gains tax. A Kansas City precinct placed in two different congressional districts in the gerrymandered map. A $250 million mistake in state budget estimates released earlier this month. Drafting errors in two different income tax cut proposals.
What happens next? If Democrats don’t stand down, the nominees will either have to be withdrawn by early next month or face being barred from holding those appointments for life.
Republicans aren’t naïve. They knew a smooth session was unlikely after last year. How they choose to break the logjam remains an open question.
Meanwhile, in the Missouri House, an overwhelming bipartisan majority voted last week to punish Democratic state Rep. Jeremy Dean for obscene text messages he sent to Republican Rep. Cecelie Williams.
Only 10 Democrats voted against sanctions: Doug Clemons, Aaron Crossley, Anthony Ealy, Elizabeth Fuchs, Jeff Hales, Kerri Ingle, Ian Mackey, Ray Reed, Del Taylor and Wick Thomas.
The punishment includes removal from committees, mandatory sexual harassment training and a requirement that Dean stay at least 50 feet away from Williams.
In a short speech before the vote, Williams said the sanctions did not go far enough, noting that at any other job “a message like that would be grounds for immediate termination, no questions asked.”
Dean, she said, targeted her despite knowing her history as a domestic abuse survivor. His apology was half-hearted, deflective and lacked true accountability.
“He knew my story, he knew my past, he knew my pain and he chose to exploit it anyway,” Williams said.
In the days leading up to the vote, there was talk that some GOP lawmakers would push for expulsion. But Republican leadership quietly worked behind the scenes to tamp that down.
Expulsion is rare in Missouri’s legislature, reserved for extraordinary circumstances, such as after the Civil War for disloyalty to the Union and, in 2021, for credible allegations of sexual and physical abuse of children.
Concerns about escalation also played a role. Push for expulsion, and Democrats might start scrolling through their phones and sharing messages they’ve received from GOP lawmakers.
The logic of mutually assured destruction, it seems, was enough to end any serious talk of expulsion.

Children’s Division, the section of the state’s social services department responsible for foster care and investigating child abuse and neglect, has also had seven directors since 2018 — and during that time faced intense scrutiny from state lawmakers for failing to report missing foster children and boarding foster children in hospitals because there was nowhere else for them to go.
As Gov. Mike Kehoe proposes cutting $600 million in general revenue expenditures to address a dwindling surplus and declining revenues, the Missouri Department of Social Services is not seeking funding for additional Children’s Division staff from state lawmakers.
“Our current focus is maximizing the resources we have — ensuring team members are supported, cases are managed effectively and staff have the tools they need to perform their jobs well,” said department spokesperson Baylee Watts in an email to The Independent.
The department requested, and Kehoe recommended, the same number of full time equivalent positions for division field staff in fiscal year 2027 as it received for the current fiscal year.
Meanwhile, state lawmakers have filed an array of bills designed to address what they say are lingering problems in the division. While the sponsors of those bills hesitated to recommend additional spending, other lawmakers and advocates cautioned against imposing standards that the division might not be able to meet without more frontline workers.
 Staffing challenges

Former caseworkers who spoke with The Independent in 2022 reported having up to 80 active cases — a workload that contributed to their decisions to leave the division. One former caseworker described the job as “impossible” and said that during the three years she spent training new caseworkers, most quit within four months.
Democratic State Rep. Keri Ingle of Lee’s Summit, a former Children’s Division investigator, said “there is nothing more stressful” than carrying the responsibility of a child’s safety and wondering if you missed something important when visiting a child’s home.
Investigators are required to make contact with a child within 24 hours of a hotline report of possible abuse or neglect.
“You’ll wake up at one o’clock in the morning and think, ‘I should have looked in that room’…or, ‘I’ve got to go make a phone call,’ or ‘I’ve got to go run out at seven o’clock in the morning and try to find this other kid,” Ingle said.
Staff turnover rates have improved in both the division and the wider department, though frontline staff continue to be the most likely to leave. 
Throughout the department, turnover stood at 30% at the end of fiscal year 2025, Watts said in an email to The Independent. The turnover rate in September 2022 was 35%.
‘This job is impossible’: High turnover, low morale plague Missouri child welfare agency

 
Turnover among frontline division staff, which include investigators, foster care case managers and hotline workers, was 40% at the end of fiscal year 2025. That’s down from 55% in September 2022. But it still means over a third of frontline staff working in the division at the beginning of the last fiscal year were gone a year later. 
Lawmakers last year approved a 1% pay increase for Children’s Division workers, on top of Kehoe’s plan giving state workers a 1% pay raise for every two years of service. 
Watts said the department is using savings from past vacancies in the division to establish specialized investigator positions with higher salaries. Watts said the positions “help reduce overall workload for frontline team members while offering additional support on challenging cases.”
There were 79 vacancies across the division as of the end of November, Watts said.
But entry-level salaries for frontline workers are still low. The starting salary for an associate social services specialist in the division is $44,630 and $48,509 for a social services specialist, Watts said.
 Proposed solutions

Some lawmakers don’t think these efforts are enough.
Republican state Rep. Ann Kelley of Lamar said that throughout her tenure on the House Children and Families Committee, she’s found it’s not uncommon for division workers to have 30 to 40 open cases. 
“That is just insane,” Kelley said in an interview with The Independent. “They can’t handle that. You cannot give the amount of care, the [necessary] amount of time to a child when you have that many cases.”
A bill filed by Kelley would limit division case workers to 20 active cases at a time.
Current caseload data was not immediately available from the department. But quarterly reports from the department show that the division is falling short of some of its own standards of service to kids and parents in the child welfare system.
Division policy requires that parents have at least one visit per month with their child in the division’s care, unless a court prohibits meetings. An evaluation team established after the passage of a 2020 state law on foster care set a goal of each county complying with this policy 60% of the time. Between April and June 2025, no more than 6% of counties met this goal, according to an October 2025 report.
The division also struggled to meet policies of one meeting per month between caseworkers and each of a child’s parents. Between July and September 2025, no more than 38% of counties met a goal of adhering to this policy 50% of the time, according to a January report.
Kelley said that addressing high caseloads would require the division to hire more staff.
“They’re going to have to hire more people,” Kelley said. “That’s just what they’re going to have to do.”
Kelley said that although lawmakers and the state’s social services department should explore options that would not require additional appropriations, lowering caseloads would likely mean setting aside money for additional hires.
“Yes, it’s going to be an issue,” Kelley said of the need for additional funding. “But for so long, we have passed it down, passed the buck, and nothing has changed. And so we’ve got to put money where our mouth is because everybody admits that there is a problem.”
Ingle said that while she agrees that there should be a caseload cap for caseworkers, lawmakers must also provide the division with resources to make that cap feasible.
“What do we do after the cap is met?” Ingle said. “That doesn’t [allow us to say], ‘We’re not going to put any more kids in foster care,’ or ‘We’re not going to do any more investigations.’ It just doesn’t work like that.”
Missouri child welfare agency reports increased efforts to find missing foster kids

Jessica Seitz, executive director of the Missouri Network Against Child Abuse, said that while her organization supports accountability for the division around caseloads, 20 cases is an “unrealistic expectation.”
Rather than putting a specific number in statute, Seitz suggested a requirement that the division adhere to national accreditation standards set by the Child Welfare League of America and report to the legislature annually on its ability to meet those standards.
State Rep. Holly Jones, a Eureka Republican who chairs the House Children and Families Committee, said that lawmakers “really need to look at our case managers and the workload that is put on them.”
Jones is sponsoring a bill that would require courts to order additional parenting time to make up for time a parent lost with their child due to an unsubstantiated child abuse or neglect investigation.
Kelley is also sponsoring bills that would require caseworker training for youth aging out of the foster care system and mandate guardians ad litem to talk with children they represent before important hearings to determine custody, visitation rights or support. 
Under a bill sponsored by Republican state Rep. Melissa Schmidt of Eldridge, the division would have to ensure that a child taken into its custody receives a physical examination within 72 hours rather than 30 days.
Between July and September 2025, the division met the current standard of 30 days in no more than 42% of Missouri counties, according to a January report.
Ingle emphasized the importance of adequate funding and staff to equip the division to provide quality services.
“I have not heard of any concerns specifically related to policy that wouldn’t be addressed by addressing pay and [staffing levels],” she said.
And Ingle said that if Missouri lawmakers truly value child welfare and the work of division staff, state spending should reflect that. 
“If we say we care about it, then we should fund it like we care about it, and we should support them like we care about it.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041623_swillum1-scaled-e1717605040418-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-26 06:57:06.815397

Critics say changes could ripple outward — delaying bills, legal mail, prescriptions and mail-in ballots

The U.S. Postal Service in Vermont has quietly implemented changes to the way mail is processed that are expected to further slow down the delivery speed of many mail categories for Vermonters. 
Vermont is the latest region to join Regional Transportation Optimization, a new strategy that ends evening collection of mail that’s more than 50 miles away from regional mail centers. 
Last week, a postal service spokesperson did not answer questions about when the new program was expected to come to Vermont. But on Jan. 16, the postal service filed data in response to questions from the U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission that shows the program has already been implemented in every zip code in the state.

Regional Transportation Optimization is one part of the Delivering for America plan, a years-long strategy of service cuts and other changes that began in 2021 under former Postmaster Louis DeJoy. 
The postal service has said the plan is essential for making its operations efficient and financially self-sustaining. But critics of the program say there’s been a lack of transparency in how the plan could affect the speed and quality of service throughout the country. 
Steve Hutkins, an advocate who runs the Save the Post Office website, said there have been no signs at post offices or other notices to customers letting them know that their mail will be sitting at the back of the post office overnight. 
“The Postal Service doesn’t want the public to pay any attention to this change in its transportation policies and the slower service standards (delivery times) that the change is causing,” Hutkins said via email. 
Postmarks now could be applied to mail a day later than customers expected — meaning that a bill payment could be considered past due, or even a mail-in ballot could be disqualified, Hutkins said. 
How does Regional Transportation Optimization work?
The closest regional processing center for Vermont isn’t in Vermont. It’s in Springfield, Massachusetts, more than 40 miles from the state border, Hutkins said. 
Previously, the postal service would send postal trucks to post offices twice per day – once in the morning, the other in the evening – to pick up mail and bring it to Springfield, Amy Gibbs, a strategic communications specialist for USPS, said via email. The new plan eliminates that second pickup, meaning that any mail that arrives at the post office after the morning pickup will stay at the post office until the following day. 
The postal service has published a map revealing the effect of this change, Hutkins said. For first-class mail, USPS has shifted many parts of Vermont from a two-day service standard to a three-day service standard, and it can take up to five days to reach other parts of the country. 
There are some exceptions, Hutkins said. Local mail in places close to Vermont’s two Local Processing Centers, located in Burlington and White River Junction, could still go to those facilities and be processed more quickly than mail going to Springfield. The postal service proposed closing the two local centers in 2024, but abandoned the plan after political pushback. 
The one-day additional delays in local deliveries come as USPS is also redefining the postmark. On December 24, 2025, the postal service changed its rules to clarify that the postmark does not “inherently or necessarily align with the date” that the piece of mail came to the postal service. 
One key concern for opponents is how both these changes could combine to affect mail-in ballots, since election officials often rely on postmarks to determine whether a ballot was received on Election Day. On January 15, 16 U.S. senators sent a letter to USPS expressing fear that this change could mean more mail-in ballots being rejected. 
In an email, USPS spokesperson Gibbs said the new postmark system does not “signal a change in postmarking procedures,” but only tries to “improve public understanding of the information postmarks convey.” 
Hutkins, a retired New York University professor, began Save the Post Office in 2011 when he learned his local post office was threatened with closure. 
How would he describe the last 15 years for the post office? 
“It’s been: Things get worse slowly, you adjust to it as things go by, and it all gets slower than it used to be,” he said. 
Much of that slowdown has been pinned to former U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. When DeJoy resigned in February 2025, U.S. Senator Peter Welch issued a statement that said “Good riddance.” 
“DeJoy’s restructuring plan has led to unacceptable mail delivery delays across Vermont, especially in rural areas of the state,” Welch said in the statement. 
Yet it remains to be seen what next steps the newly appointed Postmaster General David Steiner will take, Hutkins said. Before his appointment, Steiner served on the board of FedEx, one of USPS’ top competitors, for over a decade. 
Have these changes had an effect on on-time performance? The postal service’s own dashboard shows hardly any change to the percent of first-class mail, the cheapest category of mail for letters, postcards and envelopes, that has arrived within service standards in the Vermont-New Hampshire-Maine region. But Hutkins noted that the standards themselves have changed, making it hard to draw conclusions from the limited data available. 
For some Vermont communities, staffing levels at the post office appears to be a key reason for delays. Montpelier residents have complained about delayed mail and packages in recent weeks when four postal routes were left vacant by a staffing shortage. 
Hutkins said that the overall level of postal workers hasn’t changed much over the years, but retaining part-time workers has been a longstanding challenge. He cited a 2016 USPS report that found the annual turnover rate for non-career employees was over 40%. 
“It’s a really hard job,” he said.
Elizabeth Newman of Hinesburg said that her mail delivery has improved since 2023 and 2024, when she was only getting mail just once a week. But even now, a single mail carrier getting sick seems to lead to all the mail in town coming to a halt. 
She said she’s one of many people in town who have switched to paying her bills online whenever she can. 
“Regularly, we were having to call our credit card companies, and they hadn’t received stuff or it was delayed,” she said. 
Regarding the potential effects of the regional transport and postmark plan, she said it was hard for the average customer to understand because the postal service was like a “black box” of information. 
“You can never find out what happened or why,” she said.

Introduced by Rep. Bishop Davidson, a Republican from Republic, the legislation would require all students to participate in a minimum of 60 minutes of physical activity each school day. PE classes, additional recesses and other supervised physical activities could fulfill the new requirement, as outlined by the bill.
The bill does include caveats for students with disabilities.
Student-athletes, who are occasionally excused from physical education requirements, would not be exempt from the required 60 minutes of daily activity under the bill.
Legislators expressed concerns over the bill’s logistics — an additional hour of required learning could disrupt or extend the current school schedule. Davidson told a House committee Wednesday that he does not intend for the bill to add more time to the school day or detract from other Common Core curriculum requirements.
Haley Edwards, a senior at Republic High School in Greene County, testified in favor of the bill.
“We see the signs that tie (exercise) back to physical well-being and mental well-being, and I think that this bill really opens doors to be able to see those effects,” Edwards said.
The National Education Association has not yet determined whether legislative action is necessary to enact the proposed requirement, but a spokesman said the organization believes that increased physical activity would benefit students.
Otto Fajan, who testified on behalf of the NEA, said that the role of physical education has shrunk over the past century in American public schools.
“There’s a flow against (P.E.) caused by the structure of accountability,” Fagen said, “and standardized testing in areas that do not include physical literacy.”

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/ Special to The Dailey Gazette)COLUMBIA — A Richland County legislator running for governor will give the Democratic response to Gov. Henry McMaster’s final State of the State address.
Rep. Jermaine Johnson was chosen by the state House Democratic Caucus to deliver the message for his party, his campaign announced in a release Monday morning.
McMaster is scheduled to give his ninth and last State of the State before a joint assembly of the Legislature in House chambers at 7 p.m. Wednesday.
The state’s longest-serving elected governor will lay out his priorities for the 2026 legislative session that started two weeks ago. He’ll also highlight what he considers his administration’s successes for South Carolina and point to initiatives he wants legislators to continue after he leaves office. The Republican governor first ascended to the job in January 2017 when then-Gov. Nikki Haley left to join President Donald Trump’s first administration.

Johnson is among two Democrats who have announced bids to replace McMaster. Charleston attorney Mullins McLeod is also running.
Regardless of the outcome of the governor’s race, Johnson isn’t returning to the Legislature next year. South Carolina law allows candidates to seek more than one office at a time. They just can’t occupy more than one if they win.
But Johnson announced earlier this month that he’s not seeking a fourth term to the House so he can focus on his bid for governor.
It won’t be the first time a Democratic gubernatorial candidate was chosen to lay out Democrats’ vision in an election year.
In 2018, then-state Rep. James Smith of Columbia gave the Democratic response to McMaster’s first State of the State address. McMaster defeated Smith by 8 percentage points that November to win his first elected term as governor. In South Carolina, governors are limited to two elected terms.

But just how much is difficult to know. 
An internal budget document suggests that the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare doesn’t know if the governor’s proposed $22 million cuts would create “new potential costs.” And those cuts could also result in the state losing over $100 million dollars in federal matching funds that Idaho Medicaid would get. 
But on Thursday, Idaho’s top Medicaid official made it clear: The state’s public assistance program doesn’t have capacity to project how much cuts could spur new costs — unless it is directed to. 
Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Sasha O’Connell presents to the Legislature’s Medicaid Review Panel in Rexburg on Dec. 15, 2025. (Photo by Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)
“But I also don’t want to imply that more staff would solve the problem,” Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Sasha O’Connell told the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC. “Because I think that it’s also just an issue of not being able to predict some of these changes.”
Forecasting with big changes always carries risk, she added. The state’s estimate for Medicaid’s future budget needs often turn out wrong, she said, in part because the state projects the program’s costs well over a year before the next given fiscal year actually concludes. 
The admission comes while the Idaho Legislature grapples with which Medicaid services to possibly cut, as lawmakers brace for spending reductions after years of tax cuts. 
But some ripple effects of Medicaid cuts are already baked into the governor’s budget proposal. That’s because for every dollar in general funds Idaho pays for Medicaid, the federal government chips in at least twice as much.

 If Idaho cuts state Medicaid funding, it could lose federal funds

If Idaho cuts its spending on Medicaid, that means the state could forgo an even higher amount of federal matching dollars.

Next fiscal year, Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s proposed $45 million in Medicaid cuts would leave the state with nearly $106.8 million less federal funds, according to the Legislative Budget Book, which is produced by Legislative Services’ Office. His Medicaid plan for next year would extend cuts to doctor pay rates, and potentially cut other services like dental coverage and disability services. 
This year, Little’s cuts to doctor pay rates – set to save the state $17.2 million — would leave the state with $44.2 less federal funding. 
In 2023, the Department of Health and Welfare estimated repealing Medicaid expansion – a proposal some in GOP legislative leadership said they would consider this year – would cost the state $78 million more. 
Before the legislative session, Little cautioned that repealing expansion would spark unintended consequences. 
He also said the Department of Health and Welfare was working to figure out the true cost of repeal. It isn’t immediately clear when or if that analysis will be done. 
But in JFAC, O’Connell, the Idaho Medicaid director, highlighted a few costs the state could face if it repealed Medicaid expansion: 

Losing $38 million in revenue from a tax on hospitals, because the rate hospitals pay is based on how many Medicaid enrollees they serve. 
Driving up costs by around $20 million for state hospitals, where some services would shift from being largely federally funded back to state funded. (The federal government pays 90% of costs of Medicaid expansion.)




 Health and Welfare exempted several services from provider reimbursement rate cuts

According to the Legislative Budget Book, the Department of Health and Welfare, following a federally required review, exempted the following services from reimbursement rate cuts:

Home and community-based services, which includes certified family homes and personal care services
School-based services
Tribal providers
Federally Qualified Health Centers’ and Rural Health Centers’ final encounter rate payments
Services funded by the Idaho Home Choice grant
State-owned facilities
Hospice
And pharmacy ingredient cost




 Patients, providers turn out to oppose cuts

As lawmakers mulled the Department of Health and Welfare’s budget Thursday, advocates visited the Capitol to try to protect Medicaid services. 
Julie McConnel, a mom to 10-year old twin boys with Down syndrome, came from Nampa. She said her sons rely on a range of Medicaid services that have improved their lives – including home and community-based services, which is on Little’s list of Medicaid cut options.
Some specialists her sons see have a long wait list, and she worries that cutting their pay rates would make it even harder to get in.
“Where they are now in life is so much due to the early interventions they received for Medicaid — whether it’s general medical expenses or home and community based-services,” she said in an interview outside JFAC’s meeting room. 
Records detail Idaho Medicaid services that could be cut, but not ‘potential new costs’

Sara Bergsma owns a speech therapy clinic in Meridian called We are Better Together. She said providers are still figuring out how to navigate the state’s recent cap of speech therapy at 20 visits a year, which requires prior authorization for any more visits. 
But what worries her more is the prospect of the service being entirely cut — since it was on Little’s list for Medicaid cut options. 
“I don’t know how these clinics will stay open,” Bergsma said in an interview. “They won’t be able to take Medicaid, or they will have to close their doors if that’s the only source of income or the majority of their source of income.”
 Lawmakers mull where to cut Idaho Medicaid

In JFAC, Sen. Carl Bjerke, a Republican from Coeur d’Alene, said he’s received up to 1,000 emails from the public about Medicaid cuts. And he talked about how he was wrangling with how to cut more.
He said he wants money in Medicaid to go to “the people who are the most vulnerable.”

“I can give you many reasons why adult dental is good,” Bjerke said.
But, he said, “if I had to make a decision right here, as we’re making decisions on budgets, whether I’m going to support adult dental or taking care of a single mom taking care of a … severely autistic child, I’m going to weigh on the severely autistic child.”
Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Boise Democrat, advocated for hearing public testimony from people affected by cuts. 
And she said lawmakers shouldn’t even be in this position.
“We’ve cut revenue too hard. And I would rather look for ways we can put revenue back, so we don’t have to make decisions on these kinds of things – like who deserves it and who doesn’t,” she said. “We’re really picking winners and losers here. And it doesn’t feel good.”
Rep. Chris Bruce, a Republican from Kuna, told lawmakers that they may not be hearing from some taxpayers.
“I’d also like to remind everyone of folks who maybe are working multiple jobs, who do not have insurance for themselves, who are just paying their taxes,” he said. “We need to remember those people who are making these decisions, and not just focus on the calls that we get all the time.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative proposal could be one of the last hurdles facing an $800 million deal meant to leave the University of Nebraska the sole owner of Nebraska Medicine, and the bill appears to be gaining traction after a restructuring late last week of the nonprofit’s board.
Legislative Bill 1125, from State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, would require legislative approval before NU could acquire a controlling or sole interest in any hospital or health care facility valued at more than $100 million. That could include the planned deal for NU to assume sole ownership of Nebraska Medicine from its longtime partner, Clarkson Regional Health Services, which wants out.
“I think we need some review, and we’re not trying to do or undo the transaction,” Sorrentino told the Nebraska Examiner.

The bill has gotten more attention after NU and Clarkson announced Thursday that they were immediately changing the Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors, kicking off nearly all members and appointing a few new voting members from NU and Clarkson who are explicitly friendly to the ownership change.
“They took what I consider a nuclear action and blew the whole deal up,” State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area said Friday.
Of Sorrentino’s bill, von Gillern said: “It is far more interesting today than it was yesterday.”
‘Incredibly short-sighted’
Von Gillern said he was “really disappointed” in the Thursday board shakeup. He had led more than 30 of his colleagues to ask Jan. 8 that regents take more time to review before voting. The vote was delayed one week, to Jan. 15, partly because of lawmakers’ recommendations.

On Jan. 14, NU and the former Nebraska Medicine board, which organized opposition to the deal, also made separate in-person last stands to lawmakers. Clarkson joined NU at its forum.
Among the pleas was one from the then-Nebraska Medicine board chair, Lance Fritz, for lawmakers to consider stepping in, an action NU says is unnecessary.
Von Gillern said the competing forums were meant to encourage a “deeper level” of conversation and engagement between the organizations. And while he says he has “no reason to doubt NU’s or Clarkson’s authority to change the board, he still worries about the fallout.
“I think it was incredibly short-sighted, from a corporate-citizenship standpoint, from recognizing the level of engagement by the civic community in Omaha and philanthropy,” von Gillern said.
‘Nobody likes surprises’
The NU Board of Regents, at its Jan. 15 meeting, unanimously authorized the transaction. Regents anticipate it will “close” by June 30, barring any other changes or roadblocks. NU agreed to pay Clarkson $500 million for its 50% share of Nebraska Medicine and $300 million for related properties.
In return, Clarkson would donate $200 million back to NU for “Project Health,” a $2.19 billion endeavor to build up the next generation of health care.
Less than 24 hours after the unanimous vote, the Nebraska Medicine board, under its previous leadership, filed a lawsuit in Douglas County to try to stop the deal. The suit argues that the parent organizations had not followed the law and left the former Nebraska Medicine board members out of necessary negotiations, including exploring possible alternatives.
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a former hospital administrator, said he was skeptical Clarkson would leave Nebraska. He pointed to Fritz’s leadership, a former CEO and president of Union Pacific, as one reason why philanthropy in Omaha could be energized to step in. 
Fritz had told lawmakers at least one philanthropist in Omaha might be interested.

Riepe said for the size of the NU-Clarkson deal, it needed a lot more communication, “maybe even up to the point of a year that says, ‘This is what’s being considered.’” The proposal was announced Jan. 2. Nondisclosure agreements went back to July 2024.
“Nobody likes surprises, and I think this was a surprise,” Riepe said of the deal. “A big surprise.”
Part of the reason for the quick action was concern about whether Clarkson might try to sell to an out-of-state or for-profit corporation. The university’s exclusive window for negotiations would have ended after Jan. 15, regents said.
As a fail safe, Sorrentino’s bill would also prohibit any hospital or academic health center that serves as the primary affiliate of UNMC — in this case, Clarkson — from selling all or part of its share to an out-of-state or for-profit entity, unless the state attorney general, in consultation with the NU Board of Regents, determines such changes are “in the public interest.”
Riepe said that in his experience, projects that don’t start well often don’t end well. He hopes that isn’t the case for the Nebraska Medicine changes.
Nonprofit board shakeup
NU and Clarkson on Thursday said the board restructuring came after “careful review” and as the owners had “serious concerns about recent actions and behavior” by board members. The two organizations also described the legal action as “extraordinary.”

The board restructuring could end the lawsuit, as the board’s now-four voting members include NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold, interim University of Nebraska Medical Center Chancellor Dr. Dele Davies and Clarkson CEO Dr. Bill Lydiatt. All three have explicitly endorsed the transaction.
Those NU and Clarkson leaders are now, in effect, suing themselves. As of Friday afternoon, no additional legal motions had been filed in Douglas County District Court.
Should lawmakers get involved?
While von Gillern and Sorrentino want to have a deeper conversation, not all lawmakers are convinced the Legislature should get involved.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, now in her 12th year as a state legislator, said she had been monitoring statements from NU, the former Nebraska Medicine board and Clarkson. She said that “like most challenging issues in public life,” each had good points.
“But I think, at the end of the day, where I am, is that I just don’t see a legislative issue or role in regards to resolution of this matter for a variety of different reasons,” Conrad said.
State Sens. Merv Riepe of Ralston and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. April 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
She and Riepe both pointed to a 1977 Nebraska Supreme Court case, named after former Gov. Jim Exon, in which the high court limited how much political influence the Legislature can exert over NU because the Nebraska Constitution gives that general governing power to the NU Board of Regents.
Said Riepe: “I don’t think that we need to put in another level of discussions that take a lot more time and a lot more fuss and everything else.”
In a statement to the Examiner, the regents said their action to acquire Clarkson’s share of Nebraska Medicine “is well within the bounds of the long-established constitutional powers” of the regents and that the board acted in “good faith” at the “opportunity” that Clarkson offered.
“We will continue to move forward in the best interest of the university, Nebraska Medicine and the students, patients and Nebraskans we serve,” the regents’ statement reads. “We believe this is best achieved without legislation.”
A Clarkson spokesperson said their organization was still reviewing Sorrentino’s bill. Nebraska Medicine declined to comment Friday.
‘Cooler heads could prevail’
Sorrentino’s bill has been sent to the Legislature’s Executive Board, chaired by State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. Hansen said Thursday’s shakeup “set a few hairs on fire” and that while lawmakers might have wanted to wait, Sorrentino’s bill might come for a hearing sooner.

Hansen said lawmakers planned to take a “breath” over the weekend and decide on scheduling soon.
While the transaction heads to “closing,” Sorrentino said he still thinks his bill could have an impact. He said the Legislature “probably owes taxpayers at least a review,” noting the price tag of the deal mirrors what state legislators have appropriated in baseline state tax dollars to NU.
“I wished that cooler heads could prevail and we could discuss this,” Sorrentino said Friday.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Alligators could be raised as pets and for food under an Oklahoma bill pending before lawmakers.
Senate Bill 2087, by Sen. Jonathan Wingard, R-Ada,  would allow the raising of alligators hatched from eggs in captivity without a permit.
Currently, a permit and written permission from the director of the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation are required to own an alligator, said Wade Farrar, assistant chief of law enforcement for the agency. 
Most permits issued are for alligators in zoos, he said.
He did not have numbers of how many licenses had been issued.
The state Department of Wildlife said alligators mate around June each year, and lay 20 to 30 eggs. The Oklahoma City Zoo reports that American alligators live an average of 35 to 50 years and are naturally found in Southeastern Oklahoma.
“What I’m looking at and working on is there has been some interest expressed in the food production side of this, allowing meat processing plants to raise alligators to be able to have for slaughter,” Wingard said.
He said the measure was a constituent request, and he is trying to determine if there is a market in Oklahoma for alligator meat. Alligator skin could also be sold, he said.
He said the bill he wrote is incomplete, but he needed to get something filed as a placeholder before the bill filing deadline.
The way the measure is currently written, it would allow for individuals to raise alligators as pets as long as the animal wasn’t taken from the wild, he said.
He said the measure has generated some controversy.
“At this time, it is an incomplete bill with incomplete language, so if it does move forward, there will be more put in as guardrails and protections and it would be narrowed up before it ever would even be considered,” Wingard said.
The measure directs the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation to create rules to implement it.

As they crossed the Fox River, marchers formed a line longer than the Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge, which crosses the Fox River. 
“The only people who can defend us is us,” Daniel Castillo, a member of the Green Bay Anti-War Committee, told the crowd.

After he was shot by federal agents, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said Pretti, who was carrying a registered handgun when six Border Patrol agents tackled him, but did unholster it, appeared eager to inflict “maximum damage” on assembled federal agents. Videos taken at the scene, showing Pretti holding a cellphone camera, not a gun, and trying to help a woman who was knocked to the ground by agents, as well as  what’s known about Pretti’s background, belie the Trump administration’s claims, the Minnesota Reformer reported.
In a statement, Pretti’s parents said they are “heartbroken but also very angry” and requested, “Please get the truth out about our son.” They said that “the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting.”
“Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital,” the parents’ statement said in part. “Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman.”
Lori Blakeslee, communications director for the Green Bay Area Public School District, confirmed to the Wisconsin Examiner that Pretti graduated from Green Bay Preble High School in 2006.

In an interview early Sunday afternoon, Travis Vanden Heuvel told the Examiner he and Pretti were in a choir program together, and that the two were friends during elementary and middle school. 
“I think he was standing up for what was right and just, and I’m saddened and angered by what happened and how it happened,” Vanden Heuvel said. 
Vanden Heuvel said when he learned about the shooting, not knowing who the victim was, the word he had been using to describe it was tragic. His old assistant choir director had reached out to let him know Pretti had been killed. 
“And tragic became devastating, not that this happening in America or in Minnesota didn’t already make it close to home,” Vanden Heuvel said. “I mean, I think we’ve been feeling it hit closer and closer to home.”
The Examiner previously reported on a march against ICE in downtown Green Bay almost a year ago, in the weeks that followed President Donald Trump’s inauguration. 
Castillo told the Examiner this is different from last year’s event.
“It was just the random activist that approached us and said, ‘Would you like to set up some sort of event that shows that immigrants are just people too?’” Castillo said. “…This is much different, and because people are angry… they’re just mad that a man was assassinated, extra-judicially murdered.” 
Jennifer Gonzalez, communications coordinator for the Green Bay Police Department, said that “today’s demonstration, like others held in our community, was calm and peaceful, with no significant incidents.”
Protests also occurred elsewhere in Wisconsin, including in Milwaukee, Madison, Oshkosh and Superior.
State Rep. Amaad Rivera-Wagner (D-Green Bay) said in a statement that “it is not surprising that Alex was a nurse with roots in Green Bay, a place where we believe in taking care of each other and respecting human dignity.”
“We must come together to demand accountability, because hate cannot win,” Rivera-Wagner said. 
In a statement Saturday, Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich said “another American citizen is dead as the result of the federal government’s occupation of an American city, and the victim, Alex Pretti, was a graduate of a Green Bay high school.” 
“Without knowing all the facts of the case, we can say with certainty that a full, transparent, and independent investigation must be conducted,” Genrich said. “I mourn his tragic death with his friends and family, and join the chorus of Americans who are rightfully demanding the federal government change course and enforce immigration law in keeping with local, state and federal laws and the U.S. Constitution.”

(Getty Images)If I was in need of an emergency transfusion, the last thing I would be thinking about is whether the person who donated their life-saving blood had received the COVID-19 vaccine.
In fact, I’d just be thankful that someone had stepped up to donate healthy blood.
But I guess that’s one big difference between me and Republican state Rep. Justin Humphrey, who for whatever reason fears receiving blood from donors who got  their COVID shot will do him grievous bodily harm.
Humphrey wasted state resources filing legislation that would require the State Department of Health to squander money getting into the business of running a blood bank. And not just any blood bank, but one that only stores blood that is “untainted” by the vaccine to fight COVID-19.
It’s so absurd, I wanted to laugh when I first saw the bill, figuring it was just more theatrics orchestrated to grab headlines. It is, of course, from the same lawmaker who once garnered international attention with his proposal to create a bigfoot hunting license, and who now has his sights set on the lieutenant governor’s office.
A day after Oklahoma Voice first reported on the measure and he faced a deluge of ridicule — mixed with some adoration — on social media, I ran into Humphrey in the Capitol. Humphrey told me he no longer planned to pursue this plan legislatively. He had not ruled out working to develop a national blood bank like it through private avenues because he believes there is interest in this. He said it prompted a needed conversation.
The lawmaker from Lane said he had spoken with the head of Our Blood Institute, the nation’s sixth largest independent blood center, which is headquartered in Oklahoma City. He said he’ll use his bill to promote blood donation and to spread the word that Oklahomans can donate their own blood ahead of time to be used in planned procedures that require transfusions.
That seems like a fitting end to this tale.
Even with this particular bill out of the way, though, it’s emblematic of a larger problem. Proposals like this continue to symbolize the increasingly vocal segment of our Legislature that are either against science and medicine, have no grasp on how things actually work in health care or are hoping to capitalize off people’s ignorance.
In recent years, we’ve seen Oklahoma lawmakers spend inordinate amounts of time fearmongering about modern medicine, and we’ve seen them give credence to a small but influential anti-vaccine movement through a variety of legislative proposals.
I fear this year – an election year – is going to be infinitely worse as politicians jockey for attention and votes.
I sure hope I’m wrong.
But last session, we had a state senator accuse women of murdering babies if they take birth control, and he railed against the dangers of that safe medicine..
In June, lawmakers cheered happily for Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt when he said he would pen an executive order that forbade the state Health Department from recommending fluoride in public water supplies.
Now, we’ve also got at least one lawmaker who wants to divert Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust money that voters have specifically earmarked to improve public health to pay higher education costs for the children of teachers. 
I fail to see how that will help improve health outcomes in states, like ours, which ranks in the bottom five in access, quality and public health and has an above average rates of obesity and people without health insurance.
As someone who believes wholeheartedly in modern medicine and public health, it’s absolutely exhausting to watch these legislative shenanigans play out year after year. 
Alarmingly, it’s getting more  difficult to tell who’s joking, pandering to a base or who legitimately believes what they’re spouting while they file bills. And, it’s hard to tell which bills will die a quick legislative death and which will suddenly get reworked late in the session and charge through the opaque lawmaking process.
Unfortunately, that distracts from the good work other legislators are trying to do. It also pulls medical professionals, who are already in short supply, away from their patients as they’re forced to spend inordinate amounts of their precious time having to rebut false claims to make sure we’re all safer.
Take Humphrey’s COVID bill, for example.
Medical professionals say there is no way to differentiate between the antibodies of people who have had COVID and those who have had the vaccine. And the vaccine is safe.
Mercy Hospital Oklahoma City’s chief medical officer said they don’t routinely have patients demanding special blood.
Please believe them. 
Humphrey could have figured that out himself before filing this legislation.
At this point, pretty much everyone has probably had COVID, even if they don’t know it, since for most people it appears like a respiratory virus.
So to make Humphrey’s vision a reality, he’d need to either find people living off the grid, or he’ll need to take copious amounts of blood from newborn babies, which isn’t safe or humane.
The Legislature would be an infinitely better place if lawmakers actually trusted our health care providers and talked to them — not at them — when crafting legislation.
Hopefully moving forward, they’ll do that.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist only entered the race for Secretary of State two weeks ago. In that time, key Democrats have been rallying around him, showing off the type of organizing and bridge-building strength he’ll certainly need to get over the edge with delegates at the party’s spring endorsement convention.
Gilchrist left the gubernatorial race on Jan. 12, citing his intention to play a bigger role against threats from President Donald Trump and federal officials to meddle in upcoming elections, and broader threats to democracy that have faced the state and nation.
That said, Gilchrist was running second fiddle to current Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who remains the frontrunner in the governor’s race and now only faces Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the upcoming August primary.
Gilchrist’s entrance into the Democratic secretary of state contest, which is heavily influenced  by the state’s powerful unions and interest groups at the party’s spring and summer conventions, immediately pushed another candidate, Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, out of the race. Edevbie has since endorsed Gilchrist.
The race is now between Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, former state Sen. Adam Hollier of Detroit, and former Michigan State Lottery Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli.
On Thursday, Gilchrist unloaded a fresh round of endorsements that included more than 40 public officials, congressional districts and union groups.

— Garlin Gilchrist (@garlin) January 22, 2026

Adrian Hemond, CEO of the Grassroots Midwest consulting firm, told Michigan Advance on Friday that Gilchrist has had a pretty impressive showing right out of the gate.
“Obviously, this is a way different sort of race than a statewide primary election, because the electorate is just whoever shows up at convention and has voting rights,” Hemond said. “But endorsements matter much more in this race than they do in a statewide primary. … They matter a lot at convention because a lot of organizations that can endorse have the ability to move their members, and a lot of elected officials who endorse have reach with some of the groups who are going to show on the convention floor.”
Hemond said that Gilchrist’s new round of endorsements also show that his bid for secretary of state is already going better than his year of running for governor thus far, and that’s likely why he made the switch.
Gilchrist building bridges instead of letting them burn
Gilchrist, during his gubernatorial bid, carved out a space for himself as one of the only gubernatorial candidates to decisively support the Palestinian freedom movement and call Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide. He also said he would not accept money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC. The lieutenant governor made that pronouncement last summer at the annual American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee national convention in Dearborn.
That stance and others, like his strong union support and his championing of the state’s Clean Slate expungement program, earned him the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), who has been a leading voice for Palestinian freedom during her time in Congress.
Soon after Gilchrist dropped from the gubernatorial hunt and entered the race for secretary of state, he appeared at a candidate forum hosted by the Michigan Democratic Party’s Jewish Caucus. There, he apologized for how those remarks may have been perceived as antisemitic, although his campaign later clarified that he was not retracting his previous statements on Gaza.

Gilchrist also noted that he met with the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee.
Despite those statements, it appears that Tlaib is still on board with Gilchrist’s campaign for secretary of state, as she is listed among his new supporters list released Thursday. The list also includes Dearborn Mayor Adbullah Hammoud, an unabashed supporter of Palestinian rights and a strong critic of the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Michigan Advance attempted to interview Tlaib for this story prior to Gilchrist’s new slate of endorsements, in hopes to better understand where she stood now with the lieutenant governor now that he was out of the governor’s race and after comments at the party-hosted forum.
Tlaib’s communications office did not respond to numerous text messages or phone calls seeking an interview with the congresswoman.
Hemond said Gilchrist’s maneuvering on Gaza and Israel — admitting where he might have been wrong in some respects with moderate Democrats while still sticking to his guns on a previously stated ideological position that’s important to progressives — speaks to his effectiveness as a politician within the Democratic coalition.
“Ultimately, he’s got to take his case to the general electorate, but winning these convention fights requires a different sort of politics, and he appears to have some aptitude at that,” Hemond said.
What does this momentum mean for those still in the race?
Gilchrist gaining traction so late in the game and at an accelerated rate may be tripping alarm bells for the likes of Byrum, Hollier and Shkreli, the latter of whom also joined the race fairly late into the cycle. 
Hemond expects that at least one or two of the candidates who are not Garlin Gilchrist to leave the race by the time the party holds its early endorsement convention in the spring.

“I think Gilchrist will do well at the convention, whether he wins or not,” Hemond said. “I think it depends, to some extent, on who else is in the race. I don’t expect this to go to a vote between three candidates. It’ll be a vote between two candidates, if it’s not a coronation.”
Hemond expects at least one of them to be Gilchrist, and whoever his opponent is in the final stretch.
If that person is Byrum, his momentum certainly puts pressure on her, but Hemond called Byrum a brand-name candidate due to her family history in politics and ties to organized labor.
It also puts pressure on Hollier if he’s still standing on the eve of the convention, as the party would then have two prominent Black politicians from Detroit running for the same spot, although Hollier has been working to reach out statewide for support.
Shkreli, meanwhile, has also been making the rounds of Democratic constituent groups in her bid to be the party’s nominee.

In the case of Byrum, the former lawmaker and current Ingham clerk has been in the race since last spring, and is potentially the most qualified person in the hunt for the nomination. Deep-bench qualifications, however, don’t necessarily mean an easy or expected path to victory when the nomination is decided by party fixtures and not average voters.
In an interview with the Advance, Byrum said Friday that she remains the candidate with most experience doing the job she’s campaigning for, and with the kind of early endorsements that still matter — several unions and many local clerks.
To that point, Gilchrist, at present, has backing from the powerful Michigan Education Association and Unite Here Local 24.
Byrum, on the other hand, has support from nearly a dozen union locals, including the Greater Lansing Labor Council, Lansing-based UA Local 333 Plumbers & Pipefitters, Detroit’s UA Local 636 Pipefitters, Flint’s UA Local 370 Plumbers & Pipefitters and Monroe’s UA Local 671 Plumbers, Pipefitters, HVAC & Welders.
Byrum said she wasn’t fazed by Gilchrist’s swift albeit late launch.

“I had three opponents last month; I have three opponents today,” Byrum told the Advance. “I am the only qualified candidate in this race for Secretary of State.

Recent controversies over sprawling energy development have triggered a slate of bills to empower voters and communities in state-level energy ambitions.
The post Nuclear waste, state land use top Wyoming Legislature’s energy agenda appeared first on WyoFile .","If there’s a theme among energy-related bills proposed for the Legislature’s upcoming budget session, it might be giving the electorate and local communities more say in what many residents regard as a tsunami of energy development proposals.
From a growing crop of wind turbines to mining proposals, prospective nuclear manufacturing and hydrogen energy projects, residents have clashed with one another, county officials and the state. Tensions swirl around the economic, safety and cultural ramifications of a rapidly changing energy landscape.
One bill speaks directly to the sense that, although Wyoming wants to remain the nation’s premier source of raw power, residents want to have more of a say about what’s a good fit.
A public vote on nuclear waste storage?
One of the most high-profile conflicts has centered on nuclear energy and whether the state should loosen its ban on spent nuclear fuel waste storage. 
House Joint Resolution 3, “Storage of spent nuclear fuel and waste-vote required,” aims to put the authority to decide directly in Wyoming voters’ hands. If passed, the general election ballot in November would include a referendum on whether to amend Wyoming’s constitution to proclaim:

“No storage, siting or placement of high-level radioactive waste shall be authorized under state law and occur except upon an affirmative vote of the people of the state.


“No storage, siting or placement of spent nuclear fuel shall be authorized under state law and occur except upon an affirmative vote of the people of the state.


“That the Secretary of State shall endorse the following statement on the proposed amendment: The adoption of this amendment would require an affirmative vote of the people of the state before any high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel can be stored in Wyoming.”

All 13 sponsors behind the resolution are members and allies of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, indicative of a political divide that has already curtailed some nuclear development. In October, Radiant Industries announced it was withdrawing its plans to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility in Natrona County. Radiant’s plan would have required a change to Wyoming’s ban on high-level nuclear waste storage. Though lawmakers have tried several times to do just that, the effort has met passionate opposition, including this past summer.
At stake is whether Wyoming can reap the economic benefits of high-dollar nuclear energy proposals without sacrificing public safety. While the bill’s primary sponsor, Midwest Republican Rep. Bill Allemand, says he believes storage facilities can be operated safely, it’s unlikely that any nuclear waste deemed as “temporarily” stored here would ever be removed from the state, because there are no plans for a federal repository, he noted.
Plus, Allemand said, Radiant’s proposed site was simply too close to homes and schools in Bar Nunn, and elected officials didn’t advocate for what he considered a majority of neighbors who didn’t want to take the risk.
“Their elected officials turned a blind eye and would not listen to them,” Allemand told WyoFile. “They said they might pay a price at the next election. Well, for these people in Bar Nunn, that would have been too late.”

Proponents of bringing nuclear energy projects to Wyoming say the state risks earning a reputation as unwelcoming to the industry, which has plenty of other states courting those dollars.
If such a referendum were to pass, Allemand said, it would not stop ongoing discussions about what aspects of the nuclear energy industry might be a good fit for Wyoming. “But the Legislature, the governor, the county commission — they would no longer have that right,” he said. “It will be the people, and that’s where it should be on something of this high of importance.”
Energy on state lands
Lawmakers will also consider at least two bills that would require more public engagement and allow for more flexibility regarding energy and other industrial developments on state lands.
Senate File 40, “State lands-designation of community-valued land,” would allow the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council to designate state lands, on a case-by-case nomination basis, as “lands with significant community value.” 
Senate File 42, “County zoning authority-amendments,” would specify that counties have the authority to “implement zoning regulations for specified purposes.”
“There needs to be a little bit more of a vetting process to allow for the county commissioners or the city council or communities, in general, to at least weigh in before it lands on the desk in front of the [state lands] board.”Casper Republican Sen. Bill Landon
Both bills, according to proponents, attempt to give communities and local officials more say over state-sanctioned activities on what are known as “school sections” — state-owned lands prioritized for the financial and general benefit of Wyoming public schools. Some critics say the Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners has pursued those priorities too narrowly, failing to provide proper notice to locals when granting leases and insisting that county zoning and land use rules cannot trump the state’s authority over school sections.
Senate File 40, according to the bill’s sponsor, Casper Republican Sen. Bill Landon, “attempts to give communities an option, or at least give a little bit better vetting process to what we do on state lands, particularly state lands that are either contiguous or close to communities.”
Two years ago, controversy erupted over the state land board’s approval of mining leases on state lands at the base of Casper Mountain, where a gravel mining company proposes to set up operations. Adjacent homeowners cried foul, saying the gravel pit threatens water wells and neighborhood safety. Both homeowners and county officials were irate that the state didn’t reach out to locals before approving the leases.

Beyond Casper Mountain, residents and local officials throughout central and eastern Wyoming have said the state has approved wind and other industrial projects without considering other land values or the cumulative impacts that threaten ranching and small communities.
“There needs to be a little bit more of a vetting process,” Landon said, “to allow for the county commissioners or the city council or communities, in general, to at least weigh in before it lands on the desk in front of the [state lands] board.”
Landon noted that SF 40 doesn’t attempt to supersede the state’s authority over school sections, but prescribes a process for more public engagement and the opportunity to recognize the value of lands, on a case-by-case basis, beyond generating revenue from industrial development.
Senate File 42 flirts with the contentious issue of whether counties can impose zoning and other land use rules that might conflict with state-sanctioned activities on school sections. The measure would give counties more of a say when it comes to supposedly temporary industrial and commercial activities that can be prolonged via state lease extensions, according to co-sponsor Casper Republican Rep. Steve Harshman.

The clash over such county-versus-state authorities has generated several lawsuits in recent years, including a recent court ruling in favor of Prism Logistics, the company that wants to mine gravel at the base of Casper Mountain.
Federal minerals
Though Wyoming officials cheered the GOP-led Big Beautiful Bill, there was some regret over a provision that slashed the federal mineral royalty rate for coal, oil and natural gas — a longtime pillar of revenue to the state. The move, related to coal royalties alone, is estimated to choke the annual flow of federal dollars to Wyoming by $50 million, according to estimates.
To help make up for those losses, House Joint Resolution 2, “Federal mineral royalties-state share,” sponsored by the Legislature’s Select Federal Natural Resource Management Committee, would ask Congress to increase Wyoming’s share of federal mineral royalties from 50% to 87.5%, according to the bill draft.
The committee is also sponsoring Senate Joint Resolution 1, “State management-federal mineral leases.” The resolution would request that Congress amend the federal Mineral Leasing Act to “authorize the state of Wyoming to administer and manage mineral leasing on federal lands located in Wyoming.”
Though the production of federal minerals has been a major source of revenue and job creation in Wyoming, state leaders have bristled at past administrations’ leasing decisions, particularly when the Biden administration imposed a ban on all future federal coal leasing in the Powder River Basin — a move that the Trump administration is reversing.
The resolution claims Wyoming could administer federal leasing in the state more efficiently and at a lower cost. It also asserts that “Authorizing Wyoming to administer and manage mineral leasing of federal minerals not only respects the principles of federalism and local control but also ensures that decisions are made by those who know the land best and are most invested in its long-term sustainability.”

The proposed cuts are a form of negotiation by hostage taking, with the caucus using UW and the business council as leverage in future negotiations, writes Rep. Ken Chestek.
The post The Wyoming Freedom Caucus is playing games with the budget appeared first on WyoFile .","The budget proposal being forced out of the Wyoming Joint Appropriations Committee by its Freedom Caucus members is not a serious one. It is the opening bid in a negotiation, which promises to get very ugly and very contentious when the full Legislature convenes in two weeks. Worst of all, it shows the utter disregard that the Freedom Caucus has for the majority of Wyoming citizens. They are playing a very dangerous game.

Opinion

I teach a unit on negotiations in several of the courses I teach at the University of Wyoming School of Law. I teach my students to identify the “negotiating context” in which they find themselves, then select their negotiating strategies and tactics to match the context. 
One typical context is called a “competitive” context, in which the parties view the situation as purely a zero-sum game: For every dollar I give you, I need something of equal value in return. Competitive tactics include taking extreme opening positions, contesting every fact, making minimal concessions and using threats to belittle the opposing side, hoping to force bigger concessions from your opponent.
Everything about the bill coming out of the JAC reveals that the Freedom Caucus views the budget as a competitive context. The state’s revenue stream is level, and Gov. Mark Gordon proposed a balanced budget. Therefore, the extreme cuts being proposed by the Freedom Caucus are unnecessary; they are just cuts for the sake of cuts. 
We can afford the full funding the governor proposed for the University of Wyoming. We can afford to invest in Wyoming’s future through the Wyoming Business Council. We can afford to fund Wyoming Public Media. 
The proposed cuts or elimination of those programs amount to nothing more than hostage taking; an attempt to gain leverage in future negotiations. What the Freedom Caucus wants in exchange remains to be seen, but you can bet the concessions they want relate to the group’s extreme right-wing agenda.
The problem with all of this is that the Freedom Caucus has shown that it is willing to harm Wyoming citizens to achieve its right-wing goals. Defunding the Wyoming Business Council will make innovation and job creation in Wyoming much more difficult. The huge proposed cut to the University of Wyoming will force the school to end programs and lay off staff, and render our only four-year university less competitive in seeking enrollment. How much clearer a message could the Freedom Caucus send to our young citizens? If we don’t fund job creation and a robust education system, why should a young person stay in Wyoming?
Every concerned Wyoming citizen should contact their state legislators now and tell them in no uncertain terms that they don’t want right-wing politics to harm job creation and higher education.

In this dizzying new era of state terror, citizens and community leaders alike are trying to figure out what to do. What power do we have to face down a violent, repressive government targeting civilians in an operation aimed not at protecting public safety but at disrupting and destroying civil society? 
At a press conference with local media last week, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan promised to fight against a Minneapolis-like surge in Wisconsin, drawing a lot of probing follow-up questions from reporters. Pocan voted against $64 billion in funding for the Department of Homeland Security that passed the House and is now, belatedly, facing difficulties in the Senate. He said he would work with local law enforcement, support lawsuits filed by Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul and other state AGs against aggressive ICE deployments, and encourage peaceful protestors marching in inflatable dinosaur costumes. 
But the question of how to fight back is a tough one.
The federal government has created a massive paramilitary organization that is systematically terrorizing Democratic-led Midwestern cities. The 3,000 immigration agents in Minneapolis far outnumber the local police force there. We have never seen anything quite like this.
Minnesota elected officials seem to be struggling with the question of how to resist and how to defend their citizens. Along with strong language about the damage the federal crackdown is doing to the community, Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz repeatedly admonished protesters to remain peaceful, then deployed the Minnesota National Guard to block people from visiting a memorial at the site of Pretti’s death. Bringing in local and state law enforcement and the Guard to police protesters seems to buttress the Trump administration’s false claims that Minnesotans are the ones causing the violence, and that more armed men policing civilian neighborhoods will increase public safety. In reality, federal agents are the ones who are acting violently, not Minneapolis residents, and it’s not clear that local and state police are doing anything to protect the public from this threat.
The fact is, it’s hard to figure out what to do.
In Madison, on Saturday night more than 100 of my neighbors packed the James Reeb Unitarian Universalist Church for a potluck and discussion of nonviolent action, looking for answers to the terrible questions raised by the shooting death of yet another civilian in Minneapolis. 
How do we prepare for the possibility of an onslaught of armed federal agents into our own communities, busting down doors without warrants, dragging people out of their homes and firing on the neighbors who try to protect them? What power do we have to turn back the transformation of our country from democracy to authoritarian regime? 
The Madison event, planned before Pretti was killed, was organized by a coalition of dozens of peace and social justice groups under the umbrella Building Unity for Nonviolent Action. Speakers, including my friend John Nichols of The Nation magazine and Dane County Judge and Rev. Everett Mitchell, talked about the history of peaceful resistance in the U.S. The group showed part of the documentary “A Force More Powerful” about transformative nonviolent resistance struggles in India, the segregated American South, South Africa, Denmark and Chile. 
It was restorative to gather in person, take a break from isolation, helpless rage and doomscrolling and to spend some time contemplating the heroism of the Civil Rights movement activists who faced down hatred and violence with astounding courage and faith — despite all evidence to the contrary — in the fundamental decency of other people.
The difference between the Civil Rights era and today — and even the difference between the Black Lives Matter movement against police violence of a few years ago and today — is that the federal government can no longer be counted on to enforce civil rights, due process and justice. We are in a new era. “Those protections are gone,” Rev. Mitchell told the crowd. “So the only thing that you have available to you is each other.”
That bracing realization has spurred a proliferation of nonviolent resistance trainings in Minnesota and in other states, including Wisconsin.
One salutary side effect is that peaceful gatherings that bring out our capacity for love, mutual aid and connection help us avoid drowning in anger and despair.
Last weekend we drove to Minneapolis to visit our daughter who is, alarmingly, living in the middle of the chaos there. On our way to take her out for lunch we came upon a massive group of people holding a walking vigil in the neighborhood near where Nicole Good was shot. About 600 Minnesotans were walking the streets singing, “You are not alone” and “Hold on, here comes the dawn,” as immigrant children and their parents peered out the windows of locked houses, waving. It was an unexpected moment of grace. A glimpse of the humanity and caring that are still possible. We need to hold onto that vision.

With the bill filing deadline for the 2026 legislative session looming at the end of the month, the task force plans to draft a bill creating a waste diversion council that would assist Tennessee counties with finding ways to keep recyclable waste out of the state’s quickly-filling landfills and educate consumers about what they can recycle and where.
Tennessee businesses have told lawmakers in previous meetings that they are willing to purchase more recycled aluminum and glass if Tennessee can collect, process and produce sufficient quantities of recycled material to make it worthwhile. Right now, the state’s recycling rate is too low.
This comes as the Tennessee Waste to Jobs Act returns to the legislature for consideration. The act — introduced in 2025 by Sen. Heidi Campbell and Rep. Bob Freeman, both Nashville Democrats — would establish an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) model for packaging in Tennessee.
In EPR models, which have been in use internationally for years, companies that produce packaging products pay fees into a producer responsibility organization that uses those funds to improve recycling infrastructure and education. Tennessee’s bill would exempt small businesses that make less than $10 million in annual revenue, meaning that fees would be paid mostly by larger, national or multinational companies.

Campbell said the bill has built momentum since its introduction last year. The bill’s proponents have collected letters of support from several industry operators and a collection of Tennessee mayors from major cities and some rural communities, most recently including a letter from Dyer County Mayor David Quick.
But skepticism remains. A handful of states that have adopted EPR for packaging (many have EPR laws for specific products like batteries, paint and mattresses) are early in their implementation. 
Michael Hoffman, President and CEO of the National Waste and Recycling Association, countered that EPR does not improve recycling recovery rates or secondary markets. Hoffman told lawmakers that content commitments from producers — steady streams of recyclable materials — would stabilize secondary markets and encourage private capital investments in recycling infrastructure.
The state of trash
Regional landfill capacity and remaining life are on the decline in Tennessee, said Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Bureau of Environment Advisor Jeremy Hooper. Attempts to create new landfills or expand existing landfills are also seeing more pushback on the local level. 
“There’s less and less space over time, as population expands, for landfills,” Hooper told lawmakers during a January Senate Energy, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee meeting. “Those that are permitted are larger and more regional in nature, and there’s increasing demand on those, especially as landfills are denied expansions.”
Class I landfills, which accept the bulk of solid waste, currently have an estimated 10-plus years of life remaining in West and East Tennessee, Hooper said. But Middle Tennessee landfills are quickly approaching their limits. 
Middle Point Landfill — Middle Tennessee’s largest — has been a source of contention for years, with Murfreesboro leaders and residents opposing expansion plans and raising environmental concerns.
While the issue is regional now, that won’t always be the case, Hooper said.
“If a landfill closes down in Middle Tennessee, that has to go somewhere … waste going there right now could end up into the eastern or western grand divisions,” he said.
Landfills are expensive to run and time-consuming to permit, Hooper added, and as more landfills reach maximum capacity, waste will have to be transported elsewhere, adding to disposal costs.
Meanwhile, recycling markets and infrastructure are limited in Tennessee, making recycling more expensive as goods must be transported elsewhere for processing and reuse.  
“The take-home message for recycling is it has and continues to play a role in Tennessee, but the economics of recycling continue to make landfilling a cheaper disposal in many cases,” Hooper said.
Rep. Chris Todd, a Jackson Republican, has expressed his doubts about the cost of recycling compared to putting recyclable materials like cans and bottles into landfills. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
During a task force meeting on Jan. 22, Rep. Chris Todd, a Jackson Republican, asked if the value of recycled material to end users is high enough to support the cost of recycling on its own.
Memphis Solid Waste Director Philip Davis told the task force that right now, it’s not, but the dynamics are complex and depend on the volume of recycled material and transportation costs. If Tennessee had more local processors, for example, the value of the recycled material changes.
“The resource that I believe we’re conserving is the landfill airspace,” Davis said. “We’re trying to conserve that for industry,” instead of filling it up with materials that should be composted or diverted.
While Todd said it’s a “no brainer” that compostable materials should not go to landfills, he said he can’t see his constituents being willing to pay more to recycle items like cans and bottles if it’s cheaper to put them in a landfill.
Steering recycling away from landfills
The task force, created in 2025 by the legislature to plot a strategy for Tennessee waste through 2050, has heard hours of statements from waste industry professionals, county and state waste officials, think tanks, recycling advocates and more over the last several months.
“We’ve heard it time and time again with every presentation … we need consistency, we need some standardization,” committee member Donna Barrett said.
She will work with Todd and Sen. Shane Reeves to draft a bill to create the diversion council.










I may have a county that is so small that the mayor is the solid waste director … they don’t have time to interview a waste to energy (company) — a glass pickup company. They just don’t … have the bandwidth for that.


– Donna Barrett, Tennessee Solid Waste Task Force 


Barrett, whose record of service in Tennessee includes stints as a state representative and election commissioner, said the diversion council could be structured similar to the Tennessee Election Commission.
“We do not tell counties which election equipment to use, we tell them which ones are certified,” Barrett said, using the election commission as an example.
Training and education would be the same from county to county, but individual counties could use the diversion council as a “clearing house” or information repository to determine which options best fit them, she said. 
“I may have a county that is so small that the mayor is the solid waste director … they don’t have time to interview a waste to energy (company) — a glass pickup company. They just don’t … have the bandwidth for that.”
The council could be tasked with speaking with solid waste directors across the state, identifying needs and solutions, vetting vendors, setting vendor standards, providing standardized recycling layouts and signage for recycling and convenience centers, and standardizing education and awareness programs, Barrett suggested.
There are many details to work out, including the council’s size, membership, and funding. 
“I think we have an opportunity legislatively, and it’s got to happen fairly quickly,” Todd said, noting that new revenue will be tough to find this year, and looking to reassign existing money to fund a council might be more realistic.

A new class at the University of Wisconsin Law School aims to teach students about the perspectives of different people who are part of the criminal justice system, including those who are incarcerated. 
Dant’e Cottingham, one of the course instructors, was himself once locked up inside Wisconsin’s prison system. He said that according to stigma, he’s not supposed to be in the classroom.
“So I’m aware of that, and I carry that,” Cottingham said. “That’s important to me, because I want to make sure that the city, the state, the country knows that we are a lot more than our worst mistake.”
Instructing the class along with Cottingham is Adam Stevenson, a clinical professor and director of the Frank J. Remington Center, which houses the law school’s prison-based clinics as well as the public defender and prosecution externships. While Cottingham has the experience of being incarcerated in the prison system, Stevenson brings to the course the legal expertise of a law professor, and one who has worked with a program focused on legal assistance to incarcerated people. 
The Wednesday class, which has 19 students enrolled this semester,  counts for two credits. It’s titled “Criminal Justice System: A Lived Experience Perspective.” The class, examining how theory, policy and practice line up with reality — or diverge from it, according to the syllabus, may continue in the future depending on how this semester goes. 
In 1996, Cottingham was convicted of being party to a crime for first-degree intentional homicide for an offense that occurred when he was 17. While incarcerated, Cottingham applied to UW Madison’s program for legal assistance for incarcerated people and was assigned two law students who worked to help him win his release, he said. He was paroled in 2022. 
Cottingham served as interim associate director of the group Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing, and spoke publicly about Green Bay Correctional Institution, where he spent some of his imprisonment, and which has been the subject of criticism for inhumane conditions and calls to close the facility. Now 47, Cottingham is the reentry and outreach support specialist for the Remington Center. He said he helps men and women who are transitioning from incarceration.  
“I sit with people, build a rapport, get some insight and understanding to what their needs are,” Cottingham said. A person’s needs might involve housing, employment or medical care. 
Cottingham said that when he gave presentations in classes in the past,  students engaged with his description of his own experience, and he saw a need for the course he’s teaching now.
The experience of re-entering society after prison is one topic on the course schedule Cottingham shared with the Examiner. The arrest process, the trial process, sentencing, systemic inequality in criminal justice, and incarceration, and advocacy for reform and future directions are among the other course topics.
Guest speakers in the class range from Wisconsin Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy, to Wood County District Attorney Jonathan Barnett, to Sharmain Harris, whose book “Rising Above the Odds: My Journey from Pain and Prison to Power and Purpose” is one of the required materials for the course. Requirements include book reports that analyze autobiographies of people who have experienced incarceration.

Jini Jasti, a spokesperson for University of Wisconsin Law School, said UW Law’s motto is “Law in Action.” She said the school does not only teach the law on the books but also encourages students to see how it works from different perspectives, such as those of prosecutors, defense attorneys, victims, defendants and prisoners.  
“This unique class complements our other offerings, allowing students to hear about our trial, appellate and prison systems from someone who’s lived it,” Jasti said in a statement. 
State Public Defender Jennifer Bias and Robert Taliaferro, who was formerly incarcerated, visited the class on Wednesday. 
Bringing in these different perspectives helps  “tease out topics that we should be discussing when we’re talking about what the law is, how the law should operate etc.,” Stevenson said in a Jan. 16 interview with the Wisconsin Examiner. “One person’s perspective is definitely great in doing that, but having multiple perspectives and the potential disagreement, or the clash, if you will, can also give rise to some really rich conversation.”  
Stevenson said students will be graduating and working with clients as attorneys, and understanding the perspectives of people in the criminal justice system is important. 
Lara Hendrix, a third year law student, is planning to be a public defender after graduation. She said she thought the class would be valuable for her future career. 
Hendrix hopes that eventually people who don’t plan to practice criminal law take the class. 
“These are real people with families, and people that love them, and other people that are affected,” Hendrix said, “and that needs so much more attention than it gets.”

President Donald Trump in September issued a proclamation implementing a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applicants. The fee does not apply to current H-1B visa holders. Historically, the visa fees paid by companies ranged from under $1,000 to a few thousand dollars.

Trump called for American companies to rely on American workers for these roles, making unsubstantiated claims of “abuse” in the H-1B visa program.
The top H-1B employer in Colorado is the University of Colorado system, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data, though CU spokesperson Michele Ames said it is unclear exactly what the USCIS numbers reflect, since it appears only to list the university’s Denver campus.  
CU has 328 H-1B visa holders across all campuses and system offices in Boulder, Denver, Aurora and Colorado Springs, Ames said. Those people serve in various faculty, staff, research and clinical roles. 
“Each one of our visa holders are a valued member of our CU family,” Ames said in a statement. “Our ability to deliver world-class education to our more than 67,000 students, successfully compete for $1.7 billion in research funding each year, deliver life-saving treatment to thousands and provide $12.2 billion in economic impact to our state and nation rely — in part — on the contributions these individuals make every day.”










Our district will not be able to pay this fee for these visas.


– Scott Pribble, spokesperson for Denver Public Schools


Schools and universities use H-1B visas to hire for positions that can be difficult to fill, according to Dan Berger, a senior attorney with Path2Papers, a clinic at Cornell Law School that works to connect people who came to the U.S. as minors without authorization with employer-sponsored immigration options. 
“I think most colleges and universities want to hire the most qualified person for the position, and often it’s something that’s very specialized,” Berger said. “So it may be that you have the top five people in the world who work on a particular topic are spread out all over the world, and so what it does is … it takes away a potential pool of talent.” 
‘Confusion and harm’
H-1B visa holders support K-12 education as well. Denver Public Schools is the fifth biggest employer of H-1B visa holders in the state, according to USCIS data. The district’s internal tracking system based on school years shows that the district had 117 H-1B visas approved for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 school years.
The fee proclamation has caused “confusion and harm” in the district’s recruitment and hiring strategies, district spokesperson Scott Pribble said. The district’s visa holders fill high-demand positions, including Spanish bilingual elementary, math, science and special education teachers, and certain special provider roles. 
“Our district will not be able to pay this fee for these visas,” Pribble said in a statement. “It creates a problem recruiting qualified professionals, often holding multiple advanced degrees and bringing decades of classroom experience.”
With over 6,000 teachers in the district, the H-1B visa holders represent just under 2% of classroom staff. Over 30% of students in the district are English-language learners, and 34% of its students are Spanish-speaking. 
Maintaining an appropriate staffing level “is critical for the success of our students,” Pribble said, adding that the H-1B visa program has been imperative in supporting positions that teach students and offer legally mandated student services. 
“DPS competes in a constrained labor market for qualified educators and specialized staff,”  Pribble said. “In that environment, the district relies on all lawful recruiting pathways, including the ability to recruit and retain qualified candidates through the H-1B program for certain hard to fill roles.”
Graduate would have to leave
Colorado State University employs 131 H-1B visa holders. Most of those employees are facility or research associates, though some hold staff positions, CSU spokesperson Tiana Kennedy said. 
While initially it was unclear what the $100,000 proclamation covered, Berger said, it has since been clarified that it only applies to someone being hired directly from abroad. So, for example, if someone graduates with a Ph.D. from a university in the U.S. and a university wants to hire them, that would be considered a “change of status”and wouldn’t require the $100,000 fee.  
But the government still has discretion to approve status changes, and while Berger said it previously would do that “pretty freely,” it is “looking much more carefully at those cases.” 
“If a change of status is denied here, then the person would have to leave, and then the $100,000 fee would have to be paid,” Berger said. 
Since universities hire for the academic year, it is too early to tell how the changes from the Trump administration will affect CU’s hiring process, Ames said.  
“We will understand much more after we have been able to experience a full hiring cycle under the changes,” she said. 
The new visa fee is “just one of several hurdles” Denver schools have faced under the Trump administration, Pribble said. 
“The frequency of these policy shifts has created a climate of uncertainty, leading many of our teachers to seek urgent guidance,” Pribble said. “They are rightfully concerned about how these constant changes affect their professional standing and their families’ futures.”

(Photos courtesy of the candidates)At least three candidates plan to run for two seats on the North Dakota Public Service Commission in the 2026 election, with both incumbents announcing campaigns this month.  
Commissioner Sheri Haugen-Hoffart announced earlier this month that she will seek reelection to a six-year term. 
Haugen-Hoffart was appointed to the PSC in February 2022 and won the election for the seat the same year.
There also is a two-year term on the ballot. Julie Fedorchak was elected to a six-year term in 2022 but she gave up the seat when she was elected to Congress in 2024. 
Jill Kringstad, who was appointed in January 2025 to fill Fedorchak’s seat, announced last week that she will run for the two-year portion remaining on that term.  
Deven Styczynski of Enderlin says he also intends to run, but has not yet decided which term he would run for. 
Styczynski and other potential candidates must declare which seat they are running for when they file for candidacy with the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office. The filing deadline is April 6. 
Haugen-Hoffart, Kringstad and Styczynski are all Republicans. 
Neither Haugen-Hoffart nor Kringstad committed to seeking the nomination at the North Dakota GOP convention. Without a party nomination, candidates must gather petition signatures to get on the ballot. 
Styczynski said he would seek the party nomination for the seat he decides to file for. 
Other candidates could emerge before the April 6 deadline.
In 2024, Tracey Wilkie announced her candidacy at the Democratic-NPL state convention. She lost to incumbent Republican Randy Christmann, receiving about 30% of the vote. 
Wilkie told the North Dakota Monitor that she has not considered running this year and encouraged other candidates to come forward. 
The three-person commission oversees rates for-profit electric utilities, issues permits for infrastructure such as pipelines, powerlines and wind turbines, and manages the state’s coal mine reclamation program, among other responsibilities.  
Styczynski said he’s running for the PSC in part due to concerns about rate increases from power companies. 
He called a compromise plan to allow Xcel Energy to increase electric rates by 10% for North Dakota customers “ludicrous.” 
Haugen-Hoffart defended the pending rate increase, saying it was the first request to raise rates in four years and electric rates. 
Kringstad said abundant, reliable and affordable energy is a top priority. 
Haugen-Hoffart and Kringstad both pointed to federal reporting that says North Dakota has the lowest electricity rates in the country.

As it turned out, home improvement projects boomed and so did requests for the couple’s FabriPlas Metal products that range from fun fence toppers to deck panels featuring trees, wildlife and other nature scenes.

“Demand really went up,” Sheila told the Nebraska Examiner, “Like, it’s not stopped.”
A new state manufacturing modernization grant, authorized under a 2025 Nebraska law, will add a plasma cutting machine and a painter/welder to the business’ seven-person staff, allowing quicker response to custom orders coming from across the country.
FabriPlas Metal is among five small manufacturers selected from more than 50 applicants that will share $250,000. Winners are to use the state funds to develop innovative approaches to building their operations and boosting productivity, according to a statement last week from the the Nebraska Department of Labor, which oversees the program.
“I am so impressed with the commitment from businesses across the state to utilizing technology in ways that will grow and sustain their companies while also providing new employment opportunities,” said Commissioner of Labor Katie Thurber, who said her agency received over 50 applications.
Each recipient of a Nebraska Manufacturing Modernization and Workforce Development Pilot Investment Act grant, provided under last year’s Legislative Bill 265, is to receive $50,000 and provide matching funds to complete their project, the department said.

The legislation, sponsored by State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, was described as a one-time grant program to increase integration of smart technologies. Winners had to have at least three years of operation, at least three full-time employees and derive 51% of revenue from manufactured goods. 
At FabriPlas, Sheila Johnson said finding skilled workers is among the biggest challenges for the couple’s shop, whose registered name is PAJ Industries LLC. She also handles marketing and manages design work. Her husband has three decades of fabrication experience, cutting, sanding and finishing parts.
Their customer base is homeowners taking on do-it-yourself projects. But Sheila said more architects and developers are seeking their products. “We are so backed up,” she said.

Today, workers in all those states are bringing home paychecks that are far fatter than those of Michigan workers. That’s because those states made the transition to a knowledge economy that largely bypassed Michigan, according to a study by a University of Michigan economist.
“We were so concerned with keeping auto jobs that we missed the stuff that was coming,” said Don Grimes, who has forecast Michigan’s economy for decades and who counts himself among those who initially didn’t fully grasp how the economy was fundamentally shifting to high-wage, high-education-attainment service jobs.
The wage gaps between Michigan and what Grimes described as benchmark states are startling. Adjusted for cost of living, real wages in Massachusetts last year were an average $16,116 per worker higher than in Michigan, while Texas wages were $5,513 higher.
In 1990, North Carolina workers earned an average $8,598 less than Michigan workers. Today they bring home $566 more than their Michigan counterparts.
North Carolina’s economy has largely shifted away from employment in tobacco, textiles and furniture to higher-wage jobs in financial services, pharmaceuticals and various technologies.
“North Carolina used to have a higher concentration of manufacturing than Michigan did,” Grimes told me. “They’ve made the transition to a knowledge economy really well.”

And it’s not just those states that became far wealthier than Michigan over the past four decades. In 1990, Michigan’s cost-of-living adjusted wages were 9.5% higher than the national average, the sixth highest in the nation.
Today, the state’s wages are 4.2% lower than the national average despite Michigan’s relatively low cost of living, the U of M study said.
For decades, Michigan prospered from a healthy wage premium in manufacturing and other blue-collar jobs. But that premium has fallen from about $11,500 above the national average in 1990 to just $3,051 in 2024. Plus, the share of blue-collar jobs to total Michigan jobs has fallen from 32.9% in 1990 to 27% percent in 2024.
“We’re getting relatively poorer,” Grimes said. “We want to see our glory days. Now it’s a new formula.”
That new formula is a big concentration of high-wage jobs in areas such as information technology and financial services that can lift wages overall. Those are areas where Michigan lags far behind.
The state does possess thousands of good-paying engineering jobs. But many of those are connected to the auto industry, which pay far less than in other high-tech industries.
Michigan’s efforts to protect those positions, as well as auto factory jobs, have not succeeded. Michigan has lost about half of its auto manufacturing jobs since 1990. And many white-collar auto technology jobs have moved to Silicon Valley, Tennessee and other places, Grimes said.
“That’s really sort of depressing,” he said.
Michigan also has fallen far below the nation and benchmark states in wages paid in private-sector, high-wage service industries. Those jobs paid an average $88,655 in the state in 2024, about $11,000 less than the national average.
Those Michigan wages were an average $27,855 less than in Massachusetts, $10,494 less than in North Carolina and $9,377 behind Texas.
Closing those gaps will require a “massive revamp” of economic development efforts and attitudes by residents and policymakers about how Michigan can regain its wealth standing, Grimes said.
“It’s astounding what Michigan did in the ‘40s, ‘50s and ‘60s,” he said. “But we’re still looking backward. Everybody’s got to think differently.”

That’s a tall order at a time when politicians on both sides of the aisle are preaching the gospel of manufacturing as economic salvation, and when universities that produce high-wage workers are under attack by the Trump administration and many Republicans.
Grimes said the reality is that Michigan needs to attract more rich people who can boost the state’s wealth with their own incomes and the wages their companies provide. He’s blunt about that view, which he admits that candidates for political office this year are unlikely to embrace.
“Michigan should only give subsidies for jobs that pay over $100,000, and that should go up over time,” he said. “We need to eliminate the idea of trying to bring in factories” to create wealth. “You have to focus on jobs that pay a lot.”
While Grimes is not particularly confident that Michigan can catch up to other states that have transitioned to a knowledge economy any time soon, he said the state has powerful economic development tools — “extraordinary” water resources and world-class universities it can promote to attract the best and brightest.
West Michigan is outperforming the rest of the state in part because of its proximity to Lake Michigan, which is attracting investment from wealthy Chicagoans, Grimes said. The state could step up efforts to attract more wealthy job creators from the Windy City, among other places, he said.
“We need to go after people we’re not going after now,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/computer-chip-getty-images-1024x6831680787758-1.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 06:57:06.815397

(Photo courtesy of Joy Holmes)Joy Holmes, a mother from Conway who homeschools her two children, has depended on PBS’ content over the past several years. Beloved characters Clifford the Big Red Dog and Wild Kratts are like family for her kids, who are on the autism spectrum.
While her children struggle to connect with people, “it’s much easier to connect with a show and connect with characters” from those long-running programs, Holmes said.
“It’s a fundamental part of our day,” Holmes said. “We don’t have a day where we’re not using the [PBS] kids’ programming.”
As Arkansas prepares to become the first state in the nation to disaffiliate from PBS, leaders of the rebranded Arkansas TV insist they’re keeping viewers in mind as they replace Big Bird, Ken Burns and Daniel Tiger with locally-made productions.
“What we have the opportunity to do now is to march boldly forward with a business model that can work for the long term,” Carlton Wing, the former Republican lawmaker who is now Arkansas TV’s CEO, said at a Little Rock Rotary Club meeting this month.

But interviews with parents like Holmes and feedback the state has received show the challenges the public television network faces in winning over those viewers. 
If the agency breaks away from PBS headquarters on July 1 as planned, the shows Holmes’ children enjoy will be available online and on the free PBS KIDS app, but no longer on television.
The Arkansas PBS Commission voted 6-2 in December to cut ties with the national network. The decision came as a shock to PBS headquarters and to Arkansans throughout the state, according to correspondence with Arkansas TV that the Arkansas Advocate obtained via a public records request.
In his Rotary Club address, Wing said the same thing he told the PBS Commission: No longer having to pay PBS dues was the only way to keep the network afloat. The network lost $2.5 million in programming and operational funds after the Corporation for Public Broadcasting lost federal funding last summer, and CPB officially shut down this month.
Holmes called the disaffiliation “an ideological move.” Dozens of Arkansans made similar comments in emails to Arkansas TV.
“As an Arkansas educator, I am profoundly concerned that the shortsighted desire to eradicate PBS that was driven by Republican leaders nationally and led by President [Donald] Trump deprives children across the nation of the wonderful programming that explores history, culture, and diverse voices,” one viewer wrote.

Public Comment 20 
Another viewer said the availability of PBS kids’ shows exclusively online is untenable because “many families do not have a dedicated computer/laptop for their child/children to use.” 
 Financial concerns

Katie Cramer, Wing’s executive assistant, answered many frustrated emails with the same response. She repeated Wing’s financial argument and said the network’s “attempts to negotiate lower annual dues were, unfortunately, unsuccessful.”
Some viewers who complained noted Arkansas’ growing budget surplus.
“If this was a priority, it would be taken care of by the legislature and the governor,” a viewer from Fayetteville wrote.
Cramer wrote in response that Wing would support rejoining PBS if the network were able to negotiate lower dues and that he “has been a genuine supporter of PBS for a long time.”

Wing was a Republican state representative from 2017 until September, when he resigned to take over the public television network. He was among the lawmakers who urged their colleagues to pass the network’s appropriation bill in 2024, when the bill passed after three attempts. The appropriation took five attempts to pass the House in 2025.

Due to this years-long struggle, asking the state to give the network more spending authority “is not realistic,” Wing said.
The network has caught the ire of some Republican state lawmakers, including Jonesboro Sen. Dan Sullivan, who last year unsuccessfully pushed for abolishing the Arkansas PBS commission.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed Sullivan’s wife, Maria Sullivan, to the PBS Commission in 2024. She was among the commissioners who voted to cut ties with PBS.
 Projected viewership losses

Holmes spent years in Japan as part of a military family, and her PBS Passport subscription allows her to watch Japanese TV programs that remind her of her childhood, she said.
Those who pay $60 per year can access PBS Passport’s full library of programs, including Antiques Roadshow and Masterpiece Theatre. Wing has repeatedly said Passport will allow Arkansans to keep watching shows that will no longer be on TV, but Holmes said the cost is significant for her single-income household.
Some viewers are threatening to not just tune out, but no longer give.
“As I grew up, my worldview expanded with shows such as Rick Steves’ and Ken Burns’ numerous documentaries,” one person wrote to Arkansas TV. “After a decade in a neighboring state, I moved back to Arkansas and my wife and I are raising children in this great state. We are also new contributors to Arkansas PBS… However, I am disgusted by this decision and I will not be giving to this new entity.”
The Arkansas PBS Foundation, which manages donations to the network, provided a one-time emergency fund of $1.5 million last year to support both operating expenses and about half of the national dues. Wing and Cramer said this effort is unlikely to be repeatable.

Arkansas PBS Foundation CEO Marge Betley told viewers in an August 2025 marketing email that enough support from donors would allow the network to “continue delivering the trusted, inspiring programming that you value” despite the loss of CPB funding.
Holmes said she will continue subscribing to Passport via another state’s PBS station even though the app’s selection of programs varies state by state. Several viewers who contacted Arkansas TV about the disaffiliation said they will similarly redirect their subscriptions and donations.
“I’m 71 and have faithfully watched PBS my entire life,” wrote a viewer from Harrison. “Please reconsider the decision to leave the PBS system. I will switch viewership to another PBS station otherwise.”

Public Comment 34 
 Programming alternatives

Arkansas TV’s mission is to produce original, Arkansas-focused programming, and some content creators in the state have already contacted the network about potential collaborations, Wing said.
“We are bringing it back home to educational content for Arkansans so that we can grow and make sure that this public television model works for the next generation,” he said.
When asked if Arkansas TV has any processes to ensure its original programming is unbiased, Wing said the network will work with the state Department of Education to “make sure that anything that goes through our educational content matches Arkansas standards.”
The education department did not have any documentation related to those efforts, a spokesperson said in response to a public records request from the Advocate.
PBS programs will continue airing on Arkansas TV until June 30 unless the commission votes to reverse its decision to disaffiliate. 
A viewer from Jasper said PBS shows are providing “a positive alternative to graphic violence and sex seen on mainstream television.” Holmes agreed that PBS’ kids’ shows can’t be replicated anywhere else.
“The other stuff that’s free is just crap and not good for brains, and especially not good for autistic brains,” Holmes said. “So this loss is really big for us.”

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)After North Carolina’s two largest medical providers halted gender-affirming care for patients below the age of 19, trans youth in the state are left with few options for treatment.
Ahead of a looming Trump administration crackdown on treatments like hormone replacement therapy — which substitutes sex-related hormones like estrogen or testosterone to physically transition patients’ bodies to align with their gender identity — for patients 18 and younger, Advocate Health and UNC Health have ended such gender-affirming care for anyone under 19.
“It’s very disappointing that they would do this,” said Ivy Johnson, an attorney with the ACLU of North Carolina. “It’s completely ignoring the fact that 18-year-olds are adults in this country, and I think it’s irresponsible to discontinue care for people who’ve already been under a certain course of treatment.”
The restrictions adopted by UNC Health and Advocate Health exceed a North Carolina law passed in 2023 over then-Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto that barred minors from receiving gender-affirming care, but exempted patients already undergoing treatment due to health risks associated with halting care.

Just eight days into his second term, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the Health and Human Services Department to crack down on medical interventions such as puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy, and other treatments aimed at facilitating gender transition for patients under 19.
That manifested in December as a set of HHS regulations that would condition Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program for hospitals on compliance with federal restrictions on gender-affirming care, among other measures intended to pressure health care providers.
Now, trans youth in North Carolina who are not yet 19 will be forced to halt their care, find alternate providers in a state with dwindling options, or leave the state for treatment.
Heron Greenesmith, deputy director of the Transgender Law Center, stressed that the proposed HHS restrictions are not set to take effect for months, and that hospitals choosing to end care early are doing so voluntarily. “Right now, there is no ban.”
“Pre-compliance has been a problem for trans-supporting, trans-inclusive organizations and agencies across the country, not just for trans-affirming care,” Greenesmith said. “It could be fear for funding or for retribution from the federal government.”
While federal opposition to gender-affirming care focuses on health risks of procedures — with Trump’s executive order warning that some recipients “will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding” — Johnson and Greenesmith both warned of complications from suddenly stopping gender-affirming care.
“You’ll have physical changes that can be rapid,” Greenesmith said. “The return of dysphoria is going to be a big impact and that obviously has mental health impacts, including an increased risk of suicidality and suicidal ideation, and then the other kind of emotional and mental health crises, anxiety, depression, PTSD.”
Advocate Health, which oversees state provider Atrium Health, implemented the restrictions in August. UNC Health began notifying patients in September that care would be discontinued, though no public announcement accompanied the policy shift. Both hospital systems have been connecting affected patients with support resources, including a newly established 24/7 hotline at Advocate aimed at providing counseling.
UNC Health spokesman Alan Wolf said in a statement that concerns over the federal regulatory environment prompted the decision to restrict care.
“UNC Health follows state and federal law related to medical services around gender transition. While state law limits these services to patients 18 and older, given the unsettled state of federal guidelines, last year we began limiting these services to individuals age 19 or older,” Wolf said. “UNC Health remains committed to caring and treating all patients.”
In comments to NC Health News last year, Advocate Health raised similar concerns: “This new policy allows our hospitals, clinics and pharmacies to continue caring for all patients’ health needs in the changing federal environment.”
Duke Health, whose policy on gender-affirming care for minors remains unchanged according to their website, now has a several-months wait for those wishing to switch to their services.
“Due to increasing demand, we are currently booking new patient appointments several months out,” the page for the Duke Child and Adolescent Gender Care Clinic reads. “We are working on strategies to accommodate this increased demand. Thank you for your patience.”
Duke Health did not respond to multiple requests for comment on their gender-affirming care policies or whether patients who have lost access to care from other providers may receive expedited appointments.

The HHS restrictions are the subject of a federal lawsuit led by Oregon and joined by 18 other states, including the District of Columbia. At the state level, hospitals themselves are facing litigation. In Colorado, several families sued Children’s Hospital Colorado in state court over its suspension of gender-affirming care for minors, which has halted treatment for around 800 patients.
But North Carolina officials have declined to take action. Attorney General Jeff Jackson did not join the challenge to the administration’s policies, despite participating in a series of high-profile lawsuits against Trump executive actions last year, meaning state providers will not benefit from any injunction against the HHS restrictions.
North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Summer Tonizzo said in a statement that “gender dysphoria care is not covered by any NC Medicaid plans,” citing the 2023 state law, when asked about the department’s response to hospital restrictions.
Johnson, the ACLU NC attorney, said she believes hospitals may be illegally discriminating against patients on the basis of sex by suspending gender-affirming care.
“This seems unconstitutional and dangerous on the part of these hospitals, whose functions are otherwise supposed to be to provide medically necessary care to their patients,” Johnson said. “I would encourage people to reach out to us.”

Two similar bills — House Bill 4018 and Senate Bill 390 — are advancing through the Legislature’s separate bod[...]","Flooding engulfing parts of Glenwood Recreational Park near Princeton, West Virginia, was just one example of the widespread impact of a February 2025 storm. (Greg Jordan | Bluefield Daily Telegraph) After two widespread flooding events hit communities in both southern and northern West Virginia last year, taking lives and wrecking numerous structures, the Legislature is eyeing changes to how money could be disbursed following such catastrophes.
Two similar bills — House Bill 4018 and Senate Bill 390 — are advancing through the Legislature’s separate bodies. They would revise the rules that dictate how money is given out from the state’s Flood Resiliency Trust Fund and what projects or individuals qualify as being a priority for funding.
While it’s early in the session, those two bills — plus one to require dredging in flood-prone waterways to lower the likelihood of flooding — are the only ones introduced so far this session related to flooding. Meanwhile, flooding disasters are likely to become more commonplace in the state as floodplains grow and as prevention efforts stall.
Both HB 4018 and SB 390 would give the State Resiliency Officer authority to disburse funds to individuals, local governments, state agencies or other organizations after a flooding event as long as the projects align with the state’s official Flood Resiliency Plan.
They would require that at least half of all money given through the trust fund goes toward “nature-based solutions,” including restoring wetlands and improving floodplains, buying out flood-prone properties or helping residents relocate out of high-risk areas. A portion of the funding would be specifically set aside for property acquisition and similar mitigation efforts.
Local governments seeking funding would need to adopt or commit to flood-related standards, including hazard mitigation planning, emergency operations plans and, in some cases, participation in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Community Rating System.
Overall, any dollars distributed through the trust fund must be used to enhance flood prevention, with particular emphasis on low-income communities and those that have experienced repeated flooding.
But even if new guidelines for spending are adopted by the Legislature, the fund they apply to — the state’s Flood Resiliency Trust Fund — remains empty as it has never been allocated money since its inception in 2023. Neither has the state’s Flood Recovery Trust Fund. 
While Gov. Patrick Morrisey is asking to move $10 million to the Flood Resiliency Trust Fund in his proposed state budget, that money would go toward developing a warning system to give residents in flood-prone areas more notice and, hopefully, save lives.
Money to help with recovery and prevent devastating flooding in the first place, however, would still be lacking.
Under former Gov. Jim Justice, the Republican-controlled Legislature repeatedly opted against sending money to the trust fund despite requests from Justice, even while leaders boasted about record-setting revenue coming into the state.
In the House of Delegates this past legislative session, only 19 lawmakers — every Democrat in the House and 10 Republicans — voted in support of an amendment to the proposed state budget that would have put $50 million in the fund.
Last June, after flooding in northern West Virginia cost nine people their lives, Morrisey said he planned to have “additional discussions with the Legislature and others about the importance of flood prevention.”
But in his State of the State address earlier this month, the only flood measure mentioned by Morrisey was the early warning system; overall flood prevention or recovery was not made a priority and funding for either initiative remains lacking.
Earlier this month, disaster recovery experts told members of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Flooding that a lack of funds were making it difficult for case managers to help individuals with long-term recovery, including issues related to housing, rebuilding and more.
Lora Pierce, a disaster recovery specialist with Catholic Charities West Virginia, said that acute recovery — mucking out buildings, removing fallen trees, meeting immediate resource needs for those impacted by flooding — isn’t much of a problem in the state because there are so many groups that volunteer.
“It’s that long-term recovery, six months after the fact when all of the immediate needs may have been met,” Pierce said. “The biggest challenge and hurdle is having disaster case managers work with these people on their recovery to get them back to a safe and secure home.”
Pierce said nearly all long-term recovery efforts are taken on by volunteers. In some events — including last year’s flooding in Southern West Virginia — Pierce said there are “no disaster case managers at all” to help with recovery. Part of this, she said, is because there is little money available to pay people for these necessary services. 
Because there is not any state money put aside for flood recovery, Pierce said any funds that do come in for communities are either from local charities and nonprofit organizations or from the federal government.
Pierce said she would like to see the state remodel its trust funds to reflect the federal government’s to ensure that families receive money directly, but also that case managers and other necessary positions can be filled and compensated.
Nearly $41 million was distributed federally to families affected by flooding in the coalfields last February. That money was necessary, Pierce said, but she questioned how things will look in the future given the instability at the FEMA.
Catherine Carr Clinch, president of Tidal Basin, a disaster service provider, told lawmakers in the same meeting they should be aware that “it’s unclear what the future of funding for the federal government (following disasters) looks like.”
“FEMA’s role is changing, and the agency may no longer have the same capacity or ability to support the states,” Clinch said. “… We strongly advise you to consider funding (the Flood Resiliency Trust Fund and the Flood Recovery Trust Fund).”
HB 4018 is currently under consideration by the House Committee on Government Organization. SB 390 will be on first reading in the Senate on Monday.

(Getty Images)Wolverines in the Lower 48 states were trapped, hunted and poisoned to near extinction in the late 1800s and early 1900s and have not recovered, just the opposite in fact. It took court action by the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and other conservation groups to finally get the dwindling population listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in 2023.
The federal government is legally required to designate “critical habitat” to protect ecosystems for the recovery of threatened and endangered species, but has failed to do so for wolverines, which are hanging on by the thinnest of threads. To stave off extinction, we need to protect the habitat in which they can survive — a challenge now further exacerbated by an increasingly hot climate diminishing the deep snows they require for denning and food storage.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service noted that wolverine populations are relatively small, fragmented and isolated from larger populations in Canada. The Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that roughly 50 wolverines occupied the Idaho/Montana linkage area at the time of listing. They also estimated that roughly 63 wolverines live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
It’s estimated there are only 318 wolverines remaining in the entire Lower 48 states. Scientists believe the “effective population,” which is the number of individuals capable of reproducing and contributing to the next generation, is likely less than 40.
You read that right, fewer than 40 wolverines are currently capable of keeping the species from going extinct in the contiguous U.S. And what is the U.S. Fish and Wild Service doing to recover wolverines as required by law? Not much.
To protect the ecosystems upon which wolverines depend, the Endangered Species Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to designate “critical habitat” — the areas that provide the secure habitat where they are protected from threats like incidental trapping and can successfully reproduce.
The designation of “critical habitat” includes those areas occupied by the species at the time of listing that possess the physical and biological features such as food, water and shelter needed for survival and recovery. These areas may also include areas not yet occupied but needed for future population growth.
Because critical habitat designation is essential to the conservation of the species, special management consideration or protections may be required. The designation also guides federal actions to prevent destruction or modification of this habitat, thereby increasing species’ chances of recovery.
Unfortunately the Fish and Wildlife Service has not followed the law, has not designated critical habitat, and is shirking its duty to keep wolverines from extinction — which is why the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and our fellow plaintiffs recently filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Montana.
Although the majority (95%) of wolverine habitat in the Lower 48 states is federally owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service, there are no regulatory mechanisms or standards in Forest Service Land and Resource Management Plans to protect wolverines and their habitat. Not only is nothing being done to protect and restore wolverines and the ecosystems upon which they depend, the Forest Service has announced a massive 25% increase in national forest logging, in effect, destroying what critical habitat may be left on public lands.
The Fish and Wildlife Service has failed — and continues to fail — to comply with its mandatory, non-discretionary, duty to designate critical habitat for wolverines as required by Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act. To maintain and recover the species our choice was either take the delinquent agency to court or watch wolverines dwindle into extinction. We sided with the wolverines and are being represented by the Western Environmental Law Center.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The Mississippi Department of Corrections quietly entered into an agreement with a powerful law firm last summer to monitor its private medical contractor after Mississippi Today reports of alleged denial of health care in state prisons. 
The move comes after the state Legislature instructed the department to deliver a report on the contractor’s performance and nearly a year after the agency entered into a medical services contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars it was responsible for overseeing. The Corrections Department hired Butler Snow, a politically connected law firm in Mississippi that has defended prison systems and private prison health contractors in civil rights lawsuits alleging health care failures in several states, to monitor its prison medical contract, a letter obtained by Mississippi Today reveals. 
The letter, which has not previously been reported, from Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain to Senate Appropriations Chairman Briggs Hopson, a Republican from Vicksburg, says a Butler Snow attorney will manage a team “experienced in correctional healthcare management” to conduct contract oversight. The state Personnel Board approved the agreement with Butler Snow in August, the letter says.  
Kansas-based VitalCore Health Strategies, LLC, holds a three-year contract worth over $357 million to provide medical services to people incarcerated in Mississippi prisons. The company has increasingly come under scrutiny after a state lawmaker raised the alarm about numerous inmates suffering from treatable illnesses and Mississippi Today began investigating the alleged routine denial of health care in Mississippi prisons. 
Mississippi Today’s Behind Bars, Beyond Care series has documented potentially thousands of people living with hepatitis C going without treatment, an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings one woman said led to a terminal diagnosis. One ex-corrections official said people are experiencing widespread medical neglect in Mississippi’s prisons and turned over internal messages bemoaning the contractor’s care to Mississippi Today. 
In a statement, VitalCore spokesperson Timothy Keck said the company would comply with the new team monitoring its work.
“VitalCore’s commitment to our patients is the same regardless of any oversight,” Keck said. “We will comply with any audit and inspection and will fully engage with the MDOC in that process.”
MDOC spokesperson Kate Head did not respond to a request for comment. 
The agreement with the Department of Corrections tasks Butler Snow with compiling a team that includes a licensed physician, a licensed mental health professional and a person with experience in correctional health care management. The team will complete an initial review of health and mental health services, identify urgent performance issues and develop tools to monitor the contractor’s work. It will also recommend clawbacks — or the recovery of funds already paid — for contract requirements that are not met. 
Many of the issues the monitoring team will review, such as infectious disease control and infirmary operations, mirror concerns raised by Rep. Becky Currie, chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee, who has been attempting to pass new legislation forcing the Corrections Department and VitalCore to improve their delivery of medical care to prisoners. 
Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, tried to introduce a sweeping set of reforms in 2025 that included giving the Mississippi State Department of Health the authority to monitor prison health care. The bill was defeated, in part due to opposition from the Office of Gov. Tate Reeves, who wanted to award monitoring authority to a private firm, according to Currie. 
“Yet, we spend $700,000 on a report,” Currie previously said to Mississippi Today. 
Butler Snow received a one-year contract worth $687,000 for these services. According to the letter to Hopson, the Department of Corrections held an orientation meeting with the compliance team Nov. 10 and crafted a site visit schedule, beginning with a visit to the Central Mississippi Correctional Center in “early 2026.”
Butler Snow has been paid about $249,000 so far for its monitoring work, according to state records. 
The initial contract year with Butler Snow does not include review of dental, dialysis, vision, discharge planning or long-term care. In a December report, the state’s legislative watchdog agency found that Mississippi prisoners were likely left without adequate dental care for months as the state’s private prison health care contractor failed to meet staffing requirements and the Department of Corrections failed to document the problem.
A bill passed by lawmakers in 2025 ordered the Department of Corrections to use $690,000 of funds clawed back from VitalCore to monitor and review the health contract and provide a report to lawmakers by Dec. 15. 
Currie believed she would have a completed audit in hand heading into the 2026 legislative sessions. But she learned in late December that the monitoring team had only just been retained, and their work had not begun, she said.
“Everyone left thinking that we were getting an audit and we appropriated money to do it,” Currie said. “Not getting an audit that we were promised has haunted so much.”
Currie has again introduced a wide range of reforms in 2026. 
This year’s bills would establish a corrections ombudsman to investigate health care related complaints, establish hepatitis C and HIV treatment programs, provide kiosks for prisoners to request medical attention and require correctional officers to wear body cameras. But most of the bills have been double-referred, meaning they must be passed by two committees before a full vote. That is sometimes a sign that a bill doesn’t have the support of a chamber’s leadership.
William “Bill” Lunsford, the Butler Snow attorney MDOC tapped to lead the contract monitoring team, has represented the Alabama Department of Corrections in civil rights cases, defending the agency against claims of inadequate health care. Since 2018, the corrections agency has paid him over $40 million for legal services, according to Alabama Department of Finance online records. 
Lunsford has defended the department in Braggs vs. Alabama Department of Corrections, a lawsuit filed in 2014 by people incarcerated in Alabama and the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program that alleged the agency denied health care. The lawsuit alleged prisoners were denied hepatitis C treatment, echoing claims from people incarcerated in Mississippi, and that prisoners lost the use of their arms and legs after medical treatment was denied or delayed. A similar case played out in Mississippi when a man with a broken arm had a limb amputated after he was allegedly denied care. 
Lunsford previously sat on the board of YesCare, a Tennessee-based private prison medical contractor formerly called Corizon Health, Inc. He also defended Corizon in a class action lawsuit filed by people in Idaho Department of Corrections custody living with hepatitis C who alleged the agency refused to administer treatment in line with standards of care. 
In July, Lunsford and two of his colleagues at Butler Snow were disqualified by a federal judge in a case where he represented former Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn, after one of Lunsford’s colleagues admitted to inadvertently including made-up citations generated by artificial intelligence in court filings. 
Lunsford has litigated and resolved numerous class actions against correctional agencies and vendors and regularly advises clients on compliance and liability issues related to correctional health care standards, according to his profile on Butler Snow’s website. 
Butler Snow also wrote the Mississippi Department of Correction’s request for proposals for the medical contract. 
Lunsford did not respond to Mississippi Today’s request for comment. 
The agreement with Butler Snow raises questions about whether MDOC was monitoring the medical contract before it retained the law firm last summer. 
The contract executed by the agency in October 2024 tasked the department with monitoring the contract, including reviewing service levels, quality of care and administrative practices, meeting with VitalCore to address issues, conducting site visits and inspections and reviewing third-party reimbursements, according to the contract. The agency did not respond to Mississippi Today’s questions about its prior monitoring activities. 
In the agency’s request for proposals for a medical contractor in 2023, it wrote that the agency “does not employ any licensed personnel responsible with oversight of its contracted healthcare provider,” but said it planned to reestablish a medical compliance office within three to six months of executing the contract. 
At that time, VitalCore had served as the agency’s medical contractor since 2020 after being awarded four no-bid emergency contracts worth $324 million for the services. Combined with its current role, VitalCore has been awarded about $682 million in Mississippi corrections contracts.
This year, the agency requested an additional $250,000 in funding from the state Legislature to fund five program auditor positions to provide oversight of the contracted medical provider. 
“The presence of Program Auditors will instill confidence in both our organization and the public that we are fulfilling our duty to provide essential care and safeguard the health and well-being of the inmates entrusted to our care,” the agency’s budget request said.
VitalCore has struggled to meet the terms of its contract. According to documents obtained by Mississippi Today, the Department of Corrections clawed back $4.6 million from VitalCore during the 2025 fiscal year. Mississippi Today reported in June that even as the agency was clawing back funds for unmet requirements, VitalCore requested and received an additional $4 million to cover the increased costs of providing health care.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17162611/MT-Prison-Health-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2026-01-26 06:57:06.815397

Read that again. Thank you, Anitra Hamilton and Kayla Young. Wish there were 132 more of you. 
On the other side of the aisle, there’s nine Republican women in the House and four in the Senate.
Some facts: The Mountain State has the lowest percentage of Democrat and female lawmakers in the nation. Democrats — about 8%. Women — about 11%. 
Is that why we rank dead last in nearly every metric of family prosperity and wellness? Hmmm. Let me think. I’ll get back to you on that. Just kidding. 
Women are half the population. Yet their voices fall on many deaf ears. West Virginia has yet to have a female governor. And only one female member of the U.S Senate or House. 
It was inspirational watching Virginia elect their first female governor this year. 
Good news: Our five largest cities all had female mayors at one time. Morgantown has had six. They currently have Mayor Danielle Trumble. 
Charleston’s first female mayor is the current one: Amy Shuler Goodwin. She’s adroitly captained a Charleston revival of sorts. Emphasizes outdoor activities and fitness, arts, music and entertainment. 
Goodwin brought the much beloved Sternwheel Regatta festival back from the brink. And found a way for Charleston to host the five-year USA Cycling Pro Road National Championships. 
Her vision has strengthened West Virginia families. This is telling. Statistically, female politicians put forward more pro-family policies. 
And we’d be remiss not to praise Charlene Marshall in Morgantown. Now in her 90s, she moves like a spry 80-year-old, mind sharp as a quill. She was Morgantown’s mayor from 1991 to 1998, as well as West Virginia’s first Black mayor. She also served over a decade in the House of Delegates as a Democrat. 
So why so few women in politics? Here’s one reason: many women are taught to fear their own voice. Taught to “make nice.” Believe that a difference of opinion is bad. 
The reality? Healthy discord is fantastic. Honest, decisive opinions are signs of strength and female autonomy. Woman as their own person apart from men. In contrast, passive agreement is the devil’s dogma. It makes women invisible. 
Sometimes silence is a choice. Other times men simply talk over women or ignore them. Shameful. 
Some interesting research findings: Men and women speak and write in about the same amount, just under different circumstances. Women tend to talk more in personal and social settings. Text more. Men often speak more in business, formal and hierarchical settings. They also statistically dominate online forums and debates. Women are no less intelligent. Do not have less merit. Much is the result of sexism.
Studies also reveal the success of visibility bias. This means, the loudest voice is listened to first. Loud does not equate with smart. But we give those voices more airtime.  
Conservatives, steeped in more patriarchal values, are fragile as cicada wings. Snow. The fragility is visible in the numbers. Do they not believe women capable of leading men? Apparently not. In the U.S. House of Representatives, there are more than twice as many female Democrats as female Republicans. In the U.S. Senate, female Democrats are three times more common than their Republican counterparts. I mean, wow. 
At the state level, as of 2024, across America, women comprised 31% of Democratic legislators — and only 15% of Republican ones. That’s bananas. 
Here’s the thing: Women run the world — dominating fields in health care and education, having and rearing babies — but men rule it. Often with an iron fist. Think Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin. I could go on. You get the idea. 
But societies are changing. More men are dismantling sexism. Some good old boys clubs are gender integrating. Businesses are hiring and promoting more women. 
Bottom line? Times are evolving. Slowly. Surely.  Women: Run for office. Speak up. Support other women. Cheer them on. Don’t go along to get along. And men? Stop and listen.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)When teams of volunteers fan out across Rhode Island after dark Tuesday on a mission that will take them through parks, alongside highway ramps, and into alleyways and parking lots, they will need to dress warmly.
The weather forecast calls for the temperature to drop as low as six degrees in Providence. But the number that will matter the most is how many people are spending the overnight hours outside.
At least 60 volunteers are signed up to conduct the state’s annual Point in Time Count, a federally mandated census that creates a snapshot of how many people are homeless on a winter’s night. The data collected from every state is used to determine federal funding.
Jessica Lachey, director of development at Thrive Behavioral Healthcare in Warwick, will be participating in the annual census for the third consecutive year. But she and other volunteers stop by encampments all year long. During cold weather, they often pass out blankets and propane tanks to keep homeless Rhode Islanders warm. 
“We basically do this every day,” Lachey said. “We’ll bring a lot of warming gear.”
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires every state’s Continuum of Care program — the network of agencies and nonprofits that manage a state’s homelessness response — to conduct the annual Point in Time Count.
The date of the count varies from state to state — HUD’s only requirement is that it be done within the last 10 days of January — but the goal is the same all over the country: create a snapshot of the number of individuals experiencing homelessness on a given night during the coldest time of the year when people are more likely to use shelters.
“That does typically make it easier to count, but we’ll still be outside,” said Partaja “PJ” Spann, director of Rhode Island outreach for Newport Mental Health.
Both Newport Mental Health and Thrive are Rhode Island Continuum of Care member agencies.
Unlike prior year counts, the state’s Executive Office of Housing is responsible for overseeing volunteers — a job previously handled by the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness.
State steps in to coordinate R.I.’s 2026 homeless census

The coalition will continue to clean, validate and analyze the data to submit the estimate of the state’s unhoused population to the federal government.
The final numbers will likely be submitted in April, Jenna Thomas, the coalition’s data coordinator of the state’s portion of the Homeless Management Information System, told the Rhode Island Continuum of Care board during its Jan. 7 meeting.
That’s earlier than last year when Rhode Island’s final count was submitted in June and formally presented before the state’s Continuum of Care board in September. Volunteers counted at least 2,373 unhoused individuals across the state on the night of Jan. 21, 2025 —  representing a 2.8% decrease from the record high of 2,442 in 2024.
Volunteer training is still the primary responsibility of the coalition, which produced a 17-minute video detailing how to use the state’s database. When locating unsheltered clients, volunteers must note the person’s living situation, their location, and how long they’ve been outside.
The methodology on how to approach the count follows core guidelines established by HUD. The guidelines cover how to remove duplicate data, ensure direct interaction with homeless persons, and where surveyors should go the census night.
Thomas said guidance has usually been updated on an annual basis. But during a December call with homeless data administrators from across the country, she said HUD confirmed no new notice was coming for the 2026 count and that continuum boards should use last year’s guidance.
HUD did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
7 p.m. start
Surveys for the Point in Time Count can be done for a week following the “blitz” night taking place Tuesday — as many teams likely can’t get into every encampment. The coalition’s guidance allows surveyors to visit shelters and other warming centers where they can ask where clients were during the night of the Point in Time Count. 
Emily Marshall, spokesperson for the state’s Executive Office of Housing, said about eight teams have been assembled to go out starting around 7 p.m. They’ll cover Providence, Pawtucket, along with municipalities in northern Rhode Island and in Bristol, Kent, Newport, and Washington counties.
“Teams are built intentionally to balance experience and local knowledge, ensuring coverage of both highly visible locations and more hidden or remote areas,” Marshall said in an email.
Lachey said her team expected to wrap up their survey by 11 p.m. Thrive’s outreach team is constantly out around Kent County connecting with people at known encampment locations to ensure they’re comfortable the night of the count.
“People who are unhoused have a lot of distrust in the system,” she said. “But when you see these people day in and day out — now we have a relationship, and they talk.” 
It’s the same approach Spann’s team of volunteers in Newport have taken. While the center’s outreach team likely won’t get to every encampment on Aquidneck Island Tuesday, she said individuals and their locations are fairly well-known ahead of time.
“They’re familiar faces,” Spann said. “It’s very rare we come across an encampment or an individual we have never had contact with.”
Some people are more willing to discuss their living arrangements or other personal identification than others. Spann said surveyors honor the privacy of those who don’t want to share information.
“We’re just trying to get a head count for numbers,” she said. “Data drives the narratives, the grants and the funding — getting accurate data is the first step so we know how to support the exact number of people we need to support.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)The recent leadership shake-up at Maryland’s Public Service Commission came as Gov. Wes Moore (D) was seeking a fresh direction for the board, which regulates gas and electric utilities in the state.
The governor announced earlier this month that he had selected Kumar Barve, a longtime state delegate who has served on the Commission since 2023, after a resignation from Chair Fred Hoover, a former director of the Maryland Energy Administration and assistant people’s counsel.
“In high-performing organizations, rotating leadership at regular intervals is a smart and normal practice,” wrote Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the governor, in response to questions from Maryland Matters about the change.
To the Moore administration, the goal of the swap is to better address continued high electric bills for Maryland consumers.
“At a time when too many families are struggling with skyrocketing utility costs, we look forward to the Commission continuing to act with urgency to protect Marylanders and ensure no one is pushed to the brink — or bankrupted — just to keep the lights on and their homes warm,” Moussa wrote.
Some argued the governor’s decision was unsurprising, given his continued dissatisfaction about high electric bills, as an election year dawns.
But other observers, including consumer and environmental advocates, called the move a rare and troubling intervention by the governor in the dealings of a body that is largely independent from the executive branch.

The governor has the power to nominate commissioners and nominate the chair, but can only remove people from the commission for incompetence or misconduct. Notably, Hoover will continue serving on the commission, with his new term extending through 2029. But he will no longer hold the noteworthy agenda-setting powers of the chair.
In a statement, Hoover said it has been “a tremendous honor to serve the people of Maryland as chair of the Public Service Commission.”
“I look forward to continued collaboration with Chair Barve and my fellow commissioners in this new capacity. We have been and will continue to be strong, unified partners in the important work of the Commission,” Hoover said.
Both men appeared side-by-side during an energy hearing Tuesday before the House Environment and Transportation Committee, though Barve took a leading role.
Since they swapped terms, both Barve and Hoover must be re-confirmed by the Maryland Senate.
The timing of the move raised some eyebrows among advocates, who noted that the PSC under Hoover recently made several consequential decisions that went against gas and electric companies.
In late December, the commission denied BGE’s request to collect an additional $152.3 million from ratepayers for a “true-up,” citing the company’s “substantial overruns” of approved budgets. Instead, it let BGE collect about half that amount, which will still add 72 cents to the average household’s monthly electric bill, and $1.95 to the average home’s gas bill, starting next month.
Earlier in 2025, the PSC issued a policy requiring new gas customers to pay the full cost for pipeline extensions to their properties, instead of letting companies spread the cost among existing ratepayers.
It is rare to see state officials intervene with the sitting members of their public utilities board, who are traditionally seen as separate from politics, said Matt Kasper, deputy director for the Energy and Policy Institute. But when it does happen, there is an “elephant in the room” — the utilities, who wield immense influence and retain ranks of lobbyists, Kasper said.
“You’re left wondering: Did the utilities pressure the legislature, or pressure the governor, to make that change?” Kasper said. “That’s what I’m left wondering here.”
Barve pushed back on that notion.










We have become much more keenly aware of costs, and we’ve been micromanaging to a degree that previous Public Service Commissions may not have. I certainly anticipate that we’re going to continue that diligence into the future.


– Kumar Barve, acting chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission


“This is about serving the ratepayers in the state of Maryland,” Barve said. “We’re honest brokers. We don’t have to raise campaign contributions. We don’t have to run for office. We have fixed terms to do what we believe is the right thing.”
Barve argued that the PSC will continue to closely scrutinize utilities’ spending plans under his leadership.
“We have become much more keenly aware of costs, and we’ve been micromanaging to a degree that previous Public Service Commissions may not have,” Barve said. “I certainly anticipate that we’re going to continue that diligence into the future.”
Christine Pendzich, a steering committee member at Maryland Third Act, a climate and democracy group for people over 60, said she found the leadership change unusual.
“From everything I understand, it’s very unusual for a Public Service Commission chair to step down before the end of his term,” said Pendzich, who has focused on energy issues and the PJM grid as co-chair of Maryland Third Act’s energy working groups.
It is “notable,” Pendzich said, that Hoover didn’t share an explanation for his departure. “One does think that the governor must have weighed in,” she said.
“The sense of the community is that he [Barve] is a little bit more politically inclined to do probably what the governor would want, rather than really balancing costs and benefits between utilities and ratepayers,” Pendzich said.
Moore, other PJM governors push for changes at the nation’s biggest electric grid

Jorge Aguilar, southern region director for advocacy group Food and Water Watch, said, “The new PSC needs to tackle these eye-popping electricity bills while rejecting the insane pro-data center frenzy that will burden ratepayers with the cost of new gas and nuclear power plants.”
Adding to Kasper’s concern are documents he recently uncovered from the governor’s office, using a public information request, that showed that American Gas Association official Juan Alvarado was the only nongovernmental employee allowed to sit in on Moore’s interviews of possible PSC appointees after he took office in 2023.
“I’ve published some information to show that the Moore administration has allowed utility influence behind the scenes,” Kasper said. “I’m left wondering … is there a coziness here?”
The Moore administration defended the involvement of the association, a trade group representing gas companies, arguing that it was purely informative. Moussa wrote that “it was not uncommon for industry experts to serve as consultants or references during the board or commission placement process.”
“Highly technical knowledge, like that required to serve on the PSC, requires appropriate insight to ensure appropriate placement. Serving in a separate capacity, consultants or references have no decision-making role and no vote on placement.”
Moore nominated Alvarado to the PSC in February 2023, but Alvarado withdrew from consideration, citing “personal reasons,” amid concerns from climate groups.
To Emily Scarr, senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, the gas industry’s presence at the meeting was “entirely inappropriate, and raises serious concerns.”
“The concern is when there is a perception that only certain people are in the room, or when things are happening behind closed doors the public isn’t aware of,” Scarr said.
Josh Tulkin, executive director of the Maryland Sierra Club, said he asked the Moore administration to attend the meetings, and was “told that non-government officials were not invited.”
But for some in Annapolis, the PSC’s recent moves aiming to rein in electric and gas utility spending may have come too little, too late.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In an interview after the leadership change, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City) argued that the commission lost its way, and did not do enough to anticipate and slow down rate hikes.
“I want them to have a laser-like focus on affordability,” Ferguson said. “The pendulum swung away from from affordability, and really was exclusively on reliability and and climate purposes.”
Ferguson said, though, that the commission should “absolutely” take continued steps to scrutinize utility costs, like they did in the BGE decision in December.
“I think certainly BGE is still doing fine without the reconciliation from the last three-year rate hike,” Ferguson said. “We need in-depth analysis to make sure that any request of any additional dollars — and the potential of reducing rates — is the driving focus of the work moving forward.”
Del. C.T. Wilson (D- Charles), who worked closely on energy policy last session during his time as Economic Matters chairman, agreed. He argued that a commission leadership change was “bound to happen” amid continued blowback about high electric bills from voters. The commission also came to “repeated loggerheads” with the General Assembly, Wilson said.
He said the commission was acting more as a “rubber stamp” at a time when decisive action was needed to curtail rates before they became too high a burden. And last January, prices became a political flashpoint as legislators arrived in Annapolis.
“As a state, we’ve become wholly unprepared for what’s getting ready to hit us,” Wilson said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC02777-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

The Trump administration’s abuse of the state has caused anguish and loss for its residents, including those who voted for President Donald Trump. He has obliterated trust with the state, and it no longer makes sense for Colorado to treat the federal government as a partner.
The state would better serve its people if it took aggressive steps to disengage from the federal government, protect residents from Trump’s malevolence, and assume more responsibility for serving Coloradans.
In other words, it should pursue a “soft secession.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Individual and allied states soft secede when under federalism they leverage their autonomy to practice noncooperation with federal authority, which they substitute with their own systems.
Federal abuse in the past year is hard to exaggerate. Trump’s mass deportation program has resulted in newsmaking abuses in Minnesota, California, Illinois and Oregon, for example, but it has also disrupted lives and trampled rights in Colorado. In just one representative example, federal authorities targeted Denver immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra over protected speech, then they kept her locked up for nine months until a judge ruled she was entitled to a bond hearing.
Immigration arrests in Colorado dramatically increased in the last year, and the cases often involve scant due process. More than a third of arrests in 2025 involved people who had no criminal charges or convictions.
In addition to the harm he’s caused generally across the country, Trump has inflicted many forms of retaliation specifically against Colorado. He denied the state disaster recovery funds for wildfire and flooding. He froze federal funds in Colorado for food and child care, prompting a lawsuit from the Colorado attorney general. He vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have supported a clean water project in the southeastern part of the state. He is relocating Space Command from Colorado Springs to Alabama. He’s breaking up the world-class atmospheric science hub NCAR in Boulder.
As U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado said, “The president has declared war on our state.”
What can Colorado do?
The state can reinforce or forge alliances with other like-minded states. A model for this cooperation was established by the Democratic-led states, including Colorado, that formed the Governors Public Health Alliance in response to anti-science federal policies.
Conversely, the state can withdraw from alliances that have turned counterproductive, such as the National Governors Association, which includes the influence of Republican-led states whose leaders supported Trump’s deployment of military troops to Democratic-led cities.
Elected officials and state agencies in Colorado can strictly limit their cooperation and data-sharing with the federal government and step up the state’s own capacity to fill gaps where it previously relied on federal resources. It could start by abandoning the Colorado Information Analysis Center, one of the nation’s so-called fusion centers. These are anti-terrorism information-sharing hubs for state and federal partners under the Department of Homeland Security. Since the Trump administration labels virtually any American who opposes it a terrorist, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem zealously bases her work on that perspective, the state’s participation in the center puts every Coloradan in danger.
Gov. Jared Polis has long been eager to share other forms of information with federal authorities, such as personal data about residents who live in Colorado without authorization. This posture not only puts members of the Colorado community at risk, it’s a form of complicity.
The state has billions of dollars it invests, and how it invests matters. The state treasurer’s office and the state pension plan, the Colorado Public Employees’ Retirement Association, can allow public money to support interests that boost authoritarianism or not. Millions in public money in Colorado backs such corporate bootlickers as Palantir, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet. A state can’t say it’s opposed to fascism if it funds fascism’s accomplices.
When federal agents commit crimes in Colorado, district attorneys and other state legal authorities can hold them accountable, including through prosecution. Federal agents are protected by the Constitution if the act in question is reasonable and performed as part of official duties. But they do not enjoy absolute immunity. Attorney General Phil Weiser took a step in this direction last week when his office launched an online complaint submission form through which community members can report misconduct by federal agents.
Earlier this month, Trump said the federal government will stop making payments to “sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities,” which includes Colorado. But revenue obligations go both ways.
Colorado sends billions more to the federal government than it gets in return. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has suggested his state — which is also deemed a sanctuary jurisdiction by the administration and also sends more money to the federal government than it receives — could cut off money from California to Washington. Newsom’s office has not explained how the state would do that.
But there are ways. Some have suggested that multiple states could enter a compact and hold federal taxes in trust until the administration ceases to attack them.
This could be among the most powerful measures in a program of soft secession.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)As federal immigration enforcement activity increases in Democratic-led states across the country, immigrant advocates and civil rights groups are warning that Virginia — which recently flipped full control of state government to Democrats — could be next. 
Gov. Abigail Spanberger, sworn in earlier this month as Virginia’s 75th governor, has moved quickly to draw a line between state law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement, while acknowledging that much of the authority still rests outside her control.
Just hours after taking the oath of office on Jan. 17, Spanberger fulfilled a promise she made in an August interview with The Mercury, rescinding former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 47. 
The order had directed Virginia State Police and the Department of Corrections to enter into so-called 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, effectively deputizing state officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement and encouraging local cooperation with ICE to identify and remove noncitizens accused or convicted of crimes.
Spanberger’s executive action marked a sharp policy reversal after years of Republican leadership in Richmond and came as immigration enforcement has intensified in blue states under President Donald Trump’s renewed push for large-scale deportations.
“My executive order, repealing Executive Order 47, was an important first step in ensuring that we are not moving or reallocating state and local resources away from the first-responder duties, whether it is investigating crimes or being ready to support a community in need,” Spanberger said last week.

She emphasized the prior order “had created some real challenges.”
“Ultimately, I am looking to every step forward that we can take as a commonwealth to ensure that our communities are safe and protected,” Spanberger continued, adding that confusion around law enforcement authority has fueled fear in immigrant communities. 
“Frankly, the fear and concern that we’ve seen in other places where people without any sort of designation — unannounced, wearing masks — are taking people off the streets, the level of fear that that’s created and the level of distrust and confusion is certainly not contributing to any strengthening of our communities, let alone keeping our communities safer.”
On Friday, members of Virginia’s Service Employees International Union chapters gathered outside a U.S. federal courthouse in Richmond to protest ICE enforcement, underscoring growing opposition from labor and immigrant advocates.
About 50 people attended the demonstration, where speakers criticized federal detention practices and read aloud the names of individuals who have been killed during ICE operations over the past year.
“We’re seeing the ICE escalate everywhere from from Minneapolis all the way here to Richmond,” said Violeta Vega, an SEIU member serving as an emcee for the gathering.
 State action, limited reach

While Spanberger’s order ends the requirement that state agencies enter into 287(g) agreements, it does not terminate existing contracts between ICE, state and local governments, regional jails or sheriffs’ offices. Nor does it prohibit new agreements at the local level.
All state and local agreements “remain in force until terminated” by one or both parties, a new Legal Aid Justice Center analysis found. There has been no evidence to date that any existing contracts between ICE and state or local law enforcement have been ended as a result of the governor’s action.
The report details how dozens of agencies across Virginia — including state agencies and regional jails — have contracted with ICE to perform duties that may exceed their authority or conflict with state law and the Virginia Constitution.
The analysis further found that at least 223 state and local personnel have been nominated to participate in 287(g) agreements, including two school resource officers and a behavioral health advocate. One facility — the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George County — receives more than half of its revenue from holding people for ICE.
“Those local law enforcement agencies with 287(g) agreements now have a massive financial incentive to abandon their mission to protect communities in favor of terrorizing immigrant populations,” said Alex Kornya, LAJC’s director of litigation. 
“Contracts with ICE, often shrouded in secrecy, are not only a misuse of time and resources, but they also open these agencies up to significant liability, liability that Virginia taxpayers will ultimately pay.”
LAJC said many of the agreements were negotiated quietly, with agencies declining to provide information in response to public records requests — in some cases saying ICE instructed them not to respond.
According to ICE’s own website, there are currently at least 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving the state and local governments, and correctional facilities. Five are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law enforcement.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment from The Mercury.
 Fear, trust and public safety

Civil rights groups, including LAJC, say the impact of these agreements extends beyond immigration enforcement, undermining trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.
“Governor Spanberger’s action to rescind EO 47 on her first day was an important step, as these contracts do nothing to make people safer,” said Rohmah Javed, legal director of LAJC’s Immigrant Justice Program, adding that immigrant communities across the state are terrified.
“These agreements erode trust, making it much less likely immigrants will seek out needed services, report crimes witnessed or crimes they have experienced as victims, or participate in their communities,” Javed said. “But we need to see immediate action at both the state and local levels to officially end these abusive agreements.”
The ACLU of Virginia called the order a first step toward ensuring state law enforcement is not used for federal immigration enforcement, while cautioning that existing contracts and federal authority remain unchanged.
“Governor Spanberger’s executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families,” ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Mary Bauer said.
 Republicans warn repeal of ICE order threatens public safety

Virginia GOP leaders, meanwhile, sharply criticized Spanberger’s decision, arguing that rescinding Youngkin’s order weakens cooperation with federal authorities and threatens public safety.
Youngkin himself told The Mercury in an interview earlier this month that rescinding his Executive Order 47 would be “a huge mistake,” calling it a necessary tool for combating violent crime and gang activity, particularly in Northern Virginia.
“That partnership has made Virginia safer. We arrested the number-three guy in MS-13; the number three guy in MS-13 was just living in Virginia that otherwise would have never been arrested,” Youngkin said.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, former Attorney General Jason Miyares called Spanberger’s move “a disaster for the public safety” of the commonwealth. “Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised.”
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, also warned that ending mandated cooperation with ICE could lead to increased crime. 
“Folks need to be able to walk their street at night without fear of being either shot or kidnapped or raped. It’s the wrong way to move with public safety in Virginia,” Kilgore said. When Governor Youngkin had the agreement, we were able to catch all those MS-13 gang members up in Northern Virginia. If we’re not cooperating with ICE, folks are going to get harmed in Virginia.”
However, federal data show that immigrants without criminal records now make up the largest share of people held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, despite repeated assertions by some political leaders that enforcement is focused primarily on violent offenders.
According to ICE’s own figures, roughly 73% of those in detention as of late 2025 had no criminal conviction, and only a small fraction were held for violent offenses — many others had only minor or civil immigration offenses. 
In Virginia, too, officials have not substantiated claims about the criminal histories of people rounded up by the state’s task force. Last summer, Youngkin claimed his administration had arrested more than 2,500 immigrants who were “violent criminals,” but Miyares at the time declined to provide evidence that those individuals were in fact violent offenders when pressed by The Mercury.

 Local leaders respond

In Richmond, Mayor Danny Avula — the city’s first immigrant mayor — issued a statement addressing community concerns following reports of ICE activity in the region, including recent activity in Chesterfield County and Petersburg.
“I understand there is tremendous fear in the community right now,” Avula said. “Fear in completing everyday tasks, such as showing up for work, taking your children to school, or buying groceries, and I want you to know I hear you.”
Avula emphasized that Richmond does not coordinate with ICE on deportation activities and that the Richmond Police Department has not entered into a 287(g) agreement.
“Our officers are here to focus on their core mission: community policing, protecting all neighborhoods, and reducing crime,” Avula said, urging residents to call 911 if they need law enforcement assistance.
“I reject any approach that creates fear, confusion, or division,” he added. “Those tactics undermine public safety and erode trust, making our communities less safe, not more secure.”
Meanwhile, immigration enforcement concerns intensified last week after Hanover County officials confirmed receiving a letter from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security outlining plans to purchase and operate an ICE processing facility in a warehouse on Lakeridge Parkway.
County officials said the project was not initiated by Hanover and that the county has 30 days to respond. The Board of Supervisors had not convened to discuss the proposal as of Thursday and is expected to address the matter at its Jan. 28 meeting.
Virginia currently has two major long-term ICE detention centers — the Farmville Detention Center and the Caroline Detention Facility — along with regional jails that hold detainees under contract, including the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail. 
Advocacy groups say any expansion of processing or detention capacity could deepen fear in surrounding communities.
 A broader political test

The debate over federal immigration enforcement underscores a broader challenge for Democratic governors in states where ICE activity remains governed largely by federal authority and locally negotiated contracts.
In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz publicly condemned a federal immigration operation in Minneapolis that sparked widespread protest after a federal agent fatally shot a 37-year old woman through her car window earlier this month. Following the killing, Walz demanded that the state must play a role in the investigation of the incident. 
Coverage of the fallout has highlighted the limited tools Democratic governors have to rein in enforcement carried out independently by ICE or through local arrangements.
Similar tensions have surfaced in Illinois and Massachusetts, where Democratic governors back sanctuary-style policies but continue to face criticism when ICE makes arrests in jails and courthouses governed by local practices rather than state law. 
In Illinois, confusion over the state’s TRUST Act has left sheriffs and the governor caught between immigrant advocates and federal officials. In Massachusetts, renewed attention to ICE courthouse arrests has put Gov. Maura Healey under pressure to respond to enforcement decisions she does not control. 
Against that backdrop, Spanberger has emphasized that the stakes in Virginia are about trust — particularly whether immigration enforcement policies discourage people from calling police when they need help. 
“Ultimately, how we will determine how Virginia proceeds is that — and I say this as someone who grew up in a law enforcement family and began my career in law enforcement — the idea that any community member would be afraid of calling police in a time of need, if there’s an emergency in their home, is a tragedy in and of itself,” Spanberger said.

(Photo by Bill Hinton/Getty Images)A proposal to create a volunteer cybersecurity incident response team, investigating and troubleshooting threats targeting digital systems around the commonwealth, will be considered again in this year’s General Assembly session. 
The legislation, carried by Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, would authorize the Virginia Information Technologies Agency to select people to serve as Virginia Cyber Civilian Corps volunteers and corps advisors, and to deploy such volunteers across the commonwealth to provide rapid-response assistance under the direction of VITA upon request from a client, or government agency, affected by a cybersecurity incident. 
The proposal would also create an advisory board within VITA to review and make recommendations regarding the creation and administration of the corps.
This comes as public data suggests cyber attacks are increasing. In many cases, reporting lags and transparency vary due to reputational or security concerns.
“The problem today is that localities are ‘soft targets’ these days,” said Tijay Chung, an associate professor in the computer science department at Virginia Tech. “Hackers have shifted (their) focus from hard and corporate targets to schools, hospitals or municipalities.”
He said House Bill 83 is a smart idea and that hackers are aware that local governments don’t have the budgets for a state-of-the-art security system or dedicated 24/7 monitoring teams.  
“That’s why these days hackers, in my opinion, think that (attacking) localities are easy targets —  low risk, high reward,” Chung added.
In 2024, Feggans introduced a similar proposal, which cleared the General Assembly during his first term. However, former Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill. Youngkin believed creating a civilian cybersecurity corps is premature, costly and legally unclear under Virginia’s current cybersecurity setup.
According to the Department of Planning and Budget, an estimated $410,000 is projected for the Virginia Information Technology Agency to create and fund an advisory board for the Virginia Cyber Civilian Corps. Funds would also be allocated to the Virginia State Police for fingerprinting volunteers.
Feggans’ interest in introducing the legislation stems from his time as a cybersecurity intern for former Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s administration and their research on potential legislation. He also saw the success of similar proposals in other states like Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. 
“This wasn’t just something that came up out of the blue,” Feggans said at the start of the General Assembly session. “It’s a model showing that we can increase our cybersecurity resources without adding a large bill to the state. We’ve seen cyber attacks happen in Virginia, and we just need to continue to increase our intellectual abilities to be able to assist in that, and this is my way to address our cybersecurity resources within the state.”
In December, Campbell County was targeted by a cyberattack on its emergency notification system, OnSolve CodeRed, for weather and emergency alerts. 
The county says the system has been decommissioned. An initial investigation found that an organized cybercriminal group damaged the CodeRED platform. The group may have removed subscriber data and posted some of it online.
Chung said lawmakers will need to consider vetting volunteer experts in their implementation plan.
Chung said that having a certification does not necessarily mean you can stop an active ransomware attack.
“You really have to have real experience. Conversely, some of the best white hat hackers may not have a formal degree. VITA needs to balance bureaucracy with actual technical capability.”
If Feggans’ bill is to have any success in passing to the Senate, it will have to clear the House of Delegates before crossover on Feb. 18. Gov. Abigail Spanberger would be responsible for signing the legislation.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)Incarcerated people in Virginia can contact their friends and family by phone call or a special email service for prisons, but those who previously served time say in-person visits helped them keep morale high and incentivized good behavior.
Former and current inmates and criminal justice advocates are calling for clearer visitation standards in Virginia facilities, a challenge a new legislative measure is designed to address.
House Bill 173 by Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk, would require that the Virginia Department of Corrections provide extended visitation access for long-distance travelers who live at least 150 miles outside of the correctional facility, minors under 18 years old, and infrequent visitors who have not been to see their loved one in more than 90 days. Each visit for these types of guests would be at least two hours, unless the visitor or inmate requests to shorten it. 
Before the standards become applied broadly to VADOC, the bill stipulates that the department conduct pilot programs of the revised visitation rules at three or more prisons with different security levels to evaluate the staffing and safety impacts. This will help the department sort through how to best implement the new visitation standards. 
The bill also outlines how visitation privileges could only be suspended for conduct occurring during the visitation that “presents a direct and substantial threat to the physical safety of participants or the security of the correctional facility.”
Finally, it would create an appeal process for suspension of visitation rights and would require VADOC to collect and publish related data in an annual report to state lawmakers. 
Christine Via, whose husband Blake was previously incarcerated at Dilwyn Correctional Center, said she has been turned away when trying to visit him due to her attire, despite her attempts to follow the visitation rules and clothing policy. 
VADOC policy outlines that clothing must cover people from neck to kneecap, must not contain “inappropriate language or graphics,” watches and other wearable technology are prohibited, and that administrative duty officers “will make the final decision” on whether or not someone is allowed into the visitor room.
No matter what she wore, Christine said occasionally authorities at the center told her she needed to change for security reasons.
So, she’d “run to the nearest store and get something because I don’t want to skip my visit,” she said.
After several such interactions, she said she didn’t always bring the couple’s young son along to the facility, an hour and a half from their home, concerned that he would “get his hopes up,” only to not see his father. 
Another time, Blake said his visitation privileges were at risk of being revoked because apparently he and Christine shared too long of a kiss. 
“It’s inconsistent with treatment between (correctional officers’) shifts,” Blake said, adding that Anthony’s bill could help create consistent standards.
Humanization Project co-founder Taj Mahon-Haft also supports the bill. The organization, spearheaded by formerly incarcerated people like himself, advocates to the state legislature on behalf of bills like Anthony’s. 
During Mahon-Haft’s incarceration his mother and his now-wife were two of the people he was in touch with most, each leaning on the other for emotional support. With his mother living in New Mexico, she saved up money and took time off work to visit at least twice a year. This entailed paying for flights, a hotel and a rental car. 
In late 2021, as COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were easing up, Mahon-Haft said he’d filled out the required documentation to arrange for his mother to visit him. She was told to leave the prison after just an hour, he said, despite the waiting room being empty. 
It was the last time she visited him before he was released. 
“She couldn’t put herself through that again,” he said. “She’d spent thousands of dollars, come thousands of miles and wasted five days of her PTO.”
He and the Vias feel that the treatment by prison staff has “basically discouraged away visits” at times. 
Anthony’s bill must work its way through various committees before it may clear both chambers of the legislature and ultimately face Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s final approval, amendments or rejection.

(Photo by Vicki Jauron, Babylon and Beyond Photography via Getty Images) Menhaden, the controversial oily fish, are making waves early in the General Assembly legislative session.
Three bills have been filed that would curb menhaden catches by the only reduction fishery allowed in the Chesapeake Bay and to study the population, which some conservation groups have said is declining in the Bay and spurring suffering among other species. 
Ocean Harvesters, which contracts with Omega Protein, is a purse seine reduction fishery in Reedville, Virginia. They are the only reduction fishery allowed in the Bay, as surrounding states have banned that kind of industrial scale fishing. They frequently are blamed for the challenges posed to the menhaden population within the Bay.
Conservationists have been sounding the alarm over starving osprey populations, which researchers use as a proxy for menhaden as they are a key part of the birds’ diets. 
Maryland members of the Atlantic Menhaden Management Board have also claimed that fewer menhaden have been able to travel up to their shores for fishermen to harvest in years past, a point that Ocean Harvesters has fiercely denied and said data does not support.
Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, sponsored House Bill 1048 that would halt all purse seine fishing of menhaden in the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay until it can be scientifically proven that the fishery does not negatively impact other fisheries or species that depend on the forage fish to survive.
Ocean Harvesters said that broad language could mean the fishery shutters permanently.
“The cost would be real and immediate in the Northern Neck, where these measures threaten hundreds of jobs for fishermen and plant workers, along with paychecks, benefits, and health insurance in a rural region with few comparable, full-benefit alternatives,” Ocean Harvesters said. “These bills would disproportionately hit a largely minority, union workforce and punish working families while ignoring the science-based management already in place.”
Carr’s other bill, HB 1049, would implement quota periods so that the amount the fishery is allowed to harvest, which is already limited by a specific cap of 51,000 metric tons, would be spaced out over certain times so that the menhaden could potentially move through the Bay. 
The proposal is similar to a suggestion by the Maryland representative in the menhaden management board, which opted to restrict menhaden harvests by 20% along the entire East Coast.
“HB 1049 goes further than the Maryland delegation proposal by restricting rollover of unused quota between periods and layering on an observer requirement for a portion of trips, which are additional operational burdens without a clear conservation payoff,” Ocean Harvesters said.
Carr could not be reached for comment on her bills.
The General Assembly has attempted and failed to pass legislation in the past to conduct a Bay- specific study on the menhaden populations. There’s another attempt on the docket this year.
Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax, proposed Senate Bill 474 to establish the Atlantic Menhaden Research Fund to be used by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to conduct the menhaden population study and report to the General Assembly each year.
“Directly and indirectly, menhaden are essential to the livelihoods of countless Virginia small businesses, families, and communities. Responsibly managing the fishery protects the menhaden industry’s own workers, who have the most to lose if the fishery collapses,” said Will Poston, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation forage campaign manager.
The three bills have not yet come up for hearings in the General Assembly.

More people in the legal field are using AI to automate repetitive tasks and save time, but hallucinations have led to fake cases and false information in legal documents. (Photo by Madyson Fitzgerald/Stateline)Last spring, Illinois county judge Jeffrey Goffinet noticed something startling: A legal brief filed in his courtroom cited a case that did not exist.
Goffinet, an associate judge in Williamson County, looked through two legal research systems and then headed to the courthouse library — a place he hadn’t visited in years — to consult the book that purportedly listed the case. The case wasn’t in it.
The fake case, generated by artificial intelligence, came across Goffinet’s desk just a few months after the Illinois Supreme Court’s policy on the use of AI in the courts took effect. Goffinet co-chaired a task force that informed that policy, which allows the use of AI as long as it complies with existing legal and ethical standards.
“People are going to use [AI], and the courts are not going to be able to be a dam across a river that’s already flowing at flood capacity,” Goffinet said. “We have to learn how to coexist with it.”
As more false quotes, fake court cases and incorrect information appear in legal documents generated by AI, state bar associations, state court systems and national law organizations are issuing guidance on its use in the legal field. A handful of states are considering or enacting legislation to address the issue, and many courts and professional associations are focused on education for attorneys.
Federal judge mulls sanctions for attorneys who used AI in court filing

From divorce cases to discrimination lawsuits, AI-generated fake content can cause evidence to be dismissed and motions to be denied.
While some states urge attorneys to lean on existing guidance about accuracy and transparency, the new policies address AI concerns related to confidentiality, competency and costs. Most policies and opinions encourage attorneys to educate themselves and to use proprietary AI tools that prevent sensitive data from being entered into open source systems. Since AI tools could also increase efficiency, several policies advise attorneys to charge less if they spend less time on cases.
Some states, such as Ohio, also ban the use of artificial intelligence for certain legal tasks. In Ohio, courts are prohibited from using AI to translate legal forms, court orders and similar content that may affect the outcome of a case.
Several states have also advised legal professionals to adhere to the American Bar Association’s formal opinion of ethical AI use in law.
Artificial intelligence can help attorneys and law firms by automating administrative tasks, analyzing contracts and organizing documents. Generative AI can also be used to draft legal documents, including court briefs. Experts say the use of AI productivity tools can save legal professionals time and reduce the risk of human error in everyday tasks.
But law professionals nationwide have faced fines and license suspensions, among other consequences, for submitting legal documents citing false quotes, cases or information.
Many legal professionals are likely to not notice instances in which an AI system is “hallucinating,” or confidently making statements that are not true, said Rabihah Butler, the manager for enterprise content for Risk, Fraud and Government at the Thomson Reuters Institute. The institute is a research subsidiary of the Thomson Reuters company, which sells an AI system meant to help lawyers.










AI has such confidence, and it can appear so polished, that if you're not paying attention and doing your due diligence, the hallucination is being treated as a factual piece of information.


– Rabihah Butler, manager for enterprise content for Risk, Fraud and Government at the Thomson Reuters Institute


Courts and law organizations will need to consider education, sanctions and punitive actions to ensure law professionals are using AI appropriately, Butler said.
“AI has such confidence, and it can appear so polished, that if you’re not paying attention and doing your due diligence, the hallucination is being treated as a factual piece of information,” she said.
Since the beginning of 2025, there have been 518 documented cases in which generative AI produced hallucinated content used in U.S. courts, according to a database by Damien Charlotin, a senior research fellow at the HEC Paris business school.
“So far, if we’re looking at the institutional response, there’s not a lot because people are not very sure how to handle this kind of issue,” Charlotin said. “Everyone is aware that some lawyers are using artificial intelligence in their day-to-day work. Most people are aware that the technology is not very mature. But it’s still hard to prevent a mistake.”
State guidance
As of Jan. 23, state bar associations or similar entities have issued formal guidance on the use of AI in at least 10 states and the District of Columbia, typically in the form of an ethics opinion. Those aren’t enforceable as law, but spell out proper conduct.
In February, for example, the Professional Ethics Committee for the State Bar of Texas issued an ethics opinion that outlines issues that may arise from law professionals using AI. Texas lawyers should have a basic understanding of generative AI tools and guardrails to protect client confidentiality, it said. They should also verify any content generated by AI and refrain from charging clients for the time saved by using AI tools.
Legal professionals must be aware of their own competency with AI tools, said Brad Johnson, the executive director of the Texas Center for Legal Ethics.
“A really important takeaway from the opinion is that if a lawyer is considering using a generative AI tool in the practice of law, the lawyer has to have a reasonable and current understanding of the technology because only then can a lawyer really evaluate the risks that are associated with it,” he said.
Court systems in at least 11 states — Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia — have established policies or issued rules of conduct regarding AI use by law professionals.
Illinois, for instance, allows lawyers to use artificial intelligence and does not require disclosure. The policy also emphasizes that judges will ultimately be responsible for their decisions, regardless of “technological advancements.”
“The task force wanted to emphasize that as judges, what we bring to the table is our humanity,” said Goffinet, the associate judge. “And we cannot abdicate our humanity in favor of an AI-generated decision or opinion.”
Former lawyer seeks reinstatement after sanctions, arrest and contempt findings

Some state lawmakers have tried to address the issue through legislation. Last year, Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed a measure that requires attorneys to use “reasonable diligence” to verify the authenticity of evidence, including content generated by artificial intelligence. The law also allows parties in civil cases to raise concerns about the admissibility of evidence if they suspect it was generated or altered by artificial intelligence.
California Democratic state Sen. Tom Umberg also introduced legislation last year that would require attorneys to ensure confidential information is not entered into a public generative AI system. The measure, which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also would require attorneys to ensure that reasonable steps are taken to verify the accuracy of generative AI material.
Attorney education
It’s also important for state bar associations and law schools to provide education on artificial intelligence, said Michael Hensley, a counsel at FBT Gibbons and an advocate for the safe use of AI in California courts. AI has the ability to reduce research time just like online legal research systems, but it requires training, he said.
“I would hope the state bar would have training for this,” Hensley said. “And I think it’s absolutely imperative that law schools have a session on AI.”
In a Bloomberg Law survey conducted last spring, 51% of the more than 750 respondents said their law firms purchased or invested in generative artificial intelligence tools. Another 21% said they planned to purchase AI tools within the next year. Attorneys reported using generative AI for general legal research, drafting communications, summarizing legal narratives, reviewing legal documents and other work.
Of the law firms that were not using generative AI, attorneys cited incorrect or unreliable output, ethical issues, security risks and data privacy as the top reasons.
While attorneys and law firms have become more comfortable with AI tools, courts have been more apprehensive, said Diane Robinson, a principal court research associate at the National Center for State Courts. Robinson is also project director at the Thomson Reuters Institute/NCSC AI Policy Consortium for Law and Courts, an association of legal practitioners and researchers developing guidance and resources for the use of AI in courts.
AI has the potential to improve case processing and can allow people needing legal advice to find information by using AI chatbots, she said. But, she added, courts are still struggling with evidence altered by AI and briefs littered with hallucinations.
“Fake evidence is nothing new,” Robinson said. “People have been altering photographs as long as there were photographs. But with AI, the ability to create videos, audio and pictures has become very easy, and courts are really struggling with it.”
Charlotin, of HEC Paris, said most courts and professional associations will continue to focus on education right now.
“You cannot prevent a mistake just by telling people, ‘Don’t make a mistake,’” Charlotin said. “That doesn’t work. It’s more about setting up processes to make people aware of it, then they can set up processes to work on dealing with it.”

Jessica LaMontagne became interested in natural funerals after witnessing a loved one’s home burial in Vermont. “I was really quite moved by the experience,” she said Thursday, Jan. 23, addressing the House Committee on Executive Departments and Administration.  The experience set LaMontagne, a Dover Democrat, down a path of learning about alternative f[...]","Traditional cremation and burial remain the two major paths for disposition chosen by most people nationwide. Here, a cemetery in Henniker. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Rep. Jessica LaMontagne became interested in natural funerals after witnessing a loved one’s home burial in Vermont.
“I was really quite moved by the experience,” she said Thursday, Jan. 23, addressing the House Committee on Executive Departments and Administration. 
The experience set LaMontagne, a Dover Democrat, down a path of learning about alternative funerals. Under certain circumstances, natural burials, in which a person’s body is interred without chemical embalming, are permitted in New Hampshire, she found. But some other natural funeral practices are not currently legal for practice in-state.
One of those methods is “natural organic reduction,” sometimes called “human composting.” In this process, a person’s body is placed in a specialized container and surrounded with plant matter, like hay and wood chips. With assistance from microbes, warmth, and movement, the body is aided in breaking down into nutrient-rich organic material, similar to compost or soil, over a period of weeks or months.
House Bill 1457, which LaMontagne sponsored, would legalize natural organic reduction in New Hampshire and lay out guidelines for regulation of the practice, mirroring state regulation of cremation and cremation facilities.
This session marks the third time such legislation has been introduced. LaMontagne first introduced House Bill 1324, which would have legalized natural organic reduction, in 2024; that bill was sent for interim study, where it died in committee. Sen. Daniel Innis, a Bradford Republican, introduced a similar measure as Senate Bill 53 in 2025 that was also left in interim study. 
Innis is a co-sponsor of this year’s bill, along with Nashua Democratic Rep. William Darby, Stratham Democratic Rep. Allison Knab, Dover Democratic Sen. David Watters, and Manchester Republican Sen. Keith Murphy.  
“We’ve joined forces, and hopefully three times will be the charm, because natural organic reduction is growing across the country,” LaMontagne said.
Rep. Jessica LaMontagne, a Dover Democrat, presents a bill to legalize organic reduction of human remains before the House Committee on Executive Departments and Administration on Thursday, Jan. 22. People may choose natural organic reduction for the similar reasons they would choose cremation, LaMontagne said. “They want to just go back: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. This is earth to earth, a more ephemeral and ecological way.” (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
The practice was first legalized in Washington State in 2019, and 13 other states have since followed suit, including Vermont and Maine. A bill to legalize the practice in Massachusetts is currently before the state legislature. 
Some companies will transport deceased individuals out of states where natural organic reduction is illegal to undergo the process elsewhere. But legalizing the method in-state would ease that process for New Hampshire families and support local funeral providers, said LaMontagne.
About 61.4% of Americans are interested in exploring “green” funeral options, according to a 2025 estimate from the National Funeral Directors Association. Besides natural organic disposition is the low-emission practice of liquid cremation, or “aquamation,” which some lawmakers attempted to legalize in New Hampshire in 2013; the measure was ultimately voted down.
Despite widespread interest in alternatives, traditional cremation and burial remain the two major paths for disposition chosen by most people nationwide. Flame cremation is most common, with about 63.4% of people choosing that option in 2025, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. In New Hampshire, nearly 80% choose cremation.
Cremation is less land-intensive than traditional burial and less expensive. Opting for a burial typically adds about $2,000 to the cost of a funeral, according to the National Funeral Directors’ Association, which estimated the median cost of a funeral with burial in the United States at around $8,300 in 2025.
“I think many people choose (cremation) as a more ephemeral means of leaving this world, not to claim a piece of Earth forever in a cemetery,” LaMontagne said. 
But, she said, there are also some environmental drawbacks to cremation. It is energy-intensive and typically uses fossil fuels, LaMontagne said, and it generates particulate air pollution. The resulting ashes also contain large amounts of salt and other inorganic material, which can be harmful to plants and animals.
LaMontagne views natural organic reduction as a solution to some of those issues. The soil-like remains that are produced through the process are safe for plants, and families may confidently use them to plant a tree or scatter on a forest floor, she said.
The variety of possible destinations for reduced remains, however, was one topic of concern at the Thursday hearing. The process produces a large volume of material, about one cubic yard, according to LaMontagne.

That could pose a challenge for funeral directors and others who provide the reduction service, said David Grant, president of the New Hampshire Funeral Directors Association. Families may not want to take the material, unsure where to put it, he said.
Others wondered how the provision forbidding the use of the soil on crops would be enforced.
Bob Dunn, director of public policy for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester, cited dignity and tradition in his testimony opposing the bill.
Dunn said the church viewed reduction as an undignified treatment for the human body. The production and possible use of compost-like soil, he said, was also problematic.
“That process … is something that reduces human remains to a utilitarian end. If we look at the human body as something that can be treated in the utilitarian way, then that sends the message that living people can be looked at in a utilitarian way as well,” he said.
The Catholic Church supports cremation, Dunn said, adding that he viewed natural organic reduction as different from cremation in its production of usable soil and its novelty.
Darby said he would be personally interested in the process in order to have a “green burial” without converting a portion of his property into a cemetery.

While an initiated statute on marijuana succeeded (though the legislative success is still to be determined), and reproductive rights were solidly approved to enter the Ohio Constitution, the most recent pass at redistricting reform to change to a citizen-run method rather than one run by elected officials didn’t fare as well.
While there were lots of reasons given on the defeat of the issue, the concept of bringing up a renewed effort amid a heavily populated and highly fundraised 2026 election doesn’t strike the right chord with participants in the previous effort.
“Though our resolve to bring fair maps and a transparent process to Ohio has not wavered, we are considering the strategic and political hurdles that stand in the way of a successful ballot campaign,” Marozzi told the Capital Journal.
Many things go into the process of putting a constitutional amendment or other measure on the ballot. First comes the motivation to circumvent the legislature if an issue hasn’t risen to the level advocates think it should, often after years of attempting to persuade lawmakers.
“Unfortunately, there are times that the legislature will not move and so the ability of every day Ohioans to pull out their clipboards and get something on the ballot is transformational,” said Jen Miller, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio.
Often times, as Ohio has seen with property tax debate, just the shadow of an impending ballot measure could be enough to bring about at least some action with elected officials.

  The language of change 
When the needle doesn’t move, initiative leaders get to work, with the help of policy and legal experts, to put together the language that will frame the issue.
The idea has to be easy for voters to digest, but also legally enforceable, and able to extend change after the measure is approved by voters.
“We can spend all the money in the world on advertisements, in terms of what they see on TV, or what they see on their phones, but at the end of the day, the last thing that they see before they vote is that ballot language,” said Jeff Dieringer, political and research strategist with the labor union SEIU 1199. “And more times than not, that is going to be the determining factor of whether they check yes or no.”
It doesn’t help that issues that have failed recently statistically fare worse on future attempts, and a change to the constitution is going to start with a higher level scrutiny before the issue has even hit the table.
“If an issue is highly contested, voters are most likely to say no,” said Catherine Turcer, head of voting rights organization Common Cause Ohio. “Voters who aren’t sure are likely to say no.”
The 2023 reproductive rights amendment is one advocates point to as a good example of being easily understood, unlike the complicated and lengthy changes in the redistricting proposal.
“That was instructive, in that it was short, but is also tangibly understandable to the public,” Miller said. “(Voters) knew the rights we had before Roe v. Wade was gutted, and that this preserved those rights.”
Even with the right collection of words, whether or not the language remains the same from the advocates’ table to the official ballot is the source of struggle nowadays.
“Now we have to factor in … kind of the institutional role, and what is the worst ballot language that could be presented,” Marozzi said.
The Ohio Ballot Board, which has final say on what amendments end up on Ohio ballots, received a lot of flack for the changes they made to the redistricting reform amendment in 2024, in which they inserted language saying the redistricting commission would be “required to gerrymander” maps that establish the voting districts in the state.
The Ohio Supreme Court upheld most of the changes, including that particular change, to the surprise of many.

“The language was so Orwelllian that I couldn’t imagine they would go along with it,” Turcer said.
But because of the success they saw within elected official-led institutions like the Ohio Ballot Board, even with moves they say were misleading and deliberately one-sided, those leading the charge for change see the need for a more comprehensive change.
“We’re not necessarily ripe for big systemic change at the beginning of 2026,” Turcer said. “But we deserve to participate in a democracy that is not rigged by things like gerrymandered district lines and ballot board shenanigans.”
While changing those who are in office could be a step forward, Turcer said the environment for change in Ohio has grown to include more than just individual elected officials.
“Lying has now become part of the process, and changing the guard could disrupt the system for a few years,” Turcer said. “But that doesn’t mean that one side or the other couldn’t just go back to dirty deeds fairly easily, because one political party is in power.”
  Then comes the money 
The art of bringing together a battalion of volunteers to gather the more than 400,000 signatures over more than 40 counties needed to even get the measure in the hands of those who might approve the language has seen its own changes over the years.
“You’re obviously not just submitting that amount, usually the goal is to aim for about double that,” Dieringer said.
Volunteers usually aren’t enough these days, advocates say, and money needs to go to entities who verify the signatures.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a ballot measure that was wholly volunteer based that successfully was able to qualify (for the ballot),” Dieringer said. “It’s just not possible, given the timeline that you’re doing.”

Like it or not, money is a driver for ballot initiatives to receive signatures, for information to make it in front of the eyes of voters, and in the end, for voters to make their decision.
“The language isn’t enough, and it’s not enough just to think about ‘can you collect enough signatures in time,’” Turcer said. “It’s not enough just to get on the ballot, you need to actually get people to vote for it.”
Getting across the finish line means marketing in the media, even through Indiana and West Virginia where markets overlap with Ohio. Radio campaigns work better in rural areas like Southeast Ohio, where broadband isn’t as reliable as in other areas. Social media campaigns are rampant now, and supporters and opponents alike need to get creative in how they go about pushing their view.
“Ohio is incredibly expensive (for elections), you have a very large population, and you have multiple media markets,” Marozzi said. “You really have to do a full landscape analysis to see where and how you’re going to raise the necessary amount of money.”
Also playing a factor in how advocates persuade donors and voters is whether or not the election could see a big turnout, like in presidential years, or during an off-year with not much in the way of other candidates or issues to attract voters.
“Donors don’t want to give large sums of money to an effort that is a coin flip if it’s going to win or not,” Marozzi said. “But also they don’t want to spend money on communication that’s ineffective.”
For now, Marozzi and other advocates say that means a less-than-favorable path to success for something like redistricting reform. But it doesn’t mean other ways of bringing about change are off the table.
“The League of Women Voters is not going to stop until we have stopped partisan gerrymandering,” Miller said. “But right now we are focused on making sure every Ohioan has what they need to participate freely and fairly in every primary and general election.”
Voters should put their eye toward the future by asking candidates what they will be doing to represent voter interests, and tell the candidates what voters need.
“It does feel like change is in the air, but when we think about politics, we shouldn’t just be thinking about the next election,” Turcer said. “We should think about the ways we can support each other and engage, everything from book clubs to attending public hearings.”
Talking with those in book clubs, and coffee shops, and congregations brings about the idea that there is agreement about what is right and wrong in Ohio, Marozzi said. Conversations happening outside the ballot box are important as voters wait to cast their votes.
“It’s not lost on people that … what (elected officials are) talking about is people’s votes not actually having any impact, and that leaves a bad taste in people’s mouths,” Marozzi said.

(Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide every week. That’s the estimate Open AI released in late October while announcing new safety measures for people in crisis. When a software program becomes the place young people go to say they want to die, we have crossed into dangerous territory. 
AI companies are filling a mental health gap without meeting the safety expectations we require from licensed clinicians. That’s why Rhode Island needs to establish guardrails before more teens are put at risk.
A recent Brown University study examined how large language models like ChatGPT respond when asked to act like therapists. Even when prompted to use evidence-based techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy, the bots studied routinely violated core counseling ethics. In hundreds of test conversations, they offered false reassurance, overvalidated negative thoughts, and failed to recognize suicide language. The researchers ultimately identified 15 categories of serious ethical risks — lapses that, if made by a human counselor, would trigger oversight boards or malpractice liability. 
For chatbots, there is nothing but a disclaimer.
The consequences are no longer hypothetical. In April 2025, 16-year-old Adam Raine died by suicide. His parents didn’t know how much he was struggling until they looked through his phone and found long exchanges he’d had with ChatGPT, according to the testimony of his father Matthew Raine before a Senate subcommittee hearing on the harms of AI chatbots. In those messages, Adam told the chatbot about his suicidal thoughts and plans. But instead of urging him to reach out for trusted help, the bot discouraged him from doing so and even offered to write his suicide note, according to the testimony.










When a software program becomes the place young people go to say they want to die, we have crossed into dangerous territory. 


Adam’s death has drawn national attention to a larger trend: Young people are increasingly turning to chatbots for emotional support. A national survey by Common Sense Media found that 72% of teenagers have used an AI chatbot as a companion, and about one in eight have sought it for mental health concerns. 
It’s not difficult to see why a teen would do so, considering that nearly half of young adults showing symptoms of anxiety or depression received no treatment last year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. To compound the issue, parts of the brain that manage impulse control, emotional regulation, and risk-taking aren’t fully developed until age 25. That developmental gap leaves teenagers especially sensitive to reward and approval, and less able to question what they’re told. The same vulnerabilities that social media companies exploit to make them scroll endlessly works just as well within a chatbot.
AI has become a lifeline for young people seeking help, but its reach has far outpaced regulation. Rhode Island has a chance to lead the country by building the guardrails that national regulators have been slow to implement.
The state already has the right infrastructure to act: Brown’s researchers are helping steer the national conversation on ethics in technology, and the Rhode Island AI task force, created in February 2024, could set the first standards for mental health safety. State lawmakers should require companies to prove their products are safe before teens can use them, the same way we expect new drugs or medical devices to be tested before they’re used by the public. That review should test whether chatbots can recognize harmful phrases and automatically route users to the 988 Lifeline when necessary.
Second, the Rhode Island Department of Health should treat mental health chatbots as a form of health-related service. The state can then require transparency about what happens to the data after conversations end, who can access it, and whether it is used to train future models. Parents, schools, and clinicians cannot protect kids if they have no idea how these tools actually work. Moreover, the Attorney General’s office can use its consumer-protection authority to prohibit AI companies from making unverified therapeutic claims. If an AI tool markets itself as providing guidance or coaching, it should be held to the same standard of truthfulness that we demand from any medical or counseling service.
The question isn’t whether AI will shape the future of mental health care; it already has. My generation learned to navigate adolescence through platforms that were never built with wellbeing in mind, and we cannot repeat that mistake with AI. Rhode Island has the chance to show that states can act faster and with more responsibility than tech giants. By setting clear standards now, lawmakers can ensure that AI remains a support tool, not another witness to a preventable tragedy.
If you are in crisis or need someone to talk to, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

Getty ImagesGeorgia’s teenagers could soon be doing significantly less scrolling, swiping and tapping on weekdays.
The state Legislature is poised to consider expanding the state’s classroom cell phone ban for elementary and middle schools to high schools. Under the plan passed last year with bipartisan support, school districts had until Jan. 1 to come up with a policy for keeping phones out of student hands during classroom time for kindergarteners through eighth graders, and they have until July to start enforcing it.
Rep. Scott Hilton. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The author of the ban, Peachtree Corners Republican state Rep. Scott Hilton, said he introduced the high school expansion as House Bill 1009 near the start of this year’s legislative session after he said educators gave high marks to what Hilton calls “distraction-free education.”
Districts across the state have implemented their own bans ahead of the state deadline.
“I’ve just been blown away at the positive reaction across the board from all different constituencies, teachers, administrators, parents and even in a lot of cases, students who have experienced a difference and said, ‘Oh, wow, I kind of like this,’” Hilton said.
If the new bill passes the House and Senate and receives Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature, high schools will be required to ban cell phones starting in July 2027.
As of August, 35 states have some form of classroom electronics restriction in place, according to technology news site Techspot. Some states, like Georgia, have banned the devices entirely from the beginning of the day to the end and others have taken more permissive approaches such as allowing phones during lunch or between classes.
Hilton said Georgia is the only state to have started with the lower grades before moving up to high schoolers.
“I think it allowed folks to kind of socialize it, get used to it, and it’s made the transition a lot easier,” he said. “What I love, too, is that a lot of schools have seen the writing on the wall that we were addressing this and have proactively done it themselves already, and so we’ve got some real-world data and anecdotes, not only from across the country, but even inside of Georgia.”
A recent survey from the Professional Association of Georgia Educators found that nearly 72% of teachers in the state say the elementary and middle school ban will improve student learning, and about 71% say high schools should also be cell phone-free zones.
When only high school teachers’ responses were counted, support for a high school ban grew to 83%, the survey found.
School safety
Given the current bill’s popularity with teachers and bipartisan support from last year, the expansion seems likely to find favor in the Legislature this year.
House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, has indicated that he wants to see action on a high school cell phone ban, but speaking to reporters ahead of the start of the session, he added that he also expects lawmakers to consider parents’ and students’ concerns about safety.
Worries about students being unable to contact their families in case of a shooting or other emergency have been a central argument against the cell phone bans, especially in the wake of the deadly 2024 shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder.
Supporters of classroom cell phone bans have emphasized that school emergency plans include procedures for communicating with families and for returning students’ phones to them when it is safe to do so.
House Speaker Jon Burns. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“What we’ve learned from some of the tragic situations we’ve had, like in Barrow County, is that some of that communication certainly is good for the parent to understand that the child is safe, but also interferes with the safety protocols in the school,” Burns said. “So we believe that’s a part of that whole discussion, but you’ll see us move this session, I do believe, to ban cell phones in high schools, because so many jurisdictions around the state have already done that as well, and I think we’re all aware of that.
“I believe that will be something we will certainly have a lively discussion about, but certainly want to respect parents and their feeling of security for their students,” Burns added.
Last week, Apalachee was one of three Barrow County Schools that received called-in threats. The Barrow County Sheriff’s Office placed the entire district on soft lockdown until determining the calls were hoaxes and the schools were safe.
“It raised up a lot of hysteria and a lot of those PTSD triggers and everything because they even brought the choppers out and there was police presence at all the schools, all the schools were locked down and the whole county was pretty shaken up,” said Layla Renee Contreras, an Apalachee High School graduate whose mother and sister were at the school during the 2024 shooting.
Contreras is lead organizer for Change for Chee, an organization pushing for safety improvements in the wake of the shooting.
“I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like when the high schoolers don’t have their cell phones on them,” she said. “Because other places in Georgia, they don’t understand our perspective. We’ve lived through this nightmare already.”
‘The sweet spot’
Speaking to reporters at a media symposium earlier this month, State School Superintendent Richard Woods, who is a Republican, said he supports removing cell phones from high school classrooms because he said they lead to distraction and can harm students’ mental health, but he said he is also cognizant of safety worries.
Superintendent Richard Woods. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“I have a student that’s on my student advisory committee, and this young student was at Apalachee,” Woods said. “This student was shot at Apalachee. And I think, listen, there’s a concern that how we deal with this does have an impact. That young person said ‘my phone helped me.’”
“Do I support this? Absolutely,” Woods added, referring to the cell phone bans. “But I think we have to find a sweet spot and not move to the extremes.”
Woods said the specifics of plans should be left to districts. He said instructional time should be completely free of personal electronic devices, but he added that he may be open to districts allowing high schoolers to use their phones during other times like in between class periods.
“We have 181 school districts, over 200 when you think about charter schools, close to 2,400 schools in the state of Georgia,” he said. “So blanket-wise, yes, we need to preserve and put guidelines on how this should be used, but let the districts find out what’s working for them.”
Contreras said she thinks banning phones during classroom time is reasonable, but high school students should learn to be responsible for their own activity before they head off to college or enter the workforce.
“It should be on their person, on their body, in their book bag or something, accessible to them,” she said.
Schools commonly use devices like special locking bags to secure phones during the day or require students to put their devices in a container at the start of the day.
Hilton’s bill would require schools to restrict access entirely from the morning bell until the dismissal bell with the only exceptions being for activities that do not take place on school grounds like field trips, dual enrollment or apprenticeship programs.
“The best practice really is beginning of the day to the end of the day, and the reason being is if you allow for portions of the day, you get right back kind of where we are right now with teachers having to be cell phone police and discipline issues, and we really don’t want that,” Hilton said in a phone call.
Margaret Ciccarelli, an attorney and director of legislative services for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators, said their educator surveys show teachers also favor the so-called “bell to bell” approach, likely because of the challenges intermittent phone use creates during transitions on campus.
“During non-instructional periods like lunch, students are distracted by phones and social media and less likely to engage positively with one another in a face-to-face setting,” she said.
Ciccarelli said surveys also show that educators are expecting parental push back on phone bans – 71% reported anticipating “strong parental or caregiver resistance.”
Hilton said he understands parents wanting to be able to get in touch with their children during the day, but eliminating the distraction of cell phones entirely is best for their education.
“I’ve got kids in school as well, and I catch my own self wanting to text them something,” he said. “I think the parents, in some respects, are part of the challenge, as we’ve got to understand and adapt ourselves to the fact that kids need to be learning and focused on that in school.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A group called Washington County for Safe Drinking recently filed an ethics complaint with the Ohio Joint Legislative Ethics Committee against Republican Ohio state Sen. Brian Chavez over alleged oil and gas conflicts.
The ethics complaint argues Chavez’s alleged conflicts of interest and voting record as the Ohio Senate Energy Committee Chair shows he has prioritized personal financial gain.  
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The complaint alleges Chavez’s conflicts of interest regarding undisclosed business entities and fast-tracking legislation that could benefit these interests,” the complaint said. “When public officials with financial ties to an industry shape laws that directly benefit that industry, it undermines public trust across the entire state.”
Buckeye Environmental Network, Save Ohio Parks, and FaCT Ohio also signed the letter, which calls for an investigation. 
“This is a fundamental crisis of public trust that impacts every Ohioan’s right to safe drinking water and ethical governance,” Washington County for Safe Drinking Water spokesperson Hillary Royster said in a statement. 
Ohio law prohibits Joint Legislative Ethics Committee members or staff from confirming or denying receiving a complaint or allegation, said Ohio Joint Legislative Ethics Committee Executive Director Tony Bledsoe. 
“Therefore, I am unable to provide any further comment,” Bledsoe said in an email. 
When the Capital Journal reached out to Chavez for comment, John Fortney, spokesperson for the Ohio Senate Republicans, responded. 
“These radicalized local groups could care less about ethics, much less safe drinking water,” Fortney said in an email. “This is another baseless, desperate, and hollow attack funded by billionaire California special interests with the single goal of killing the oil and gas industry in Ohio.”
Chavez — who was appointed to the Ohio Senate in December 2023 after Frank Hoagland retired and was elected to a four-year term in 2024 — has many connections to Ohio’s oil and gas industry.
Before becoming a senator, he was a member of the Oil and Gas Commission, served as a trustee for the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, was on the board of the Southeast Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and managed and owned Reno Oil & Gas, Inc.
Chavez resigned as vice president of Heinrich Enterprises, Inc — his wife’s family’s oil and gas business — in 2024, according to Chavez’s 2024 Financial Disclosure Statement.
He was CEO of DeepRock Disposal Solutions, a wastewater disposal company that uses deep-well injections, until 2024. Chavez, however, was listed as a DeepRock Disposal Solutions manager in its 2025 annual report filed with the state of West Virginia, according to the complaint. 
Chavez “does not disclose ownership in DeepRock Disposal Solutions LLC in either his 2023 or his 2024 financial disclosure forms,” according to the complaint. 
“Signing documents as the CEO of DeepRock Disposal Solutions LLC, but failing to disclose employment, or any other interest, with respect to that specific company at any point in the past, is not a standard that the Ohio Ethics Commission should want to set,” the complaint says. 
DeepRock is currently facing litigation in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Brine injected into a DeepRock well migrated underground and erupted to the surface in an abandoned well in Noble County in 2021. DeepRock did not have to pay for clean-up and the state spent about $1.3 million to plug the leak and clean it up. 
Chavez did not disclose his or his immediate family members’ interest in Heinrich Property LLC, Horizon Partners Investments LLC, Funds Protection Investment LLC, Condevco Operating LLC, and DeepRock Disposal Solutions LLC, according to the complaint. 
“Failing to list a single LLC for which you have an interest on a state financial disclosure form is a problem,” the complaint says. “Failing to fully disclose interests in as many as five or even six LLCs … is more than a simple oversight.”
The ethics complaint also alleges Chavez fast-tracked a bill that could financial benefit him. 
Ohio Senate Bill 219 would change the state’s orphan well program by proposing a dedicated fund for plugging orphan wells and streamlining notice requirements before work would begin. An orphan well is an abandoned oil and gas well that has no owner, meaning no one is able to properly plug the well.
It also makes it easier for drillers to get expedited review of projects, limits liability after a well owner sells one of their wells and gets rid of a requirement for drillers to make road-use agreements with local governments. 
The bill was introduced in June by Republican Senator Al Landis, passed the Senate in November, and is now in the Ohio House. 
Chavez Well Service has bid on five orphan well contracts since Chavez became a senator and won one contract worth more that $200,000, according to the complaint.  
“Should Senate Bill 219 become law, the injection well industry will be set to make more money with less oversight,” according to the complaint. “Consequently, Senator Chavez, with both his disclosed and undisclosed interests, could stand to profit from the provisions in Senate Bill 219.” 
Ohio’s Orphan Well Program has plugged approximately 2,300 abandoned wells since its inception in 1977.

(Getty Images)As a family doctor, I have been trained to ask questions, and after years of study and practice, I’ve become pretty good at it.
The question I find myself asking about a recent article published by The Guardian (“‘A bombshell’: Doubt cast on discovery of microplastics throughout human body,” Jan. 13), calling into question the relevance of micro- and nanoplastics to human health is, why? Why would a publication known for its journalistic commitment to robust and factual evidence give oxygen to aspersions on a well-established quorum of scientific consensus?
This is a confounding question in light of the plethora of articles that The Guardian has previously published to the contrary regarding micro- and nanoplastics and human health.
Just two weeks ago, for instance, The Guardian ran an article highlighting the widely agreed upon finding that “burning plastic releases noxious compounds such as dioxins, furans, and heavy metals” (“Household burning of plastic waste in developing world is hidden health threat, study shows,” Jan. 8). This research surveyed 1,000 respondents across 26 countries. The “bombshell” article fails to provide similar significant quantitative objections.
In New Hampshire, where the literal downstream health and environmental impacts of micro- and nanoplastics are readily apparent, The Guardian’s assessment grossly undervalues the lived experience in favor of weak general claims of insufficient scientific rigor.
Included in the long list of noxious compounds associated with the production of plastics are the “forever chemicals” colloquially known as PFAS. These chemicals contaminate air, soil, and water, and have been shown to cause a variety of cancers, thyroid and gastrointestinal disease, and cardiovascular disease. They have been banned because of their toxicity.
The Guardian rightly acknowledges a few facts in its risky article: There is too much plastic in the world, it is a growing problem, it has microscopically made its way into our bodies, and we should probably try to avoid a lot of it.
For reasons that are unclear, The Guardian chose to publish an article of distraction, diverting attention and credibility from this very serious and well-established problem. While the science showing exactly what this means for human health does have room for improvement and growth, it is morally reprehensible to conflate this natural level of uncertainty with a lack of actionable evidence.
The Hippocratic oath is the foundation of medicine, and first doing no harm is the foundation of my care for every patient. So again I ask, why is this fundamental tenet now being challenged?
We all, doctors, health care providers, scientists, journalists, corporate CEOs, and individuals, need to remember this for our own well-being. Part of doing no harm means assuming a conservative approach when it comes to exposure to toxic substances, which we have not always done well.

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Margery Koveleski didn’t know it at the time, but her life’s work began in 2018, when her former pastor asked the mother of six if she could interpret Sunday services for a group of recently arrived Haitians. Church services led to teaching English classes, which led to interpreting at a community health clinic, which led to opening an office in the back of a Haitian grocery store.  There, for nearly five years now, Margery has helped Haitians settle into this midwestern city of 60,000 that became a flashpoint for the country’s immigration debate during the 2024 presidential campaign.
At first, a lot of Margery’s work revolved around setting things up: utilities, cell phones, health care. Then, as President Donald Trump escalated his immigration crackdown to unprecedented levels, her focus shifted to winding things down. Margery is now a lifeline for her Haitian neighbors as they fight to stay in a country where fewer and fewer legal pathways are available to them. Without a last-minute reprieve, the clock has likely run out on many of their American journeys.
Margery has called Springfield home since she moved here about 24 years ago from New York, where she was born and raised. She learned Haitian Creole as a child by translating for her maternal grandmother, who joined them in New York from Haiti. Now, she shares the language of her ancestors — and her calling — with her 27-year-old daughter, Laura Koveleski, who moved home to Ohio from Florida about three years ago.
Margery’s work, done from a desk in a closet-sized storeroom an arm’s length from where her daughter now sits, sometimes demands long hours, produces little income and isn’t the type of job you leave behind when you go home for the day. They know their clients are depending on them, now more than ever, and they’re willing to give them whatever they need most: a ride to court, a sympathetic ear, a call to an employer to negotiate family leave.

Lately, supporting clients as they try to sort out their immigration cases takes up more and more of their time. Margery’s massive desk calendar notes the increasingly frequent all-day trips they make with Haitians to Ohio’s main immigration court in Cleveland, about a three-hour drive. On one such day last autumn, Margery’s alarm went off at 3 a.m. She made her way to the guest bedroom downstairs to make sure Laura was awake. Within the hour, they were out the door to pick up a man on Springfield’s south side, where most of the city’s Haitian immigrants live. A soft rain fell as Laura merged their rental car — picked up the night before, to spare their own from the wear-and-tear — east on I-70, then north on I-71, past the soggy corn and soybean fields that line the interstates most of the way to Cleveland.
Mother and daughter talked quietly as their client caught up on sleep in the back seat. They all knew they were making the journey, which clocks in at least nine hours from pick-up to drop-off, despite near certainty that the man’s asylum claim would be denied. During a prior court appearance, a judge gave him 30 days to produce proof of personal persecution in Haiti, with the type of evidence that is all but impossible to get in a country where armed gangs rule the capital and routine government services barely exist.
It’s a now-familiar predicament for so many in his community.
The man was one of some 330,000 Haitians in the United States under a program known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, which gives people from certain countries in conflict or facing natural disasters the ability to live and work in the United States for a set period of time. He was seeking asylum because barring action from the federal courts, TPS for Haitians ends February 3. Less than two weeks now remain for hundreds of thousands of Haitians to make an impossible choice: go back to an unstable, violent and desperately poor country where they fear they might die; leave and start again in another new country; or slip into the shadows in the United States, unable to work or live freely.
It all has Margery, a no-nonsense nurturer whom many clients call “manman” — Haitian Creole for “mother” — rethinking whether her city and country are the type of places where Haitians should try to put down roots and build lives.
“I went through a process of grief, but I’m now at acceptance,” Margery said.
Margery and Laura arrived back from the trip to Cleveland in the last light of the grey day. On the ride home, their client said he’d likely go to Mexico ahead of the TPS end date; other Haitians have told them they plan to leave for Brazil or Chile. After dropping him off at home, mother and daughter headed to Eat Greek and More, a favorite spot by the reservoir in Springfield’s northeast suburbs. They ordered at the counter, then slid into a booth. Their falafel arrived in plastic baskets lined with red-and-white checkered paper. Now that they’re regulars, the owner often makes eating there all the more enticing by sending over fries or dessert on the house. Margery first tried Greek food with Laura in Cincinnati, and she was thrilled to find such a good option a couple of miles from home. It’s become their go-to place to bring visitors, an introduction to their city that defies preconceived notions about small towns in red states far away from the country’s coasts.
It also serves as yet another reminder of the good that immigration has brought to Springfield at a time when the issue threatens to tear their city — and their country — apart.

Springfield has been on edge since the final months of the 2024 presidential election, when now-President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who was then one of Ohio’s U.S. senators, spread the lie that Haitians in Springfield were eating their neighbors’ pets — a convenient internet fable that bolstered their ticket’s call for mass deportations. Vance grew up just an hour’s drive away, in similarly sized Middletown, Ohio, which did not take the same steps to welcome Haitian immigrants as Springfield did and has also not experienced a recent economic resurgence. When CNN’s Dana Bash confronted Vance about his role spreading the pet-eating lie, he said that it was OK to  “create stories” that drew attention to issues his constituents cared about, like immigration.
But much of the attention directed at  Springfield was negative and laced with violence. Neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups like Blood Tribe and Patriot Front disrupted community events and protested in front of City Hall. Phoned-in bomb threats forced the temporary closure of schools. Local charity leaders helping Haitians were doxxed; business owners employing Haitian workers were threatened. To many in Springfield, it started to feel like their community, where leaders had taken great lengths to help Haitians assimilate by amping up translation services and securing training systems for new drivers, was starting to come apart at the seams.
It wasn’t that Springfield absorbed the estimated 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants that arrived in Ohio’s Clark County in recent years without issue. Though Haitians began immigrating to the area more than a decade ago, their numbers increased during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, when staffing agencies recruited them for jobs that paid as much as $20 an hour — jobs that employers couldn’t seem to fill. The rapid influx stressed local resources, particularly housing, because Haitian workers often rented bedrooms in shared homes and could therefore collectively pay higher rents than many longtime local families. It created some resentment.
Tensions worsened in August 2023 when a Haitian immigrant driving without an Ohio license crashed into a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy on the first day of school. The next year, a jury convicted the driver of aggravated vehicular homicide and involuntary manslaughter. Trump and Vance seized on the tragedy as further evidence that Haitians were criminals, cherry-picking crime statistics to present Springfield as a city under siege. The student’s devastated parents pleaded at city meetings for people to stop invoking their son’s death to justify anti-immigrant hatred.
What the vitriol obscured, according to Margery and many other longtime Springfield residents, were the improvements that followed the most recent wave of Haitian arrivals: formerly boarded-up houses were renovated and filled, employers expanded in the region thanks to a reliable workforce, and small businesses like restaurants and grocery stores opened to serve Haitians nostalgic for home.
Springfield’s Republican mayor worked to dispel the pet-eating myth. Ohio’s GOP governor, Mike DeWine, also tried to turn down the temperature, promising to send more resources to the city where he was born. DeWine was familiar with conditions on the ground in Haiti: He had made dozens of trips there over the years to visit a school named for a daughter who died in a car accident when she was 22; the school was forced to close in early 2024 due to worsening violence. “Haitians are — culturally, my wife, Fran, and I have seen this when we’ve been down in Haiti — education is prized,” DeWine told ABC’s “This Week.” “So when you look at all of these things, people who want to work, people who value their kids, who value education, you know, these are positive influences on our community in Springfield.”
Trump’s second administration has attempted to move up the TPS end date for Haitians (the effort was blocked by the courts) and cut off other avenues for Haitians to obtain different types of legal immigration statuses. Over his first year in office, Haitians have become less visible on Springfield’s streets and foot traffic is down at businesses serving Haitian immigrants, like the grocery store that hosts Margery’s office. As scenes of armed and masked immigration agents breaking down doors in Minneapolis homes began to unfold on smartphone screens in Springfield in recent weeks, Haitians — and their American neighbors — grew more and more afraid. Charities and churches have developed meal-delivery systems so Haitians do not need to leave their houses.

DeWine, who has privately told local charities that his hands are tied when it comes to federal immigration policy, recently warned that if there is no reprieve on TPS, it could jeopardize Springfield’s recent economic upswing, which also boosted fortunes in the larger rural region.
Sometimes, Margery wonders whether it’s time to close up shop.
“Is it worth it to fight to stay in America, now? That’s a question I ask myself,” she said as she and Laura finished their dinner of falafel and owner-proffered fries. “If our government is changing, if more than half of the population is okay with what’s happening, is it really worth it?”
“Changing drastically, so as far as deportations, could be good news, bad news, who knows,” Laura added.
“I used to live in fear of all this mistreatment,” said Margery, “and I’m seeing what’s happening, and because I believe in God, and I know that God is sovereign, if they’re deporting them, who’s to know that is not the best thing?”

Margery’s faith in God is what drew her to Springfield in the first place.
When the Koveleskis were living in New York City, they would travel the country in their motor home, visiting other congregations affiliated with their own conservative, majority-Black Christian church, including one in Springfield. On September 11, 2001, Margery’s husband was at work when two planes flew into the World Trade Center; they couldn’t reach each other for hours. Their fear compelled them to move their young family to safety. A church friend who had hosted them during their Christmastime trips asked, “Why not Springfield?” They moved the next year.
By the time Haitians were arriving in Springfield in earnest, Margery had soured on her church. There was a sex scandal involving a pastor in a neighboring state, and then reports of financial improprieties in another congregation. The church embraced divine healing — the belief that you can recover from illness and injury through the healing power of God without medical intervention — around the same time that Margery needed life-saving caesarean sections to deliver her two youngest children. That, she said, was when she finally “lost the faith.” She now describes herself as spiritual but not religious.
Still, in 2018, when her former pastor asked if she would put differences aside and step up to interpret Sunday services for a group of Haitian congregants, she did not hesitate. She also started teaching them English in the evening.
“I remember the first night they saw snow,” Margery recalled. “They were laughing and opening their mouths, and they were praising God, seeing snow for the first time in their life; this was magical for them.”
One of the students was an older man named Moses. “He had a t-shirt on, and it was snowing, and I said, ‘Moses, you have no coat, aren’t you cold? You should wear a sweater.” She remembered him responding: “No, I’m in America. I’m in America. I’m gonna learn to be content. I’m gonna train my body to be grateful and happy, and so if I’m cold, I’m not going to complain. I’m going to give God thanks because I’m able to be in America, I’m able to work, and I have security, I have a church. What else do I need?”
Margery knew that Moses would nevertheless need a coat to get through Ohio’s winter. She asked the congregation if they could collect cold-weather apparel one Sunday for their Haitian worshippers and was disappointed when church leaders said they would need to hold a special meeting to discuss what seemed like a routine effort, and one they’d done before for other groups in need.
But, she said, God found another way. The principal at her younger son’s school, where she volunteered, overheard her talking about working with the Haitians at church and wrote a no-strings-attached $1,000 check. Margery and her husband used it to buy dozens of coats, gloves and hats, and distributed them to the Haitians after a Sunday service. It was like Christmas arrived early, she said.
Then came her breaking point.
At the end of another church service, when congregants had the opportunity to talk about something God had done in their lives, a debate erupted over whether the Haitians, who were dutifully and enthusiastically paying their tithes, were truly full congregants and able to offer testimony. One American congregant, she said, asked if the Haitians attending church alongside them were “legal.”
When it was Margery’s turn to testify about God’s work in her life, she took the microphone and walked her fellow congregants through passages of the Bible related to persecution and forced migration, and she talked to them about the Underground Railroad.
“I burnt the church with my tongue,” she recalled. “I rebuked the church and the minister, everybody, and I didn’t come back after that.”
But it didn’t take her long to find other ways to continue what had become her own ministry.
For several months, after she and her husband were forced to shutter their high-end furniture store during the pandemic, Margery interpreted for Haitian Creole-speaking patients at a community health care center. Then, a friend from church who knew about her work with the Haitian community called to tell her she’d seen a small grocery store on the city’s south side with a Haitian flag displayed in its window.
Margery wrote down the address, then went to check it out. The owner was a Haitian American with a green card who had recently moved to Springfield from New York, sensing a business opportunity when he heard that Haitian workers were settling in the city. She introduced herself; he said she could help his customers set up their phones and utilities and figure out their dates in immigration court from his grocery.
Margery started out at a little table, set up among the bins of cassava and coolers of Cola Couronne, an amber-colored Haitian soda that tastes like an effervescent fruit punch and is fondly called “Caribbean champagne.” At first, she worked entirely for free. Then, she started accepting small payments to cover supplies like stamps and envelopes. It became clear that her work would require its own designated space — to keep the aisles clear in the grocery store, but also for privacy. Many of Margery’s clients had traveled the harrowing migration route through the Darién Gap, the remote, dense rain forest that links Colombia and Panama. It was not uncommon for their stories to include details of their own sexual assaults or the family members they lost to sickness or injury along the way. They needed a quiet space to unburden themselves. They needed a quiet space to pray.

Now, a slightly larger storage room in the rear of the grocery acts as a waiting area for Margery’s clients until it is their turn to take a seat in the closet-sized storeroom office she shares with Laura. Clients got to know Laura from the small trinkets and jewelry she gifted them, like sheets of earrings from the budget mall shop Claire’s. The gifts helped inject a little joy into the otherwise dreary experience of dealing with the U.S. immigration system.
Laura learned Haitian Creole by listening to clients’ migration stories. Some, she memorialized in paint. One painting, above Margery’s desk, depicts a father and young son holding hands as they face the jungle; the client’s wife and the son’s mother did not survive the trip. The painting above Laura’s own desk shows Haiti’s La Citadelle, a 19th century fortress honoring the successful slave rebellion that led to the country’s independence from France. In the painting, a young boy stands with his mother at the base of the winding, uphill road that leads to Haitian independence, with earthquakes and other obstacles along the way.
“We hear a lot of stories of what it took for people to get here. People who walk from Chile, people who walk from Brazil, people who maybe took a flight from Haiti to Nicaragua, but walk from Nicaragua. All of those people, walking up to the U.S.-Mexico border, hoping to get some sort of permission to enter the country,” Laura said. “During that route, you’re walking through the jungle with your family. A lot of people don’t make it. People fell from mountains. People drown in rivers. If you break a leg, you can’t keep walking, and you can’t have somebody carry you the whole way through, so you hope something will take you out.”

Margery and Laura now work out of their grocery-store office three or four days a week. Each day brings a little bit of everything. A sign in Haitian Creole hanging in the waiting area clarifies what the women can — and cannot  — do for their clients.
Laura translated the words as Margery gently corrected her grammar: “I’m not a lawyer; I’m not an immigration officer; I’m not a U.S.C.I.S. officer; I’m not a judge; I can’t make any decision on your case or process your case; I can’t call or check your status without you; I can’t call immigration without you; I can’t guarantee the results; I can assist you, I can help you with your application, I can write a letter, I can help you get information; I can’t do a miracle, only Jesus can.”

On a chilly day in December, the task at hand was wedding planning. Laura had already gone with the client to weigh in on the dress — intricate lacing, dramatic back, short train — and was now ordering a suit for the bride’s infant son on Amazon. While the client had the money to pay for the suit, she did not have a credit card, so Laura used theirs for the purchase. Once the suit was ordered, they started brainstorming beautiful and free indoor spots in Columbus for wedding photos. Several feet away, another mother met with Margery because she needed help asking her employer for time off work after giving birth.
A couple of months earlier, on a sunny day in October, most of the people who stopped by had questions about a new immigration fee that the Trump administration had announced without explaining how people should pay it. Haitians wanted to comply with the new rule to improve their chances of staying in the country, so they waited in folding chairs against shelves of cassava bread, coconut milk and cases of mango-strawberry juice. Among them was a man with a red folder of documents and a woman bouncing a baby on her knee.
Margery’s cell phone did not stop ringing.
“Alo,” she answered in Haitian Creole. “Yes, you’ll see a Haitian flag in the window,” she said once it was clear that the man on the other end of the line spoke fluent English.
Soon, a master sergeant in his U.S. Army fatigues poked his head into the office to make sure he was in the right place. He held his elderly mother’s purse as she and her husband, dressed in their Sunday best, settled into chairs in the waiting area. His mother and stepfather had called him the night before, he explained, ahead of a court appearance that day because they needed his help interpreting. He drove more than 15 hours overnight from Louisiana to meet them at court in Columbus, only to find out family members could not act as interpreters; the interviews would need to be rescheduled. A lawyer overheard the exchange and shared Margery’s phone number, so the master sergeant, his mother and stepfather got back the car and drove the hour-plus to see her in Springfield.
“They’re frantic right now,” the master sergeant assured Margery, gesturing to the prim and stoic elderly couple sitting outside her office door.
It only took minutes — the master sergeant didn’t even sit down — for them to work out that Margery would assist his mother and stepfather at their rescheduled interview. The master sergeant bought a Couronne, then took his parents to lunch. He would take a short nap before driving back to Louisiana.
“You’re a good son,” Margery said,  then turned back to help the new mother.
Margery and Laura’s work navigating the morass of the U.S. court and immigration systems has only become more essential in recent weeks as the TPS end date looms for Haitians. They said that many are hoping that a federal court intervenes and extends the program. Clients are banking on a judge ruling that since TPS was created to protect people who cannot safely return to their home countries, they cannot be sent back to Haiti — where many of them do want to return someday — until conditions improve.
Margery said she can’t help but think sometimes about one of her favorite musicals, “Fiddler on the Roof.” In it, Tevye is a poor Jewish milkman living in early 1900s Russia. He and his family decide to flee anti-Semitic pogroms in their Jewish village of Anatevka, and the final scene shows them on a ship headed to safety in New York. In Margery’s present-day reimagining, Springfield is Anatevka, Haitians are the persecuted people and the United States is the country they must consider leaving to find safety.
Margery is trying to accept that the country that offered her own parents safe harbor in the 1960s, then the city that offered her own growing family refuge after 9/11, are no longer the beacons to newcomers that they once were. She is trying to make peace with what that means — for her clients, for herself, for her country.
“We’ve made so many enemies in the world. If the world is turning away from America, who could know the consequences that America is going to reap?” Margery asked.
“We may need to lose everything,” she added, “in order to be put back together again.”

Josh Shapiro vowed on Saturday to take legal action against the federal government for a decision to remove an exhibit on slavery at Independence National Historic Park in Philadelphia.
“It is important that we do not allow them to succeed,” he said.

During his book launch of “Where We Keep the Light” at the Parkway Central Library in Philadelphia, Shapiro delivered pointed criticism at President Donald Trump’s administration for the Department of Interior’s actions on Thursday to remove the exhibit about the nine people enslaved by George Washington at the President’s House Site. He accused the federal government of attempting to divide people, while whitewashing the nation’s shared history. 
Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker’s administration, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, filed its lawsuit on Thursday and said that in 2006, the city and federal government signed a cooperative agreement that may require advance notice for changes to the site and added that the city is reviewing its options.

Shapiro said he is working closely with the Parker administration and will be filing an amicus brief to support them. 
“We are exploring ways in which we can get those displays back up either on city or state owned property nearby,” Shapiro said. 
Noting that the nation is celebrating its 250th birthday, Shapiro emphasized the importance for acknowledging history. 
“How can we go forward if we don’t know our history,” Shapiro. “How can we go forward if we don’t remember where we came from?”
“Those signs aren’t just signs. It’s not just metal and ink,” he added. “What that is, is our shared history.”
ABC News reported on Friday that a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior said the move complies with Trump’s executive order in March 2025 to remove “divisive, race-centered ideology” and narratives from federal cultural institutions.
However, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), an ally of Trump, also voiced his disagreement with removing the exhibit, while likening it to his opposition to the changing of names of some military bases.
“Our history is our history. It is our willingness to learn from it that makes America exceptional and the greatest country on Earth, on our journey to become a more perfect union,” McCormick wrote, in part, in a social media post on Saturday.
Shapiro expressed confidence that they will be successful in getting the display back up.
Shapiro says he’s prepared to protect the vote ahead of midterm elections
Shapiro said he “fully expects” Trump to “continue to try and undermine our elections,” ahead of the 2026 midterm, in response to a question submitted to the moderator by an audience member. 
“We continue to have free and fair, safe and secure elections,” he said. “I will do everything in my power to stop anyone from taking away your vote in the midterms.”
Shapiro, who was elected governor in 2022, is seeking a second term in November. His likely opponent is Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who supports Trump.
He referenced his time as the state’s attorney general during the 2020 election when Trump sued the state 43 times in an effort to overturn the election, but was unsuccessful.

“Suffice to say we are on it. We are prepared,” Shapiro said. “We will do everything in our power to protect your vote. That is your power and we will protect it.”
Throughout the event, Shapiro delivered pointed criticism of Trump on a wide variety of matters, including his administration’s actions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
Outside of the event, protesters gathered to call on Shapiro’s administration to not cooperate with ICE.
However, he also said Democrats have to do more than just fight against Trump, but have to make an effort to improve the lives of citizens. Shapiro touched on usual themes from his speeches about the importance of investing in education and public safety, while working across the aisle with Republicans, who hold a majority in the state Senate.
Recalling arson attack, Shapiro highlights power of prayer
For a sizable portion of the program, Shapiro, alongside Salem Baptist Church Pastor Marshall Mitchell, talked about how faith has shaped his life and career. 
Shapiro said he was five months into writing the book when Cody Balmer, a Harrisburg man, firebombed the Governor’s Residence while his family and guests were sleeping after Passover.

He said the power of prayer from people of all walks of life lifted him and his family up in that difficult moment. 
Shapiro also described growing up in a home that was structured around religion in Montgomery County, noting he attended a faith-based school, and celebrated shabbat dinner on Friday with his family. He said he and his wife, First Lady Lori Shapiro, raise their children to be connected to their faith.
Following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel by Hamas, Shapiro said he heard from those who were Jewish who were scared and said he felt a responsibility to be more open about this faith, as antisemitism and other forms of bigotry were on the rise.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who is mentioned in the book, considered Shapiro as her running mate in 2024 and reportedly asked if the governor had ever been an agent of Israel. CNN reports Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who Harris selected to run as vice president, was also asked if he had ever been an agent of China. Shapiro did not mention her during the event.
Multiple elected officials were in attendance, including U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-Philadelphia), state Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia), multiple members of the state House, and a representative from Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker’s office. 
State Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) was spotted outside at the immigration protest. 
2028 on the horizon
As Shapiro seeks a second term as governor, he is being mentioned as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028. 
Mitchell, who served as the moderator, ended the event by noting that Shapiro often talks about basketball in the book and referenced an analogy about how the governor wants the ball in his hand so he can take the shot. 
“There’s a lot of people in this room and a lot of people who are listening who are counting on you taking your shot,” Mitchell said. “Now and in the not-so-distant future.”
The next stops along the book tour for Shapiro include New York on Tuesday, Boston on Wednesday, and Washington D.C on Thursday.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/slavery-exhibit-philly-1-1024x661.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 04:57:16.760364

One of its biggest purposes — if not its single-most important — consists of spending money for schools, roads and other public services. But budgets sound dull. Dealing with columns of figures puts many Kansans to sleep. It’s understandable.
It’s also dangerous. 
As I learned during my years in the nonprofit world, budgets are moral documents. What you choose to spend money on reveals what you prioritize. What you choose to cut reveals what you dismiss.
Just look at funding for public schools and universities.


Educational institutions with more resources can offer students more programs, more skilled teachers and more enrichment opportunities. Schools with fewer resources struggle to cover the basics. Kansans grasp this. Many move to Johnson County and other privileged communities for “good schools” supported by property taxes.
If the state doesn’t support public schools and universities adequately, what kind of judgment does it make about our state’s children and young adults? What kind of judgment does it make about our society and our future?
The Kansas Legislature’s annual budget debate is set to kick off with a Monday hearing. I urge you to pay attention, to actively track where the money goes. Watch what lawmakers actually do with the billions of dollars that comprise our state budget. Are they using those dollars to support the people of Kansas — especially those most in need of assistance — or are they handing out freebies to favored groups?
You will hear one claim at some moment that they have to go along with a cut they don’t like or a long-term reduction they hope to reverse in the future. Treat them with the utmost skepticism.
Every lawmaker, Republican and Democrat, conservative and liberal, has free will. They have the ability to choose. They will all make moral judgments in the days and weeks ahead. Let’s see what they do.

Higher education chatter
I dropped by the weekly press conference held by House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard and Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, both Lenexa Democrats, on Thursday. The two chatted with reporters about the budget rush (see above) and life in the opposition party.
One question raised was whether the Legislature would take dramatic steps to reduce spending. And by dramatic, I mean closing Emporia State University.
Woodard told me in a follow-up email: “There has been talk of that my whole time in the legislature, but I haven’t seen any action steps to actually make that a reality. I think with a new leader, they can restore the faith and enrollment in Emporia State University.”
As I wrote last month, let’s hope thats true.
Former Emporia State president Ken Hush, meanwhile, has been brought on as a budget consultant for the Legislature. But Woodard told the assembled reporters Thursday that he hadn’t seen hide nor hair of the man.
“As one of his eight bosses, I haven’t had a conversation with him since they allegedly hired him for $10,000 a month,” the House minority leader said. “I haven’t seen him in any of the budget committees.”
I have spotted Hush hurrying through the Statehouse hallways, but apparently he wasn’t going to meet Democrats.
Woodard told me he hoped lawmakers would soon have a broader conversation about Kansas higher education. That doesn’t mean closing Emporia State, but it could mean considering tough steps. As demographics change and fewer students enroll, problems will inevitably follow.
“I do hope we can start strategic planning for what our university system looks like two decades from now after the enrollment cliff, and whether it is feasible to maintain six institutions or not,” he wrote.

Friendlier vibe detected
I’ve detected a slightly different tone at the Kansas Statehouse this session. Maybe the upcoming primary and general elections are the cause, maybe folks have just showed up with different dispositions.
In either case, I’ve noted a generally lower temperature and slightly friendlier vibe. This doesn’t mean the Legislature will get around to serving everyday Kansas anytime soon, mind you, but perhaps that accelerated schedule and a desire to avoid looking like extremists in front of voters has sanded the rough edges off a handful of legislators.
Budget hearings this week will be a test, as will the ongoing partisan shadowboxing in Rep. Pat Proctor’s House Elections Committee. Can even lower-key lawmakers restrain themselves when the chance to undercut Democrats or poor people arises?
We’ll all have to wait and see.

Kansas Reflector funding
The question of how Kansas Reflector is funded comes up every year or two. We’ve always been open and honest about the process, but in case you haven’t heard our explanation before, here it is.
We’re part of States Newsroom, a national nonprofit devoted to providing state news coverage of issues that otherwise would go underreported, or unreported. When Kansas Reflector launched on July 21, 2020, we were the organization’s 18th outlet. States Newsroom now oversees newsrooms in 39 states and has content-sharing agreements with nonprofits in the other 11. In other words, we have boots on the ground in every state of the nation.
Based in North Carolina, States Newsroom handles high-level fundraising and human resource duties for all of these outlets. You can read our parent’s tax returns and browse a list of everyone who has contributed more than $1,000 at statenewsroom.com/support.
If you want to know more about the organization, feel free to read these pieces from The Washington Post and the Columbia Journalism Review.
In recent years, Kansas Reflector has focused more on local fundraising. In 2025, we’re proud to say that we brought in a record amount from folks across the state, who donated an average of $38 apiece. In total, you all contributed an amount that equates to about 40% of our yearly budget.
Folks at the town halls we’ve held across the state sometimes ask how solid we feel about our funding model and our future.
The answer? We feel good about both.
Admittedly, the news media faces challenges from every front. But as long as we do our jobs to the best of our ability, and as long as Kansans support our work as strongly as they have in recent years, I expect us to be around for a long time to come.
Kansas lawmakers should take note.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Last year, Congress rushed to push through all of the president’s wish list as H.R. 1, the “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” while the new president’s honeymoon poll numbers were still intact. 
The bill enacted a range of policies, including making President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent, exempting tips and overtime from federal income taxes, and requiring new work requirements for safety net features like Medicaid.
One item that flew under the radar for many but has been reported by the Cleveland-based Center for Community Solutions since last year is a provision that changes the funding structure for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, previously known as “food stamps”). 
The new law enacted new requirements on states, requiring them to reduce benefit provision error rates or be required to pick up larger parts of the tab for SNAP.
The problem with this requirement is that Congress set the required error rate so low that only seven states would have achieved it in 2024.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to the Center for Community Solutions, Ohio’s error rate was 9% in 2024 and if Ohio’s rate is that high in 2026, the state will be on the hook for $318 million in SNAP payments that it previously did not have to pay.
An estimate by the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality in September put that number at closer to $390 million. 
It seems like whomever you ask, Ohio will be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars if it wants to keep its SNAP program.
To understand the scale of this, a $318 million new SNAP obligation would make Ohio’s new SNAP obligation on its own as expensive as a top-10 agency in the state government. 
That would make continuing to fund SNAP as expensive as Ohio’s entire Department of Natural Resources, Department of Health, and Department of Transportation combined according to Legislative Service Commission data.
$300 million or more is no tiny line item, even for a large state like Ohio. 
Ohio has previously balked at proposals for $300 million food programs, so there is a strong scenario that Ohio ends up with a $300 million tab from the federal government later this year and state legislators balk at it, leading to the end of the SNAP program in Ohio.
SNAP is a big deal. 
It is one of the largest antipoverty programs in the country, pulling an estimated 3.6 million Americans out of poverty. 
In our 2024 study of poverty in Ohio, we estimated that over 1.5% of the state population is kept out of poverty by SNAP. That means that under a conservative scenario, 180,000 Ohio residents would be plunged into poverty by dropping the program.
SNAP is a program that reduces poverty, reduces food insecurity, and supports local grocers. 
Losing the $260 million a month that the federal government finances in grocery spending in Ohio through SNAP will mean the closing of grocery stores that serve low-income households across the state, especially considering the low margins grocery stores run on. 
This could be especially devastating for low-income, rural communities like Vinton County, Ohio, which endured a stint a decade ago where it had no grocery store throughout the entire county.
Ohio is on the precipice of facing the consequences of H.R. 1. 
Hopefully federal policymakers realize the dangers of playing chicken with the U.S. safety net and decide to pump the brakes, otherwise hundreds of thousands of low-income residents in Ohio will suffer.

Or even an average one. 
While knowing how and why government works is a good start, elected leaders need much more to steer any ship of state and keep it from running aground on everything from debilitating partisanship to undue special interest influence to wing-nut conspiracy theories. 
That said, please do not confuse the broadside above with me finding Legislative Bill 1066 wholly disagreeable. The proposed legislation would require Nebraska state senators to take a 20-question civics test and post their scores on the Nebraska Legislature’s website.
Support for civics emphasis
Holding political office without a grounding in civics is a poor look, one that eventually comes to light. Cases in point: A U.S. senator from Alabama and now candidate for governor there famously did not know the aforementioned three branches of government. Another U.S. senator publicly confused the Constitution with the Declaration of Independence. The Secretary of Homeland Security didn’t know the meaning of habeas corpus.
While a nominal civic education assures nothing, it is critical to be an effective office holder. LB 1066 hopes to remedy potential failings among those who represent us in the Unicameral.
Should Nebraska legislators be tested on civics knowledge? New bill says yes.

A state senator would have 90 days after taking office to tackle LB 1066’s 20 questions on civics and U.S. history, which could be the same as those administered to individuals hoping to become naturalized American citizens. 
I hate to pick nits, but the timing seems a little strange. Some voters might want to see test results before an election rather than after. Just saying.
While knowledge of civics and U.S. history are important, for my money an effective senator provides leadership despite the room’s temperature and the political pressure gauge’s reading; has a penchant for thinking critically lest unintended consequences derail what seemed like a good idea at the time; displays a willingness to use proven science rather than political expediency in writing laws; and rocks an attitude of collegiality without being a doormat, carrying someone else’s water or hiding in the smallness of ad hominem attacks. 
Otherwise special sessions get called to undo a safe haven law, an abundance of medical research, and experience gets ignored for political purposes. Name-calling passes for argument and wisdom.
Communism and more
The Legislature also will be thinking about communism this session or, more to the point, a duplication of communism. Senators will be debating LB 1024, which would require Nebraska public schools to add teaching the dangers of communism to school curricula, although it’s already part of the state’s social studies standards.
New bill would require Nebraska K-12 schools to teach anti-communist lessons

Aside from the duplicative nature of LB 1024, a reading of its seven pages reveals at best a set of curricular guidelines and at worst a class syllabus, neither of which seem to be in the Legislature’s charge, let alone its wheelhouse. Plus, nowhere in the introduced legislation is definitive evidence of “the increasing threat of communism in the United States …,” the basis on which LB 1024 is being proposed. 
Research shows some young Americans have looked at ideas more aligned with democratic socialism than communism, but it, too, is already covered in the state standards. Some might remember when we liked Ike, swiveled hula hoops around our waists, hard passed on the Edsel and at least a few people checked under their beds for commies. 
Aside from LB 1024’s communist focus providing a twinkle of the past, it might also provide a good civics test question: Who said and to whom and why, “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”
Voting knowledge
Finally, even though state senators would already be in office when they saddled up for a LB 1066 civics exam, the value of a knowledgeable class of political leaders extends well beyond the Nebraska Capitol and into the voting booth. 
Political and social scientists call those poorly informed who cast ballots, “low-information voters.” No term that I know of captures the phenomenon for those already in office and writing laws.
Finally, if LB 1066 passes, senators airing their “academic” laundry on the Legislature’s website deserve props. Never mind that Nebraskans would know the senators’ scores. Each of us has our own responsibility to be fully and factually informed, making good on that whole watchfulness in the citizen idea. 
It is indeed our salvation. Which also just might make another good question.

(Sarah Ladd/ Kentucky Lantern)An Oldham County mother has filed a lawsuit against Kentucky child welfare officials, alleging they violated state open records law by failing to provide records related to child deaths and serious injuries from neglect and abuse.
Jennifer Mortenson, who has 12 children, six of whom are adopted, said she is seeking the records to determine whether there are gaps in Kentucky’s system when it comes to protecting children.
While the Cabinet for Health and Family Services has provided thousands of pages of the records, it hasn’t fully complied with her request, has missed deadlines set by state law, provided incomplete files and has heavily redacted the material, according to the lawsuit filed Dec. 23 in Franklin Circuit Court.
“I’m not trying to make things difficult but open records are what they are,” Mortenson, a longtime child advocate, said in an interview. “You’re legally entitled to them.”
A Health and Family Services spokeswoman responded that the cabinet is complying with Mortenson’s request and continues to do so on a “rolling basis” as it reviews case files for release and redacts some information for privacy reasons.
“Following its commitment to transparency, the cabinet has provided extensive records in response to the open records request and has continually informed the requester of its ongoing review of records and the time needed to complete the review,” spokeswoman Beth Fisher said in an email. “At this time the cabinet has provided about 8,800 pages of records with necessary redactions and is reviewing between 12,000 and 14,000 additional records.”
As for potential gaps in child protection, Fisher said the cabinet’s “top priority is the health and safety of the Kentuckians we serve — especially children — and we remain committed to doing that work transparently and in accordance with our state laws.”
Access to some child protection records have been well-established by the courts in recent years.
In 2016, after a seven-year legal battle with the Louisville Courier Journal and the Lexington Herald-Leader, the state conceded that files it keeps of child deaths and near fatal-injuries are public records. The cabinet settled the legal battle by agreeing to pay the newspapers nearly $700,000 in penalties and legal costs.
The Todd County Standard, in a separate case, also won the right to obtain records related to the 2011 death of a child in that county who was fatally beaten after the cabinet placed her in an adoptive home.
The records of the case involving Amy Dye, 9, of Todd County, were particularly damaging. It became a symbol of systemic failures after records the state released showed state social service officials had disregarded repeated abuse allegations from teachers at her school.
No longer confidential
The cabinet for years had argued all such records were confidential but eventually agreed to abide by court rulings that found that cases in which a child dies or nearly dies from suspected abuse or neglect are subject to open records law.
There have been about 200 or more such cases per year in Kentucky over the past several years.
An outside panel that reviews all child deaths or severe injuries from suspected abuse or neglect reported in its most recent annual report that it examined 70 child deaths and 149 near-deaths in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2023. It reviewed 68 deaths and 134 near deaths of children the previous year.
Mortenson said she wants more details about how the cabinet identifies and investigates such cases.
Mortenson said she and her husband, Matthew, became foster-adoptive parents in 2016. (Such parents provide temporary care for children with the goal of reuniting them with their parents but are prepared to legally adopt.) She also helps operate Hope’s Closet, which provides free children’s clothing and other items for foster, adoptive and kinship families.
She serves on the cabinet’s Trusted Advisors Council, a panel of individuals who have been involved with the foster adoptive system that recommend changes and identify areas of concern.
Mortenson said she first began requesting records in September 2025 of all child deaths and near-deaths from abuse or neglect for 2024 and the first eight months of 2025 but doesn’t believe the cabinet is fully complying.
Mortenson’s lawsuit has been assigned to Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd, whose previous rulings upheld public access to such records in the cases brought by the newspapers starting in 2009.
Mortenson also has filed a complaint with the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services outlining her concerns.
‘Plan of safe care’
Mortenson said she has become increasingly concerned about several areas where she sees gaps in protection for children and hopes to use the information to encourage lawmakers to strengthen laws.
One such area is how state social services staff oversee cases of newborns exposed to substances such as drugs or alcohol including those born with neonatal abstinence syndrome — in withdrawal from drugs, usually opioids, but often more than one substance.
Federal law requires state child welfare workers to create what’s known as a “Plan of Safe Care” for such newborns, meant to ensure the health and safety of the baby and support parents and caregivers.
Yet an outside panel that reviews child abuse deaths and near fatalities in Kentucky last year found in more than a third of the cases it reviewed of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, no record of such a plan could be found. The Child Fatality and Near Fatality External Review Panel concluded that was likely an “underestimate” of newborns without such plans.
Even as cases of infants born exposed to substances or in withdrawal have risen steadily in recent years, its report found the safety plan “is rarely available to most Kentucky families who are in dire need.” Such infants are at greater risk for health problems as well as abuse and neglect, the report said.
The panel noted that last year was the second year in a row it has recommended improving the system to provide such safety plans for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, noting that they are at risk of health problems as well as injury and death from abuse and neglect.
“Year after year, the panel has documented that these children are at serious risk of maltreatment,” the report said.
A state health office that tracks such births found a slight decrease in 2024 in the number of infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome.
In 2024, there were 741 cases of babies with signs and symptoms of the syndrome versus 792 cases reported in 2023, according to the Kentucky Public Health Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Reporting Registry 2025 annual report.
Among its recommendations: “Every infant, including those prenatally exposed to drugs or alcohol, should leave the hospital with an appropriate plan of safe care.”
But Mortenson said she doesn’t believe that’s happening, based on records she has collected and reviewed so far.
Her complaint to the federal health agency states that she believes safety plans are only documented in “a small percentage of cases” of newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Her complaint said that appears to result from failure of a health provider to diagnose and report the condition to child welfare authorities as well as the failure of Kentucky Child Protective Services (CPS) to investigate and follow up on all such cases brought to its attention.
Cases ‘screened out?’
Mortenson also said she’s concerned that in many cases of child abuse and neglect, perpetrators are not prosecuted. She’s also concerned that Child Protective Services “screens out” too many reports of suspected abuse or neglect as not meriting an investigation, a concern also highlighted by the outside panel in its most recent report.
“Screening out of CPS referrals has been a concern addressed by the panel for many years and continues to be the most frequently identified area of concern,” its report said.
The cabinet, which investigates and decides whether to substantiate suspected abuse or neglect of children, says that while reports of suspected abuse have risen over the past several years, substantiations have “steadily decreased” over the past five years.
In 2024, 127,342 suspected cases were reported while 43,668 were accepted for investigation — the rest screened out. Of those, 8,196 cases of abuse or neglect were substantiated, according to an annual report by the cabinet.
Mortenson said she believes cases may be falling through the cracks of a chronically overworked and understaffed child welfare system.
Mortenson is not a lawyer but is representing herself in her open records lawsuit. She also plans to contact state legislators and enlist their support.
“My goal is to help identify the gaps and push legislation that will help protect children,” she said. “If I can help create the rules, maybe we can save some lives.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3810-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 00:56:59.235826

In 1975, a utility company needed a small legal favor, so they wrote a draft opinion and slipped it to him.
The late Justice Joseph Boyd Jr., via Florida Supreme Court
That is not, as I’m sure you are aware, normal.
Boyd said he did nothing improper: Indeed, he said, he promptly hopped to the gents’, tore the thing up, and flushed it.
This sounded sufficiently odd to the Florida Legislature that they threatened to impeach him, only backing down when he agreed to a psychiatric exam.
He convinced the doctor he was not, in fact, as nutty as a fruitcake.
These days, you wouldn’t be blamed for thinking psychiatric exams might be in order for some in Florida’s political and legal establishment.
Or, even better, a moral compass: Many of the judges appointed over the last seven or eight years seem to have misplaced theirs.
Florida has just acquired a new Supreme Court justice, appointed by the governor.
There is no suggestion, however, he’s mentally ill. As for a moral compass, well, that remains to be seen.
Justice Charles Canady recently vacated the bench to parachute into a sweet gig directing the University of Florida’s new Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education.
White males
There were six Federalist Society candidates on the governor’s shortlist, raring to take Canady’s place: all male, all white.
One hopeful used to work for Liberty Counsel, an outfit that advocates for laws adhering to “Christian and biblical” principles.
One was on the First District Court of Appeals, where he ruled to dilute Black voting power by abolishing a North Florida congressional district.
One had an unremarkable practice in civil litigation; another wasn’t known for having a significant impact on the legal profession, but did gain some notoriety with distinctly un-clever X quips accusing late night hosts Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon of having “Low T” and snickering like a third-grader at a “gross” picture of President Joe Biden kissing his wife, to which he added a cartoon of skeletal elderly folks having sex.
This is what passes for “judicial temperament” in Ron DeSantis’ Florida.
And how about this fellow John Guard, formerly Florida’s chief deputy attorney general?
He defended the state against Planned Parenthood and other Jezebels who think women should have control over their own bodies.
Donald Trump had planned to nominate Guard for a federal judgeship, but put that on “indefinite” hold after Guard was subpoenaed in connection with the Hope Florida investigation.
In case you’ve forgotten, Hope Florida is a program spearheaded by Casey DeSantis to bypass Big Gubmint nonsense like healthcare for children, housing assistance, and SNAP benefits, hooking up the Deserving Poor with churches and charities.
In 2024, Hope Florida was mysteriously given a nice hunk of cash from the $67 million settlement in a Medicaid over-billing case.
It should all have been returned to the taxpayers, but somehow Hope Florida got $10 million off the top.
Gingrich acolyte
The money went to a couple of PACs working against the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana.
One of the PACs was controlled by James Uthmeier, then the governor’s chief of staff, now Florida’s attorney general and former boss of John Guard.
To many in the Legislature, that looked like money laundering.
The House of Representatives investigated; now the whole mess has been given to a grand jury to see if anybody needs indicting.
You will not be surprised to hear, given the circumstances, DeSantis didn’t choose Guard for the state Supreme Court.
You might be surprised to hear Guard got a nice consolation prize: an appointment to the Florida Second District Court of Appeal.
Adam Tanenbaum, via Florida Supreme Court
But the winner of the Supreme Court stakes is Adam Tanenbaum, a very conservative judge with a very impressive resumé: top of his class at UF, former intern for Newt Gingrich, stellar student at Georgetown, law professor, lots of experience working in the Legislature, and, most recently, First DCA judge.
Tanenbaum joins a court comprising three Latino men, one Black woman, and two white women. Canady was the lone white fellow.
So, Tanenbaum adds what DeSantis no doubt thinks is appropriate “diversity” to the court.
As the president reminds us, white people, especially white men, white people, especially men, have been “very badly treated” in America.
But with the new justice, the court can be proud of its ethnic diversity.
Its ideological diversity, however, is pretty much non-existent.
Six of the seven justices are DeSantis picks.
Six of the seven can be relied upon to rule the way DeSantis would like.
Sole dissent
In 2025, the court upheld the state’s six-week abortion ban and gutted Florida’s Fair Districts amendment.
Never mind that 63% of Florida voters approved the 2010 ballot measure to stop partisan gerrymandering and protect minority voting rights.
This court blew it off: How dare ordinary citizens choose to enshrine fairness in the Florida Constitution? What do they know?
For that matter, what does the American Bar Association, the 147-year-old group of legal professionals dedicated to upholding ethics and standards and promoting equal justice, know?
The court has now dumped the ABA as the state’s exclusive law school accrediting body, saying, “The Court is persuaded that it is not in Floridians’ best interest for the ABA to be the sole gatekeeper deciding which law schools’ graduates are eligible to sit for the state’s General Bar Examination and become licensed attorneys in Florida.”
Ron DeSantis loathes the ABA, calling it “a very, very partisan activist organization” because it promotes racial and ethnic diversity in law schools.
(See discrimination against white men above).
This would be the same radical Democratic Party ABA apparatchiks who gave U.S. Supreme Court justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito their highest rating of “Well Qualified.”
As of right now, there isn’t really an alternative to the ABA.
Perhaps the Association for Biblical Higher Education can step up until the Federalist Society can create its own Law School Inquisition.
Who needs an independent judiciary? So 20th century.
The (sort of) good news is retrograde decisions weren’t unanimous: one justice, Jorge Labarga, appointed by Gov. Charlie Crist, cast a dissenting vote in each case.
Channeling slaveholders
The bad news is Labarga only has another 18 months on the bench: When he turns 75 in 2027, he’ll have to retire.
Tanenbaum’s record indicates he’s unlikely to join the court’s last moderate in voting against the majority.
When he was an appeals court judge, he ruled in favor of eliminating minority-access voting districts and penalizing school districts for enforcing mask mandates during the COVID pandemic.
He’s an out-and-proud “originalist,” one of those people who confuse the United States Constitution with holy writ — a trait he shares with six members of the U.S. Supreme Court — a sacred text that can only mean what it meant in 1789, law as set in stone as the Code of Hammurabi.
In 1789, women couldn’t vote and almost all Black people resident in the 13 states were enslaved.
Indeed, 25 of 55 Framers were slaveholders.
Unless these 18th century landed gentlemen had the prophetic talents of Nostradamus, a magic mirror, and time travel technology, they could have no idea what America would be like in the 21st century.
Yet the likes of Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Adam Tanenbaum insist they hold the key to what the Framers intended and/or what everyone understood to the Constitution to mean at the time.
Originalism is, as the prominent legal scholar Eric Segall says, “dangerous nonsense.”
It’s intellectually dishonest, too: Surely, “well-regulated militia” in 1789 meant a trained group of citizens who could protect the community against some tyrannical force, not (as the conservative court would have us believe) a nation of armed individuals empowered to shoot anyone who “threatens” them.
Stare decisis
As for stare decisis, the principle that courts should give a certain deference to precedents, it’s not popular with Federalist Society types.
Justice Tanenbaum has dismissed stare decisis as an excuse for what he sees as incorrectly decided cases.
Many of those supposedly bad decisions constitute “legislating from the bench,” which is nothing more than “judicial activism.”
(The overturning of Roe v. Wade and giving the president unlimited immunity — that’s not “judicial activism;” it’s just the intuited wisdom of 237 years ago).
The language of the Constitution should be paramount. If the judge will simply do what it says, no one can say they’re legislating from the bench.
Tanenbaum has written: “elevating the text of the Constitution over prior erroneous judicial reasoning could not fairly be labeled as ‘judicial activism.’”
You might want to ask how he’s so sure he knows what reasoning is “erroneous.”
You might also wonder if this is merely a convenient way to dismiss previously settled law because it offends the judge’s politics.
The United States Supreme Court will soon issue a decision on the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the core of civil rights in our democracy. Chances are better than even they’ll eviscerate it.
Ron DeSantis is counting on it. That’s why he’s demanding a special session in April.
He wants the Legislature to draw new congressional maps — maps to finally finish off most districts that might elect a Black or Latino or, God forbid, Democratic representative.
If the new map gets through the Legislature, it will undoubtedly end up before the Florida Supreme Court — and the governor’s hand-picked justices are waiting.

FRANKFORT — Brittany Herrington missed her son’s first time catching the flu, his first time riding a bike, his bout with chickenpox and the way his toddler “fat face” came in because she was incarcerated. 
Herrington had asked to be court-ordered to a residential treatment program but was denied. Outpatient treatment, too difficult to reach from her rural Kentucky home, was not fully effective for her. 
Without that rigorous, inpatient care that she sought, Herrington didn’t know how to get sober, which she desperately wanted so she could show up for her child. 
The Eastern Kentucky woman, now 41 and a mom of two, finally got access to effective treatment, but said “it came years too late.” 
Once in a residential program, she wrote little Gavin letters — “Mommy loves you more than pepperoni pizza,” one said — and drew small pictures to mail him. 
“He knew that I was fun and I loved him enough to draw pictures, and I wasn’t a stranger,” she said. “I was really scared he’d forget me.” 
Herrington is now advocating for a bill introduced by Kentucky lawmakers this week and backed by a slew of advocacy organizations that could change the incarceration landscape for Kentucky parents by considering alternatives to detention. 
The Family Preservation Act 
Rep. Nick Wilson, R-Williamsburg, said his goal is keeping more families together, teaching parents how to parent and reducing child trauma through the state. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Filed as House Bill 464, the Family Preservation and Accountability Act would allow judges to consider an alternative sentence for parents charged with low-level, nonviolent crimes to keep families together. Violent crimes, including child abuse, are banned for consideration. Alternatives to detention as outlined in the bill may include parenting classes, substance use treatment, family counseling and more. It has not yet been assigned to a committee. 
Rep. Nick Wilson, R-Williamsburg, the bill’s sponsor, said his goal is keeping more families together, teaching parents how to parent and reducing child trauma through the state. 










Kentucky kids should not serve their parents’ sentences


– Amber Duke, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky


Having a parent incarcerated is an adverse childhood experience that can negatively impact a person’s life over the long term. About 12% of Kentucky children have or previously had a parent incarcerated, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky. That’s about 150,000 children across 120 counties. 
“I’m a kid of the ’90s, and I remember in Little League baseball, and around that age, basically everybody who got a backache was getting prescribed an OxyContin,” Wilson said. “I think we are still seeing the detrimental effects of what happened for that 10, 15, 20-year period of time.” 
One of those key impacts, Wilson said, “has been the deterioration of the family union.”

Even though overdose deaths have declined over the last three years, Kentucky still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder in the United States, costing the state about $95 billion, with an average cost per case of $709,441 across all systems, the Lantern has reported. 
Sen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, plans to file the bill in the Senate. She said Wilson’s measure is “practical, responsible and important.” 
“These situations (low-level, nonviolent crimes) still demand accountability, but they also allow parents to remain connected to their children when it is safe to do so,” she said. “This approach is fiscally responsible. It costs so much less than incarceration. It reduces repeat offenses, and, most importantly, it produces better outcomes for our kids.”

Kentucky incarcerates women at one of the highest rates in the world, according to the ACLU, and the state reports the second highest rate in the nation for children who have parents behind bars. 
Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky, said this is hurting family stability. 
“Kentucky kids should not serve their parents’ sentences,” Duke said. “Accountability is something that is important. Accountability is not something that should destroy families. It should not come at the expense of our children’s well being, and kids should not be punished for their parents’ mistakes.” 
Wilson said he believes there is substantial legislative support for this bill: “I think everyone’s in favor of this bill,” he said.  
“This bill does not excuse wrongdoing. It does not weaken public safety, and in fact, it improves it,” Raque Adams said. “We know that stable families are one of the strongest foundations for a healthy society.” 
‘I did the best I could’
Brittany Herrington holds a photo of her visit with Gavin in jail back in 2010. Jan. 22, 2026. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Herrington, of Argillite, developed an addiction to OxyContin as a teenager. 
“During my years in high school … that’s what you did. You went and you did Lortabs together,” she told the Lantern. “The cheerleaders, the band kids, the average Joes. We all just got high. In high school it was Lortabs, Xanaxes and Valium, but it quickly moved to OxyContin.” 
Gavin was 2 years old when she had her first felony arrest in 2009 for drug possession, wanton endangerment, receiving stolen property and other related charges. 
Herrington said she asked the judge to send her to residential treatment. She knew she couldn’t afford rehabilitation on her own. 
Instead, the judge sent her to an outpatient program 25 miles from her home. With only one car between her, her husband, her parents and brother, getting to treatment four days a week was “an impossible task.” 
“I was court ordered to a treatment center I couldn’t really even get to,” she said. “I did the best I could for as long as I could, to make it there four days a week, and I just couldn’t.” 
She only lasted a few months.

In March 2010, a failed drug test sent her back to jail. She asked for rehab again, she said. She was denied and spent the next nine months — out of a three-year sentence — incarcerated. 
During that time, she saw her son once. During his visit, she borrowed clothes from a fellow inmate so she could be in “street clothes” to see him. 
“He was just different,” she recalled. “His face was different, his body. I picked him up, and he weighed, like, a million pounds. He was a different kid. He was in a different growth stage.” 
She thinks he only changed in weight 12-15 pounds, but his “fat face” had come in, and he looked different. She’d missed a lot, she realized.  
“You feel like an a**hole,” she said. “You can’t function because you feel worthless. You feel not worthy of anything. You’ve left your son. Your choices have separated you, you just feel like a crappy, crappy human. The worst. You just feel despicable, like, who does that?” 
But, for so long, addiction controlled her, she said. 
“I hated getting high,” she recalled. “Oh, I hated it.” She hated the sickness that came after, the feeling of no control. 
Herrington was paroled that December and went to the Women’s Addiction Recovery Manor, an inpatient recovery center in Henderson. There, she took parenting classes and started a journey of long-term recovery and advocacy. The experience was “overwhelming,” though. 
“Anytime I talked about leaving, I was scared to death,” she said. “Like, ‘oh my God. I was so serious about staying sober before, and I didn’t do it … What if I can’t?’” 
But, she said, while there: “Every day, I got to watch women get their kids back.” 
Before long, she and her husband, John, and Gavin were settling in together under the same roof. She could be an active parent, and “we were family again.” 
She is still sober 14 years later and an active advocate for women going through experiences similar to the one she survived. 
After jail, finding her own Healing Place
Jessica Ashby, 41, was prescribed Oxycodone after the birth of her daughter, a treatment for standard pain that “unleashed a monster” of addiction in her life.

“When I took home that prescription, I didn’t know that they were highly addictive,” Ashby said. “I thought it was going to be OK. It was from my doctor. Why would he give me something that is going to turn around and make me sick later?” 
She spent three years “doing anything and everything I could to support that habit,” she told the Lantern. She was arrested on a theft charge in 2014 and spent 17 months in and out of jail. 
She said she lacked access to treatment and resources that could have helped her begin to get sober. She lost her job and custody of her daughter. 
“I just couldn’t get clean,” she said. “Most people don’t really commit felonies unless there’s … an underlying issue.” She wanted help, though, and finally got it. 
In 2019, Ashby drove herself to The Healing Place in Louisville, where she still attends — and teaches — classes. 
“I finally started to feel like I was in a community. I was in a community with people like me,” she said. “They help people write resumes. They did all of those things that were critical in early sobriety.” 
She’s been sober about seven years thanks to The Healing Place, support she received from her 12-step program and other organizations geared toward early stages of sobriety. She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in December and has begun work toward a master’s degree. 
Ashby just bought her first house in Louisville.
If something like the Family Preservation and Accountability Act that Wilson is proposing had been in place when she was first arrested, Ashby believes she and her daughter “would still be together.” 
“I completely understand that … people like me, if we had committed the crime, I understand that we still have to be punished,” she said. “I understand that wholeheartedly, but our kids are the one that’s being punished, so we have to find a way to deal with the crime while addressing whatever’s going on in that parent’s life. And I think that this bill does that.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The Gen Z gender divide in politics,Rosemary Bonadies,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/the-gen-z-gender-divide-in-politics/,"I fear as Gen Z becomes older, there will be less social cohesion and greater risks to democratic consensus.","In recent years, young men and women in Generation Z have moved in opposite political directions, producing a gender gap unlike any other generation before. Young men have increasingly leaned towards the conservative, Republican party while women have moved towards the liberal, Democratic party. While gender gaps are a feature in every generation, none have been as stark as Gen Z. 
Who is the main driver? Women. They are now the force pushing Gen Z towards the left politically and socially, and becoming increasingly more civically active compared to any other generation. There are divides not just about how they feel about political candidates, but cultural issues which could deeply affect America.



Generation Z, which I am a part of, is the cohort born between 1997 and 2012. My generation has been shaped by rapid technology growth, social media, witnessing financial crises, wars, and climate change. 
Contrary to the conventional wisdom that young voters support progressive candidates and policies, in the most recent presidential election, men between the ages of 18 and 29 showed immense support for the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. However, women have become a cohesive force for the Democratic party, with about 65 percent voting for Biden in 2020 and Harris in 2024. 
This gender divide is complex, rooted in differences in politics and social issues. In terms of politics, only 26 percent of Gen Z women approve of the job that Donald Trump is doing in office compared to 47 percent of Gen Z men. On the question of abortion, 76 percent of women believe that abortion should be legal, whereas 59 percent of men believe it should be legal.

Women’s activism is now amplified by the fact that we make up around sixty percent of college students, contributing to the trend that higher educated individuals tend to be liberal. With greater access to higher education and economic opportunity, women are now more empowered to play a larger role in political activism and voting, while men have fallen behind women in civic engagement. 
Alongside this increase in engagement, there is the fact that women’s rights are being increasingly threatened under the Trump administration. After movements like #MeToo and the fall of Roe v. Wade, many women feel a sense of urgency and personal investment, whereas Gen Z men don’t have the same sentiment. Moreover, this reflects both differences in priorities and experiences. 
Many men feel that their rights and lifestyle are being infringed upon so they seek validation from communities online. The feeling of losing influence in many aspects of society has led them to turn to misogynistic social media influencers like Charlie Kirk, Andrew Tate, or Adin Ross who have created a mass following. They have become pillars of hypermasculinity and misogyny by promoting hate and violence against women. 
Additionally, these influencers have become prominent recruiters for the right wing Republican party by framing politicians like Trump as an empowering figure who will restore male power. With social media algorithms and echo chambers, podcasters, YouTubers and other online influencers, can easily engage young men and boys – some as young as middle school – to promote conservatism rooted in male dominance, and a community of men who have common ground.
Algorithms turn everyday interests like fitness, relationships, and gaming into gateways to the manosphere. They thrive on male loneliness and insecurity about themselves and the world around them and move the blame to women.
These political shifts also go beyond just political candidates, they have put a strain on romantic and platonic relationships, as women and men are no longer spending time together, rather they are spending time in their separate echo chambers – creating their own sense of reality on social media. As young men are holding onto the belief in more traditional gender roles and family structures, Gen Z women are valuing independence, their careers, and progressive reform.
As a member of Gen Z, I have experienced this divide. I and many other women my age have become concerned with issues like abortion, the environment, gun laws, and equality while many of our male counterparts don’t feel the same or prioritize other issues. 
Why is this important? Who does it affect? It is important because this signals deepening polarization that has shown to put a strain on relationships. As Gen Z becomes older, there will be less social cohesion and greater risks to democratic consensus. With the effects of social media algorithms and echo chambers, there will be irreversible polarization and instability. 
Polarization has effects on housing, jobs, welfare, social relationships, mental health, and families.
What can we do? In short, educate. 
As Gen Z, we can develop our media literacy and learn to combat misinformation. Introduce media literacy in school curriculum; parents can educate their children on media influence – young boys about misogynistic language and media, and young girls about self confidence. We can foster better empathy and understanding for personal gender struggles including women’s underrepresentation and hardships and men’s mental health struggles. Men with large platforms must promote equality, emotional intelligence, and mental health resources. We can focus on common struggles that we have experienced like economic opportunities, housing, and anxieties about the future.
Understanding the causes and consequences of this political and social split helps us navigate the lasting effects of social media, misinformation, the need for education, and relationships. Ultimately, Gen Z’s historic gender divide is not a myth, but a tangible reality shown in activism, ideologies, and voting across the country. 
As a generation, we can work towards a better cohesive force that focuses on growth and positive change.

Wes Moore (D) said he and federal officials agree on the importance of moving forward with the rebuild of the Francis Scott Key Bridge as well as a potential new American Legion Bridge. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Even before this month’s meeting between Gov. Wes Moore and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy jump-started talk of public-private funding to replace the American Legion Bridge, federal officials were already moving in that direction.
In a Federal Register post Dec. 11, the Federal Highway Administration solicited “public input and proposals on innovative project delivery methods to ensure cost-effective and efficient reconstruction of the American Legion Memorial Bridge.” The post noted that the state cannot fund the project on its own, before noting that a public-private partnership (P3) could do the trick.
Just over a month later, Moore and Duffy announced they had agreed on “the need to speed up the reconstruction and leverage innovative approaches like a public private partnership (P3) that will ensure Maryland, Virginia, and D.C. commuters can soon experience some much needed traffic relief from the most congested corridor in America.”
It was a change of course for Moore who inherited the framework of a P3 deal from his predecessor, Gov. Larry Hogan (R), for the American Legion Bridge and additional toll lanes on the Capital Beltway. But the state and Transurban, the company behind the proposed P3, were not able to finalize the deal, and P3 funding fell by the wayside.
In a meeting with reporters Jan. 16, Moore said he was never “against P3s. I’m against dumb P3s.”
“And I think we had dumb P3s that were put in place before,” Moore said. “I’m for P3s. Yes, there is going to be private-sector involvement, but the entire upside can’t be on the private sector while the public sector gets hooked.
State reopens door to private funding for American Legion Bridge reconstruction

“And so, we’re just going to make sure that we’re thinking smartly about ways we’re going to apply the P3 into this. But I do think that P3s are necessary and required for a lot of the major projects that we want to get done in Maryland,” he said.
The meeting with Duffy also touched on replacement of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
In the days after the bridge was struck by a loaded container ship and collapsed into the Patapsco River in March 2024, then-President Joe Biden pledged that the federal government would fund 100% of its replacement. Congress put that pledge into law in late 2024, a legal promise that Maryland lawmakers have repeatedly cited when President Donald Trump makes threats about federal funding for the project.
But in the days after the collapse, state officials also said it would cost just under $2 billion for the bridge replacement, which could be done as early as 2028. The latest estimates say the project could cost up to $5.2 billion and take until 2030, opening the door to new criticism from the Trump administration.
Duffy and Trump have also been critical of the use of contractors based on race or sex. Moore this month dismissed those complaints, saying increases in the estimated cost of the bridge replacement had nothing to do with choice of contractors and everything to do with required changes to the bridge design for safety reason, additional materials to go with those changes and higher costs of those materials as a result of tariffs and inflation.
State officials have long said that they will put any money they win in lawsuits against the owners of the Dali, the ship that struck the bridge, toward the bottom line on the project. In the joint statement after their meeting, Moore and Duffy said they “made significant progress on cost sharing … to ensure fairness” on the Key Bridge.
But that wording left some, like Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) confused.
Ferguson called the joint announcement “very promising” and said he was “looking forward to hearing the details” of the meeting. But he seemed surprised when asked about the possibility of “cost sharing” mentioned in the Moore-Duffy statement.
“I have to look more into that,” Ferguson said. “My understanding is that cost sharing is not a component of it. It’s 100% covered. So, I have to get back to you on that.”

“The good news is that the repaying, or the payment for the rebuild of the Francis Scott Key Bridge is in federal law. It’s in statute,” Ferguson said. “It is not through executive order or regulation that can be waived by the stroke of a pen and would require an act of Congress to restrict that funding.
“Should we be wary? I think we have to be. I think every assumption of what we thought or we could assume about the relationship between the state and the federal government is now up for question.”
Moore did not elaborate on the discussions regarding federal funding for the Key Bridge replacement.
“I think our teams are working very closely, and we are ensuring that in this time, we are going to be able to do something that’s not just going to make the people of the state of Maryland proud, but we’re going to do something to make the people this country proud,” Moore told reporters a day after meeting with Duffy.
It’s also not clear how the American Legion Bridge Project will progress. It is also unclear what role, if any, the Virginia Department of Transportation will have in a new American Legion Bridge.
Moore, in statements following the meeting with Duffy, described the American Legion Bridge project as “stalled.”
“We want to get this done quickly. And the thing that we both acknowledge is that when I first came on board, what we inherited were just stalled projects. Right?” Moore said. “The Purple Line was a stalled project, the ALB [American Legion Bridge] was a stalled project. And I told the secretary, and I think, you know, he agreed, we’re going to work together, because I refuse to hand off stalled projects to my successors.”
Doug Mayer, a spokesperson for Hogan, rejected Moore’s characterization of the American Legion Bridge project as stalled when he came into office. Mayer said Moore is “not misrepresenting the truth. He’s lying.”
Hogan had announced a plan to widen the bridge along with Maryland sections of Interstate 495 before Moore took office under a P3 agreement with a consortium led by Australia-based Transurban. The Transurban-led consortium was to expand the bridge and highway using managed toll lanes.
Mayer said the Hogan administration left the project “on the 99-yard line.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“He inherited a project that the former administration had spent years fighting for and had finally gotten to a place where all it needed was to go in front of the Board of Public Works,” Mayer said. “He (Moore) said he was going to pause it and get more feedback and for silly things like equity and the rest of that nonsense. What’s been going on for the last three years?”
Critics at the time complained that the proposal would benefit wealthy motorists and harm the environment. The project was similar to one Transurban constructed in Virginia.
Moore, responding to a question from a reporter, called the project a shared interest of both states and one that both states should share responsibility.
“I think for a lot of things that were done before, there was not a mutually shared both interest, ambition or incentive to be able to get the work done,” Moore said. “I will be working very closely with our friends in the Commonwealth of Virginia to make sure that the p3 that is done, that Maryland actually has a proper seat at the table when we’re looking at what those proper and those final dynamics look like.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260116MoorePC-1024x681.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

Moore’s new federal lobbyist 
Alexis Covey-Brandt has taken over as the state’s new federal lobbyist.
Covey-Brandt took over Tuesday after Matt Verghese abruptly left his position.
“Over the past three years, Matt Verghese has played a pivotal role leading our state’s federal engagements during a volatile political climate in Washington,” the governor’s office said in a statement sent in reply to a reporter’s inquiry. “The Governor’s Office is grateful for Matt’s service in the Administration, and we wish him well as he transitions from his role.”
Verghese’s departure was effective immediately.
Covey-Brandt served as chief of staff to Rep. Steny Hoyer, a position she held for more than a decade. She left the post to become a senior adviser to Moore in June 2023.
Another race, another Democrat
After being passed over when the Democratic central committees in a three-county area chose Kevin Harris to fill the vacant District 27 Senate seat in November, Jason Fowler has decided to take his case to the voters.
Fowler filed the paperwork Friday to run for the Senate seat that includes parts of Charles, Calvert and Prince George’s counties.
Fowler, 37, who ran unsuccessfully for the District 27C House seat in Calvert County in 2018, said he “just can’t sit on the sidelines” as his district and the state experience “an affordability crisis.”
District 27 candidate Jason Fowler
“Too many people have been priced out of our state. We’re a high-taxed state with some of the most expensive housing, energy costs, grocery prices in the country,” Fowler, an attorney from Calvert County, said in a recent interview. “One of the main problems that we see in Annapolis, there is not vigorous debate over policy. It’s people just voting on bills without either reading them or thinking about the long-term effects of these policies.”
Fowler would have to unseat Harris, who was chosen overwhelmingly by the  Democratic central committees in the three counties represented by District 27, and later appointed by Gov. Wes Moore (D). Harris replaced Democrat Michael Jackson, a former Prince George’s County sheriff who left the Senate on Nov. 11 to become the Maryland State Police superintendent.
Fowler and Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. (D-Prince George’s and Calvert) were the two other candidates who sought the appointment to replace Jackson.
Trone staffs up
Turns out David Trone doesn’t just want his old job back — he wants his old staff back, too.
Trone, the former 6th District representative who lost his seat in an unsuccessful, and costly, bid for U.S. Senate in 2024, announced in December that he is running for his old job in the House. To do so, he will have to unseat Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th), who has no intention of giving up the seat, in a Democratic primary.
Trone last week announced a campaign staff that is heavy with staff from his time on Capitol Hill, including three who are coming over from McClain Delaney’s office.
Campaign manager Sonny Holding was McClain Delaney’s chief of staff, had been Trone’s deputy chief of staff and was district director to former Rep. John Delaney — McClain Delaney’s husband, who held the seat before Trone. Former Trone director of outreach Sarah Dreyer, who served until last month as McClain Delaney’s district director, will be deputy campaign manager. Sasha Galbreath, a former communications director for Trone who served in that role for McClain Delaney until October, will be senior strategic adviser to the campaign.
Trone also said that his former director of operations, Tyler Jessee, will come over from Rep. Johnny Olszewski’s (D-2nd) office to be another deputy campaign manager and Nathaniel McCarthy, who “worked for Congressman Trone since 2017 in various roles,” will be communications director and chief of staff.
Trone has already turned the race into a referendum on Trump and is already peppering the airwaves with ads touting his two impeachment votes against Trump in the president’s first term. McClain Delaney has responded with a video saying she has regularly taken on Trump over policies that harm the district and touting endorsements from virtually every top Democrat in the state.
It is also likely to be an expensive race: Trone, the millionaire owner of Total Wine & More, loaned himself almost $63 million for his unsuccessful Senate bid against Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and has already loaned $5 million to his latest campaign, according to a year-end report with the Federal Election Commission. McClain Delaney’s year-end report has not been posted yet by the FEC.

Wes Moore (D) meets at the state's Emergency Operations Center Sunday with Maryland National Guard troops called up for the weekend's snowstorm. (Photo by Joe Andrucyk/Governor's office)Maryland was one of 10 states declared disaster areas by President Donald Trump over the weekend as a result of the winter storm that stretched from the Southwest to the Northeast.
The declaration means that assistance is available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency as the state responds to the storm, with impacts beginning Saturday .”Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize and provide, at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency,” the agency said in a statement announcing the declaration.
It comes a day after Gov. Wes Moore (D) declared a state of emergency in Maryland and asked for federal assistance responding to the storm that dumped anywhere from 6 inches to a foot of snow and ice on the state, beginning Saturday and continuing through most of the day Sunday.
State offices were closed Monday as crews continued to dig roads out from under the snow, and schools across the state were closed Monday with several already announcing Tuesday closures. Federal offices were closed and most workers granted leave Monday, but emergency workers were expected to report and telework and remote employees were expected to work their regular hours.
The General Assembly canceled House and Senate sessions Monday, but said that previously scheduled committee hearings could continue virtually.
Other states to get a disaster declaration in response to the winter storm were Virginia, West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.

The weather system has slammed much of the country. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)I am despondent about the weather. No, I’m not writing about the slaying of another person in Minneapolis.
I am despondent about the cold and snow that have locked me into my home for a long weekend. No, I’m not writing about the presence of armed federal forces on the streets of U.S. cities turning their vast firepower on protesters protecting their neighbors.
And yet, I know that as much as the cold and snow trouble me, they will pass.
I know that warmer weather will come and the snow and cold and ice will melt. Please understand I am not using any metaphor here. I am not writing about our current administration in Washington, D.C., or outrage toward American immigration enforcement policies.
I’m writing about the weather caused by a nationwide storm, one that meteorologists call unprecedented.
And the weather will change.
It can be tempting over a long weekend like this — with days of subfreezing temperatures behind you and days of subfreezing temperatures ahead — to believe otherwise. We suspect the chill will never retreat. Our fingers will always stiffen in the biting cold air outside. We will remain inside our homes wrapped in blankets and avoiding slippery roads. The world will spin as a we remain locked inside.
I’m definitely not saying that this works as a metaphor for our current political situation, when authoritarians in waiting stalk the hallways of the White House. I’m not saying it applies to vile lies spread about people including Renee Good and Alex Pretti by officials who yearn to crush political dissent and silence opposing voices.
I’m not saying either of those things. I’m dealing with the weather, and the irrational fear that bad weather will never change.
Even in the coldest temperatures, that’s not true.
The sun will come. It will shine. The snow will melt in into water and flow into drains and make its way to the river. The ice will retreat and disappear in water vapor that floats up into the atmosphere to create clouds. 
No season lasts forever. Spring will come and the air will warm and the flowers bloom and the wheel turn. The rains will come and nourish green grass and trees, and world around us will flourish once again. No one who bets on winter lasting forever will win his or her wager. 
Change always prevails.
I write this knowing that words have limits. Thoughts from one opinion editor in Kansas can only do so much, even in this interconnected age. My fulminations and broadsides — against the weather of course, not anything else going on right now — might shift attitudes a percentage point or two. At most.
On the other hand, concrete actions help. Hardy souls can plow the roads and shovel sidewalks, check on elderly friends and family, help dig cars out of snow drifts. That helps. That clears the way for the next season, whenever it inevitably arrives.
If we learn anything from the weekend, let it be this.
Change will come. Seasons will shift. Warmness will replace the chill. But we can also learn from the repetition. We can prepare ourselves for the inevitable changes. Knowing now how much cold, how much ice, how much snow can warp an entire region, we can be on watch in years to come.
For so long, many of us suggested that it can’t happen here. I refer to winter weather. Now we know better. Now we can pass that knowledge to the generations who follow.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-25 23:54:52+00:00,Mississippi Today,Two Mississippi prisons temporarily lose power amid freezing temps from winter storm,"Leonardo Bevilacqua, Jerry Mitchell and Michael Goldberg",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/25/two-mississippi-prisons-lose-power-winter-storm/,The winter storm that pushed through the state Saturday and Sunday temporarily knocked out power at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman and Delta Correctional Facility in Greenwood.,"The winter storm that pushed through the state Saturday and Sunday temporarily knocked out power at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman and Delta Correctional Facility in Greenwood, even as temperatures plunged below freezing.
This photo taken by an inmate in Unit 29 of the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman shows a fire set by another inmate down the hall from his cell at around 3 a.m. on Sunday, January 25, 2026.
“At Parchman, we had a limb fall on a line,” Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain told Mississippi Today on Sunday afternoon. “The power is coming back on.”
Entergy workers spent about three hours fixing the problem, he said.
Parchman is in rural Sunflower County near Tutwiler and has about 1,900 inmates. Delta Correctional is in Greenwood and houses about 300 women. Both are in areas that received snow and ice.
Generators were supplying power Sunday at Delta Correctional, Cain said. “The only place we’ve had a problem is at Parchman.”
“I just had a mama tell me that the inmates were banging on the wall all night, that they were cold and hungry,” Cain said. “All that’s bullshit.”
Inmates had sack lunches Sunday, Cain said, “and we should be able to cook supper. We have water and everything.”
House Corrections Committee Chairwoman Becky Currie said Sunday that she asked prison officials if they had checked generators at Parchman before the ice storm.
“They said no,” Currie said. “I’m raising hell, but it is an emergency. This is another major mistake for the Department of Corrections.”
Currie told Mississippi Today that she spoke to a staff member at Delta Correctional on Sunday afternoon who told her the generator was working but was only keeping some lights on. It was not sufficiently heating the building, the staff member told her.
“I can’t imagine being in a tin can with no heat,” Currie said. “We all plan for storms in Mississippi. That’s why there is not a loaf of bread on the shelf (in the grocery store). They are responsible for thousands of lives. There are hospice patients, dialysis patients. And they can’t make sure the generators are going to work in time of need?”
Temperatures at Parchman fell to 19 degrees Sunday.


An inmate in Parchman’s Unit 29, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said he awoke at 1 a.m. Sunday to the lights flickering on and off. He said that at 3 a.m., a fire was set down the hall from his cell. He said inmates were trying to get the attention of correctional officers after the power went out, and the temperature inside the block got “too damn cold.”
The only light visible was coming through the windows, he said. “The officers aren’t doing anything, they’re not checking to see if inmates are cold or anything.”
This photo taken by an inmate at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman shows the view out a window on Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026.
Inmates were hollering for warmer clothes after the temperature dropped, he said. A warden later announced to inmates that “nothing could be done,” he said.
Mississippi Today was able to review photos of both the inmate’s icy window and the fire that was set in his block. Dark cells and hallways can be seen in an additional photograph obtained. Parchman’s fields are blanketed with white snow in another.
At around noon Sunday, the inmate said he was given a cold breakfast. It’s unclear, he said, when the next meal could be served. Security checks that usually happen every half hour had ceased since early Sunday morning, he added. Besides breakfast at noon and a nurse making a medication drop at a nearby cell, he said no guard or other person had come by his cell Sunday.
Stephen C. McCraney, director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday he received a phone call about three to four days ago that three generators at the Delta Correctional Facility were “iffy.” He said he sent three extra generators to the prison.
Parchman is a new problem, he said. When power went out there, it became a priority, he said.
 “Sometimes things break in the middle of the night. Those customers within those facilities, they can’t go home for the weekend, they can’t go to the neighbor’s house and we realize that,” McCraney said of the prisoners in Parchman and Delta Correctional.
Mississippi Today obtained text messages from a Parchman guard, who wrote: “Most of their stuff doesn’t work. What does work is rigged up. They don’t have a maintenance team that actually knows what they are doing.
“And our heaters work well,” the guard wrote. “They just aren’t turned all the way up because we don’t want to burn them up and then be without them all together. They are set at 65 or 68 I can’t remember. So inmates probably still want a blanket to keep comfortable but they definitely are not freezing.”
At a Sunday news conference, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said he was “aware” of the prison problems. “I’m confident that we will get that back online via a generator if not already, then very soon,” Reeves said.
Facebook entries by people concerned about prison conditions alleged that Parchman inmates were suffering without heat or food. 
When someone made a joke on Facebook about inmates freezing to death, Drea LaSha responded that they are “still human beings that breathe the same air we do. They are not dead but will be in such conditions and you joke about it … Could be you.”
Terell Harris added, “These are humans and not animals, and let’s be honest, the animals get protected in these conditions. Everyone in prison don’t deserve to be there, and some are actually innocent. Either way, these are humans, and we all have family that has been to prison.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06073847/Parchman-front-gate.jpg,,,2026-01-25 18:56:39.627178

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The assault of a Florida congressman at a Sundance party is being investigated as a possible hate crime after police say a man sneaked in, made racially charged remarks, and punched the lawmaker in the face.
Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., said in a social media post that the man who assaulted him late Friday “told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face. He was heard screaming racist remarks as he drunkenly ran off.” 
In a statement, the Sundance Film Festival condemned the assault and said it abhors “any form of violence, harassment, and hate speech.”
“The safety and security of our festival attendees is always our chief concern, and our thoughts are with Congressman Frost and his continued well-being. We encourage anyone with additional information on this matter to contact the Park City Police Department,” the statement said.
According to a police affidavit, Christian Joel Young, 28, had approached Frost and a friend at a private party at High West Distillery in Park City, Utah, and began “making weird conversations and comments referring to their race.” When they went to step away, the affidavit says, Young put his arms around their necks like he was hugging them and pulled them in close, saying “we are going to deport you and your kind.”

Shocked, the two pushed Young away, who then yelled a racial slur and punched Frost in the face before running into the crowd, the affidavit says.
The affidavit says Young then approached a woman and her friend by the bar, but when the two stopped engaging with him as the conversation became “inappropriate and racially charged,” Young grabbed her shoulder, pushed her against the bar and yelled “You are the kind we are going to deport. You’re being deported.”
A man who witnessed the encounter caught Young and held him until event security arrived. Security members told police Young had been denied entry to the bar, then was seen jumping a fence set up for the private event. When security approached, he jumped back out and ran away. Security members didn’t know how he sneaked back in. 
Police who questioned Young said he told them he didn’t remember what happened and that he didn’t know his name, but when officers called him by his name he responded, “indicating his answers were intentionally evasive and not due to impairment,” according to the affidavit. Staff at the bar told police Young had ordered only two drinks before they stopped serving him due to erratic behavior.
Police also confiscated a Sundance Film Festival administrative access pass in someone else’s name from Young.
Young was booked into Summit County Jail under investigation of assaulting a government official and assault of the woman at the party, with both “racially charged” incidents being screened for a hate crime enhancement, according to the affidavit. Young is also being investigated for aggravated burglary for allegedly entering the bar unlawfully.
An attorney for Young was not listed. He is being held without an option to post bail.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A crowd of over a thousand demonstrators gathered at the Colorado Capitol and marched through downtown Denver on Sunday to protest the Trump administration after another fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in Minnesota.
“Again we gather to express our outrage over a lawless regime terrorizing communities,” activist Darlene Rivera told protesters from the Capitol steps. “It is clear that this regime is waging war against the people that do not agree with their racist policies and actions.”
The demonstration came one day after Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot and killed by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis, just two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents. The two killings have sparked nationwide outrage, even as President Donald Trump’s top advisers have rushed to spread false information about Pretti and Good, both of whom were smeared as “domestic terrorists” by the administration within hours of being killed.

Multiple videos that surfaced Saturday showed federal agents opening fire on Pretti while he was restrained and on the ground. Pretti was lawfully carrying a handgun, which had already been secured by agents before the shots were fired. While Trump officials baselessly called him a “would-be assassin” who intended to harm immigration agents, videos show the encounter began with Pretti filming the agents with his cell phone.
“Renee Good and Alex Pretti were murdered in broad daylight while being filmed by numerous people,” Rivera told the crowd. “The videos we have all seen make it clear that Renee and Alex were murdered.”
Joining protesters on the Capitol grounds were a handful of Colorado Democratic elected officials, including state Sen. Jessie Danielson of Wheat Ridge and Attorney General Phil Weiser, who is a 2026 candidate for governor.

Carol Wiemann, a demonstrator from Boulder, stood on a street corner west of the Capitol and waved an American flag at passing cars, many of which offered supportive honks throughout the protest.
“Tears. Tears,” she said of her reaction to hearing of Pretti’s death. “I’ve had enough. This is the fourth or fifth time I’ve been down here. Trump is evil — he’s evil, and we’ve lost our democracy.”
Pretti’s parents, Michael and Susan Pretti, are Colorado residents. They released a statement Saturday calling him “a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends.”
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” their statement said. “Alex (was) clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs.”
“Alex wanted to make a difference in this world,” they said. “Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact.
The federal presence in Minneapolis is part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
Colorado reaction
Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, called the shooting “tragic and unacceptable” in a statement Saturday afternoon. He called for an impartial investigation into the incident and affirmed people’s right to protest.
“To anyone peacefully exercising your First Amendment rights, Colorado stands with you. Americans are experiencing violence and intimidation by our own government. It is unacceptable and must end. Americans are not blind and can see the dangers of the current approach and tactics from ICE,” he said.

The six Democrats in Colorado’s congressional delegation condemned the shooting online. As of Sunday afternoon, the four Republicans who represent Colorado in Congress had not spoken or issued statements about the shooting.
In a social media post, Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, called ICE a “rogue agency” out of control, and said ICE needs to be “dismantled” and U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be impeached.
Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat, said in a statement that she grieves the “senseless loss of life and the terrifying leadership that has created this reality.”
“Our country is at a breaking point because of the illegal and fascist actions of this administration. The American people have had enough. Some Republicans have started to call for ICE oversight, but we need more,” she said.

Sen. John Hickenlooper wrote in a post that he will vote against an upcoming bill in the Senate to fund Homeland Security. The bill which includes $10 billion for ICE. It is expected that Senate Democrats will not provide the votes necessary to advance the bill, which passed the House last week.
“ICE is out of control,” Hickenlooper wrote. “Killing people, separating families and terrorizing communities.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the wake of a massive winter storm that rolled across Tennessee, covering the state with a glaze of ice and leaving hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses without power, President Donald Trump approved on Saturday a request for emergency aid. 
Gov. Bill Lee issued a state of emergency for all 95 counties on Friday, ahead of the storm, and on Sunday, Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell declared one, urging people to stay home if possible. 
“Try to shelter in place, help neighbors who are in walking distance, be careful if you do have to go outside,” said O’Connell.

As of Sunday afternoon, more than 225,000 Nashville households lack electricity, according to the Nashville Electric Service and O’Connell. Middle Tennessee Electric Corporation, which covers portions of Middle Tennessee, reported 13,000 outages. Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation, which serves portions of northern Middle Tennessee, including Montgomery, Stewart, Sumner and Robertson counties, reports 35,000 of its 110,000 members are without electricity. 
Memphis, which in 2022 had long term outages after a major winter storm, escaped the worst of the ice. 
Activation of an emergency declaration gives state and local government agencies access to federal support for emergency protective measures, direct federal assistance and coordination of federal resources.
Trump’s quick approval of the request for emergency support contrasts the much slower response from the federal government after severe storms battered West Tennessee in the spring. 
This is the third time in less than two years Tennessee has had to access federal emergency funds for climate disasters. Prior to the spring tornadoes and flooding in 2025, in September 2024, flooding caused by Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage to parts of East Tennessee.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The federal killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis this month, captured from multiple angles by witnesses recording on their cell phones, kicked off a dizzying day here and in Washington. Democratic politicians and ordinary Americans reacted with a mix of outrage and incredulousness, backfooting the Trump administration as the federal operation Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has called an “occupation” approached its third month.
By late Saturday, a Trump-appointed Minnesota federal judge appointed had ordered the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence.” 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said his party would block a must-pass government appropriations package — and partially shut down the government next week — if it contained additional funding for the Homeland Security Department. 
As it did earlier this month after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, senior Trump administration officials worked swiftly on Saturday to blame the incident on the victim. 
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Alex Jeffrey Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” echoing language used by Vice President JD Vance to describe Good. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said Pretti appeared eager to inflict “maximum damage” on the federal agents assembled near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street Saturday morning. Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s chief domestic policy advisor, called Pretti an “assassin.” 
Videos taken at the scene — as well as what’s known about Pretti’s background — belie the Trump administration’s claims. Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and no criminal record, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara. 
Moments before he was shot, Pretti could be seen on video with his phone — not a gun — recording federal officers, as has become standard practice among anti-ICE activists. 
A cell phone video shows a gaggle of Border Patrol agents wrestling him to the ground and beating him; an agent removes Pretti’s holstered gun, and Pretti appears to pose no threat to the officers surrounding him. Moments later, about 10 shots ring out. 
In a sworn affidavit filed Saturday evening, a physician who lives nearby said Pretti had no pulse when they arrived at the scene. The physician, whose name and identity were not made public, said agents did not appear to be rendering lifesaving aid and initially refused the physician’s offer to help. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.
Pretti’s name had emerged in media reports by early afternoon. It’s unclear whether federal, state or local officials attempted to notify his next of kin beforehand. Michael Pretti, his father, said he first learned of the shooting from an Associated Press reporter.
“I can’t get any information from anybody,” Michael Pretti told the AP, detailing a runaround with the Border Patrol, local police and area hospitals. He said the Hennepin County Medical Examiner eventually confirmed they had Alex Preti’s body.
“We are heartbroken but also very angry,” Pretti’s parents said in a statement released later on Saturday that described Pretti as a “hero” who “wanted to make a difference in this world.”
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said. “Please get the truth out about our son.”
Meanwhile, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said DHS officials blocked their investigators from the crime scene even after they returned with a judicial warrant. The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts. Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.
The names of the agents involved in the shooting have not been released. Bovino told CNN on Sunday that he did not know whether more than one agent fired shots.
Minnesota officials questioned Homeland Security’s handling of the shooting’s aftermath and indicated they did not trust the department to conduct a fair investigation.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections unveiled a new website this weekend to combat “ongoing misinformation” from Homeland Security. In a lengthy statement on Saturday, the department called into question Bovino’s initial explanation for the operation that led to Pretti’s death. The statement said the individual named by Bovino as the target of the operation did not have a significant criminal history, as Bovino alleged, and was previously released from immigration custody in 2018 — during the first Trump administration.
A recent article by Stateline, which is a States Newsroom outlet like the Reformer, found that eyewitness testimony and other evidence often contradicts DHS’ initial description of incidents involving its agents.
On Sunday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he expects Homeland Security to heed Saturday’s court order to preserve evidence to support the state’s own investigation.
“We’ve had to threaten them with contempt a few times, but open defiance of court orders is not something that we’ve experienced,” Ellison told the Star Tribune.
Signs had emerged by Sunday that at least some elected Republicans and gun rights groups were uncomfortable with the official line that Pretti posed a clear and present danger before his death. Few elected Republicans wholeheartedly endorsed the administration’s narrative, and even some right-wing influencers who typically hew to the party line recoiled.
Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who faces a primary challenge from his right this year, called Saturday’s shooting “incredibly disturbing.”
“The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” he said on Sunday. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation.”
The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus also issued a statement calling for an independent investigation.
“Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights. These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times,” the group said.
Kevin Stitt, the outgoing Republican governor of Oklahoma, hinted in a Sunday interview with CNN that the administration should rethink its immigration enforcement efforts.

“And so what’s the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want,” he said. “We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.”
Dozens of Minnesota business leaders released an open letter that gently called for a change in approach by the federal government, risking the ire of Trump, who is known for his retribution against those who oppose him. 
“With yesterday’s tragic news, we are calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” the CEOs wrote. 
Among them were top officers of Medtronic, 3M, Target and the sports franchises. This is notable because as the Reformer previously reported, the state’s biggest companies had been publicly silent until now. Business leaders, the chamber letter asserts, have been “working behind the scenes” since the federal siege began. 
Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms.  On Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Minnesota could end the federal law enforcement surge if it repealed pro-immigrant “sanctuary” policies and turned over its voter rolls to the federal government. (Minnesota is not a “sanctuary state”; an effort to pass a sanctuary law the last time Democrats controlled the Legislature went nowhere.)

That Bondi made such an offer at all is notable. But it’s unlikely to lead to a resolution. On Sunday, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon brushed off the idea of providing state voter information to the federal government in a caustic statement.
“The answer to Attorney General Bondi’s request is no. Her letter is an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law,” Simon said.
False claims of voter fraud have become a staple of the Trumpist political movement. A group of right-wing activists led by Mike Lindell — the pillow mogul currently running for governor as a Republican — claimed widespread voter fraud after the 2020 election. But as part of the state’s usual election auditing process, a random group of precincts in every congressional district were chosen for review, totaling roughly 440,000 votes after the 2020 election, spanning more than 200 precincts. The hand tallies were virtually identical to the machine tallies.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0763-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-25 16:56:59.715795

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Following the killing of Minnesota nurse Alex Pretti at the hands of a Border Patrol officer on Saturday, Michigan’s U.S. Senate candidates are now laying out their plans on how to deal with increasingly violent federal immigration enforcement actions that have resulted in three shootings in three weeks, with two now ending in death.
Local and state Democratic officials in Minnesota immediately condemned Saturday’s shooting as protests ramped up, while Republican President Donald Trump threatened again to send military forces to Minnesota, according to reporting from Michigan Advance’s sister publication, Minnesota Reformer.
In Michigan, the three Democrats in the Senate race followed suit, but they each have slightly different policy contemplations to either rein in, curb or abolish the executive branch’s increasingly troubling immigration force.
Former health official and Bernie Sanders-wing progressive Abdul El-Sayed has called for the outright dismantling of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a position he’s held since 2018, a message he has amplified in the wake of the government killings of Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7.
“The murderers of Renee Good and Alex Pretti were eight-year and ten-year agents — training isn’t the issue,” El-Sayed said in a statement issued Sunday. “ICE is a paramilitary force deployed against and our Constitutional order for the service of one would-be dictator. How many more people do they need to shoot? Ask the families of Renee Good or Alex Pretti — both American Citizens — if ICE is protecting us. There can be no justification for lawlessness in the name of the law. And now is not the time to put political convenience. Trump is trying to normalize military force on peaceful streets, tearing apart our constitutional rights one by one. Our tax dollars are being used to kill Americans on our streets rather than save lives in our hospitals like Alex did.”
El-Sayed added that the U.S. must work to secure its border and work toward comprehensive immigration reform through legislation, and not through continued executive action. ICE, in that regard, has been shown to be “irredeemable,” he said.
“Retraining won’t fix it,” El-Sayed said. “And the only reason to deny this is political cowardice. … Rather than protecting us, it has become the thing from which we need to be protected. Abolishing this agency is the only safe path forward.”

While El-Sayed stated his belief that this stance sets him apart from his opponents, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) has called for denying further funding for ICE and has demanded the immediate and sweeping overhaul of the agency. She says the upcoming vote in the U.S. Senate would be a good place to start for Democrats to assert leverage.
“Another person was killed by ICE in Minneapolis, after state leaders told them to leave, local officials told them to leave, and local law enforcement told them to leave,” McMorrow said in a statement on Saturday. “But Trump’s ICE continues on its collision course making our communities LESS safe — not more. Congress: not one more penny until we get the same oversight and accountability we demand from every law enforcement agency.”
McMorrow and her Democratic colleagues in the Michigan Senate are working on a game plan to respond to ICE tactics in the Great Lakes state, and that includes legislation prohibiting officers from being masked on operations with full identification. News that ICE has been distributing memos indicating that the agency does not need a judicial warrant — but rather a Fourth Amendment-bucking administrative warrant signed by an ICE official — has also led state Democrats to consider banning entry by law enforcement without a warrant.
McMorrow has also called for strict, codified use-of-force policies on the federal level to give courts a clear line for when an officer has abused their station if it ends in a preventable violent encounter. Vetting of recruits and vigorous training is part of McMorrow’s plan, as well as a demand that ICE stop detaining American citizens.
“Continuing to provide funding to this agency without a complete overhaul to return it to its duty will be a failure to meet the moment,” McMorrow said in a statement released prior to the death of Pretti this weekend. “The leverage is there. And Democrats should force Republicans to the table to demand that Congress use its power of the purse to end this nightmare and restore the community safety that Americans are demanding.”
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) on Sunday said she was joining as a co-sponsor for H.R. 7163, which would divert ICE’s $75 billion slush fund, created with the passage of last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, to state and local law enforcement agencies.
The bill would hire and train an estimated 200,000 local police officers across the nation, reverting funds to what Stevens called “proven law enforcement personnel who have real ties to the communities they serve.”
“Donald Trump’s ICE is out of control — this situation requires real reform and real accountability. Trump’s ICE Agents have now killed two American citizens in broad daylight and they are putting more Americans in danger every single day,” Stevens said in a statement. “Not one penny more should go to ICE. Kristi Noem must be impeached. It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents. We’ve heard today from law enforcement leaders in Minnesota who want to keep their communities safe, but are being blocked from accessing evidence and information about these crimes.”
Other aspects of the bill include:

Reallocating $29.85 billion in funds for ICE’s enforcement and operations to the COPS Hiring Program (and waive the program’s traditional matching contribution requirements for small jurisdictions); and
Reallocating $45 billion in funds designated for ICE’s detention capacity to the Byrne JAG program, which provides funding to support training, crime victim assistance, and crime prevention.

Stevens voted against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which did pass in the U.S. House last week, and last year co-sponsored the VISIBLE Act to ban ICE agents from wearing masks and concealing their identities. Stevens has also called for U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to be removed from office and co-sponsored articles for Noem’s impeachment.

What about Republicans?
The main Republican in the race, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, as of Sunday afternoon, had not issued a direct statement on the killing of Pretti. Rogers, who is endorsed by Trump, did issue several statements following the killing of Good, saying Democrats, and more specifically his Democratic opponents in the race, were persistently supporting “criminals over cops and America’s safety.”
“The Left’s never-ending war against law enforcement is an assault on Americans’ safety,” Rogers said in a statement issued Jan. 22. “These brave men and women protect our streets so that Michigan families can drive to work and walk to school without fear. But when you have Democrats releasing violent offenders onto the streets, and siding with criminals over cops, that all goes out the window.”
The only other Republican in the race, former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Bernadette Smith, has not issued any public statement on either Pretti or Good’s deaths.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7744-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-25 16:56:59.715795
,DC,2026-01-25 21:13:53+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Deadly shooting in Minneapolis could lead to partial government shutdown over ICE funding,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/deadly-shooting-minneapolis-could-lead-partial-government-shutdown-over-ice-funding,,"A partial federal government shutdown appeared Sunday to unexpectedly be on the horizon, after another fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis led key U.S. Senate Democrats to say they will oppose a spending package that includes immigration enforcement funds.Senators have until a Friday deadline to clear a package of six House-passed funding measures, including the $64.4 billion Homeland Security appropriations bill that includes funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Border Patrol.Republicans hold a majority in the chamber but would need at least seven Democrats to join them in voting for the package in order to clear the chamber’s 60-vote threshold to advance legislation. The agreement had appeared to be on track for easy passage by the Senate by Friday, when a stopgap spending law expires. But after Saturday’s killing of 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, the second by Homeland Security Department officers in Minneapolis this month, key moderate Democrats, appropriators and leaders said they would not support the package if it includes the Homeland Security legislation in its current form. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also said his caucus would not provide the votes needed, citing the killings of Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, and called for the DHS bill to be split from the five spending bills with broad bipartisan support.“Senate Democrats will not allow the current DHS funding bill to move forward,” Schumer said in a Sunday statement. “The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public. People should be safe from abuse by their own government.“Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,” he added. “This is (the) best course of action, and the American people are on our side.”A complicating factor is the DHS bill also includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, even as a major winter storm swept through a large swath of the nation Saturday and Sunday, triggering disaster declarations in multiple states.President Donald Trump and key administration officials committed to a robust media strategy over the weekend, defending the officers involved and smearing Pretti, despite contradictory evidence in available video.Some elected Republicans backed the administration's account, but an unusual number of GOP members of Congress and at least one governor called for accountability.Latest shooting a turning pointFive of the eight Democrats and independents who voted with Republicans to end a shutdown in November have said they will not support the package if it includes DHS funding.Maine independent Angus King, who caucuses with Democrats, said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” that he would vote against the package.“I hate shutdowns,” King said in a video interview on the Sunday morning show. “I’m one of the people that helped negotiate the solution to the end of the last shutdown, but I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances.”Nevada Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, a former federal prosecutor, criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and called for blocking the funding package.“The Trump administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability,” she said. “They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement. This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe, it’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants. I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill.”Cortez Masto called for the DHS bill to be split off from the rest of the package. “We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget. We’ve already passed six funding bills,” she said. “Let’s pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans’ constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement’s essential role to keep us safe.” Fellow Nevada Democrat Jacky Rosen, who also voted to end the shutdown in November, said “enough is enough” and that she would oppose a funding package that did not “rein in ICE’s out-of-control conduct.”“As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” she said. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.“My personal guiding principle has always been ‘agree where you can and fight where you must,’” she added. “And I believe this is a time when we must fight back.”Virginia’s Tim Kaine said in a Friday statement — before Pretti’s killing — that he would oppose the package for several reasons, including as a check on ICE.“We are not living in normal times,” he said. “The President is acting chaotically and unlawfully and we shouldn’t give his deranged decisions the imprimatur of congressional approval by passing this legislation without significant amendment.”Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois also said after Pretti’s killing early Saturday — the third shooting by immigration officers in Minneapolis in three weeks — that he would vote against the package. Durbin is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.DHS fundingThe House last week passed the DHS funding bill, with seven Democrats voting to approve it, and a separate package of three other appropriations bills that passed with broad bipartisan support. House members passed two other funding bills the week before.The fiscal 2026 Homeland Security spending bill cuts funding for Customs and Border Protection by $1.3 billion, and maintains flat funding for ICE at $10 billion.The bill attempts to put guardrails around immigration enforcement by allocating $20 million for body cameras for ICE and CBP officers. But even if the funding bill doesn’t pass or gets held up, the immigration enforcement agencies are still flush with cash after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Republicans passed last year allocated $190 billion for DHS. ICE is slated to receive about $75 billion over four years, or $18.7 billion a year.Path forwardAny Senate amendment to the House-passed package would require another House vote. The House is scheduled to be out this week and the chamber, narrowly controlled by Republicans, may be unwilling to cooperate with Senate changes.Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, a Maine Republican up for reelection this year in one of the nation’s most closely watched races, did not dismiss the possibility of changes in the spending bill package, telling The New York Times on Saturday she was “exploring all options” for passage.The major winter storm also hit Washington, D.C., and could further complicate the Senate vote or potential House consideration. All flights into Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport were canceled Sunday as snow and sleet covered the region. A handful of GOP officials, including Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska called for more scrutiny into Pretti’s killing and ICE’s conduct more generally. “There must be a thorough and impartial investigation into yesterday’s Minneapolis shooting, which is the basic standard that law enforcement and the American people expect following any officer-involved shooting,” Tillis said on social media.“For this specific incident, that requires cooperation and transparency between federal, state, and local law enforcement. Any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy.”Cassidy posted on social media: “The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is a former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on social media he was “troubled by the events that have unfolded in Minneapolis.”“As an attorney and former federal prosecutor, I believe a thorough investigation is necessary—both to get to the bottom of these incidents and to maintain Americans’ confidence in our justice system,” he said.Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, was among those who said he was troubled by the shooting.“I think the death of Americans, what we’re seeing on TV, it’s causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,” Stitt said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Americans don’t like what they’re seeing right now.”Administration, some allies defend shooting Many others, including Republican senators and Trump administration officials speaking on Sunday talk shows — Noem, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche — defended the agents involved and blamed Pretti and state and local Democrats in Minneapolis. “Democrats are now backing out of a bipartisan agreement to fund DHS, which makes sure our border is secure and our immigration laws are enforced,” Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote on social media.“This is reckless and quite frankly, very disappointing. It appears that Democrats are so wedded to supporting people carrying guns trying to interfere with a lawful arrest that they will shut down the government.”Patel, on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News, said DHS is investigating the shooting but the FBI is processing physical evidence. “No one who wants to be peaceful shows up in a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines,” Patel said, referring to reports that Pretti was carrying a handgun for which he had a concealed carry license, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.Spokespeople for Collins, Schumer and Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota did not return messages seeking comment Sunday. Senate Democrats were set to meet virtually on Sunday night, according to multiple media reports.",,,,2026-01-25 16:56:59.715795

Jeff Landry at a news conference Sept. 13, 2024, on the recovery from Hurricane Francine at Signature Aviation in Kenner. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said “sanctuary city” policies and a lack of cooperation from local authorities in Minnesota created the situation that led to Saturday’s shooting death of Alex Pretti, after a confrontation with federal immigration officers.
Scalise appeared on the CBS program “Face the Nation” Sunday morning, where host Margaret Brennan sought his reaction to the third shooting by federal officials in Minneapolis in three weeks and the second death.
Multiple video accounts show Pretti, 37, an ICU nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital, intervening after a Border Patrol agent shoved a woman to the street. A group of agents then forced Pretti to the ground, after which he was shot multiple times. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was in possession of a handgun and two clips when he encountered federal agents. Noem told reporters Saturday it appeared Pretti “arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”
Some 3,000 federal agents have carried out sweeps in the Minneapolis area over the past two months. Grassroots organizers have tracked their efforts in an attempt to warn targeted immigrants, and the two sides have clashed on several occasions. 
Scalise, a Republican, said officers with Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have seen far greater cooperation from local police in other states, including Louisiana. Operation “Catahoula Crunch” from Homeland Security, which focused on the New Orleans region, totaled 370 arrests as of early January before Border Patrol Director Greg Bovino redirected the 200 agents to Minneapolis.
Violent criminals are being apprehended where ICE and Border Patrol agents work in collaboration in local authorities, according to the majority leader.    
“You’re seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don’t have sanctuary city policies,” Scalise said, “and where you don’t see, by the way, people going in the streets breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.”


Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed that Pretti held a permit to carry a concealed firearm, and videos from Saturday’s confrontation show Pretti holding only his cellphone to record video. 
O’Hara and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said the 2nd Amendment allows Pretti to have his weapon with him at Saturday’s demonstration, but Scalise said that right is effectively revoked if a permit holder is in the act of committing a crime. Federal officials have said grassroots efforts in Minnesota to monitor and disrupt immigration enforcement efforts are unlawful.    
Scalise noted that, as a state lawmaker, he authored the Louisiana law to create concealed-carry permits.
“You are not allowed to carry a gun while you’re committing another crime, and interfering with law enforcement is a felony,” said Scalise, who prefaced his statement by saying he wasn’t familiar with Minnesota’s concealed-carry permit law. 
As in Louisiana, concealed weapon permit holders in Minnesota can face additional charges if they have their firearm in their possession during a criminal act. Louisiana has since approved the concealed carrying of a firearm without a permit, eliminating the need for training to possess a firearm.

Soon after Pretti’s fatal shooting, U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-Lafayette, posted social media comments similar to those Scalise would make Sunday morning. Cooperation between local police and federal immigration authorities in other cities has prevented the “encroaching, interference and provocation” seen in the “sanctuary city” of Minneapolis, he said.
“This sanctuary city BS raises stress levels in ways that it’s difficult to explain, but I can tell you that pulling the trigger will happen more frequently when things go FUBAR, and sanctuary city policies most definitely create FUBAR situations,” Higgins wrote, citing the military slang acronym for “f—ed up beyond all recognition.” 
In contrast to his fellow GOP members in the Louisiana delegation, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy made a measured call for accountability after Pretti’s death in a social media post Saturday night. 
“The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,” Cassidy said in an X post. “The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”
This is Cassidy’s first public statement out of sync with the Trump administration since the president urged U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R-Baton Rouge, last weekend to run for his seat this fall. Letlow announced her candidacy Tuesday.  
O’Hara, who appeared on “Face the Nation” right before Scalise, said federal officials have yet to share complete details of what led to Pretti’s death with his agency. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which investigates all police-involved shootings in the state, was denied access to Saturday’s shooting scene by federal authorities, despite having a warrant from U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee.     
The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was also turned away from the scene of the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.
U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, was more pointed in his reaction to Saturday’s incident, saying in an X post it took place less than a month after Good’s death. 
“This violence we’re seeing is sanctioned by the dangerous rhetoric and reckless policies of Donald Trump and Kristi Noem,” Carter said.

Snow and ice left widespread damage across northern Mississippi as a massive storm moved across large parts of the U.S., creating dangerous travel conditions. Trees split open and dropped heavy branches, and power lines crashed down in some areas.
Though the biggest damage was in the northern part of the state, areas as far south as Natchez saw icy conditions.

About 10% of Mississippi customers were without electrical service at midday Sunday, and the hardest-hit areas were in the northern part of the state, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. 
“The situation is expected to get worse before it gets better,” Gov. Tate Reeves said, warning that restoring power could take days.
Like many other Oxford residents, Lee Ragland said he and his wife, Jana, were without power Sunday. He said some trees and large limbs fell in their yard, but luckily none had hit their house.
“Laid in bed last night listening to transformers blow and trees snapping and falling up and down street,” Lee Ragland said in a text message. “Not a good feeling. Now need to find a chainsaw crew to clear my driveway.”

Holly Springs resident Pat Stubbs said his home lost power Saturday night, and trees were down all around his neighborhood.
“I’ve got gas logs and a gas stove and oven. I’m better off than most,” Stubbs said Sunday. “Looks like it’s gonna be a few days before all this melts.”
In Clarksdale, Shawn Thomas-Erving said Sunday he helped six people who were stuck in the storm Saturday evening, including law enforcement. He said he used a shovel to get tires out of areas thickly blanketed with snow and ice. 
Thomas-Erving said afterward that he was tired, but “I felt like it was my duty.”
He said wintry conditions haven’t been this bad in Clarksdale since the early 2000s. He described the situation Sunday as “unbearable,” with cars still sliding and getting stuck.

Lafayette County, home to Oxford, had about 20,000 customers without electricity at midday Sunday, about 75% of the customers in that county.
Lee County, home to Tupelo, had nearly 13,000 customers without electricity, about 35%.
Reeves said power outages were expected to increase as ice accumulates and trees continue to fall.
Tippah Electric Power Association reported that TVA, one of the largest power providers in northeast Mississippi, had “catastrophic damage” to one of its main distribution lines “and because of that, it could be a lengthy time before they are able to get power to every customer,” Reeves said.

Jackson firefighters extinguished flames Saturday night at what was supposed to be a vacant building at Chapel Ridge apartments. The Jackson Fire Department’s chief investigator, Charles Felton, said the building was being used by people “without permanent housing.”
Oxford Mayor Robbyn Tannehill said on social media Sunday that crews were working to clear streets for emergency vehicles. She implored people to remain home and to stay away from downed power lines.
“It looks dire right now, I know, but Oxford’s a community that takes care of each other and comes together when things are most challenging,” Tannehill said. “And this challenge will be no different.”

Communities across the commonwealth have been blanketed with snow and ice over the weekend, making roads hazardous and causing power outages. In a Sunday morning press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear said more snow, sleet and ice is expected throughout the evening. 
Beshear said that the state had no reports of deaths or significant injuries because most Kentuckians were prepared and had stayed off roads Saturday. 
“To the people of Kentucky, thank you. You’re helping everybody out there do their very best in responding. You’re protecting one another and yourself,” he said. “But snow and ice totals are expected to increase today and tonight, so we still have a long road ahead of us.” 
At the time of the press conference, Kentucky had more than 50,000 outages reported with more expected. The state has set up 113 warming centers, and local information can be found on the Kentucky Emergency Management’s website. Eighteen state parks have set up warming centers. 
The governor and emergency management officials strongly urged Kentuckians to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary. Beshear also emphasized that when shoveling snow, take breaks, as the activity can increase risk of heart attacks. Last year, six Kentuckians died while shoveling snow. 
President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency Saturday for several states, including Kentucky, due to the weather. A Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) press release said the declaration allows for federal assistance to aid response efforts. 
Beshear declared a state of emergency for Kentucky Friday. 
Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office is taking reports of suspected price gouging at its hotline, 1-888-432-9257, or online. 
Beshear also reminded Kentuckians to call 911 in emergencies or life-threatening situations. If someone has immediate needs that aren’t life-threatening, like little to no heat or phone issues, they can complete the online Rapid Needs Assessment Form or call 502-607-6665.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota regularly disenrolled one of the highest percentages of Medicaid patients in the country each month last year, contributing to one of the largest yearly decreases in the state’s Medicaid enrollment in the last decade.
The state often switched places with Oklahoma last year for the first and second highest-percentage of disenrollments in the nation, according to national Medicaid data, with disenrollment rates regularly over one-third of patients up for renewal. Medicaid, which is funded jointly by the federal government and states, provides health insurance for people with disabilities or low incomes.
Overall, South Dakota Medicaid enrollment dropped by about 9,000 people from February to November last year, primarily among traditional Medicaid for adults and children, and has since stabilized around 141,000. That number includes expanded-eligibility Medicaid for adults ages 19 through 64, approved by South Dakota voters in 2022, which has stayed relatively stable at around 30,000 people enrolled.
Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff spoke to South Dakota Searchlight after he presented Medicaid enrollment information to the legislative budget committee on Wednesday at the Capitol in Pierre. He said the reason for the higher disenrollments was a combination of South Dakota’s use of an automatic renewal process known as ex parte, and the lingering impact of post-COVID pandemic removals.


Althoff told lawmakers that while Medicaid is a “big spend” in the department’s budget, it is “super impactful in our efforts to lift people who are downtrodden and facing bad times up.
“Without our ability to work pain free or feel confident that ‘I’m not going to die’ or ‘I’m having my personal health in good order,’ we don’t go forward ambitiously, we don’t take risks, we don’t find jobs that we need,” Althoff said.
The decrease could also be due to a healthy economy, said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured for KFF. The nonprofit health policy organization researches and reports on major health issues in the United States. South Dakota reported one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation over the last year. 
The decrease in enrollment throughout the year matches nationwide decreased enrollment, Tolbert added.
State predicted enrollment decrease
A year ago, Althoff told lawmakers there would be a decrease in enrollment as the department implemented ex parte, or automated renewals, to identify enrollees no longer eligible for the program. At the same time, the process allows states to simplify Medicaid renewals, eliminating the need for people to resubmit eligibility information to the state.
SD Medicaid officials say enrollments will decline as they cross-reference for eligibility

South Dakota was not able to use ex parte until it upgraded to a new online enrollment system, Althoff told lawmakers at the time. He said that once the state was able to use ex parte in late 2024, it used external databases to reference and remove South Dakotans who were “no longer eligible” for enrollment, for reasons such as finding a job that put them outside income limits.
The state is required by law to first attempt to renew patients by crosschecking with other data sources, within the state or through a third party. If a state identifies an ineligible patient on the rolls, patients are sent notification and paperwork to prove otherwise.
But an average of 9% of patients up for renewal were terminated because they were no longer eligible, according to state data. The majority of disenrollments were “procedural terminations,” due to missing and improper paperwork.
Tolbert said for a majority of people who lose Medicaid access, it’s not because they are no longer eligible or because their income exceeds the limit, but rather because they “weren’t able to navigate the renewal process.”
Procedural disenrollment can be due to unreliable mail, and the disenrollment often leads to confusion and a lack of insurance for people who need health care, said Shelly Ten Napel, CEO of Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas.
Increases in automatic renewals prevent “time consuming” paperwork for patients and the state, and it means fewer people are “showing up for care who have unknowingly lost coverage,” Ten Napel said.
Althoff predicted that fiscal year 2025 average monthly Medicaid enrollees would drop to just under 140,000 by June of last year, a drop of about 8,000 enrollees, before climbing back up. 
Medicaid enrollment in reality dropped to 144,310 by June of last year and continued to decrease through September, to 141,012 average monthly enrollees. Enrollment has since plateaued, with 141,151 average monthly enrollees in November, according to the latest Medicaid enrollment report.
Change in ex parte could ‘stabilize’ enrollment
South Dakota’s high disenrollment rate changed after the state Department of Social Services changed its automatic renewal labeling and process, due to modernized enrollment software. The latest national Medicaid report dropped South Dakota’s disenrollment standing to 22nd highest in the nation, at a disenrollment rate of about 20%.
Since July, the state’s number of terminated Medicaid recipients due to procedural disenrollment — often due to failing to fill out required renewal, financial or residential documents — dropped to an average of 17%.


Althoff told Searchlight that the department recognized its comparatively high procedural disenrollment rate and made changes.
Starting in July, the department started retaining “categorically eligible recipients” in the Medicaid program, which includes children in Child Protective Services custody or adults who are older or disabled who receive supplemental security income from the Social Security Administration.
“We changed how we define those administrative functions, and that’s what led to the radical change,” Althoff said.
Many Medicaid cases up for renewal in the first half of 2025 weren’t able to go through the ex parte process as well, according to a state Department of Services spokesperson, because of the modernization of the state’s Medicaid enrollment software. The state continued its standard practice of mailing renewal forms, which historically result in higher procedural disenrollment rates.

It wasn’t until September of last year that all Medicaid cases were in a “ready state” for ex parte with the state’s new enrollment software, according to the department. Department officials expect Medicaid enrollment to stabilize over the next year, due in part to the ex parte process and changes regarding the “categorically eligible recipients.”
More than half of Medicaid recipients up for renewal since July were automatically renewed — over 60% in September and October.
Between ex parte reapproval and approvals through submitted renewal forms in the last three months of reports, over three-fourths of recipients due for renewal are being renewed.

Our state must act now, guided by data, employers and long-term planning.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Amy Spear and Megan Sullivan: Vermont trails the nation.","This commentary is by Amy Spear, president of the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, and Megan Sullivan, vice president of government affairs for the Vermont Chamber of Commerce.



Each year, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce sets legislative priorities grounded in one core objective: advancing the Vermont economy. As we enter the 2026 session, Vermont stands at a defining moment. 
Affordability pressures, demographic decline and rising operating costs are converging just as our state needs more workers, more housing and greater predictability to sustain economic growth.
Our work toward long-range strategy began with the Vermont Economic Action Plan, a statewide blueprint shaped in consultation with more than 5,000 Vermonters. 
The plan established a clear vision for a stronger and more affordable future, grounded in data, pairing community insight and measurable targets. 
It also signaled a pivotal shift in how Vermont approaches economic decision-making. Instead of reacting to problems as they arise, we now have a long-term framework that can guide policy choices and align efforts across the public and private sectors.
This alignment is urgently needed. The Vermont Futures Project’s new competitiveness dashboard shows Vermont trailing most states in economic performance. 
Vermont ranks 51st out of 51 in economic momentum, 49th out of 50 in economic outlook, 51st out of 51 for effective business tax rates, 43rd out of 51 for cost of living, and 50th out of 51 for residents aged 25 to 44 as a percentage of the population. 
This means we have a small and shrinking tax base, shouldering an ever-increasing cost burden, and our ability to improve affordability through growth is hampered by a policy environment that is not conducive to expanding economic opportunity relative to other states. 
Without a substantial immediate commitment to economic stewardship and growth, the data point toward a future of higher costs or significant cuts to critical services.
Results from this year’s Business Climate Survey reinforce this landscape, too. Employers identified taxes, regulations, labor shortages, health care costs and housing challenges as the most significant barriers to growth. 
Many employers consulted in the survey voiced concern that the state’s policy direction is disconnected from Vermont’s economic reality and said they do not feel heard in Montpelier. 
When employers were asked how confident or concerned they were with elected officials’ understanding of economic pressures facing businesses, about 85% said they were either somewhat concerned or very concerned.
Business leaders shared with us examples of policy decisions advanced without a clear understanding of operational impacts. This sentiment reflects a growing disconnect at the precise moment Vermont needs alignment around affordability, stability, and long-term economic strategy. 
It also underscores the essential role the Vermont Chamber plays in bringing employer perspectives to the policy and regulatory tables and ensuring economic policy aligns with economic reality. Addressing Vermont’s challenges requires sustained commitment to coordinated, data-informed action.
While there is difficult work ahead, progress was made last year on housing infrastructure, workforce programming and slowing the growth of health care costs. These advances were important, but they are not enough on their own. 
Vermont must shift from episodic decision-making to a consistent, long-range economic strategy. The Economic Action Plan provides that roadmap. Paired with disciplined and transparent leadership, it offers a path toward measurable improvements for both families and employers.
Our 2026 legislative agenda reflects this approach and focuses on four core areas aligned with statewide priorities and employer needs. 
With state spending up more than three billion dollars in five years, Vermont must adopt predictable fiscal practices that control cost growth and strengthen affordability for families and employers.
A modernized regulatory system must support timely housing and economic development. Streamlined permitting and clearer rules will reduce costs, shorten timelines and restore Vermont’s competitiveness. 
Employers report that workforce pressures and housing shortages remain among their highest concerns. Strengthening recruitment and retention requires connecting training strategies, talent attraction and coordinated housing solutions. 
Finally, manufacturing, tourism, health care, technology and small businesses all face rising pressures. Strategic investments in infrastructure, innovation, and cost containment will strengthen these key sectors.
As we begin the 2026 session, Vermont faces a choice. The path forward requires courage, collaboration, and a commitment to measurable progress. Employers are ready to be partners in this work. Policymakers must be equally ready to align decisions with long-term strategy and economic reality.
Vermont’s future is not predetermined. It is shaped by the choices we make — together.

It is also a moment to underscore what defines our profession: a commitment to truth, transparency and patient safety.
Physician anesthesiologists do far more than “put patients to sleep.” We are responsible for managing pain, vital functions and life-threatening complications before, during and after surgery. That level of responsibility demands trust, and trust is built on honest communication and informed consent. At the Michigan Society of Anesthesiologists (MSA), which represents nearly 1,000 anesthesiologists statewide, these principles guide everything we do.
That’s why MSA is proud to advocate for Michigan Senate Bills 475 and 476, which prohibit pelvic, prostate and other intimate exams on patients under anesthesia without their explicit, informed consent, except in emergencies. This legislation sends a clear message: patients have the right to know what will happen to their bodies and to say yes or no beforehand. There is no room for ambiguity when it comes to consent.
Transparency also means being clear about who is providing medical care. MSA has been a strong supporter of medical title transparency so patients understand the training and credentials of the professionals who are treating them. This is not about professional labels; it is about honesty and patient confidence.
Throughout the past year, MSA has also become a leader in educating Michiganders about emerging safety issues. We have warned patients about hospitals replacing anesthesiologists with other clinicians for certain procedures without clearly explaining the change. We have urged patients to tell their anesthesiologist about recreational marijuana or psychedelic mushroom use, which can significantly affect anesthesia and surgical outcomes. We have helped raise awareness about the warning signs of cardiac arrest and the importance of knowing CPR, skills that save lives long before an ambulance arrives.
In addition, MSA has supported efforts to curb the recreational misuse of nitrous oxide while preserving its appropriate medical use. This is another example of how anesthesiologists look beyond the operating room to protect patients and communities.
Physician Anesthesiologists Week (Jan. 25-31) focuses on recognition as well as accountability. Michigan’s anesthesiologists take seriously the trust patients place in us. Through advocacy, education, research, innovation and daily patient care, MSA will continue to put truth and transparency first this week and every week.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
While Speaker Jason White said he did not pressure House members for their support to garner the narrow 61-59 margin to pass his massive school choice/voucher bill, he at the least had a laser-like understanding of how representatives were going to vote.
Normally, during final passage of a bill in the House, the speaker opens the voting machine and then asks three times “has everyone voted” before closing the machine.
When it came time to vote on the controversial school choice/voucher bill, White opened the machine, which displays on two giant boards on the House floor how members are voting, and asked twice “has everyone voted?” Before he repeated that phrase the third and final time, he took the unusual move of interjecting, “waiting on the gentleman from Grenada,” presumably Republican Kevin Horan.
White then asked, “anyone else?”
Without the momentarily delayed vote of the gentleman from Grenada, the bill would have passed by a one-vote margin instead of the two-vote difference. A tie vote would have been a rejection of the bill.
The bottom line is that White can say he did not apply pressure, as he told reporters after the vote earlier this month, but it was obvious he had a clear understanding of the members’ votes he needed to pass his signature bill for the 2026 session.
Being able to see the members vote on the giant screens can be a powerful influencer. Former House Speaker Billy McCoy used to say he lost only one vote as Education Committee chair. It was on a bill that allowed public schools to offer preschool classes. He said he lost the vote because then-Speaker Tim Ford held the machine open an unusual length of time and a handful of members got cold feet and changed their votes before Ford closed the machines. It is not likely that Ford was intentionally trying to sabotage the bill from McCoy, a fellow Democrat. After all, Ford voted for it.

After the closeness of the recent vote on the school choice/voucher proposal, it became questionable whether the bill would ever leave the House and advance to the Senate, where opposition to sending public funds to private schools seems even more intense.
The Mississippi Constitution gives any member the authority to hold a bill – after a final vote – on a procedural move called a motion to reconsider. The voucher bill was held on a motion, meaning it would require another majority vote to pass and advance to the Senate.
There was at least a little uncertainty on whether the bill could garner another majority. After all, two Republicans did not vote. One of them, Rep. Price Wallace of Mendenhall, said he was absent because of commitments on his family farm, but if he had been there he would have voted no. The other – Rep. Clay Deweese of Oxford – was apparently in the Capitol or close by, but did not vote.
It is not known for certain how he would have voted. But Bradley Roberson, the school superintendent in Deweese’s hometown of Oxford, has been a vocal opponent of spending public funds on private schools.
In the end, though, the motion to reconsider was disposed of on an anticlimactic voice vote and the bill was sent to the Senate.
It was a bit surprising to many that the opponents of the bill – all of the Democrats and 17 of White’s Republicans – did not demand a recorded vote that would have been visible on the two giant boards in the House chamber.
But, perhaps the thought was that at this point it was better to keep the coalition opposing the bill publicly together and not give someone, though White says it would not be him, the opportunity to twist arms to get additional votes for the bill.
The bottom line is if the bill passes the Senate there will be at least one other vote – perhaps multiple votes – on the bill in the House, and members already have taken a tough vote on the measure.
It is likely that if the Senate does kill the bill, White and his allies will attempt to amend another bill and reintroduce the school choice effort. Knowing that, perhaps members thought there was no need to have another tough vote this early in the session. Additional tough votes would come later.
And White says he will not be pressuring members – just reminding the gentleman from Grenada to vote.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/15143800/3X0A7629.jpg,,,2026-01-25 07:56:33.484350

Ask Julia Kern about her upcoming trip to Italy and she’ll talk up the appetizers and savory scenery. Then comes the main course — the one where she’ll compete alongside more than a dozen other athletes with Vermont ties at the 2026 Winter Olympics.
Like a majority of the state’s qualifying skiers for Alpine, biathlon, cross-country and freestyle events, Kern has attended the games before. But this time, the 28-year-old member of Stratton’s SMS T2 elite Nordic training team will be able to partake of the host country more easily than in the past.
“The last one was in lockdown during Covid,” Kern recently told VTDigger about her 2022 Olympic debut in Beijing, China. “All of us agree that wasn’t a normal experience.”

Alpine skiing will offer Vermonters the best chance to see a familiar face ascend a podium at the games Feb. 6-22 in the Italian competition centers of Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo:

Mikaela Shiffrin, a 30-year-old graduate of Burke Mountain Academy, is aiming for a comeback after winning slalom gold in Sochi, Russia, in 2014 and giant slalom gold and alpine combined silver in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018, only to fail to medal in 2022 and fall during the 2024 Killington World Cup.

Shiffrin has told the press she won’t compete in all six Olympic races like she did four years ago, but instead will focus on her current strongpoints: going down and around the gates in the slalom, giant slalom and team combined events.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle, 33, of Starksboro — whose mother, Barbara Ann Cochran of Richmond’s Cochran’s Ski Area, won slalom gold in 1972 — is returning to his third Olympics after scoring silver in the super-G (super giant slalom) in 2022.


Paula Moltzan, 31, a former University of Vermont NCAA champion, will be competing in her second Olympics, having just purchased her first house in Waitsfield.


Nina O’Brien, 28, a graduate of Burke Mountain Academy, will return to the games after scoring the sixth-fastest time in the first round of the 2022 giant slalom, only to crash and break her leg in the second run.


And Mary Bocock, a 22-year-old Dartmouth College graduate, will be making her Olympic debut as the daughter of a member of the Sullivan family of skiers from the Mount Snow region.

In cross-country skiing, Kern will be joined by four other athletes with state connections:

Jessie Diggins, a 34-year-old SMS T2 team member, is seeking to add to her medal count — she won U.S. Nordic’s first-ever gold in 2018 and a silver and bronze in 2022 — before wrapping up her racing career this March.

Diggins is expected to compete in all six Olympic cross-country events, which will require her to ski as little as 7.5 kilometers in one race and as many as 50 in another.

Ben Ogden, a 25-year-old University of Vermont graduate, will be representing his Bennington County hometown of Landgrove, population 177, for his second games. He’s expected to focus on his sport’s shorter sprint races.


Jack Young, 23, of Jay, will ski as part of Craftsbury’s Green Racing Project.


And Lauren Jortberg, a 28-year-old Dartmouth College graduate, will participate as a member of the Mansfield Nordic Pro Team.

Biathlon — a sport mixing skiing and shooting — will see the most Vermont representation, with four of the team’s eight racers connected to the state, including three who belong to its Army National Guard:

Deedra Irwin, a 33-year-old guard staff sergeant from Jericho, placed seventh in the 15-kilometer race during her first Olympics in 2022 — the best-ever finish for an American in an individual biathlon event.


Sean Doherty, a 30-year-old guard member, will be attending his fourth Olympics.

Two biathlon teammates will be making their Olympic debuts:

Margie Freed, a 28-year-old University of Vermont graduate, is a member of Craftsbury’s Green Racing Project.


And Maxime Germain, 24, is a guard aviation operations specialist.

(Biathlon alternates are Jake Brown, 33, of Craftsbury’s Green Racing Project, and Chloe Levins, 27, of Rutland.)
And in freestyle skiing:

Mac Forehand, a 24-year-old Stratton Mountain School graduate from Winhall, is set to offer acrobatic tricks, flips and spins in his second Olympics.


And Olivia Giaccio, 25, will hit the moguls course, having grown up skiing at Killington.

After the Covid-confined 2022 games, many Vermont athletes are planning to travel to Italy with family and friends. Kern is ready to show them her top speed.
“Then I’ll make sure to slow down,” she said, “to appreciate and share this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”

In one Franklin County community, “everyone's got a story” about child care, a parent said.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Nicole Streeter thought she’d had it tough when she found only minimal child care options for her daughter while living in North Hero. Then, she and her husband moved to Franklin County.
“There were no openings,” she said of child care operations around her new home in St. Albans Town. “We actually had to keep (our daughter enrolled) in Grand Isle County, so we were commuting over half an hour every day.”

To her, it seemed like word of mouth was now the only way to snag a decent spot for her child — and the place she finally found was a long time coming. Now, at 28, she’s expecting again, and options continue to be sparse. Toward the end of last year, she decided to quit her job (a decision also influenced by both care costs and return-to-office mandates for state employees, she said) and stay home with her daughter in preparation for the new baby. 
Streeter’s experience is far from unique, according to a study released this month by Vermont First Children’s Finance. While the state as a whole is showing clear progress in closing the gap between supply and demand when it comes to child care, a few counties — particularly in more rural areas — are lagging substantially. 
Since the passage of Act 76 expanded the state’s child care tuition assistance program in 2023, 50% more families are making use of its aid, according to a recent monitoring report from Building Bright Futures. Experts also told lawmakers this week that Vermont has seen 100 new child care programs open in the past three years, and 1,700 new child care slots have become available.
But Franklin and Essex counties, in Vermont’s rural Northeast Kingdom, show outstanding need more than double that of counties further south; both show that demand is over three times higher than the supply of child care slots. Orange County is also an outlier at more than 2.5 kids per available slot, compared with Chittenden or Bennington counties with less than 1.5.
In keeping with past reports from Let’s Grow Kids, the advocacy nonprofit that closed its doors this fall, First Children’s Finance sought data that focused on the gap between supply and demand in child care with a focus on workforce implications. The count of care slots only included full-time, year-round programs that would allow their parents to remain in the workforce. The team calculated need in each county based on the number of children in the appropriate age range who do not have a stay-at-home guardian.
Erin Roche, who leads Vermont First Children’s Finance, acknowledged the scale of regional imbalance was “a little surprising,” and said the causes may be complex. It’s something her office has been specifically working to solve recently, she said, as it distributes development grants to individual providers on behalf of the state.
“We have prioritized counties that have larger gaps than others in terms of funding,” she said. 
Her team also plans to begin more targeted promotion of those opportunities in areas like Franklin County.
For parents like Chris Carter, 42, such efforts are welcome.
Both of Carter’s children experienced issues with the quality of their care after moving from center to suboptimal center in the St. Albans-Fairfax area as infants, he said. A yearslong search he called “a nightmare” involved the Colchester-based Little Saplings being shut down by the state amid fraud allegations in late 2024, as was reported by Seven Days.
“I think a big part of the problem here is staff — finding quality staff,” Carter said. 
Earlier this week, advocates expressed similar concerns in Montpelier, and pushed lawmakers to pass a bill that would change the state’s approach to licensing individual child care workers.
Carter’s younger child, 2, still commutes to Chittenden County for care. In his community, Carter said, “everyone’s got a story” about child care.

‘Very slim to none’
Providers in Franklin County are feeling the strain — long waitlists weigh against a dearth of qualified employees.
Paulette Fedorishen, longtime director of Little Shepherd Child Care in St. Albans, said she has a waitlist of about 30 families looking for infant care alone. Parents commonly call before the child is born, she said, because otherwise, “the odds of you getting a spot are very slim to none.”
Several care providers told VTDigger about a bottleneck around care of very young children stemming from particular restrictions on in-home providers, as well as tighter rules in general surrounding staff-to-child ratios and group size.
Preschool slots, Fedorishen said, are much more widely available due to opportunities created by the state’s universal pre-K program. Her enrollments in that age group are “stagnant” by comparison, she added.
Fedorishen operates her center with 38 full-time slots, well under its licensed capacity, but said she has to turn parents away “all the time.” She needs to hedge her bets, she said, due to “never knowing if (we’re) going to have enough staff.”
Population density is also an important factor in determining pressure on or opportunity for particular businesses, some providers said. Franklin County’s relative concentration of child care facilities near St. Albans, its largest city, is a pattern that has appeared elsewhere in the state, with some educators moving away from rural areas to improve enrollment and make ends meet.
Suzy’s Little Peanuts, a small chain of child care centers, recently closed locations in Brookline and Bellows Falls due to rising costs and lower demand.
“Brookline was kind of in the middle of nowhere, so we didn’t have as high of enrollment that we wanted,” said Kayla Gralia, the Springfield location director.
The business’ new location in Brattleboro opened on Monday, and though enrollments are starting slowly, Gralia said she expects the center to be at capacity soon.
“Brattleboro will probably be one of our most successful sites,” she said.
While Windham County appears better placed in Roche’s study than Franklin and other counties further north, demand for care slots still exceeds supply by over 100%.
Roche said child care in Vermont may be entering a new phase in which advocates and grant administrators should look to solve particular deficits in particular communities.
“We’re not quite there,” she said of developing such a county or town-specific strategy, but “I think that’s where we’re going.”
It might not just be about investment, Roche said — some communities use alternatives to full-time child care more often based on their particular demands. Essex County in particular has an unusually large proportion of part-time care providers.
“Every family is different, and every child has different needs,” she said.

The vote, which was held after 30% of union members brought a petition, was 73-38 to maintain the union, a slightly wider margin of support than the initial vote to form the union in 2024.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Jan. 22, 2026.
Just over a year after they first voted to form a labor union, Copley Hospital workers voted to continue the union in a rare decertification vote, which, if successful, would have led to its dissolution.
The Copley support staff voted last Wednesday 73-38 to maintain the union, in a secret ballot election supervised by the National Labor Review Board. The vote showed a slightly wider margin of support than the initial vote to form a union in November 2024, where support for organizing was 68-44.

The vote was held after 30% of union members brought a petition to force another vote on the matter. This came following a year of slow-moving contract negotiations and a pay increase offer from hospital administration for non-union employees.
“Our coworkers spoke clearly today. We voted to stay organized, to fight for a livable wage and fight for a fair contract so we can provide the best care to our patients and the community,” Sarah Bray, a member of the support staff at Mansfield Orthopedics in Waterbury, said in a statement after the vote results were announced last Thursday, Jan. 15.
“We respect the democratic process that played out and the decision employees made against decertification of their union,” Wayne Stockbridge, chief of administration and human resources at Copley, said in a statement following the vote. “While we had hoped to return to a direct working relationship, we accept the outcome of the vote. Our priority now is to move forward constructively and collaboratively.”
Though Copley officials have emphasized in public statements that this push for a new referendum was enacted on unionized employees’ “own accord” and that a year of contract negotiations with the support staff union was done “in good faith,” internal and public communications leading up to the vote indicated hospital administration would strongly prefer the employees not be unionized.
Following the successful union drive at the end of 2024 — the vote was held after a year of organizing by staff and the Northeast Nurses Union to address issues around growing disparity and benefits, and seeing the protections enjoyed by their nursing colleagues, who have been unionized since 1997 — support staff entered into contract negotiations with hospital administration.
For eight months, these negotiations proceeded slowly, with much time spent constructing a fair wage scale, something Bray said the hospital did not have in place for support staff.
Then, in an Aug. 11 internal memo, Copley CEO Joe Woodin put additional pressure on contract negotiations by announcing a 5% raise for hospital staff, but not for union employees, as “union members follow the guidelines outlined in the contract or are subject to union agreements with current negotiations.”
Woodin did not comment for this story.
Bray said she believed frustration around the length of the contract negotiations and the timing of the announcement that support staff were not receiving a 5% raise led to the decertification petition.
“The staff, I think in general, are frustrated with the fact that it’s hard enough to survive on what we make already, given the rising cost of living,” Bray said. “That 5% makes a big difference for people over the years, and we want to make sure that that’s something we get every year, at least.”
While nearly a third of Copley support staff were required to hold a decertification vote, hospital administration did not shy away from voicing their support for their staff hoping to return to business as usual.
After the initial unionization effort, the Northeast Nurses Association submitted multiple complaints to the National Labor Review Board, alleging that Copley administration had violated the National Labor Relations Act and unlawfully fired two employees for engaging in unionization activities.
Woodin said at the time that he had resolved these complaints with the NLRB. A request for comment from the board was directed to the Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, which did not return a request for comment.
On Dec. 30, Stockbridge sent out a memo emphasizing that not including union staff in the 5% raise was “not a punishment but a legal requirement.”
He added that first contract negotiations often take well over a year and would likely continue to drag on if the union was not decertified.
He also emphasized the cost of union dues to employees as the downsides of a seniority-based promotion system favored by unions, as opposed to Copley’s focus on “individual performance and the ability to work flexibly with our team.”
“We believe the relationship Copley has with our employees is stronger, more productive, and more responsive without a union,” Stockbridge wrote in the Dec. 30 memo, noting benefits employees were previously offered, like gift cards for local businesses during the holiday.
“We strive to treat our employees fairly without the need for a third party,” he wrote.
On the eve of the decertification vote, the hospital published a public letter from interim Chief Operating Officer Carol Ferrante that encouraged support staff to “make your decision based on what is best for your own personal interest and your family,” claiming again that unions privilege seniority, not merit, when it comes to promotions.
“I feel very strongly that promotions and opportunities should be based on merit. If we are bound by rigid union rules regarding seniority, we lose the flexibility to reward the individuals who are working the hardest to make Copley great,” she wrote.
Most of the hospital’s support staff were apparently not convinced.
“The outcome reinforces what support staff have said consistently since organizing: They are seeking a contract that delivers fair wages, transparency, and the resources necessary to provide quality patient care,” Katie Doodie, a regional organizer for the Northeast Nurses Association, wrote in a statement following the vote. “Workers say today’s election result is a clear signal to management to come to the table promptly and negotiate in good faith to reach agreement.”

Smile
Jordan Kramer, 15, Hinesburg
The last thing that brought a smile to my lips was a school hallway interaction. A girl I’d never seen before passed by me, and gave me the biggest smile. It quite literally felt like sunlight seeping into my core. Even after she had passed me, there was still a trace of a smile on my face. And that reminded me of something.
When I was little, I used to play a game with my sister where we would take our bicycles around
Burlington. The game went like this: Each person who smiled back at us on the bike path was worth one point, and we would compete to get the most points. We would smile hugely until our face muscles felt tight.
I remember how much my own smile and my sister’s would tint my day with joy. What a beautiful time.

Josh Shapiro addressed mounting fear about immigration enforcement tactics Saturday hours after federal agents shot and killed another person in Minneapolis amid escalating confrontations with the city’s residents, government and public safety officials. 
“What we are seeing in Minnesota is absolutely unacceptable,” Shapiro said. “It is so dangerous, not just for Minnesota, but for the entire country. … What’s happening in Minneapolis could happen here in Philadelphia, or in Pittsburgh, or in Lancaster, or in other communities across our commonwealth. And I will just tell you this: We are prepared for that.”
Shapiro spoke in response to a submitted question about what he’s doing to keep Pennsylvanians safe from Immigration and Customs Enforcement during a book signing at Parkway Central Library in Philadelphia.  Just outside, on a historically cold afternoon, hundreds of people rallied in protest of ICE’s surge in several states in recent months – and what they’ve said has been silence and inaction from the governor as he launches a re-election campaign.  Shapiro is also mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for president.

Andrew Lefkowitz, of Montgomery County, came into the city for the event organized by advocacy groups including the Pennsylvania Immigration Coalition and Council on Islamic Relations.
Lefkowitz, 32, said he wanted to protest test the governor “not really doing much about ICE in Pennsylvania.” Although, the inaction isn’t limited to Shapiro, he added. 
“Democratic leadership … they’re throwing up their hands and saying, ‘Oh, well, you know, not much we can do. We’re doing our best,’” said Lefkowitz, an activist who’s been helping people and their families find legal assistance and other support when they’re arrested by ICE. “They’re trying to play by the rules. And Trump is throwing the rules out the window.”
Lefkowitz said he felt a particular sense of urgency Saturday after learning a U.S. Border Patrol officer had shot and killed 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. It was the second fatal shooting since the Department of Homeland Security started deploying thousands of immigration officers last month to the Twin Cities region and beyond. 
Last week, the death of 37-year-old Renee Good was ruled a homicide. And details emerged about the DHS memo laying out a legal argument to justify warrantless forced entry to people’s homes.  
Shapiro said Saturday his administration is doing “tabletop exercises” and planning.

“We are working with our partners at the local level and where we can at the federal level to ensure their safety, and to ensure that we can continue to keep and build bonds and trust that exist, … and not have it eroded by the federal government sending in ICE against the wishes of the mayor or against the wishes of the governor,” he said.
Shapiro also said “we do not do ICE’s work for them here in Pennsylvania.”
“Our state police [don’t] ask for people’s status and we do not share any of that information with the federal government,” he said. 
Advocates, however, have flagged a couple loopholes in the Pennsylvania State Police’s civil immigration law enforcement policy that they say need to be closed, which would all but sever communication with ICE. It’s one in a list of executive actions they say the governor should take to protect immigrants and the general public amid the Trump administration’s enforcement surge. 
Meanwhile, dozens of the commonwealth’s other law enforcement agencies – local police, constables and county jails and sheriffs departments – have contracts formalizing ICE cooperation. 
Known as 287(g) agreements, they delegate to local law enforcement ICE tasks and responsibilities that differ depending on the type of agreement in place. The most common one among Pennsylvania law enforcement agencies, by far, is a task force model. It affords the most authority of three 287(g) types, empowering trained officers to carry out enforcement actions such as making civil immigration arrests, collecting evidence for deportation cases and issuing requests to other agencies to detain people for suspected immigration violations. 
Those agreements would be banned or restricted by proposals being developed in the state legislature modeled after laws already in place in some other states.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Lawmakers lodging complaints to Arkansas’ colleges and universities isn’t necessarily anything new. Legislators have no qualms telling school leaders when they or their constituents are displeased.
In recent years, it’s likely had more to do with football coaches than law school deans.
But the swiftness by which the University of Arkansas withdrew its offer to incoming Law School Dean Emily Suski is a sign of the new reality for higher education in the state. And it signals to lawmakers how quickly schools could bow to pressure.
The UA’s about-face has become the latest flashpoint over academic freedom as schools around the country face increased Republican scrutiny, from President Donald Trump down to state officials. 
The backlash over the school’s decision to withdraw Suski’s offer has created unwanted headlines nationally for the UA. Closer to home, the decision prompted a walkout by students and sparked fears from professors about their own freedom of speech.
An Arkansas Supreme Court decision last year that could open the door to the Legislature taking further control over higher education and direct say over hiring and firing officials.
The court unanimously ruled last year that the Legislature has the authority to scale back constitutional amendments that were proposed and approved by the people. 
Most of the attention following that decision was on progressive measures the state had approved because of citizen initiatives, including the 2016 amendment that legalized medical marijuana. The ruling raised concern among groups that have been trying to put proposals on the ballot dealing with redistricting and reproductive rights. 
But it might also mean the Legislature can revisit the constitutional amendment that was aimed at giving higher education the kind of independence that Suski’s defenders say is now at risk.
That amendment, also known as Amendment 33, was ratified in 1942 in response to a different kind of political meddling. The University of Arkansas back then faced the ire of Democratic Gov. Homer Adkins and his efforts to fire then-president and eventual U.S. senator J. William Fulbright.
In a bit of irony, it was another law school dean who took center stage in that fight over higher education’s independence. Then, it was Robert Leflar.
Even before the court’s ruling on constitutional amendments last year, the Legislature had a political advantage that was clear. 
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has made targeting “indoctrination” at all levels of education a clear priority. That line of attack has found favor with legislators, especially those facing primary fights in March. 
The UA’s flagship school had already taken steps that appeared to be in response to higher ed’s role as a culture war battleground. That includes the school’s decision to close its diversity, equity and inclusion office in 2023. Late last year, the school removed the head of its Middle East Studies office over comments made about Israel.
The school’s posting of Ten Commandments displays on the Fayetteville campus — in compliance with a 2025 state law — led an alumnus to pull two scholarships he had funded.
Republicans hold an overwhelming majority that could turn the normal holds on budgets that are a headache for schools and other state agencies into an outright nightmare when the fiscal session begins in April.
The challenge facing UA leaders is how they can reassure nervous faculty and students that they’re not effectively handing over every administrative decision to lawmakers. Or that faculty’s curriculum vitae won’t be scoured for any material politically unpopular in a deeply Republican state.
At the same time, they’ll have to provide that reassurance in a way that doesn’t threaten opening up a deeper fight with the Legislature over who controls the higher education system. 
It’s a difficult if not impossible balancing act that could define not just the Fayetteville campus’ future but that of higher education overall in Arkansas.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260120_LawSchoolProtest6_Grajeda-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-25 06:57:30.954770

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/25/susan-keane-ct-retires/,"Keane, the recently retired senior administrator of the Appropriations Committee, leaves a legacy as a fierce advocate for public access.","For the past four decades, Susan Keane has helped to shape Connecticut’s schools and communities, health care and social programs, transportation systems and environment.
Few people noticed.
In many ways the behind-the-scenes chief architect of the state’s budget adoption process, Keane has piloted dozens of legislatures through the labyrinthine task of crafting the multibillion plans that guide so much of life here.
Whether shepherding hundreds of bills, overseeing months of public hearings, arranging research or preserving records, Keane has been the one constant in a process in perpetual flux.
But when the General Assembly convenes its next regular session on Feb. 4, Keane — for the first time in 43 years — won’t be there.
The recently retired senior administrator of the Appropriations Committee leaves an overarching legacy as the model of nonpartisan support that drives democracy, as a fierce advocate for public access and as a trainer to countless staff, legislators and lobbyists.
I feel I have an obligation to make that process as open to the general public as the joint rules will allow.Susan Keane
Keane, 69, who stepped down in late November due to health issues, will be missed for her sharp Irish wit and fiery red hair — not to mention a deep appreciation for music and dance.
“The genuine calmness under pressure, being precise without being rigid, and being deeply respectful to people at every level,” Taylor Aitken of Lebanon, who succeeds Keane, said of her mentor. “She made people feel, whatever question you came to her with, that you mattered. You don’t replace someone like Susan. You carry forward what she’s built.”
“She will be missed by people who never even experienced her,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, a New Haven Democrat and veteran member of the Appropriations Committee. “Her role wasn’t just the committee administrator. Her role was the thread who ties through everything.”
Open, accessible government comes first
The “everything” that Keane tried to preserve was nothing less than Connecticut’s legislative process, from the smallest proposal to the $27.2 billion spending plan lawmakers approved last June for the current fiscal year.
“My philosophy was always to be the ultimate facilitator of moving bills properly,” Keane said. “That’s the bottom line. That’s my north star, the process of good government.”
By far the most grueling of legislative committees, Appropriations has 12 subcommittees and, at any given time, several other affiliated working groups or task forces.
In the final weeks of the legislative session, leaders negotiate a budget with the governor’s staff, a process that can take weeks or months, marked by days that start mid-morning and end well after midnight.
Sue Keane [was] the person who operated the nuclear power plant and never allowed it to melt down.Spencer Cain, state fiscal analyst
Proposals offered in the middle of the night often must be ready for a vote within a day.
“Many people likened Sue Keane to the person who kept the trains running on time,” said Spencer Cain, a state fiscal analyst for three decades prior to his retirement in 2009. “But I likened Sue Keane to the person who operated the nuclear power plant and never allowed it to melt down.”
For Keane, “good government” goes way beyond keeping good records and facilitating legislators’ research. It involves linking residents with their government.
That means given people access to public records — even if state officials prefer otherwise, said Betty Gallo, a lobbyist for more than 40 years who retired in 2018.
“If she could possibly give [a budget document] to me, she gave it to me,” Gallo said. “She never said ‘I don’t have time,’ or ‘I’m not going to get that, it’s too much trouble.’”
But Keane was better known for making face-to-face connections happen.
That means everyone gets a chance to testify before legislators. If special technology, unconventional hours or other adjustments must be made, so be it.
People with mental illness might not be able to stay long in a crowded hearing room. And if so, others — including state officials — might have to wait for their chance to speak with the committee.
“I feel I have an obligation to make that process as open to the general public as the joint rules will allow,” Keane said. “And that’s one of the things that I’m most proud of.”
Regardless of the logistics, “she always made it work,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, a New Haven Democrat and current House chair of the Appropriations Committee who said Keane clearly loved the challenge. “And you could see her wheels turning. Her right hand would start going like she was pounding out a beat in her mind.”
Never one to shrink from a challenge
Not shrinking from a challenge was a virtue instilled in Keane by some of her earliest mentors.
Born Susan Ann Keane in June 1959 on Capitol Avenue in Hartford, just a few minutes from gold-domed building that would dominate her career, she would learn from her father, John, that a polite joke and a smile can turn back many aggressive people.
“I can dish as well as I can be served,” she said.
She spent most of her childhood just east of the Connecticut River, graduating from Manchester High School before attending the University of Hartford, where she learned about a Capitol internship.
Not intending to work in government but thinking it could be interesting, she decided to try.
Her compassion and empathy transcended the legislative process.Vincent J. Candelora, House Minority Leader
After two years of assisting Rep. Thom Serrani of Stamford, then co-chair of the Transportation Committee, he asked her to remain on as clerk. Keane accepted but had no interest in “the money committees” because they “used to kill all of the transportation bills.”
That changed in 1983 term when “my legislative godmother,” Secretary of the State Julia Tashjian, insisted Keane drop her grudge and interview to clerk the Appropriations Committee.
After five minutes with that group’s House chair, Waterford Democrat Janet Polinsky, Keane was hooked for life.
“Janet and I clicked immediately, like a bolt of lightning struck, and I don’t say that lightly,” she said.
Keane loved Polinsky’s insistence on inclusiveness, respect for the governor down to the most obscure staffer, and zero tolerance for those disrespectful to rank-and-file workers.
If lobbyists or politicians sought a meeting with Polinsky, Keane said, “She would look at me and say: ‘Do we like them?’ And that was Janet’s code for, ‘Are they good to you?’”
Though also protective of staff, Keane shies away from confrontations.
Though she likes being called “Susan” and “cherishes” being named after her grandmother, Keane says nothing when many at the Capitol call her “Sue” because “I’m uncomfortable correcting people.”
Her desk is the building’s unofficial “therapy room,” Aitken said. Gallo occasionally found excuses to visit the Appropriations Committee office, just to run into Keane. “She was one of those people, when you have a bad day, you would just drop by,” Gallo said. “You’d feel better when you left. And that’s not a small skill.”
‘Lucy and Ethel’ of the General Assembly
Still, there was one type of friction Keane always relished: between Appropriations and its opposite number, the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee. One group figures out how government spends money, the other how it raises it.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who spent most of his career on Finance said Appropriations — which hears countless impassioned pleas from program advocates seeking funding — is often called the “feeling committee.” Those on Finance, though, are members of the “thinking committee.”
But Candelora says no one is held in higher respect than Keane. 
“Her compassion and empathy transcended the legislative process,” he added.
Keane appreciated Candelora’s praise but said he’s wrong about the two committees.
“Despite what Finance thinks, Appropriations is the most unique committee in the legislature,” she said. “That’s gospel, my friend.”
Ironically, Keane’s closest friend during her legislative career was Mary Finnegan of South Windsor, senior administrator of the Finance Committee for most of her 37-year career until her retirement in 2014.
“For a good year, I felt like I was missing a piece of me” after Finnegan left, Keane said.
She made sure that [the governor’s staff] and the committee were able to work through all our differences and learn to respect one another.Ben Barnes, budget director for former Gov. Dannel P. Malloy
Both hold the legislative process and public access in the highest regard. Neither suffer fools gladly.
For decades, legislative leaders called upon both senior administrators to train new staff, new legislators and lobbyists, a job for which Keane was perfect.
“She was definitely a feeler,” Finnegan said. “She was very supportive of people. She formed relationships.”
In the 1980s and ’90s, when the legislature hosted huge parties in the Capitol shortly after the session’s midnight adjournment, Keane and Finnegan were the chief organizers.
“We were like the hostess with the most-est,” Finnegan said, adding that Keane, an accomplished Irish step dancer, “could cut a rug.”
But none, Finnegan added, could match Keane’s encyclopedic knowledge of music, whether classical, big band, jazz, pop, rock or hip-hop.
The duo, because of their camaraderie and similar passions, became known as “Lucy and Ethel,” though it never was entirely clear who was who.
Keane shared Lucille Ball’s red hair, but modestly insists Finnegan, like Lucy, “was the alpha.”
It mattered little. Both women insist the other was the consummate friend and public servant. And no challenge was so great it could withstand their combined efforts.
“Do you have time to meet me at the railing?” was code, Keane said, for meeting on an upper floor of the Legislative Office Building, “consoling one another, solving the world’s problems.”
Avoiding partisanship – but not laughter
But despite her passion for work, Keane found time to enjoy the Capitol’s lighter moments.
Former House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero, a Norwalk Republican who retired in 2016, recalled at least one time Keane allowed a huge break in her focused demeanor during a committee meeting. But it took a highly atypical topic: whether to fund a new state ranger to monitor flocks of free-range chickens.
“I think I blurted out, ‘There’s a post you don’t see at the job fair in high school,’” Cafero told the Connecticut Mirror. “She just lost it. She had to literally excuse herself from the room. When she came back, she sat down — and lost it again.”
Superior Court Judge Robert Genuario, a Norwalk Republican who spent a more than a decade in the Senate and on Appropriations in the 1990s and 2000s, credits Keane’s sense of humor with averting a budget crisis in 1995.
With Republicans holding the Senate for the first time in a decade and Democrats the House, both entered the final days of the session agreeing on spending for health care, education and other core programs while lowering taxes one year down the road.
But they couldn’t decide which chamber and party would get to adopt the new budget first.
It’s critical that we maintain that sense of objectivity, which sometimes flies in the face of being human.Susan Keane
Keane, whose committee staffed those negotiations, “just started laughing like it was nobody’s business,” Genuario said. “All of these weighty issues that impact people in their daily lives, and we got stuck on … inside baseball.”
But it was her laughter that showed legislators their stubbornness, Genuario said, adding the House got the first vote and Connecticut got its tax break.
 “It strikes me as indicative of her ability to respect all people … not to take sides, but pave the way for a good working environment,” he said.
Keane also refused to be adversarial with the Executive Branch, said Ben Barnes, who was Gov. Dannel P. Malloy’s budget director from 2011 through 2018.
“As much as anyone, she made sure that [the governor’s staff] and the committee were able to work through all our differences and learn to respect one another,” he said.
Keane could work with anyone who respected her allegiance to an open and fair legislative process, said New Haven Democrat Bill Dyson, who served 32 years in the legislature through 2008 and co-chaired the Appropriations Committee for much of that time.
She was the glue that sort of held everything together.Former Sen. Toni Harp, D-New Haven
“She had a certain aura about her work that was beneficial,” he said. “Once you knew she was serious, she was easy to get along with. You do what you’re supposed to do.”
But there was one time Keane found it hard to remain silent as others debated issues.
Her son, Daniel, is on the autism spectrum, and Keane recalled a debate in the early 2010s over whether to increase funding for mental health supports.
At the urging of Sen. Toni Harp, a New Haven Democrat and co-chairwoman of Appropriations at the time, Keane agreed to share with legislators the challenges, “the journey” her son and family faced. But that was it.
“That was the hardest thing for me,” she said, but as a nonpartisan staffer, “it’s critical that we maintain that sense of objectivity, which sometimes flies in the face of being human.”
Harp said Keane’s dedication to her role was unmatched. “She just knew all the rules,” Harp said. “She was the glue that sort of held everything together.”
COVID presented the ultimate test
Keane faced one of her greatest challenges in March 2020 when the General Assembly closed its regular session two months early with the coronavirus’ arrival. Although leaders planned to reconvene the 2021 session on time the following January, it soon became clear that most residents wouldn’t be vaccinated by then.
Legislators needed safe access to their constituents and to each other, but the heart of committee work — public hearings, orderly debate and voting — had to be preserved.
Keane, who says she was cursed with “lousy gene pools” and has battled Bell’s palsy, heart disease, and sleep apnea, feared for herself, other legislative staffers and for their family members who might be infected through second-hand exposure.
But when legislative leaders tasked her with developing new procedures for all committees, she also saw an opportunity to deliver a more open government long after the COVID outbreak slowed.
“This idea of expanding access to people has been percolating in my head for decades,” she added.
Remote online hearings, once considered unwieldy at best and unworkable at worst, became possible.
The legislature increased its reliance on The Connecticut Network, its 24-hour cable television and internet news service that records countless events at the Capitol and Legislative Office Building. Meanwhile, Keane created numerous YouTube channels to serve the committees.
Procedures were created to allow remote constituent testimony. And the voting process was deliberately slowed to allow each legislator in remote attendance to first show their face on camera, state their name, and then cast their vote.
Her legacy is woven into the building.Taylor Aitken, incoming senior administrator of appropriations committee
Lawmakers often forgot one step or another at first in a voting process that already could get complicated quickly by amendments and other special rules.
Keane steered them back gently but relentlessly, part operatic conductor, part Simon Says leader.
“Are you on [camera] yet?” was a common response to lawmakers who tried to vote remotely with sound on but camera off. “I know you’re trying.”
When Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, once got confused and addressed Keane as the “chairwoman” of the committee, the senior administrator smiled and said, “Why thank you, madame” for the promotion.
But those changes took hold, and now most committees operate in hybrid fashion, allowing remote or in-person attendance, something Walker said has greatly improved attendance and facilitated scheduling.
Finnegan said only Keane could have developed that new system — and kept legislators from rejecting it. “She is incredibly creative,” Finnegan said. “I kept watching it on TV saying, ‘I would kill myself.’ That was a tremendous load of work. … She was the go-to person.”
Finding time for family, leaving a legacy
Finnegan also marveled that Keane, despite carrying a weekly workload that often exceeded 70 or 80 hours, found time for family.
Keane met her husband, Vincent Mazzotta, when he represented Portland and Cromwell in the House of Representatives in the late 1980s. They married in 1993, years after he had left General Assembly. Besides their son, they also have a daughter.
And though Keane lives in nearby East Hartford, she said her family sometimes sacrificed because she couldn’t get home soon enough.
“There were concerts and plays that were missed,” she said. “They went to bed without being tucked in by their mom, having a story read or getting a good night kiss. And that took a toll.”
But when the legislative session was over, Keane said, everything took a back seat to family.
There were frequent vacations to Cape Cod, “which is our favorite place on earth,” and lots of “unstructured time” that was just about being together.  “There were days we didn’t get out of our pajamas,” she said. “There were times we had what we called a ‘totally chocolate dinner.'”
“You can never recapture what was lost, but you can find a way to make memories, and I worked very hard to do that for my children.”
Legislators knew how many priorities Keane juggled for years, Candelora said, adding they couldn’t resent their workloads when they saw how she handled hers, day after day.
“She always set the tone with a smile,” he said.
Keane’s example and dedication, Aitken added, is as much her legacy as the knowledge she shared with so many, or the budgets and countless other bills she helped legislators produce.
“Her legacy is woven into the building,” she added. “If you worked in the legislature or adjacent, there’s a very good chance you learned something from Susan.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0109_SR_SusanKeane_085-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-25 05:57:50.481675

As costs rise, residents need flexible, affordable options that support their daily lives.","For most of us, the phone in our pocket has quietly become the center of daily life. It’s how we manage work schedules, school updates, medical appointments, transportation, and the constant stream of communication that keeps a household running. In Connecticut, where communities range from dense suburban neighborhoods to more rural stretches, staying reliably connected isn’t just convenient, it’s essential.
Yet the cost of that connection has steadily climbed. Families are stretching budgets to cover multiple lines. Young adults entering the workforce are navigating rising living expenses with little room for unexpected bills. Seniors, many of whom now rely on mobile devices for telehealth and staying in touch with loved ones, are finding that dependable service can feel like a luxury rather than a given. And in areas where coverage is inconsistent, even the most basic tasks (confirming an appointment, checking a bus schedule, receiving a school alert) can become unexpectedly difficult.
These challenges don’t always make headlines, but they shape the rhythm of everyday life. More households are relying on mobile service as their primary connection to work, school, and healthcare, even as costs continue to rise. When mobile service becomes too expensive or unreliable, the effects ripple outward, a missed job opportunity, a delayed message from a child’s teacher, a dropped telehealth call. The small disruptions add up.

That’s why the conversation around mobile affordability matters so much right now. Residents need options that reflect the realities of modern life: plans that don’t force them into paying for more than they use, coverage that supports them whether they’re at home or on the go, and service that adapts to the needs of families, singles, seniors, and everyone in between.
Cox Mobile is one of the providers working to meet those needs by rethinking how mobile service can fit into people’s lives. Instead of one‑size‑fits‑all plans, Cox Mobile offers flexible options that allow residents to choose what works for them, whether that’s a predictable monthly rate for a busy household or a lower‑usage plan for someone who simply needs reliable connectivity without the financial strain. For many, it’s the ability to stay connected without paying for data they don’t use. For others, it’s the reassurance that their mobile service will support virtual appointments, job applications, or school communication without interruption.

These kinds of choices matter. They give residents more control over their budgets and their connectivity, and they help ensure that staying connected doesn’t become another source of stress. As Connecticut continues to evolve and the demand for connectivity increases, the importance of accessible, dependable mobile service will only grow. It supports workforce participation, strengthens family communication, and helps residents navigate the demands of a fast‑moving world.

When people can stay connected without financial strain, the benefits extend far beyond the device itself. It’s about stability, opportunity, and the ability to participate fully in daily life, no matter where you live or what stage of life you’re in.

And of time, memory, and knowing when to let go.
On the last long trip in our old Jeep I topped a hill west of Meade in southwest Kansas one evening and was buffeted by the wake of a double tractor-trailer going the opposite direction. Trucks on that stretch of U.S. 54 Highway don’t dawdle, and the turbulence rattled my hood so hard that the exterior latch on the passenger’s side came loose. I cursed and pulled the Jeep over at a wide spot on the shoulder, put the gearshift in neutral, and set the parking brake. Then I got out to inspect the damage.
Owners of older Jeeps might know the weird hood flutter endemic to the vehicle. There’s a center latch underneath that keeps the hood from flying up and smacking the windshield, but there are two outside latches that keep the corners of the hood more or less secure.
On this particular model of Jeep, a 2010 Wrangler JK, the straps of the stock hood latches are made of rubber, which stretch as they age and make the hood flutter more severe. After a few years, the rubber breaks, which makes for an unpleasant highway experience, and you also lose some hardware. During the life of the Jeep, I had replaced the latch-strap combination at least three times.
I finally tried an aftermarket all-aluminum latch, which took an hour in the driveway and resulted in skinned knuckles from jamming wrenches inside the fender to reach some of the nuts, but I hadn’t gotten the tension right, which put me on the side of the road dealing with the problem. I didn’t have the right hex wrenches, or enough daylight left, for a permanent fix. So I resorted to a temporary repair.

In past years, I’d used an assortment of bits and bobs to secure broken hood latches while on the road, including once using an old fishing stringer. I had since learned to keep a small roll of baling wire in the back. As I finished up the temporary repair and snipped off the excess wire with the cutter on a pair of needle nose pliers, I looked back down the highway toward Meade and saw the all-but-full moon just above the lonely horizon.
In the other direction, the setting sun was a blazing beacon.
It was Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025.
The juxtaposition of sun and moon seemed significant.
I was on my way to the Oklahoma panhandle to research a forthcoming book, and even before I left home, I was having jitters about the fitness of the 15-year-old Jeep to make the journey.
The engine was still good, but the clutch was beginning to slip after nearly 180,000 miles. The passenger side headlight sometimes winked out, but thumping it usually brought it back. There was a Christmas tree of warning lights on the dash from an ABS module that had failed, and I had spent much of the last month haunting dealerships in various towns across eastern Kansas in a vain attempt to find one in stock. The part appeared to be on permanent backorder. The brakes still worked, but I didn’t have any of the fancy stuff like traction control. The factory CD player in the dash had stopped working about a decade ago, the passenger’s side heater didn’t work, and a rear main engine seal was leaking, requiring me to add a quart of 5W-20 every couple of thousand miles.
Perhaps worst of all, a driver in a Dodge truck had failed to yield at an intersection during a September trip to Texas and struck us a glancing blow, creasing the driver’s side rear quarter panel and shattering the plastic fender flare. I had gotten a replacement fender from eBay and attached it with fasteners from Harbor Freight, but there was still the smear of green paint from the Durango on the Jeep’s silver panel.
It was the only mishap in the Jeep, and it scared me and Kim badly. The Dodge had come from behind a semi into our lane, and although I steered far enough over to prevent tragedy, there was still contact, accompanied by a loud bang and flying debris. Nobody was hurt in the collision, but it was a lesson in mortality. If my reaction had been a split-second later, if the point of contact with the Durango had only been a few inches ahead, it would have been grim.
For years we’d had a sense of safety in the Wrangler, but the cold equations of physics had allowed us a glimpse of the catastrophe possible in meeting a bad driver at the wrong time. I developed a fear of passing semis because you never can tell what’s lurking on the other side, but that feeling eventually passed. The Wrangler was old and battered, but it had kept us safe in the only accident we’d had in 14 years of marriage.
But as I stood at the side of the road, at the crest of the hill outside Meade, I finally admitted to myself that the silver Jeep had likely reached the end of its useful life as a highway vehicle. It was a realization I had been resisting because the Jeep wasn’t just a vehicle. It had become a four-wheel-drive icon of freedom to roam. I’ve driven Jeeps daily since 1999. If you’d like to know the story of the first military Jeep sold to civilians after World War II, you can find it here. Jeeps are noisy, finicky, and sometimes just plain trouble, but there’s no substitute for authenticity or trail-worthiness. I’d had the silver Jeep, the 2010, the longest of any, and it took us from Sacramento to upstate New York and just about everywhere in between.
There’s not a corner of Kansas we didn’t visit in the silver Jeep from home base in east central Kansas, and the towns we explored were a lesson in state history: Arkansas City, Atchison, Cherryvale, Colby, Coffeyville, Cottonwood Falls, Council Grove, Dodge City, Elkhart, Fort Scott, Garden City, Greensburg, Hays, Iola, Lawrence, Leavenworth, Lecompton, Liberal, Lucas, Lyons, Manhattan, Marion, Newton, Peabody, Kansas City, Osawatomie, Shawnee Mission, Topeka, Wamego, Wichita and many others.

I know the Jeep was not a living thing, but an object. Yet those two round headlights reminded me so much of a horse it was easy to forget. I sometimes found myself patting a fender of the Wrangler in the way you would an animal. Kim tells me that I tend to get along better with machines than people — automobiles, guitars and amplifiers, ham radios, old stereos — and that is true enough. It isn’t the machines themselves I am fascinated with, but in the way these machines are connected with the world we know. Whenever we fall in love with a family car, it’s not the car we cherish, but the memories of our lives in that car. Take Kim out of the equation and the silver Jeep becomes just another vehicle.
It wasn’t a particularly valuable car otherwise.
It was a bog standard Wrangler Sport S with a black hard top and alloy wheels. They were produced in the tens of thousands. It was already a year old when I bought it, with a loan from the credit union, and the price seemed high at the time — around $16,000. Looking back, I realize it was among the last of a breed, with no touch screen in the middle of the dash and a mostly analog driving experience, including manual transmission.
Even when it was 15 years old, I still thought of it as the “new” Jeep. It always seemed that way, even when it was beginning to fail. Cars changed dramatically during the time I owned the Jeep, something I was confronted with every time I had to rent a car for business. Everything seemed to be controlled by a menu instead of a switch or a button. Are cars better now? Absolutely. They are safer, faster, more sure-footed. But I think I’ll always miss the silver Jeep.
Among the memories I’ll hold tight to is loading the back of the Jeep with personal things from my office in Plumb Hall after I was among more than 30 faculty members fired at Emporia State University. You can read about the purge in this column from 2022, but what you need to know is that our termination wasn’t our fault. I filled the Jeep with crates of my books, boxes of research, mementos from students. When I swung the tailgate shut, it marked the end of 17 years of teaching journalism, including the anxiety and chaos of the pandemic. The future was uncertain, but damned if I didn’t feel I was ready for anything with that gearshift under my right hand and Kim waiting at home on Constitution Street.
The next couple of years were tougher than we could have imagined.
The one thing that didn’t let us down was the Jeep.
It got us to the other side of a bad stretch. Yeah, it had a few problems, but it never left us stranded. It took us anywhere we asked of it. We did have a bad few minutes in Yellowstone National Park when a snowstorm was blowing in and the electrical system went dead, but a quick brushing of a corroded battery post got us rolling again.
We said farewell to the silver Jeep on Dec. 13, 2025, when we traded it in at a dealership. It had taken a day to clean out all the stuff that had accumulated over more than a decade. The glovebox was a time capsule of registrations, insurance cards, oil change receipts, assorted pens and business cards from people I didn’t remember. Beneath the passenger seat, I found a favorite pocketknife I’d lost three years before. From a plastic bag beneath the hood, zip-tied to the fender, was a spare car and house key to be used in case we locked ourselves out.
We had taken the back seat out so there would be more space for gear. There was camping equipment to get us through a night or two if needed, including sleeping bags and butane cook stoves; there was fishing equipment consisting of fishing rods in cases, a soft-sided tackle box, and a net and a stringer; a tackle box turned into a first aid kit with bandages and pain relievers and anti-itch ointments and other things that might be needed in a pinch; tools, including a tow strap, fuses, jumper cables, a flashlight and a full set of socket and open-end wrenches; a pair of my old boots stuck in a corner of the hard top, along with a clean pair of wool socks; a grey plastic bus bin used as a catch-all for maps, brochures, bandanas, Nalgene bottles, cups, trash bags, paper towels, snacks, a camera tripod and two pairs of flip-flops; and a badly scuffed orange utility box, with assorted outdoor gear, that had been in the back of every Jeep I’d owned over the past quarter century. All three had been daily drivers.
At the dealership, Kim made a final search of the Jeep, just to be sure.
From deep beneath the driver’s seat she pulled, fittingly enough, a reporter’s notebook. It was the last thing the old friend gave up.
I had been reluctant to trade in the Jeep. Even at the dealership, I tried to talk myself into keeping it, lied to myself there wasn’t all that much wrong with it, and thought wouldn’t it be nice to keep just to drive around town? But Kim said it was time, and I knew she was right. Still, we nearly left the dealership — in a different and newer Wrangler — with the keys to the old Jeep in my pocket.
I went back inside and tossed the keys to the service manager, who made a fine catch. And in that moment it was done.
Cheers to open roads and new chapters.

But if you must...,"I hate winter.  And winter hates transportation.
Growing up in The Great White North (Canada, eh?), winter seemed to last about six months.  This winter in Connecticut seems even longer.  But feet of snow and sub-freezing temperatures don’t have to stop you if you follow some tried and true travel hacks.



Traveling by car:
If a storm is coming, get your car off the street and into a garage.  That way the trucks can plow and you don’t have to dig out your ride.  
If you do have to clean off your car after a storm, include the roof in your efforts. Otherwise your car may start launching “ice missiles” at unsuspecting targets as you’re driving down I-84.  That can mean a fine and possible injury to others.
Keep your gas tank full.  Your windshield washer tank, too… with ice-melting fluids, not water.  Replace worn wipers before winter storms.  Frozen, shredded rubber on dirty glass turns night driving into roulette.


When you start your engine, let it idle for at least 20 to 30 seconds before driving to ensure adequate oil distribution.  Don’t race the engine.  This isn’t Daytona, and cold oil doesn’t respond well to your enthusiasm.
Drive with your traction control turned on and proceed with caution.  Just because you’re in a SUV, don’t assume that because your car is bigger it’s safer.
Check your tires.  For every 10 degree drop in temperature you lose one PSI in tire pressure.  Under-inflated tires mean longer stopping distances (before factoring in the ice), lower fuel economy and higher risk of blowouts.
If you’re in an EV anticipate that your car won’t charge as well in the cold.  And expect to lose 20-40% of your normal driving range.  Pre-conditioning the battery while plugged in can claw back some of that mileage.
Without sounding like a scolding parent, just assume the worst because winter always does. Keeping an emergency kit handy: a blanket, flashlight, phone charger, and gloves in the car isn’t paranoia, it’s planning.
Traveling by train:
While train travel is much safer in bad weather, it’s not immune to physics.  Sub-zero temperatures are the enemy of all things mechanical.
To their credit, Connecticut’s railroads have a much better record of performance in winter than in years past when service was pre-emptively cancelled to avoid stranding passengers.  But remember… parts of this railroad are 100+ years old and centenarians don’t like playing in the snow.
While apps like TrainTime have vastly improved communications, they’re not perfect.  Trust your eyes and crowd-source any mistake you see to the Twitter account @CTRailCommuters to advise your fellow riders.
If your station’s waiting room is locked or the platform is not shoveled / sanded, document it and call your town hall.  Commuters deserve heat and a safe path to their train.
Grabbing the first train in the morning darkness turns you into a guinea pig as it encounters frozen switches and doors so later trains don’t have to.  Overhead power lines can snap and strand you without heat, so opt for diesel powered trains if they’re an option.
And don’t forget to download and activate your ticket before boarding; this in case cell service is lost and you’re hit with an $8 fine under Metro-North’s new rules.
Keep your cell phone (and its winter-hating battery) fully charged and close to your body heat to preserve its power.  Stashing your phone in a bag or outside pocket will drain your power quickly.
Finally, ask yourself “Is this trip really necessary?”  Sometimes the smartest winter travel decision is deciding not to travel at all.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/plowing-1.jpg,,,2026-01-25 04:56:12.636841

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Over a thousand people gathered for a vigil and rally Saturday night at Whittier Park in Minneapolis to mourn Alex Pretti, the man who was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent. After the vigil, demonstrators marched in subzero temperatures to the site where Pretti was killed on Nicollet Avenue, south of 26th Street.
The site of the shooting has been turned into a makeshift memorial of candles and flowers, less than 2 miles away from the memorial in the Powderhorn neighborhood made for Renee Good on January 7, the day she was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.
Since Pretti’s killing, which drew hundreds of protestors in the immediate aftermath, people have built barricades out of dumpsters, trash cans and picnic tables to block off traffic from the surrounding streets. Before a swell of demonstrators arrived from the Whittier Park vigil, the area was mostly quiet, with hundreds huddled around his memorial.
Isabelle Atem, a nurse who drove in from Woodbury, cried as she said: “I thought it was just a dream, but… I’m here now. It feels real. It really happened. You know, in a movie, when you shoot people, I know it’s fake. I never knew it (could be) real.”
Atem said she felt bad when she found out Pretti was also a nurse. In a statement to multiple news outlets, Pretti’s parents said he was an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital.
“Nurses are out there to help people. Why are they killing? Why are they shooting?” Atem said.
Atem, an immigrant from Cameroon, said that despite being a U.S. citizen, she has been afraid to go outside amid the surge of over 3,000 federal immigration agents to Minnesota, who have detained residents regardless of their citizenship status.

People were handing out warm drinks and food — fried rice, hummus — from local restaurants at tables at Pretti’s memorial. Glam Doll Donuts, across the street from where the Border Patrol agent shot Pretti, was open after hours and filled with people looking to stay warm.
As demonstrators from the nearby vigil filtered onto Nicollet, chanting, Jake Anderson handed out the last of the three gallons of chicken wild rice soup he had made that day.
Anderson, who lives in the Whittier neighborhood where Pretti was killed, said that he came to support everyone marching “a brutal takeover of our city by totalitarian ICE members and people who don’t actually care about safety in our community.”
“I think there’s a lot of outrage and rage clearly, but there’s also just a sense of community,” he said, as a man complimented his soup.
Some demonstrators banged on dumpsters with hammers and their hands as people chanted: “No Justice, No Peace” and “F*ck ICE.”
The parents of Alex Pretti, Michael and Susan Pretti, released a statement Saturday, castigating the Trump administration for slandering their son with “sickening lies” that they called “reprehensible and disgusting.”
They defended their son’s conduct, saying he was protecting a woman who had been pushed down by federal agents. “Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man. Thank you.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0729-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 22:56:50.623254

Family members identified the man who was killed as Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who had protested President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in his city. After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and protesters clashed with federal immigration officers, who wielded batons and deployed flash bangs.
The Minnesota National Guard was assisting local police at the direction of Gov. Tim Walz, officials said. Guard troops were sent to both the shooting site and to a federal building where officials have squared off with protesters daily.
Information about what led up to the shooting was limited, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.
But Connecticut officials, including Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, quickly denounced the federal agents’ actions.
“It’s just f***ing awful, the inhumanity of this,” Murphy said in a video posted to social medial. “We cannot fund ICE as it is constituted today.”

Pam Bondi just sent a letter to Minnesota officials saying ICE will leave if the state turns over its voter database to Trump. Guess what? This has never been about safety or immigration. It’s a pretext for Trump to take over elections in swing states. pic.twitter.com/BHrQJUECJY— Chris Murphy  (@ChrisMurphyCT) January 25, 2026

Sen. Richard Blumenthal criticized the Department of Homeland Security’s plan to investigate the shooting itself and called for an independent investigation.

Coverup in real time—if DHS investigates its own potential illegality. Congress must demand an independent investigation—immediately. A bipartisan call for justice—now. https://t.co/vgCHB6TJnR— Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) January 24, 2026

U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, joined the call for an independent investigation.
“The second fatal shooting by DHS agents in Minneapolis this month demands a thorough, professional homicide investigation by local and state authorities who are actually qualified to carry out that task,” Courtney said in a statement. “DHS leaders and agents have shown they are more interested in politically spinning the facts to escape accountability, which is one of many reasons why tensions in Minnesota and across the country are dangerously on edge. The DHS spending bill, which I opposed along with the entire Connecticut House Delegation this past week, will simply perpetuate the status quo rather than rein in DHS rogue behavior. The Senate still has a chance to vote to restore civilized norms in law enforcement, and for the sake of the country, they should act accordingly.”
U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, called the shooting “sickening.”

The images coming from MN are absolutely horrifying. ICE agents have killed someone else.This must be investigated and ICE must leave MN.Residents should not have to fear the federal government. This is sickening.— Jahana Hayes (@RepJahanaHayes) January 24, 2026

Democratic state Rep. Farley Santos represents Danbury, where a number of ICE arrests took place last year.
“What we are witnessing should stop this country in its tracks,” Santos said in a press release. “We have seen children used as leverage, toddlers detained, kindergartners turned into bait, and now another human being killed. … What we are seeing is the result of unchecked power and reckless tactics … This is violence carried out under the color of authority. If we remain silent, it will only spread. What is happening is un-American, and it cannot continue.”
And a coalition of Connecticut immigration organizations released a statement to the media calling for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to be abolished.
“We are heartbroken,” reads the statement, signed by CT Students for a Dream, Danbury Unites for Immigrants, Colectivo de Defensa/Hartford Deportation Defense, Make the Road CT, New Haven Immigrants Coalition, Stamford Norwalk United For Immigrants and Unidad Latina en Acción.
“We stand with Minnesotans as they continue to face the terror of state violence and illegal actions by federal agents,” it continues. “We have seen first-hand ICE’s increasingly more violent tactics and the escalating number of detentions in CT and across the Northeast. … Our CT elected officials must ensure that Connecticut is not complicit in the federal government’s abusive immigration enforcement tactics or its creeping authoritarianism. We call on our state legislators to protect our privacy by regulating private companies’ ability to capture our personal information and ensure the national guard is not used for immigration enforcement.”
Trump lashes out
Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that federal officers were conducting an operation and fired “defensive shots” after a man with a handgun approached them and “violently resisted” when officers tried to disarm him.
In bystander videos of the shooting that emerged soon after, Pretti is seen with a phone in his hand but none appears to show him with a visible weapon.
O’Hara said police believe the man was a “lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.”
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference that Pretti had shown up to “impede a law enforcement operation.” She questioned why he was armed but did not offer detail about whether Pretti drew the weapon or brandished it at officers.
The officer who shot the man is an eight-year Border Patrol veteran, federal officials said.
Trump weighed in on social media by lashing out at Walz and the Minneapolis mayor.
Trump shared images of the gun that immigration officials said was recovered and said: “What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers?”
Trump, a Republican, said the Democratic governor and mayor are “are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”
Pretti was shot just over a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7, sparking widespread protests.
Pretti’s family released a statement Saturday evening saying they are “heartbroken but also very angry,” and calling him a kindhearted soul who wanted to make a difference in the world through his work as a nurse.
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,” the family statement said. “Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.”
Video shows officers, man who was shot
In a bystander video of Saturday’s shooting obtained by The Associated Press, protesters can be heard blowing whistles and shouting profanities at federal officers on Nicollet Avenue.
The video shows an officer shoving a person who is wearing a brown jacket, skirt and black tights and carrying a water bottle. That person reaches out for a man and the two link up, embracing. The man, wearing a brown jacket and black hat, seems to be holding his phone up toward the officer.
The same officer shoves the man in his chest and the two, still embracing, fall back.
The video then shifts to a different part of the street and then comes back to the two individuals unlinking from each other. The video shifts focus again and then shows three officers surrounding the man.
Soon at least seven officers surround the man. One is on the man’s back and another who appears to have a canister in his hand strikes a blow to the man’s chest. Several officers try to bring the man’s arms behind his back as he appears to resist. As they pull his arms, his face is briefly visible on camera. The officer with the canister strikes the man near his head several times.
A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it’s not clear from where the shot came. Multiple officers back off the man after the shot. More shots are heard. Officers back away and the man lies motionless on the street.
The police chief appealed for calm, both from the public and from federal law enforcement.
“Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands,” the chief said. “We urge everyone to remain peaceful.”
Gregory Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol, who has commanded the Trump administration’s big-city immigration campaign, said the officer who shot the man had extensive training as a range safety officer and in using less-lethal force.
“This is only the latest attack on law enforcement. Across the country, the men and women of DHS have been attacked, shot at,” he said.
Walz said he had no confidence in federal officials and that the state would lead the investigation into the latest fatal shooting.
But Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said during a news conference that federal officers blocked his agency from the shooting scene even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.
Amid the unrest, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will not vote for a spending package that includes money for DHS. Schumer’s statement increases the possibility that the government could partially shut down on Jan. 30 when funding runs out.
Protests continue in Minneapolis
Protesters converged at the scene of the shooting despite dangerously cold weather.
At midday Saturday, the worst of an extreme cold wave was over, but the temperature was still -6 degrees (-21 Celsius).
After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them “cowards” and telling them to go home. One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: “Boo hoo.” Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car. Protesters dragged garbage dumpsters from alleyways to block the streets, and people who gathered chanted, “ICE out now” and “Observing ICE is not a crime.”
As dark fell, hundreds of people gathered quietly by a growing memorial at the site of the shooting. Some carried signs saying “Justice for Alex Pretti.” Others chanted Pretti’s and Good’s names. A doughnut shop and a clothing store nearby stayed open, offering protesters a warm place as well as water, coffee and snacks.
Caleb Spike said he came from a nearby suburb to show his support and his frustration. “It feels like every day something crazier happens,” he said. “What’s happening in our community is wrong, it’s sickening, it’s disgusting.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26025029988353-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 21:56:35.553078

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin says she will vote against funding the Department of Homeland Security after federal immigration officers fatally shot a second American citizen in Minneapolis Saturday.
Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said federal agents killed a 37-year-old man who was an American citizen and a lawful gun owner. The Associated Press identified the man as Alex Pretti.
Graphic video filmed by bystanders and posted to social media shows federal agents wrestling Pretti to the ground and hitting him with a firearm before multiple shots can be heard.
It is the second time this month U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have killed an American citizen in Minnesota. Federal agents previously shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7.
Slotkin, a Democrat from Holly, said the killings are “part of a continued, coordinated assault on our Constitutional rights — with specific focus on individuals and groups who disagree with this President.”
“As all Americans can see with their own eyes, ICE and those under their command are not acting as responsible law enforcement agencies,” Slotkin said. “They are recklessly inciting violence at the whims of the president. And they must be reined in before there is more killing.”

The appropriations package that Slotkin plans to vote against includes $64.4 billion in DHS funding for fiscal year 2026. It would reduce funding for Customs and Border Patrol by $1.3 billion but would continue funding ICE at current levels.
The package includes $20 million for officer-worn body cameras for ICE agents but stops short of additional guardrails that Democrats, including Slotkin, have demanded.
Republican leaders in the Senate plan to bring the DHS funding up as a single vote with funding for other government programs that have more support among Democrats.
The funding package would need to earn 60 votes in the Senate by Friday to avoid a government shutdown.
Even if DHS funding lapses, federal agencies could tap into $170 billion of one-time funding for immigration enforcement that was included in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
All but seven Democrats in the U.S. House voted against the DHS funding. Michigan’s congressional delegation voted along party lines, with every Republican voting to pass it and every Democrat voting against it.
Retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) has not indicated how he plans to vote on the funding package.

But he has called for a “full and impartial investigation by local police” into the fatal shootings of Pretti and Good.
In both cases, federal officials stonewalled state and local police from investigating and quickly began spreading a narrative that is not supported by videos shared by witnesses and reviewed by experts.
An F.B.I. agent investigating the shooting of Good resigned after the Trump administration pressured her to drop the civil rights inquiry, The New York Times reported.
While Michigan’s congressional Republicans have been largely silent on the killing, Democrats have been outspoken.
U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) echoed the calls for a “thorough, independent investigation.”
“Our communities deserve public safety and accountability — not a militarized presence that escalates fear, trauma, and loss of life,” Scholten said. “What we’re seeing isn’t how a world leader runs its immigration system. It’s evidence of chaos, cruelty, and dysfunction.”
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said the actions of ICE agents are “not reflective of the high standards residents should expect of law enforcement officials.”
“This failure, in turn, compromises the ability of local and state law enforcement to do their jobs and jeopardizing the safety of police and civilians alike,” Nessel said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) said Congress “must not send them one more taxpayer dollar without reforms that bring the agency back to its mission and in line with basic law enforcement best practices.”
“I’ve worked with brave, patriotic law enforcement officers for decades. They take their duties seriously to uphold our laws, de-escalate situations, and keep us safe,” McDonald Rivet said. “Lawless ICE operations are doing the opposite, and now we have chaos and dead Americans.”
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) said that “anything less than abolishing ICE is a cowardly capitulation to fascism.”
“I am so sick of fake ass people who say they uphold our Constitution,” Tlaib said. “No you don’t if you fund this madness.”
U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit), who is facing a primary challenge, repeated his call to abolish ICE, adding that the Senate “must stop all funding to ICE, even if that means shutting down this oppressive government.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/83A0225-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 21:56:35.553078

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Hundreds in force, Mainers rallied this weekend against the Trump administration’s immigration operation in the state, decrying the arrests of their neighbors and recognizing those afraid to leave their homes who couldn’t join in protest. 
Since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement heightened its presence in Maine on Tuesday, the agency said it has arrested at least 100 people but provided few specifics, as public officials have called for transparency, to no avail. Community organizers, faith leaders, business owners, political officials and candidates at protests in Portland and Lewiston demanded accountability, pointing to the known detentions of at least several people with permission to work in the U.S. and no criminal records. 
Others shared personal stories and the anguish of loved ones who are afraid to leave their homes. 
Usually filled with children doing their homework and laughing, the office of Generational Noor, a youth education nonprofit in Lewiston, is now empty, said executive director Amran Osman. 
“They’re scared to show up because they think that showing up to somewhere means that they might not make it home,” Osman said. “No child should have to feel this way.”
Safiya Khalid, executive director of the Community Organizing Alliance, a Lewiston-based group boosting civic engagement among Black and immigrant communities, said her phone is filled with requests for help. A friend afraid to drive into work. Another in need of food, fearful they’ll be picked up outside the store. Detentions in both scenarios have already been documented in Maine.  
“But at the same time,” human rights activist Faisal Khan told Maine Morning Star, “more and more people are waking up; more and more people are speaking out, not only in protest but really showing support to the marginalized communities that are being targeted right now.”
While many comments at rallies were targeted calls to get ICE out of Maine, speeches were also filled with gratitude for how community members have stepped up. 
“There is an effort in this country to define who belongs and who does not… to convince people that if it is not happening to them, it is not their problem,” Khalid said. “But here is what they miscalculated: they underestimated community. They underestimated neighbors who will drive each other to work. They underestimated networks that would deliver groceries. They underestimated people who refused to look away.”
In Portland Friday night, passing cars honked incessantly amid the chants of the roughly 1,000 people gathered in Monument Square, where speakers demanded justice for Minneapolis resident Renee Good and others killed by federal agents, before marching down Congress Street, stopping traffic.
The next morning in Minneapolis, federal immigration officers shot another U.S citizen.
On Saturday afternoon, about 500 people gathered inside the Agora Event Center in Lewiston, many taking to the podium to condemn that latest killing, while equally as many people marched outside in solidarity in single digit temperatures. Other actions were held across the state, including about 60 people who lined the streets of Saco, and dozens more who protested South Portland.

Pointed critiques and calls to action
In a statement condemning the recent killing, Gov. Janet Mills said she requested a meeting with President Donald Trump to demand in-person that his administration “withdraw these untrained and reckless ICE agents in Maine and across the country who are stoking fear in communities, arresting legally present people, including law enforcement officials, and who pose a grave threat to public safety.” 
Mills also called on Congress to immediately bring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem before them for a public hearing and to cut off further funding for ICE “until their lawless tactics and dangerous behavior cease.”
Some who rallied in Lewiston and Portland criticized Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden for voting for a spending package Thursday after many other Democrats rejected it, objecting to funding the Department of Homeland Security amid aggressive immigration enforcement. 
Others directed their anger toward Republican U.S. Sen Susan Collins.
Democrat Troy Jackson, gubernatorial candidate and former president of the Maine Senate, said, “I hear all the time about the supposed power and influence of U.S. Senator Susan Collins. Well, Senator Collins, this would be a great time to use it.”
Graham Platner, the oysterman trying to unseat Collins, called on current Maine leaders to do more. 
Platner criticized Mills for delaying her decision on a forthcoming law that will restrict local police from cooperating with ICE. State and local police already couldn’t enforce immigration laws, which are a federal matter, however local authorities have contributed to immigration arrests in Maine, including through traffic stops and 911 calls.
While the Maine Legislature passed it last year, Mills let it become law without signature earlier this month, making it so it can’t take effect until the summer. Maine State Police, however, is already following the law. Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck issued a directive last month that essentially implemented its underlying policies.
Democratic State Rep. Ambureen Rana of Bangor also called out Mills during the rally in Portland, arguing that fear of government retaliation for the law was regarded above “the terror that immigrants in our community face day-to-day.” 
Immigration authorities and state Republicans have pointed to that law when defending the surge of immigration enforcement in Maine. 
“Every elected official is complicit,” Rana said, “and they must be held accountable. They must be pushed. They must be swayed and brought along in this movement.” 
Other calls for action came from Jackson, who said the state needs to create more accessible systems of accountability, such as a civil rights and legal action team. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat who is also running for governor, said the state ought to use the documented evidence of ICE’s actions so far to hold the agency accountable. And another Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Hannah Pingree, called on governors and attorneys general across the country to file suit every single time the Constitution is violated by ICE.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-24 20:07:08+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,What we’re doing to treat ADHD isn’t working. Here’s what would.,Mike Goldstein,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/what-were-doing-to-treat-adhd-isnt-working-heres-a-plan-to-change-that/,"There needs to be a wholesale rethinking of our approach to ADHD, one that is guided by evidence and a better understanding of the dynamic nature of attention problems.","AFTER DINNER, some 200,000 Massachusetts teenagers retreat to their bedrooms. Nominally, they’re doing homework. In practice, many are waging—and losing—a private war of attention. Even when they turn their phones off or leave them in the kitchen, the homework itself often lives on a laptop, where a single click offers instant distraction and relief. 
We recently launched a consulting business to coach high schoolers struggling with getting homework done. The fancy, sometimes broader name for the skill we try to help them develop is executive function.  
We’ve worked with dozens of teens over the past six months. Many try in good faith.  They trudge upstairs after dinner.  They stare at Google Classroom, click into math or history, maybe start a problem or two. Then they promise themselves they’ll start “for real” in 10 minutes, and click elsewhere. The evening dissolves into self-reproach.  Now it’s 9 pm.  Oops, now it’s 11.   
What we’ve learned in helping kids with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is that they need more than “strategies.”  Teachers and counselors have already explained these – here is how to get organized, how to prioritize, here are some tricks to help you focus. It is not leading to behavior change.   
There is no one-size-fits-all plan that will work with all students.  Most of our students arrive having already tried these things.   
What’s needed is a wholesale rethinking of our approach to ADHD, one that is guided by evidence and a better understanding of the dynamic nature of attention problems. Getting the diagnosis right will allow us to stop spinning our wheels and develop the best plan for each student dealing with these challenges.  
ADHD is a complex, multi-dimensional problem.  You need a spirited trial-and-error, equally multifaceted plan to address it.  It’s a chronic condition that is always changing, often in reaction to changed circumstances: fall to wintertime blahs, loss or gain of friends, a particularly inspiring or boring teacher, sports participation.   
The chronic nature means it’s unlikely that an ADHD teen will ever transform into someone like his or her super-organized friend or sibling.  What’s more plausible is that an hour a week of well-considered, evidence-based, trial-and-error coaching can help unlock perhaps 10 additional individual hours of effort – which could mean the world to the mental health and school trajectory of a struggling 15-year-old.    
When it comes to how adults respond to a teen with ADHD, parent reaction varies.  Some feel sympathy, others fury.  Some parents (moms more than dads) blame themselves.   
At high schools, many veteran teachers shrug.  It’s always been like this – some teens just can’t or won’t get their work done – but it’s way worse now in the smartphone era. Solving the 8 am to 3 pm smartphone issues with school cellphone bans, however, doesn’t do anything for the 3 pm to 3 am problem.   
What precisely is behind all this? As journalist Paul Tough  wrote last year in The New York Times Magazine, experts argue vigorously about ADHD. What is it? Are we over- or underdiagnosing it? How should we treat it?
In 2024, Tough wrote, 11.4 percent of all US children had been diagnosed with ADHD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among adolescents, the figure was even higher — 15.5 percent — while a stunning 23 percent of all 17-year-old boys had an ADHD diagnosis.  
Our take: It’s over-diagnosed in affluent communities, where some families simply see a path to advantaging their teen over their friends, with extra time on SAT and so forth. Meanwhile, it’s under-appreciated in high-poverty schools, where there’s less belief that many teens are trying in good faith to get their work done, but stuck.   
Families desperate for answers often marshal everything they can to address the problem. The cavalry sometimes succeeds: medication, therapy, IEPs and 504 plans, executive-function coaching. Often it doesn’t. 
Take Alan, a 16-year-old with two D’s and an F. His mom had already tried the obvious fixes. She sat him at the kitchen table to do homework—he’d start, then toggle to Discord within five minutes. She hired therapists—he felt better after sessions, but turned in zero additional assignments (and sometimes used therapeutic language to deflect Mom). The school offered daily check-ins. Alan BS’d his way through them. 
We tried all sorts of strategies with him. Clear task list with time estimates? First night: 8 out of 10 level of impact. Two weeks later: it had slipped to 4 out of 10. Pomodoro technique – the celebrated 25 minutes on, 5-minute break tactic?  Failed for him.  App blockers? Alan circumvented them in minutes. Hard start time? Somehow 4:30 pm became 5:15 pm became “after this YouTube video.” 
What worked? A coach adopting a Sherlock Holmes mentality when navigating the school’s online platform (it might take 22 clicks to find what was actually due tomorrow); detailed nightly plans his mom enforced; body-doubling for math, where Alan dictated answers, first to the coach and eventually to the computer; chunking big research paper assignments into smaller pieces with micro-deadlines; live editing sessions, where a coach would hover over Alan a little bit, kind of like a personal trainer at the gym (“OK, now hold this plank for 60 seconds”).  
What were Alan’s final semester grades? In chemistry, he went from an F to a B. In pre-calculus, from a D+ to an A, and in history, from a D to a B. When all was said and done, four strategies failed, five worked – for Alan. The next kid will need different ones. 
And that’s the problem. Schools, parents, and even some clinicians use the strep throat framework. Positive strep test? Amoxicillin.  Or, to borrow another medical analogy: broken ankle?  A cast, followed by eight weeks of PT. These solutions work reliably. 
ADHD doesn’t operate that way. That’s why everyone gets frustrated. We should treat it more like diabetes: a complicated, chronic condition that requires constant monitoring and adjusting of treatment, as warranted.     
Even when you think you’ve cracked the code, conditions change, and the treatment needs to also. The sport season that was a motivating force ends. The friend group shifts. The science teacher who motivated kids goes on leave, and the sub is a dud. 
What are the policy implications of all this? 
1. ADHD exposes the failure of one-shot systems. 
The problem with our approach to ADHD is the same as the problem with how we deal with many learning disabilities that call for an individualized education program.  IEPs aren’t built for trial and error. Moreover, they often have a legal compliance vibe. Many veteran teachers are forced to sit through meetings where, in their heart of hearts, they don’t think the plan has any chance to succeed – it’s full of jargon and nominal accommodations like “preferential seating.”    
We could learn from how we handle other chronic conditions like diabetes, where success means continuous monitoring and adaptation. What if IEP teams reconvened quarterly, not annually, explicitly to test and adjust interventions?  This won’t make a difference if the special ed services amount to no more than bureaucratic compliance. In that scenario, it’s just more worthless meetings, annoying for all involved.  But this is an essential idea if the services are delivered in good faith, because only trial and error is likely to stumble on the set of things that work for that particular teen at that moment in their lives.   
2. ADHD has an evidence vacuum. 
When it comes to treating ADHD, we have passionate practitioners—therapists, coaches, teachers, pediatricians—but little shared measurement of whether interventions actually improve a student’s ability to plan, start, and finish tasks.   
Massachusetts is home to many world-class social scientists.  MIT’s Blueprint Labs  uses data to better understand policies in education and other areas.  There are many other similar research centers. The state could fund randomized controlled trials with real outcome metrics: tasks started on time, assignments submitted, credits earned. Publish all results, good or bad. The goal isn’t crowning one method—it’s building a testing infrastructure and evidence base that separates what works from what merely sounds helpful.   
3. ADHD magnifies a brutal equity gap. 
Trial and error costs money. What works is relentless tinkering—come up with a strategy the teen is willing to try, do it, measure it, adjust—until some combo clicks. Our small firm mostly serves wealthy families who can afford multiple attempts until something clicks. Families relying on services in public schools often get one shot, maybe two, before the system gives up on their teen. 
Massachusetts already knows how to democratize boutique interventions.  For example, the 2006 Rosie D. settlement—a class-action lawsuit over inadequate mental health services—transformed home-based therapy for Medicaid-eligible children from a luxury into a statewide benefit.  We should do the same for executive function support—making the trial-and-error coaching process accessible to every family, not just those who can pay.

The Mississippi Department of Transportation said ice had been reported on roads and bridges in at least 26 counties, primarily in northern Mississippi. In a social media post, the agency urged residents in heavily impacted areas to use roadways only for emergencies as crews monitored conditions and treated major routes.
People hunkered down in their homes after stocking up on groceries, and officials warned that electricity outages are likely in some places if ice coats power lines or knocks trees onto the lines.

Local officials echoed warnings about avoiding travel as temperatures dipped below freezing. Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill and the city’s police department reported that several major roadways were icy on Saturday afternoon, with conditions expected to worsen overnight and into the weekend.
“Please stay off the roads if at all possible,” Tannehill said. 
Severe winter weather is a rare occurrence in the Deep South, so it can have outsized impacts because Mississippi has limited winter weather infrastructure. Ice accumulation, even in small amounts, can quickly make roadways impassable and increase the risk of crashes.

The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency has warned that the storm could cause major power outages that could last several days across much of the state. MEMA had also urged residents days in advance to prepare by having enough water and non-perishable food on hand.
Gov. Tate Reeves has declared a state of emergency and said at a Friday news conference he had been in contact with federal authorities to prepare for the storm.

The Associated Press reported that almost 12,000 weekend flights in the U.S. were canceled as the massive storm started to wreak havoc.
Roughly 140 million people, or more than 40% of the U.S. population, were under a winter storm warning from New Mexico to New England. The National Weather Service forecast warned of widespread heavy snow and a band of catastrophic ice stretching from east Texas to North Carolina. By midday Saturday, a quarter of an inch of ice was reported in parts of southeastern Oklahoma, eastern Texas and portions of Louisiana.
“What really makes this storm unique is, just following this storm, it’s just going to get so cold,” said Allison Santorelli, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “The snow and the ice will be very, very slow to melt and won’t be going away anytime soon, and that’s going to hinder any recovery efforts.”

Jackson’s homeless shelters opened additional beds ahead of a potentially devastating ice storm to protect vulnerable residents from the freeze.
But advocates say it would not be enough to serve the city’s entire unhoused population – some of whom will weather the storm outside in tents, tarps and sleeping bags. 
“I’m ready for this cold. I got on plenty layers and lots of blankets. I’m good,” said Michael Veal regarding the impending winter blast forecast for this weekend.

It’s not just homeless people in open-air encampments who will be left in the cold: Jacksonians with poorly insulated homes — as is common across the Southeast — may also need to seek refuge, further straining shelter capacity across the city. In other parts of Mississippi, churches and social services groups started opening shelters Friday as a winter storm with snow, freezing rain and sleet started moving across parts of the state Saturday.
Jackson’s roughly 250 shelter beds, operated by Stewpot Community Services, Shower Power, Gateway Rescue Mission and the Salvation Army, will accommodate the homeless or unstably housed during the coming week’s freezing temperatures, according to Melvin Stamps, the planning director for the Central Mississippi Continuum of Care.

But the number of available beds is in flux, with advocates reporting that two of the year-round centers, the men’s shelter at Gateway Rescue Mission and the adult shelter at Salvation Army, are full or near capacity. The Salvation Army typically charges a boarding fee, but it waives that cost during inclement weather.
During past weather events, the city of Jackson has opened a temporary shelter at the Johnnie Champion Community Center, often called Champion’s Gym, near Jackson State University. With more than 100 beds, the building offers the largest capacity of any shelter in the city.

It will not be open during this storm because the heaters need to be replaced, according to city officials. An additional city facility that has been used as a temporary shelter, the Jackson Police Training Academy on Charles Street, is also not in sufficient condition to open. 
Nic Lott, the city’s spokesperson, said the building and maintenance department is working to secure new heaters. “We would love to use the facility, but the heaters need to be replaced and there’s a process we’re going through to get that done,” he said. 
Shower Power, which has operated at Champion’s in the past, opened 75 beds on Saturday at its building on South Commerce Street. 
Stewpot offers beds at two shelters, a men’s facility and a facility for women and children, all year round. On Friday, it opened an additional 30 beds at its downtown Opportunity Center – usually a day center – in anticipation of the falling temperatures. 
The city announced in a press release that the American Red Cross would be offering shelter, but as of noon on Saturday, the nonprofit was not affiliated with any shelters in Jackson or in the state of Mississippi, according to its online map.

“We probably won’t have enough inventory to be able to support the number of beds that may need that warming space,” said Stamps from Continuum of Care, which is composed of several organizations working to reduce homelessness. “Now, I think it would have been OK if Champion’s Gym was open.” 
While some homeless people in the Jackson area will attempt to weather the ice storm, Stamps said he anticipates the vast majority will attempt to seek shelter. Earlier this week, his organization conducted a survey of the number of homeless people in Jackson and found 123 people living at roughly 50 encampments throughout the city. 
“It’s all about establishing a positive rapport with them so that when a situation like this occurs, it’s not like we’re trying to poke and prod,” Stamps said. “We already have relationships.”

Even so, the number of people outside who will attempt to seek shelter is likely higher, as point-in-time counts often fail to accurately capture how many homeless people live in a community. 
For the people who don’t seek shelter, advocates and outreach coordinators like Dee Dee Barlow Moore say the coming days will be life-threatening. Last month, a homeless man died of hypothermia after opting to sleep outside a building in downtown Jackson — mere blocks away from a shelter. 
“So many of them, in their minds, equate shelter to confinement and to so many horrible, traumatic things in their past,” she said. 
Another reason people avoid the shelter: Their dogs can’t come with them. 
Teresa Renkenberger, the founder of Shower Power, said she wishes it were possible to accommodate pets, but it is too disruptive.
“They would fight and bark, and trust me, I want to take them,” she said. 
To help the folks outside, she said they will be making repeated visits with sleeping bags and even pet food. And if people do choose to go to Shower Power, Renkenberger promises warmth: She said they recently finished installing blown-in insulation to complement two 5-ton heaters inside the large sleeping area.

Moore has also been visiting encampments throughout the city – collections of tents on streets in a mostly deserted industrial area close to downtown Jackson or groups who congregate behind chain retailers in the city’s northern limits – to pass out camping gear and other supplies. 
“But the ones that are the diehards, that truly believe that they can make it through anything, I ordered some of these camping mats that are insulated,” she said. 
That’s in addition to doling out what Moore estimates is three cars-worth of thermal blankets, tarps, hats and gloves, and sleeping bags. She is also planning to pass out propane camping heaters.

Chemical hand warmers in particular can save lives, she said. 
“I’ve had one guy that literally didn’t die from hypothermia because his entire encampment pooled all of those together,” she said. “He had fallen in the mud and all they saw was his shoes sticking up. They got 20 to 30 HotHands and covered him in it until AMR got there.” 
Belonging to a group can help in other ways, too, Moore said. Some people who don’t want to go to shelters will pool funds they have made from panhandling to buy motel rooms. But for that to work, at least one person in the group must have identification — leading to the sometimes fatal resort of staying outside. 
“The wet and the cold is what will kill them,” she said. 
It’s not just the ice that can lead to death. The winter months in Jackson are known as “fire season,” due to the number of homes — abandoned or otherwise – that ignite, said Jeremiah Howard, the Hinds County coroner who also works as a volunteer firefighter in the tiny town of Pocahontas. 
The city of Jackson will sometimes see multiple fires in one night, Howard said. One cause of the repeated blazes: Homeless people seeking shelter inside abandoned houses and lighting fires to stay warm. 
Moore said she’s recently started passing out hand sanitizer to people living in encampments so they can safely start fires, as she’s seen too many people try to light tires to stay warm, then breathe in toxic smoke. 
“They come out looking like they’ve been rolling in soot,” she said. “But they’re trying to survive.”

Another reason for the fire season: Drafty windows and poor insulation that force residents to heat their homes through unsafe methods, such as multiple space heaters or the oven. 
Jill Buckley, Stewpot’s executive director, said the extended freezing temperatures mean a higher likelihood that people will face financial hardship from trying to stay warm.  
“It’s a cascade of events that starts here and now and will take months to recover from,” she said. 
In one scenario, Buckley described a resident’s gas usage going up because they’re relying on the oven to stay warm, leading to a higher bill the next month. 
“Then you have to figure out how to pay your regular bills,” she said. “Or something happens with your plumbing, you can’t afford to get the plumber out, and JXN Water charges you thousands of dollars.” 
Buckely said her coordinators will keep going out to make sure people know they have a place to get warm. 
“They’re making that decision when it’s 54 degrees outside,” she said. “It might be a different decision when it’s 32 degrees outside.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/23191155/Opportunity-House-1.jpg,,,2026-01-24 14:57:03.381904

DHS first claimed both men injured in the incident were inside a van that ICE officers fired at in self-defense, but later said that one of the injured men had already been arrested and was in custody inside an ICE vehicle when he was hurt. The other man was shot twice and is facing two federal criminal charges.
In August, federal immigration agents fired at a family’s vehicle three times in San Bernardino, California.

Surveillance footage from the street does not show agents being struck by the vehicle.
The Saturday shooting comes one day after tens of thousands of people protested ICE in downtown Minneapolis in subzero temperatures.

“If you tamper with my players, I’m going to turn you in. It’s just that simple,” Swinney said during a news conference. “I’m not out to get anybody fired, but there has to be accountability and consequences for this type of behavior and total disregard for the rules.
“If this happened in the NFL, which is an actual league with rules, they would be fined, they would take draft picks, they hit the cap, whatever,” Swinney continued. “This is such a terrible example for young coaches in this profession. … To me, this situation is like having an affair on your honeymoon.”
Ferrelli, a former linebacker at California, entered the transfer portal on Jan. 2 and committed to Clemson four days later. Ferrelli subsequently enrolled, began classes, and began attending meetings and workouts, Swinney said.
Ferrelli reentered the portal on Jan. 22 and committed to Ole Miss.
“You can’t sign with the Browns and practice a week, and then the Dolphins call you and say we’re going to give you a little more money and you say, ‘See ya, boys,’ and go play for the Dolphins. That’s not the real world,” Swinney said.
Ole Miss athletic officials did not respond to Swinney’s allegations when contacted on Friday by The Associated Press.

NCAA vice president of enforcement Jon Duncan said in a statement that the association “will investigate any credible allegations of tampering and expect full cooperation from all involved as required by NCAA rules.”
Swinney alleged that Golding maintained contact with Ferrelli after the linebacker had enrolled at Clemson, even texting, “I know you’re signed, but what is your buyout?”
When Swinney found out about it, he said he initially told Clemson general manager Jordan Sorrells that he wanted to give Golding “some grace” because the Rebels’ coach was newly promoted after Lane Kiffin left for LSU over Thanksgiving weekend.
Swinney asked Sorrells to tell Ole Miss officials “that we know what’s going on, and if he doesn’t cease communication, I’m going to turn him in. I really thought that would be the end of it, but it wasn’t.”
Swinney said Ferrelli’s agent confirmed that Golding had continued reaching out to the player, so Clemson officials asked for copies of the text messages.
“The agent communicated that if we were to add a second year at $1 million to the already agreed-upon deal with Luke, then they would gladly give us whatever we need to turn Ole Miss in,” Swinney said. “Jordan, appropriately, said, ‘No, we’re not doing that.’”
Clemson athletic director Graham Neff said the university’s main reason for making the allegations public was to spur changes to the college football calendar and related rules — or lack thereof — that have contributed to upheaval across the sport.
“The NCAA was surprised a school was willing to come forward as directly and transparently as we were,” Neff said. “We need to look real hard at how we got here, but (also) how to get out of it.”
Neff added that Clemson was exploring its legal options.
“This is not about a linebacker at Clemson,” Swinney added. “I don’t want anyone on our team that doesn’t want to be here.
“It’s about the next kid and about the message being sent if this blatant tampering is allowed to happen without any consequences.”
Swinney also called the January transfer portal window “stupid,” saying it causes “flat-out extortion in some cases” because players and schools are making major decisions during “such a short period of time, right in the middle of when people are trying to play bowl games, playoff games, et cetera.”
If the system is not reformed, Swinney warned, there will be unintended consequences for players who transfer among multiple schools while chasing short-term financial payouts — particularly if they don’t make it to the NFL.
“We’re going to have some screwed-up 30-year-olds … that have no degrees, that have spent their money, that can’t play football anymore and aren’t connected to anything,” Swinney said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/24111155/AP25361755369011.jpg,,,2026-01-24 12:57:15.130108

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)Judges in South Dakota routinely order people charged with alcohol or drug offenses to get chemical dependency evaluations or sign up for drug treatment programs as a condition of pretrial release from custody.
In practice, those orders have long functioned more like suggestions in most counties.
“Nobody follows up on that,” South Dakota Supreme Court Chief Justice Steven Jensen told the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee on Friday at the Capitol in Pierre. “We don’t have anybody doing that, because we’re not doing pretrial probation.”
That’s about to change in South Dakota’s second most populous county, Jensen told lawmakers earlier this year.
The chief justice told the committee that the pretrial supervision pilot program in Pennington County will use a $385,000 grant from the MacArthur Foundation to build a base-level of supervision for people who’ve yet to be tried in court. Probation officers will follow up with people released on bond to notify them of upcoming court dates. 
Chief justice outlines roadmap to more services for drug offenders, young people and probationers

One piece of the Pennington County program is already in place in Minnehaha County, and has been since 2018.
In all counties outside of Minnehaha, Jensen said, judges set bond conditions without seeing a criminal or drug abuse history for the person asking for pretrial release. 
Under the pilot program, Pennington County court staff will gather that information and share it with judges upfront, as staffers in Minnehaha County already do.
The Unified Judicial System isn’t asking for any extra money from lawmakers this year for the pilot program, as Jensen said existing employees should be able to shoulder the workload. He also said, however, that the pilot program could point the way to a future expansion of pretrial services.
Jensen is asking lawmakers to take an action without a price tag, however. House Bill 1015 would authorize the state court system to offer probation-like services to people who’ve yet to be convicted. The House Judiciary Committee voted 10-3 on Wednesday to send that bill to the full House of Representatives.
Committee members commended court system officials for exploring ways to refine bond condition decisions and reduce problems with missed court appearances. Some members expressed concerns about ongoing funding when the grant money runs out. 
One opponent, St. Onge Republican Rep. Mary Fitzgerald, said she couldn’t support a bill that put more responsibilities on overworked court service officers.
“How in the world do you expect them to do this in Pennington County without hiring?” she said Wednesday.
Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, said he understands concerns about ongoing funding, but that he supports the program. The issues created by a lack of pretrial services for people at risk of missing court or misbehaving are too serious to ignore, he argued.
“I’m of the mindset that doing something is mandatory, and doing something like this is way better than doing nothing,” Hughes said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden has been getting some flak recently from his Republican primary election opponents for using his office to bolster his reelection campaign. It will be interesting to see, should any of them displace Rhoden, if they use the office any differently. 
At the top of the opponent complaint list is the governor’s penchant for roaming the state, handing out checks from the Future Fund. So far he has hit Aberdeen, Watertown and Brookings, offering payments to bolster economic development.
One of Rhoden’s opponents, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, questioned the timing of the $1 million grant to Aberdeen’s two new business parks. In a South Dakota Searchlight story, Doeden said Rhoden “uses taxpayer money the same way career politicians have been using taxpayer dollars for decades — largely for his own benefit.”
It’s easy to see Rhoden’s largesse in Aberdeen as a political jab at the wealthy Doeden, as though the governor is saying “you’re not the only one in this race with some money to throw around.” 
Governor hits the road to award more state grants; opponents call it campaigning

In the same story, Rhoden’s other opponents also offered criticism of the timing of the Future Fund grants. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson said it was concerning when award announcements turned into campaign rallies and state House Speaker Jon Hansen said that the Future Fund was funding Rhoden’s political future. Rhoden countered by saying he was just doing his job. 
Created in 1987 at the request of Gov. George Mickelson, the Future Fund was designed to allow a governor to respond with funding quickly for an economic development opportunity. Gov. Kristi Noem’s use of the fund raised some eyebrows. She used it to pay for a series of commercials starring herself, a shooting range lawmakers had refused to pay for, a fireworks show and a rodeo. Basically, she used the Future Fund to pay for items that were too expensive for her to put on her state credit card. 
Part of the Noem legacy that Rhoden is left to deal with is Senate Bill 1, a measure that would take some control of the Future Fund away from the governor and give it to the Board of Economic Development. As much as his opponents don’t like the timing of Rhoden’s Future Fund awards, they may be secretly rooting for SB 1 to fail, ensuring their own ability to make grants and influence people. A vote on the bill ended in a tie in the Senate State Affairs Committee. It’s likely to be resurrected in some form this session. 
A case can be made for saying Rhoden began using the office to bolster his political career as soon as Noem left for a life of leading the masked marauders in the Department of Homeland Security. It’s likely the scent of her perfume still lingered in the governor’s office when Rhoden hit on the idea to embark on an Open for Opportunity tour of the state. The taxpayer-funded series of events was designed to introduce the state to its new governor and the new governor to business leaders and potential donors. 
Well-timed economic development grants and taxpayer-funded travel aren’t the only benefits of incumbency. Rhoden also inherited a well-tuned communications machine that cranks out news releases aplenty. These releases rarely, if ever, include bad news. It’s usually a glowing report on state finances, grant announcements, task force recommendations, board appointments — with the appointee expressing what a pleasure it will be to work with the governor, pleas for Congress to do better and announcements about Rhoden’s Open for Opportunity itinerary.


Let us know what you think...


 

In among those news releases is a weekly column from Rhoden. Anyone with experience in public relations knows that it’s unlikely the governor actually writes the columns. Still, they serve as inexpensive political advertising when picked up by the state’s newspapers. His pre-session column assured voters that he would be working hard for them with the Legislature. 
It would be easy for Rhoden to quell this particular line of attack from his opponents. He could stay in the Capitol, emerging only for actual campaign events. He could put away the Future Fund checkbook, or if there’s a community in need, send an economic development minion to hand over the grant. That would keep the presentations from having the same air as a campaign event. He could cut back on the news releases and, out of fairness to his opponents, suspend his weekly column until he’s no longer a candidate for office. 
It’s unlikely he’ll do any of those things. Using the perks of the office for his benefit is what happens when a politician runs for a job he already has. 
As for the other Republicans running for governor, they may want to choose something else to complain about. By harping on the notion that Rhoden is using his office for political gain, they run the risk of reminding voters that he’s the governor and they’re not.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7788-scaled-e1769266672955-1024x727.jpg,,,2026-01-24 10:57:39.379165

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2026/01/childrens-hospital-transgender-patients-california/,Families sued to block the Justice Department's subpoena for records of young transgender patients. The agency agreed to drop its request through 2029.,"In summary
Families sued to block the Justice Department’s subpoena for records of young transgender patients. The agency agreed to drop its request through 2029.


Transgender patients of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles secured a win this week after the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to end its efforts to obtain personal and medical information of more than 3,000 young patients. 
Last summer, the federal Justice Department announced that it sent subpoenas to more than 20 medical providers that offered gender-affirming care for minors. At the time, the department said it was doing so to investigate “healthcare fraud” and “false statements.”
Seven families whose children have received gender-affirming services at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles sued in November to quash the subpoena to protect their information. 
The department never provided evidence of fraud, said Khadijah Silver, director of Gender Justice & Health Equity at Lawyers for Good Government, one of the firms representing families in the class action lawsuit. The hospital did not not turn over the requested documents. 
“It was basically a fishing expedition,” Silver said. “Without any probable cause, they did not have the authority to be seeking medical information.” 
The DOJ and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles did not immediately return requests for comment.
The department subpoena demanded the hospital provide a large range of documents, including patient intake forms, insurance claims and “documents sufficient to identify each patient (by name, date of birth, social security number, address, and parent/guardian information) who was prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy,” court documents show.
Under the agreement, filed in federal court Thursday, the Justice Department will withdraw requests for documents that identified patients or their families through 2029. 
Attorneys representing patients and their families have moved to dismiss the case.
“This is one piece of a large, very important puzzle, but it does allow our clients to hold on to their basic legal right to medical privacy,” Silver said. 
The settlement unfolded the same week that a judge in Baltimore rejected the Trump administration’s request to subpoena the same information from Children’s National Hospital in Washington D.C.  
The subpoena is not the only federal action that has targeted transgender patients and their providers.
Last year, the Trump administration issued an executive order that threatened to pull federal funding from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care. Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the summer seeking to block the order. 
The federal government has also issued orders that recognize only two biological sexes and prevent transgender girls and women from participating in women’s sports. A third order threatens federal funds for schools that support transgender youth.
After federal actions escalated, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles closed the doors to its Center for Transyouth Health and Development last July, leaving about 3,000 young patients in limbo. Other providers in the state have also scaled back gender-affirming services. 
“The shutdown came despite efforts my office took over recent months to assure (Children’s Hospital Los Angeles) that they were protected and required to provide gender-affirming care,” Bonta said at the time.

The 1967 bombing of the Beth Israel Congregation was far from a solitary act. The attack on Mississippi’s oldest synagogue came as part of a reign of terror by the nation’s most notorious Ku Klux Klan.
The newest attack on the house of worship, which happened this month, shows that “history repeats itself,” said Lindsay Baach Friedmann, South Central regional director for the Anti-Defamation League. “The question is not whether we are teaching the next generation, but what are we teaching them?”
The FBI has charged Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, of Madison, with burning the synagogue in the predawn hours of Jan. 10. According to federal court documents, Pittman referred to it as “the synagogue of Satan” — a term used by followers of Christian Identity, a white supremacist religion that teaches that Adam and Eve were white, that non-whites are “mud people” and that Jews are the offspring of Satan.


What makes the latest attack scary is “there are a lot more of him out there,” said Rabbi Valerie Cohen, who served Beth Israel from 2003 to 2014.
During the Civil Rights era, the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan became the most violent white supremacist organization in the U.S., responsible for at least 10 killings in Mississippi. They were also responsible for dozens of church bombings as well as the bombings of the homes of civil rights and Jewish leaders.

The White Knights rose to the fore after the University of Mississippi enrolled its first Black student in 1962. By 1964, the Klan group boasted more than 90,000 members.
When news came in early 1964 that civil rights workers planned to “invade” Mississippi that summer, Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers told his Klansmen, “The events which will occur in Mississippi this summer may well determine the fate of Christianity for centuries to come.”
He urged them to get their guns ready.
“When the black waves hit our communities, we must remain calm and think in terms of our individual enemies rather than our mass enemy,” he told them. “We must roll with the mass punch which they will deliver in the streets during the day, and we must counterattack the individual leaders at night.”
Then he advised them, “Any personal attacks on the enemy should be carefully planned to include only the leaders and prime white collaborators of the enemy forces.”
On the first day of summer 1964, Klansmen killed three young civil rights workers, who were investigating the Klan’s burning of a Black church in Neshoba County. A deputy jailed Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman and released them into the hands of waiting Klansmen, who shot them to death and hid their bodies in an earthen dam.
Forty-four days later, FBI agents discovered the buried bodies. By killing the trio, the White Knights meant to send a message not just to those in the movement, but across the nation, about who held power in Mississippi, who could do as they pleased and who needed to live in fear.

Between June and October 1964, Mississippi saw the bombings of at least 48 Black churches, homes and “freedom houses,” according to records kept by the Council of Federated Organizations, an umbrella group for civil rights organizations.
That same year, the White Knights began to regard Jews as their major enemies, just as the Klan had done in the 1920s. Klansmen embraced the views of Christian Identity, which teaches that white people are the true Israelites and that Jews are imposters.
On Sept. 18, 1967, the White Knights bombed the Beth Israel synagogue, the opening salvo of the White Knights’ campaign against the Jews.
A month later, the White Knights suffered their biggest setback when a U.S. District Court jury convicted seven, including Bowers, on federal conspiracy charges for the 1964 killings of the three civil rights workers. They received prison time up to 10 years, but they initially remained free on appeal bonds.
The violence continued.
On Nov. 15, 1967, the White Knights bombed the home of the Rev. Allen Johnson, a Black Methodist member and NAACP leader in Laurel, where Bowers lived. Four nights later, a bomb ripped through the home of civil rights activist Bob Kochtitzky in Jackson.
Two days before Thanksgiving, the White Knights bombed the home of Rabbi Perry Nussbaum, leader of the Beth Israel congregation in Jackson.

More attacks followed in 1968, including the bombings of Black churches and a synagogue in Meridian.
After Meridian police determined that Klan bomber Thomas Tarrants was behind the synagogue bombing and others, a shootout took place between him and officers. He somehow survived, but his companion, Kathy Ainsworth, was killed.
After the death, Bowers wrote to an officer involved in the shootout and questioned why he would protect the Jews, calling them “the synagogue of Satan.”
Tarrants went to prison for the bombing. While there, he underwent a religious conversion that he later wrote about in his book, “Consumed by Hate, Redeemed by Love.”
Tarrants, now president emeritus of the C.S. Lewis Institute, became friends with the Rev. John Perkins of Jackson, who was beaten in jail by law enforcement for his involvement in the civil rights movement.

The latest burning of Beth Israel “is not just an attack on a building — it is an assault on human dignity, on faith and on the sacred truth that every person is made in the image of God,” said Elizabeth Perkins, co-president of The John & Vera Mae Perkins Foundation.
“My father has always said that reconciliation is born where truth and love meet,” she said. “That belief still stands. We grieve with Beth Israel. We stand with Beth Israel. And we commit ourselves again to the long, holy work of justice, reconciliation, and peace. Hate will not have the last word. Love will.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12154649/DSC01168.jpg,,,2026-01-24 07:56:30.711528

All four said they regretted ending their pregnancies.
The state rested its case Friday after bringing to the stand a panel of witnesses who argued abortion is harmful to women and should be governed by strict regulations. It’s the same argument Missouri’s anti-abortion movement continues to make the focus of its campaign to ban the procedure.
With the trial scheduled to end Monday, the state capitalized on emotional testimony in an attempt to prove its case that these regulations, which have crippled Planned Parenthood’s ability to perform abortions, are necessary safeguards. 
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri, which sued to strike down the laws under the state’s new voter-approved reproductive rights amendment, have argued the laws are discriminatory and unconstitutional because they have prevented tens of thousands of Missouri women over the past several years from accessing abortion without crossing state lines.
State attorneys leaned on the stories of women who sought abortions decades earlier at Missouri Planned Parenthood clinics, before the procedure, its providers and its clinics were more heavily regulated. The four described impersonal visits and overcrowded dark rooms with heavy, sad atmospheres where women were often crying.
“The abortionist came in from a side door,” testified Stephanie Jacobson, using an anti-abortion pejorative for the doctor, about the first abortion she had when she was 16 in 1978. “It was very excruciating. I must have been squirming, because they kept saying, ‘Lay still.’”
After her second abortion in 1982, this time at a local hospital, Jacobson said she miscarried another pregnancy and attributed it to her abortions. She went on to give birth to five children.
But until about nine years ago, when Jacobson said she completed an abortion recovery counseling program, she said she was depressed, angry and had thoughts of harming herself because of the choice she’d made.
The requirement that Missouri’s 26-page informed consent booklet be given to every woman seeking an abortion is one of the challenged laws in the case. While it does mention that a provider must inform the patient of “possible adverse psychological effects associated with the abortion,” it does not go into any further detail about those effects or provide any basis for the statement.
Missouri regulator says abortion clinics faced heightened scrutiny unrelated to safety

Marilyn Cox, of Hillsboro, said she was going through a divorce in 1980 when she was seeing another man and got pregnant. For financial reasons and because she “didn’t want to face” her dad, she had an abortion. 
Cox said the Planned Parenthood she went to did not properly inform her of the development of the fetus in the womb at eight weeks. She testified that she would not have gone through with the abortion if she knew that, or if she had seen it on an ultrasound.
After that, she described two near-suicide attempts, one that occurred about a year after the abortion.
“I hated my guts,” she testified.
Linda Raymond took the stand on Tuesday and spoke about the effects of her abortion in 1976, saying she had depression, anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks, and is still on an anti-depressant today. Like Jacobson, she said she found a “post-abortive” counselor to help her through it.
And Crystal Lane had an abortion in 2009, during a divorce when she was dating someone else. Lane said she didn’t want to bring more children into a volatile family situation, as she already had two at home.
“No one at the (Planned Parenthood) clinic coerced me, but I wasn’t told how it would affect me,” Lane said.
Lane said she’d had some substance abuse issues before the abortion, and later became addicted to methamphetamine. She said it wasn’t until she went through a program focused on healing from abortion that she could process the trauma. The program encouraged her to name the fetus she aborted, and she now has the name “Starling” tattooed above her right eyebrow.
During cross-examination of the witnesses, attorneys for Planned Parenthood pointed out that three of the four women testified they had been abused by someone close to them. Raymond said her mother physically abused her, Lane said her ex-husband and father were abusive and Cox said her previous marriage was abusive.
Many studies show women who experience intimate partner violence are at increased risk for developing mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse disorders.
Attorneys for Planned Parenthood affiliates and the ACLU of Missouri repeatedly challenged the relevance and expertise of the state’s witnesses on scientific and relevancy grounds, leading to drawn-out exchanges that eventually drove Deputy Solicitor General Peter Donohue to accuse the other side of purposely doing it to “run out the clock.”
But the witnesses still provided plenty of testimony, despite the objections.
An Ohio nurse practitioner named Maureen Curley testified that although she hadn’t referred anyone for an abortion in 20 years, her counseling of patients who had abortions led her to believe that motherhood is protective, and giving birth is “psychologically safer” than abortion. 
She said even in a case like the 10-year-old girl in Ohio who was pregnant as a result of incest and had to travel to Indiana for an abortion, giving birth would be more protective from a mental health standpoint.
Abortion safety takes center stage as Missouri trial enters second week

St. Louis Dr. Andrew Steele, an OB-GYN who largely performs pelvic-related surgeries, said he’s seen four cases of abortion complications between 2009 and 2023. And one California doctor who had performed a different type of abortions than today’s practice between 1987 and 1994 was largely excluded from testifying after the plaintiffs objected.
Plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought to exclude the testimony of Priscilla Coleman, a retired professor of human development and family studies who frequently writes and testifies against abortion. Coleman’s papers, some of which have linked abortion to increased risks of mental health problems, have faced criticism and even retraction.
On cross examination, attorneys for Planned Parenthood tried to accuse Coleman of cherry picking data points and studies that supported her anti-abortion views. Coleman provided an expert report in the case and told the court she had read each of the 280 papers she cited in that document. But she acknowledged she removed one of her citations of a study published only in Turkish, which she does not speak, after it was pointed out by plaintiffs. 
Coleman testified she believed abortion should be illegal in almost all cases, including rape.
She acknowledged that the American Psychological Association, the National Academy of Sciences and the United Kingdom’s Royal College of Psychiatrists have all concluded that scientific literature shows no association between abortion and adverse mental health, but said scientists were breaching ethics to advance abortion rights.
“I believe there’s an effort to distort the literature,” she said. 
A temporary injunction blocked most of Missori’s abortion regulations pending trial.  Until a ruling is made, the Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis continue offering appointments for procedural abortions. Medication abortion remains unavailable.

[…]","The Missouri Capitol Building in Jefferson City (Getty Images).January is National Mentoring Month, a time often marked by good intentions and well-meaning reminders to “give back.” But mentoring is not a box to check or a seasonal act of generosity.
In Missouri—at a time when leadership pipelines are strained, women continue to exit the workforce, and civic trust feels fragile—mentoring is essential infrastructure.
I have spent much of my career mentoring women leaders across Missouri: women balancing careers and caregiving, women stepping into leadership for the first time, women returning after a setback, and women wondering whether the table they worked so hard to reach truly has a seat for them. Through my work with the Greater Missouri Leadership Foundation (Greater MO), I have seen again and again that mentoring is not about advice alone. It is about belief, access, accountability—and support that helps women soar.
That support matters more than ever. According to the Women in the Workplace study from McKinsey & Co. and LeanIn.Org, one of the biggest drivers of women’s ability to advance in their careers is the level of career support they receive. But women still receive less of that support, particularly early and later in their careers, which can limit their professional growth. It also robs our economy of the benefits of their full potential.
At Greater MO, our mission is to strengthen Missouri by preparing women for civic, community, and organizational leadership. That work is grounded in a simple but powerful truth: leadership does not develop in isolation. It develops in relationship, and all of us have a role to play.
When women are supported and mentored well, they stay engaged, pursue promotions, run for boards, step into public service, and remain connected to their communities. When they are not, we see the opposite: talent loss, disengagement, and leadership gaps that ripple across sectors. Mentoring is how we build a sustainable pipeline of leaders who are prepared not only to lead organizations, but to steward communities.
But despite the overwhelming evidence of the importance of mentorship to our workplaces and our economy, mentorship remains too scarce. Research shows that women are 24% less likely than men to get advice from senior leaders, and 62% of women of color say the lack of an influential mentor holds them back. And while the vast majority of Fortune 500 companies offer mentorship programs, uptake is a challenge—with less than a quarter of employees taking advantage of the programs available to them.
We can do better.
National Mentoring Month is an invitation—to individuals, organizations, and communities—to take mentoring seriously. Not as a program, but as practice. Not as charity, but as strategy.
If you are further along in your career, consider who is watching your path and wondering if theirs is possible. If you are earlier in your journey, seek out those who ask thoughtful questions and honor your full life, not just your résumé. And if you lead an organization, ask whether mentoring and structured support systems are embedded into your culture—or left to chance.
Mentoring does not require perfection or decades of experience—only presence, curiosity, and a willingness to share both lessons learned and lessons still unfolding. In fact, research shows peer mentorship leads to longer-lasting relationships and is just as effective as traditional mentorship.
One of the most meaningful mentoring relationships in my own life came at a moment when I did not yet have the language for what I needed. My mentor did not hand me a blueprint. Instead, she asked better questions: What do you want your life to look like? What are you optimizing for right now? What does “enough” look like in this season?
Those questions stayed with me. They shaped how I lead, how I mentor, and how I encourage others to define success on their own terms—not as perfection, but as progress with intention.
The future of leadership in Missouri will not be built by accident. It will be built through relationships, intention, unwavering support, and the quiet, powerful work of mentoring—one conversation, one goal, one rising leader at a time.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-512285042-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 06:57:33.680245

You know the ones—ominous music, grainy photos, and a narrator who sounds like they gargle gravel for a living. We’ve all seen them. We’ve all heard them. And at this point, we’re anesthetized. Political Novocaine.
Enough.
Montana deserves better than campaigns that treat voters like raccoons rummaging through ideological trash cans. We deserve ideas, not insults. Debates, not drive-by smear jobs. Sunlight, not sludge.
And that brings us—unavoidably—to incumbent Sen. Steve Daines.
Rather than showing up in Montana for public town halls, rather than standing in front of voters and answering unscripted questions, Daines has perfected a different approach – absence. He won’t hold a public town hall. He won’t face constituents. Instead, Montanans get something else entirely—well-financed, vicious attack ads, launched long before an election and even before a candidate has formally declared.
That’s offensive.
If you won’t show up, don’t send a hit piece in your place. Montana is not a focus group. Democracy is not a mailer campaign. And an attack ad is not a substitute for showing your face and answering hard questions.
Daines should show up. Sending a slick, cynical attack ad instead doesn’t cut it.
Now let’s be honest about what just happened—because it tells us everything we need to know.
University of Montana President Seth Bodnar resigns his position, and before he even announces a campaign, before he files for office, before he says a word about running, Republicans launch a vicious attack ad.
Day. One.
That’s not confidence. That’s fear.
You don’t unload the attack ads that early unless you’re scared stiff.
No welcome. No thanks for service. No “let’s debate the issues.” Just straight into the gutter, guns blazing, facts optional. Misleading claims. Flat-out untruths. The political equivalent of throwing a punch before the bell rings.
Shame on them.
This is exactly why Bodnar is such a compelling candidate. The very speed and savagery of the attacks are the tell. When the ideas are weak, the attacks get loud. When the record can’t compete, the mud comes out early.
Here’s a radical thought: What if candidates held 56 debates across Montana? Fifty-six. One for every county. Let voters ask questions. Let candidates explain who they are, what they’ve done, and what they actually plan to do—rather than explaining why their opponent is apparently the third cousin of Satan.
Crazy, right?
Attack ads don’t persuade; they poison. No one watches one and says, “Wow, that really enriched my understanding of public policy.” They say, “I hate all of you now.” These ads ruin television, make public service unattractive, and convince good people that running for office isn’t worth the personal abuse.
Attack ads are why decent people stay home and cable news stays rich.
This isn’t the Montana way. Or at least, it didn’t used to be.
Which brings me back to Bodnar.
Under his leadership, UM stretched to new heights: roughly $300 million in infrastructure improvements—much donor-funded; R-1 research status (a very big deal); rising enrollment; better retention. He took on a tough job and exceeded expectations.
Now, according to reports, Bodnar may run for the U.S. Senate—as an independent. And suddenly the political establishment loses its mind.
Let’s pause on something important: Bodnar is a real public servant. Full stop.
First in his class at West Point. Rhodes Scholar. Truman Scholar. Green Beret. Multiple combat deployments. Lieutenant Colonel in the Montana National Guard—still serving. Leadership under fire isn’t theoretical for him; it’s lived.
This guy didn’t read about leadership—he graded it.
He taught economics at West Point. He served as a senior executive at General Electric. He knows how large, complicated systems work—and how to fix them.
So what do the attack ads do? They lie.
They claim Bodnar raised tuition by 30%. False. Tuition is set by the Board of Regents, appointed by Gov. Gianforte. If you’re angry, aim accordingly.
What Bodnar actually did was create the Grizzly Promise: Students from families earning $50,000 or less attend UM tuition-free—about a quarter of undergraduates. The average Montana student paid around $3,000 a year in tuition. That’s not an increase. That’s a lifeline.
They claim he’s anti-woman. Also false. His record includes hiring and promoting accomplished women across campus leadership—law, business, conservation and beyond.
Montana deserves truth—not attack-ad garbage. Not politics as a blood sport. Not tribal stupidity served with gusto. 
Public service should not require body armor.
This is a call for higher integrity and higher discourse—from every party and every candidate. Tell us your vision. Tell us your ideas. Tell us how you’ll make Montana stronger.
And if you’re already in office, show up. Face the people you represent.
Just spare us the lies, the fear-mongering, and the political junk food.
Montana deserves better. And we should demand it—loudly.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bodnar-1024x885.jpg,,,2026-01-24 06:57:33.680245

Megan Degenfelder, Wyoming's top education official, proclaimed a desire to someday be president back in high school. Today, she’s running to become the state’s second female governor, the first in a century.
The post Degenfelder sets sights on long-held ambition to lead Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—Liz Masterson has been a high school journalism teacher long enough that some of her current students have parents who also took her classes. 
A lot of things have changed in the course of the almost two decades since Masterson began her career. But she still remembers Megan Degenfelder’s drive, especially compared to other students.  
“She said she wanted to be the first woman to be president of the United States,” Masterson recalled. 
Upon graduation, Degenfelder forged a path she now says sets her apart from other Republicans in the race to be Wyoming’s next governor — and potentially the first woman to hold the office since Nellie Tayloe Ross a century ago.
Degenfelder’s resume looks like one drawn up to check every box for an ideal Wyoming politician. She attended the University of Wyoming and then studied economics in Beijing, where she wrote a master’s thesis on coal and natural gas. She then spent about a decade in the energy industry. She also worked for U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis in D.C. and served under former Superintendent Jillian Balow in Cheyenne. In 2022, when voters elected Degenfelder as superintendent of public instruction, she became one of the youngest statewide officials in Wyoming history. 
“Now here we are,” Masterson told WyoFile at a Tuesday night campaign event in Degenfelder’s hometown. 
In a capacious, modern outbuilding dubbed “The Barn” by its affluent owners, Tiffany and Blake Gamble, on the Oil City’s eastern outskirts, dozens of Degenfelder’s family members, friends and supporters gathered. 
Wearing a red jacket and skirt with a turquoise squash blossom necklace, Degenfelder moved easily from one conversation to another, shaking hands, laughing and smiling. Her long blonde waves curled away from her face.

The crowd leaned younger, closer to Degenfelder’s age of 37, and was a contrast to the typical older turnout at GOP events in Wyoming. A gaggle of children ran around in red campaign T-shirts while parents and other attendees munched on Domino’s pizza. For many of those in the room, Degenfelder’s bid for governor felt both inevitable and thrilling. 
“I’m fired up,” Tiffany Gamble told WyoFile before her opening remarks. 
Standing in the truck bed of a blue, cherry-condition, vintage Ford, Gamble spoke into a microphone about her time with Degenfelder at Natrona County High School. Together they served as student body president and vice president. 
“Of course, Megan, she was president,” Gamble said. But the evening was not strictly about friendship, she added.
“We have a clear choice to make,” she said. “Do we drift toward middle-of-the-road politics, trying to please everyone, borrowing liberal ideas that don’t fit who we are? Or, do we stand firm in our conservative values?”
“I can tell you, my family is choosing the latter,” Gamble said. 
As superintendent, Degenfelder has not shied away from aligning with the right flank of the party. She backed legislation to authorize charter schools and a voucher program to make public funds available for private tuition. (The latter remains in limbo after it was challenged in court as unconstitutional.) She also supported legislation limiting transgender students’ participation in school sports and bathroom accessibility, and cheered the Trump administration’s dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education. 
Still, the Wyoming Republican Party has not always backed Degenfelder. 
In 2022, when Balow resigned from her superintendent post to take a job in Virginia, the party voted to nominate three other finalists over Degenfelder, even though she had served in a key leadership position at the state’s education department. More recently, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican lawmakers that’s gained a significant foothold in the party, has been mum about her gubernatorial bid while weighing in on other statewide races, and taking aim at Degenfelder’s most evenly matched opponent, Sen. Eric Barlow of Gillette. 
But Degenfelder has something now she didn’t have in years past. This time, the most powerful person in the country is backing her campaign. Four days before she announced her plans, President Donald Trump gave his endorsement. 
“Should she decide to enter this Race, ‘MAGA’ Megan Degenfelder has my Complete and Total Endorsement,” Trump posted online. “RUN, MEGAN, RUN!”
Although Degenfelder defeated Trump-endorsed incumbent candidate Brian Schroeder in 2022, Trump’s endorsement counts for a lot in Wyoming, where 75% of voters supported him in 2024. Her campaign Facebook page includes a photo of him next to an image of her. 
Bryan Dugas, Degenfelder’s husband of about a decade, introduced her Tuesday night. 
“I’m a better Christian, a better husband, better physician, a better man because of Megan,” Dugas said. “And we have the opportunity to support her and her aspiration to better this entire state, its people and its future.”

After Degenfelder stepped into the truck bed, she began by thanking her hometown supporters and her mom, Cheryl, who died in 2024. 
“She hated politics, but she’s with us, and I’m very grateful for that,” Degenfelder said. 
From there, Degenfelder asked the crowd to go back in time with her to the mid-1800s, “when a group of people on the East Coast of the United States of America heard about the promise of a better life out west.”
She described their journey as the greatest risk of their lives. And she spoke about her own family, who ultimately wound up west of Casper and would come to grow a life from half a section of land to over 8,000 acres. 
“They arrived at this place after this journey — if they survived — and they look around and nothing’s here,” Degenfelder said. 
There were, of course, people here. She did not mention the Indigenous people who inhabited the land going back at least 12,000 years, or the Plains Indians, whose pragmatic routes over mountain passes, along river corridors and across sagebrush basins were followed by early Euro-American immigrants and explorers. 
When her ancestors and other settlers arrived, Degenfelder said, “they started building something bigger than themselves. That’s who we are as Wyomingites.” 
Today people expect elected leaders to “get out of the way,” she said, “but to fight hard as hell for Wyoming when it matters most.”
The fight at Wyoming’s doorstep, as described by Degenfelder, includes: coastal elites and celebrities “trying to push a climate agenda” that hurts the state’s jobs and revenue, transgender athletes and “radical activists that are literally trying to redefine genders of children,” a lack of respect for the rule of law and for citizenship, assaults on ICE agents and law enforcement officers, child care fraud in Minnesota, and New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani “who literally hates everything that we stand for in America.” 
Degenfelder made a vow if elected governor.
“I will protect our conservative values and way of life because our rights, our freedoms, they come from God, not from the government, and they cannot be taken away,” she said.

Many of those supporting Degenfelder’s gubernatorial campaign were by her side in 2022 when she ran for superintendent, including Kayleigh Clark. 
At the event, Clark told WyoFile she recalls working with “a bunch of other moms” to put together Degenfelder’s Casper Parade day float, and sharing an excitement with them about “where we live.”
Clark doesn’t think of herself as a political person, she said, but learned from seeing her parents review the Casper Star-Tribune’s voter guides over the years to be informed about her choices. Clark now has two children and said she wants to be a part of setting up the state for success. 
“Now feels like a different energy,” she said. Tiffany Gamble echoed that, telling WyoFile it feels like a “whole new generation” becoming more interested in politics. 
Gamble recently founded Powder River Prep, a private school in Casper, due to growing concern with “politics brought into the classroom,” she said.
The school is “rooted in conservative values and faith-based principles,” according to its website. Families need more choices, Gamble said, lamenting that her school cannot receive state funding and voicing her appreciation for Degenfelder’s support of school choice. 
As a member of the State Board of Land Commissioners, Degenfelder has opposed Prism Logistics’ development of a gravel mine at the base of Casper Mountain. Even so, Prism’s owner, Kyle True, was there Tuesday to support her campaign.   
“There are bigger issues than my little business,” True said, adding that he’s been impressed with her time in statewide office. 
In an interview with WyoFile at the event, Degenfelder answered questions about recent budget cuts supported by the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee. The panel sent shockwaves around Wyoming when it recommended major cuts to the University of Wyoming, the defunding of Wyoming Public Media and the elimination of the Wyoming Business Council.
“I support that the Joint Appropriations Committee is trying to get people’s attention. They are trying to make sure that people know what government is funding, and really to have that conversation about it,” Degenfelder said when asked about the committee’s proposal to cut roughly 11% of UW’s block grant. 
“Now, do I think that the $40 million cut to the University of Wyoming is the right move right now? No,” she said. “I think we can find where that sweet spot is.”
As a UW graduate, Degenfelder said she wants “the best” for the school, but that “doesn’t mean we just allow runaway spending.” 
Asked about her stance on the committee’s proposal to dismantle the Wyoming Business Council, Degenfelder said the state’s tax structure is at odds with the agency. 
“It’s very difficult for them to be successful,” she said, adding that economic development has a place in Wyoming. 
“But when we talk about economic diversification, it’s incredibly difficult to do,” Degenfelder said.

Lastly, Degenfelder told WyoFile she wants “people to get excited about politics again” and “this new wave of Republican politics in the state of Wyoming and the next generation of leaders and the opportunity that we have.”
Before any of Tuesday night’s speeches, the lights and country music came down. People quieted their conversations and turned their attention to a large projector screen. A glossy campaign video played, casting a red glow over the darkened room.
There was Degenfelder. Coaching the UW women’s rugby team. A rifle slung over her shoulder in a sagebrush sea. Walking her rescue dogs across Laramie’s campus. Atop a horse. At War Memorial Stadium. In a classroom. On Fox News. 
Standing next to her husband at the event in Casper, Degenfelder watched the advertisement. She smiled at what she saw ahead of her.

In his budget proposal released Jan. 15, Gov. Jim Pillen proposed to transfer $40 million, over two years, out of the Nebraska Environmental Trust to finance a new boat marina along with bank stabilization work at Lewis & Clark Lake, and to pay for water conservation projects – two things previously funded using state taxpayer funds.
The $40 million take, which must be approved by the Legislature, would nearly exhaust about $20 million-a-year in state lottery proceeds given to the Trust to dole out annually via competitive grants to enhance and conserve the state’s environment.


Amendment proposed
A proposed constitutional amendment introduced in the Nebraska Legislature would “cut out all of this nonsense, and preserve the (Environmental) Trust,” according to former State Sen. Sandy Scofield, the head of the watchdog group, Friends of the Environmental Trust.
Legislative Resolution 298CA, by State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, would let voters decide whether Trust funds only can be used for “the conservation, enhancement, or restoration of the natural physical and biological environment in Nebraska.”
It also would require state agencies to come up with a 50% match for any funds granted to them by the Trust.


The $32.7 million earmarked for the Lewis & Clark Lake marina and bank improvements would nearly replace the $37.5 million in state tax funds that Pillen set aside for the project last year. The $8 million in Trust funds proposed for the Water Resources Cash Fund mirrors a request made recently by the Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment, which administers the fund.
Neil Sullivan, the governor’s budget director, told the Examiner in an email that using $40 million in Trust funds, rather than state taxpayer funds, “contributes toward delivering both a balanced budget and additional property tax relief.”
But Jon Oberg, a former director of the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services who has sued previously to prevent a transfer of Trust funds, characterized the use of Trust money to replace general taxpayer funds as “classic money laundering” to solve a state budget problem.
Oberg, in an email, said he hopes the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee rejects the Pillen administration’s attempt to “circumvent the Constitution” and “uphold(s) budget integrity.”
He said rejection of the transfer by state lawmakers is preferable to requiring “citizen lawsuits” like the one he and W. Don Nelson, a chief of staff under then Gov. Bob Kerrey, filed in 2020 to block a swap of Trust grants to benefit an ethanol blender pump project.
In May, Oberg threatened – but didn’t file – a lawsuit against the Pillen administration’s proposal to transfer $15 million in Trust funds to sustain a state water conservation fund.

The proposed Trust fund transfer comes as Pillen looks to close a $471 million budget gap by tapping excess state funds (see infobox) and cutting government spending.
The Legislature has, in past years, approved transfers of funds from the Trust into the Water Resources Cash Fund. Local natural resources districts use that fund to finance projects that conserve water and soil. Backers say it fits with the Trust’s stated purpose “to conserve, enhance and restore the natural environments of Nebraska.”
The Environmental Trust currently shows a surplus fund balance of about $20.6 million, but that does not include a recent $6.5 million transfer from the state lottery at the end of December.
The governor’s fund transfer proposals in Legislative Bill 1072 call for $32.7 million for the Lewis & Clark Lake work to be transferred by June 30, which raises the question of whether the Trust will have enough money by then.
Questions also have been raised about whether Trust funds can be used for “recreation” projects, such as a marina for boats at Lewis & Clark Lake.
Sullivan, the state budget official, said recent Trust grants have included a discovery center at Pecan Creek in Lincoln and renovation of Memphis Lake. He said the Lewis & Clark project would improve public access to the lake and include shoreline restoration and enhancement of fish habitat.

“Using these funds to protect the vital groundwater and surface water resources and for lake improvements, access enhancements and shoreline restoration is a clear constitutional and commonsense use of the funds allocated to the Environmental Trust,” he said.
But former State Sen. Sandy Scofield, who heads a watchdog group called Friends of the Environmental Trust, said financing a marina for 350 motorboats and sailboats at Lewis & Clark Lake doesn’t fit with the Trust’s purpose.
“The only habitat it creates is for predatory humans,” Scofield said. “I love the [marina] idea, and I’d certainly support the project, but it’s not even remotely appropriate for the Nebraska Environmental Trust.”
Last year, the governor had a bill introduced to expand the use of Trust funds to include “recreation” and the construction of new cabins at state parks, but the bill didn’t advance.
Scofield added that transferring almost all of the Trust’s funds to one project — at Lewis & Clark Lake — runs contrary to the Trust’s goal of spreading the lottery money to all counties and cities across Nebraska.
“It’s just unfair to everyone in the rest of the state to play games like this,” she said.

Other proposed fund transfers
Besides the $40 million transfer from the Nebraska Environmental Trust, Gov. Jim Pillen’s budget proposes several other fund transfers to the general fund, including:
* $50.7 million from the Water Recreation Enhancement Fund. (It was created by the so-called STARWARS committee, created in 2021 to improve recreational opportunities in the state. The original proposals included new marinas at Lewis & Clark Lake and Lake McConaughy, a new lodge at Niobrara State Park and a huge sandpit lake between Omaha and Lincoln.)
* $18 million from the Economic Recovery Contingency Fund.
* $13.8 million from the Nebraska Capital Construction Fund.
* $7.8 million from the Health and Human Services Cash Fund.
* $6.5 million from the Homeless Shelter Assistance Trust Fund.
* $5.7 million from the Perkins County Canal Project Fund.
* $4.9 million from the Trail Development and Maintenance Fund.
* $2.4 million from the Nebraska Rural Projects Fund.
* $5 million from the Records Management Cash Fund.
* $2.5 million from the Secretary of State Cash Fund.

In an effort to help Idahoans follow major bills, resolutions and memorials through the legislative process, the Idaho Capital Sun will produce a “legislative notebook” at the end of each week to gather information in one place that concerns major happenings in the Legislature and other news relating to state government. To receive the full extent of our reporting in your inbox each day, sign up for our free email newsletter, The Sunrise, on our website at idahocapitalsun.com/subscribe/.
Here is our quick rundown of the major happenings during the second week of the Idaho Legislature’s 2026 session.



 First bill to conform Idaho’s tax code with ‘Big, Beautiful’ bill emerges

One of the biggest puzzles Idaho legislators must solve in the 2026 legislative session – and every session – is the state budget. And one of the biggest pieces to that puzzle this year is how the state will choose to conform with the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act championed by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.
In most legislative sessions, a tax conformity bill is usually one of the first pieces of legislation to be introduced, often with little fan fare or debate. But 2026 is different due to those massive changes to the federal tax code.
On Friday, Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, unveiled a proposal that would adopt nearly all the tax deductions that were included in Trump’s megabill, which Ehlers estimates could cost the state about $155 million in lost tax revenue each year that the deductions are in effect.
Idaho Legislature’s budget committee adopts more optimistic revenue forecast

“This is a much bigger bill this year,” he said before the House Revenue and Taxation Committee.
There are about 39 tax code changes from the massive federal tax and spending bill — such as no taxes on a worker’s tips, no taxes on some workers’ overtime, and various business deductions — most of which have financial implications for the state.
The timing of these tax changes matter, and there are different ideas from elected officials on when Idaho should conform with the federal law.
Ehlers estimated the changes will cost $155 million annually, which is the same as what the governor projected in his budget proposal. However, Gov. Brad Little’s proposed budget assumed the tax changes would take place starting in the next fiscal year. Ehlers’ proposal would have the budget reductions hit in the current fiscal year.
If the state adopts the changes for the current 2026 fiscal year, that could put additional strain on the Idaho State Tax Commission as it rolls into the busiest part of tax season. It may also lead to more Idahoans having to file amended tax returns.

The issue becomes even more complicated because some of the definitions states must use to apply to their own taxes from the “Big, Beautiful” bill have not yet been released by the federal government. That means Idaho lawmakers don’t have a clear estimate on how much conforming to the GOP megabill will actually cost as they set the state budgets for all agencies and departments.
Idaho officials have cited estimates on the cost of adopting all the tax changes that ranged from $115 million to around $400 million, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Asked why he chose to use the retroactive date, Ehlers noted that some of the changes expire in 2028, such as the no taxes on tips or overtime. 
“If we don’t allow them to take it in 2025, then they’re missing one of the four years,” Ehlers said in an interview. “So that’s like 25% of the benefit; they’re only going to take it for the three years. So, we wanted to make sure that they got the full four years of the One Big Beautiful Bill.”
 House committee narrowly rejects introducing bill that would have eliminated Idaho’s Hispanic commission

After a tie vote in the House State Affairs Committee on Thursday, a draft bill that would have eliminated the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs was not introduced for further consideration. 
House committee rejects bill to eliminate Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs

Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, presented a draft bill that would have repealed any mention of the commission from state code, eliminating it completely by July 1. Scott served on the Legislature’s interim DOGE committee, named after the federal (and now defunct) Department of Government Efficiency, which was tasked with finding bloat in state government programs and budgets to cut.
Some members of the state DOGE committee said the commission represents “DEI,” which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion, and voted to recommend its elimination last year.
The governor’s proposed budget for the commission is $288,500 in state general funds, according to the state legislative budget book.
 Legislation of interest during the first week of the 2025 session

House Resolution 20: Sponsored by Rep. Monica Church, D-Boise, the resolution condemns political violence, honors the lives of those killed or injured, and calls on all Idahoans to reject all forms of such violence. It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
House Bill 489: Sponsored by Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, the bill adds to existing law to prohibit the use of a mask or disguise during a criminal offense. It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
House Bill  491: Sponsored by Rep. Marco Erickson, the bill amends Idaho’s existing Good Samaritan law to protect people who give aid to an individual that is experiencing a mental health or suicidal crisis. The bill prevents a civil lawsuit from being filed against someone who stops at the scene of an emergency and, “in good faith,” tries to provide assistance, unless they are found to be “grossly negligent.” It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
House Bill 493: Sponsored by Rep. Britt Raybould, R-Rexburg, the bill would make it a felony on a first offense for anyone 21 years or older to solicit commercial sexual activity. Idaho’s current law provides for charging a misdemeanor for the first offense, followed by a felony for the second offense. It is on the House’s third reading calendar and may be taken up in the coming days of the session.
 What to expect next week at the Idaho Legislature

Quick note: Many committees, especially at the beginning of the session, have agenda items known as an RS (which stands for routing slip). That’s legislative talk for “draft legislation.” An RS is not a public record until a committee votes to introduce the bill. Many of those agenda items are only listed by subject matter, so it’s impossible to ascertain what the RS is specifically about, other than the few words used to describe the RS until the introductory hearing takes place.
IDAHO SENATE
Senate Resources and Environment Committee
1:30 p.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold introductory hearings on an RS relating to “Consolidation of the Soil and Water Conservation Commission,” and it will consider the gubernatorial appointments of Kenneth Long of Horseshoe Bend and Carl Rey of Boise to the Outfitters and Guides Licensing Board.
Senate Education Committee
3 p.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing on Senate Bill 1225, which would change Idaho law to reduce the public disclosure requirements of finalists for the state’s open public university presidency positions from five finalists down to one sole finalist. The committee is also scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS that would change “Lewis-Clark State College’s name to Lewis-Clark State University throughout Idaho Code.”
IDAHO HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
House Education Committee
9 a.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS relating to “Education funding, disabilities.
House Health and Welfare Committee
9 a.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold seven introductory hearings on RSs relating to “cottage food operations,” “yellow dot program,” “directed blood product transfusions,” “health care cash payments,” “health benefit plans – cancer medications,” “midwifery,” and “epinephrine delivery systems.”
House State Affairs Committee
9 a.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS relating to  “flags, gov entities, penalties.”
Idaho constitutional amendment proposed by state senator to protect public lands

House Local Government Committee
1:30 p.m. Monday:  The committee is scheduled to hold an introductory hearing on an RS relating to “agricultural pests” and “open meetings, public comment.”
House Transportation and Defense Committee
1:30 p.m. Monday: The committee is scheduled to hold four introductory hearings on RSs relating to “vehicle registration stickers,” “parent-student driver’s training,” “transportation, identity,” and “transportation, funding, fuels.”
 Quote of the week

“I wanted feedback. I wanted a lot of feedback, because it deals with a very personal matter for every Idahoan, and that is our public land here in Idaho.” – Sen.

Idaho Supreme Court Chief Justice G. Richard Bevan gave the annual “State of the Judiciary” speech to the Idaho House and Idaho Senate on Wednesday, asking legislators to thoughtfully consider how best to protect public officials and members of the public who use the court system as threats made against judges in the state continue to rise.
“Threats directed at Idaho judges and courts have increased significantly in recent years, and while most never materialize, those that do require precautions that can disrupt court operations and delay the delivery of justice,” Bevan told legislators.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Secretary of State Michael Watson says that strengthening Mississippi’s notoriously lax campaign-finance laws will be his top legislative priority this year. 
Attempts to tighten Mississippi’s campaign spending laws have sputtered in recent legislative sessions. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been reluctant to consider any reform. But Watson, a Republican who helps administer the state’s elections, said recent criminal corruption allegations against local officials have renewed his push. 
“This is not just a political issue,” Watson said. “This is a crime-fighting issue.” 
A federal grand jury last year indicted two county sheriffs in the Mississippi Delta on charges of corruption linked to an alleged drug-trafficking scheme. The two have pleaded not guilty, though court documents allege that undercover law enforcement agents bribed the officials through campaign donations.

Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens and former Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba are also fighting federal bribery charges, where law enforcement agents accuse them of accepting bribes in the form of campaign donations. They have pleaded not guilty. 
Watson’s proposal would require local and state candidates to file reports online, cap cash donations to political candidates at $1,000 and transfer enforcement authority from the Mississippi Ethics Commission to both the Secretary of State’s office and the Attorney General’s office.
If a candidate does not have reliable access to the internet or is unable to operate a computer, they can send a facsimile copy or a letter of their report to the Secretary of State’s office, who will then upload the report online.

The secretary of state said he has worked with Sen. Jeremy England, a Republican from Vancleave, and Attorney General Lynn Fitch in crafting a bill. 
MaryAsa Lee, a spokesperson for Fitch, told Mississippi Today in a statement that the Attorney General’s Office was proud to work with Watson and legislative leaders on the bill, and Mississippians deserve to control their own elections.

“Together, we have created a package of reforms that will close the loopholes that allow outside, special-interest dark money to flow into Mississippi elections,” Lee said. “We are hopeful that this year the Legislature will make these reforms.”
Mississippi’s current law has a confusing, conflicting enforcement system that gives some responsibilities to the secretary of state’s office, the attorney general’s office and the Ethics Commission. 
The new proposal would task Watson’s office with investigating violations and Fitch’s office with prosecuting them if a crime has occurred. The only time the Ethics Commission would step in is if the secretary of state’s office was involved in alleged violations. 
England is the author of the legislation, and the lieutenant governor’s office has referred the measure to the Senate Elections Committee, which England leads. 
The Jackson County lawmaker said he’s hopeful the Legislature will pass the measure because it’s important for the state’s elections to be as “transparent as possible.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/21165710/MG_9221.jpg,,,2026-01-24 06:57:33.680245

Nearly two dozen candidates signed up to run in what is known as a jungle primary, which is when all the candidates appear on the same ballot at once, and if no candidate gets more than half the vote, the top two compete in a runoff.
With so many names on the ballot, the race for the 14th Congressional District will surely go to an April 7 runoff. 
But there are also now three state legislative races set for that day. 
One election is to replace ex-state Sen. Colton Moore, a Trenton Republican who is running for Greene’s seat. Senate District 53 includes Walker, Dade, Chattooga, Catoosa and part of Floyd counties. 
Candidates can start qualifying for the special election Thursday. 
There are also two House seats on the ballot after a pair of lawmakers resigned shortly before the start of the 2026 session. 
Former state Rep. Karen Bennett, a Stone Mountain Democrat, resigned before being charged with unemployment fraud. She pleaded guilty Wednesday to making false statements to obtain the aid, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Northern District of Georgia. 
House District 94 includes portions of DeKalb and Gwinnett counties. Qualifying for the seat starts Monday. 
Ex-state Rep. Lynn Heffner, an Augusta Democrat, said she was stepping down because damage to her home from Hurricane Helene left her unable to satisfy a state law requiring lawmakers to live in the district they represent. House District 130 includes part of Richmond County. Candidates can start qualifying Monday. 
Winter storm Fern will freeze the state legislative session, at least for a day.  
House leaders announced they would delay the start of Monday’s session until 1 p.m. and that no legislative business would be conducted that day. The Senate is still set to gavel in Monday morning but the chamber is expected to be quiet. The Senate committee meetings that were scheduled for Monday have been canceled. 
Gov. Brian Kemp declared a statewide state of emergency Thursday ahead of the weekend storm that is expected to bring a wintry mix and wind gusts that could take down trees and power lines and cause other damage. 
“If you can just stay off the roads, that would be a big favor to us and help keep everybody safe,” Kemp told reporters during a virtual media briefing Thursday. Kemp was in Belgium Thursday on an economic development trip. 
Monday will be the sixth official day of the 2026 session, which is set to end April 2. Lawmakers are scheduled to be in session through Thursday next week. 
Announcements:
Denise Pierce Burns, who is the former GOP congressional district chair, announced Friday that she will run to replace former state Sen. Colton Moore. In a press release, the homeschool mom describes herself as a homesteader who has also advocated for “food freedom, medical freedom and small farms.” 
Ross Sheppard, a Milledgeville Democrat, has launched his House campaign for District 149. Sheppard is a Milledgeville native who says he served as a legislative aide while in college for former longtime Rep. Rusty Kidd, who died in 2020, before working as a lobbyist. He’s challenging Democratic incumbent, Rep. Floyd Griffin, who won the seat in 2024. 
Endorsements: 
Sen. Nabilah Parkes, a Duluth Democrat, has picked up several endorsements from her colleagues in the Senate in her quest to become Georgia’s next insurance commissioner. Parkes announced Thursday that she has the backing of Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones of Augusta and more than a dozen other Democratic Senate leaders and senators. She’s the only announced candidate on the Democratic side in that race so far, and she is challenging GOP incumbent commissioner John King. 
Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper, who is a Republican, weighed in on two races this week: He’s backing state Rep. Tim Fleming of Covington in a crowded GOP primary for secretary of state, and he endorsed Jim Kingston in the 1st Congressional District in southeast Georgia. Both of these races are for open seats.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Savannah-vote-line-1024x7682-2.jpg,,,2026-01-24 05:56:25.792377

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A bill introduced in the Kansas House this week, one that its Republican sponsor hopes will embolden free speech in honor of Charlie Kirk, might indeed prevent censorship and nudge student voices, as he intends.
However, it might also frustrate many Kansans (including fellow Republicans) who won’t enjoy the unfettered expression — from students and faculty, on campus and online — that this bill protects. We can nitpick other likely consequences of the bill after we cover the basics.
Rep. Brett Fairchild, R-St. John, introduced a bill Tuesday that would, generally speaking, enlarge the free speech rights of people on Kansas university and postsecondary education campuses. The bill’s acronym? The FORUM Act, for “forming open and robust university minds.”
In the other chamber, Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, announced this week that additional legislation “is being drafted to safeguard free speech for students across Kansas education, from K-12 to public colleges.”
Fairchild and Masterson paid homage to Kirk, a slain conservative activist and free speech advocate who was shot and killed in September while speaking at a Utah college campus.
“Charlie Kirk was martyred for bringing truth and wisdom to college campuses, where the free exchange of ideas must remain central to their mission. He built a legacy of respectful yet passionate discourse and warned of the dangers when we stop talking to one another,” a statement from Masterson said, calling the bill a “top priority.”
Fairchild called Kirk “a great champion of free speech on college campuses.”
While Kirk’s views on many issues struck me as wrongheaded and offensive, his advocacy for free speech was different. The open debates he created, particularly for college students, pivoted campus norms about free speech.
I worry that this bill — or ones like it — won’t do nearly as much.
As we wait for the Senate bill, let’s review the House bill from Fairchild. Or, to be more accurate, the piece of legislation that Fairchild said came from someone connected to the libertarian group Young Americans For Liberty. Fairchild credited the words in the bill to a person who “knocked on doors when it was 100 degrees outside” and “helped me get elected a few years ago.”
“I’m a big fan of free speech and the First Amendment and I didn’t have any reason to say no,” Fairchild said during my interview with him this week.
He also expressed a loose commitment to the current language of the bill, House Bill 2472.
“I’m not necessarily 100% locked in to keep the bill exactly how it is,” Fairchild said. “As it is currently written, I’m open to amendments if universities come and testify.”
My former University of Kansas colleague Harrison Rosenthal helped me rake through the bill’s legalese. Rosenthal now works as a managing associate at the Dentons law firm and focuses on media and constitutional litigation.
Many of the bill’s provisions would duplicate protections provided by the First Amendment, and in that way the bill seems to me like political stagecraft — feting Kirk without making meaningful changes on college campuses.
However, Rosenthal said, “the bill’s novel moves are significant.” For example, the bill instructs universities to make all outdoor areas on campus into “public forums.” Another provision bars institutions from providing preference to groups or speakers affiliated with the university over unaffiliated groups or speakers.
The bill also protects off-campus and online expression by students. This is where I believe the bill proposes more than many Kansans actually want.
Section 9 of the bill says, “No postsecondary educational institution shall discipline, penalize or otherwise retaliate against a student, student organization, faculty member or staff for expressive activity conducted online, whether on social media, in email, on websites or other digital platforms, if such activity is protected under the first amendment to the constitution of the United States and section 11 of the bill of rights of the constitution of the state of Kansas and conducted in person.”
No discipline, penalty or retaliation at all? For students, organizations, faculty and staff? Would that be a popular outcome?
While I personally believe that universities should not be in the business of regulating a freshman’s Instagram post, is that what Fairchild believes?
In our interview, he said that he doesn’t want “speech constrained unless the speech is basically violent or racist speech.” It’s unclear, in my reading of the bill, what would trigger constraints on racist speech — and those guardrails have existed in the past.
Apart from racist speech, many fellow Republicans, including national political figures, have worked to punish students and faculty for speech recently. In fact, some of that speech was in response to Kirk’s shooting. 
Last year, a KU staff member posted that Kirk was “better in the ground as worm food than up here preaching that murdered children are a necessary sacrifice for 2A rights,” referencing the second amendment.
The backlash was understandably fierce from conservatives, including Masterson, who called for the university to fire the staff member. (KU did not.)
If Fairchild’s bill — or one similar in the Senate — passes, employees and students would be emboldened to speak in that same way.
Similarly, the New York Times published previously sealed court documents this week that showed the only evidence used by the Trump administration to seek deportation of university students was constitutionally protected speech. The judge in the case unsealed the documents to showcase how free expression about Israel and Palestine was being weaponized.
The judge in that case chided two Trump cabinet members for their role in an “unconstitutional conspiracy.” The administration’s actions were, in the judge’s view,  “violating” expressive rights of students studying in the United States.
“These cabinet secretaries have failed in their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution,” Judge William G. Young said last week in an emotional denunciation of the government from the bench.
The bill also requires that each institution “submit a report to the legislature and the governor” detailing the restrictions it enforced, speech disruptions or censorship and more. Asking for more annual reports is a curious pose from a political party that seeks to make our state government leaner and reduce funding for state universities. (It also smacks of a fishing expedition to provide fodder for screaming headlines in partisan media outlets.)
My biggest concern with this bill and others like it: Conservatives envision such laws as potentially liberating conservative speech on campus while somehow constraining contrary messages.
What will conservatives think if the law allows unfettered speech for their political foes?
For his part, Fairchild said he wants all speech protected.
“I don’t think it’s promoting a certain political view over any other type of political view,” Fairchild said. “I think it would protect speech from students who are on the left side of the political spectrum just as much as it would those on the right.”
As a free speech advocate, I support most of the bill’s language. Campuses could improve by fostering more open and risky debate among everyone on campus.
However, I worry that Kansas state law has little to do with the reticence that most students have. I have never heard a student bemoan the lack of statutory protection for what they want to say in class or on social media.
Rather than being a legal problem, student hesitation about being honest and open is a problem of social psychology.
Undergraduate students between 18 and 22 have grown up with the specter of digital retribution for their expression: Is someone going to post a recording of what I say in class to Instagram? Will I be canceled by friends if I post this video on TikTok? Will I be tossed out of contention for a dream job because of something I wrote on Twitter in high school?
These are the worries that they reported to me in class this week as we started a new semester. We reviewed recent research showing how college students see First Amendment protections as being damaged — more and more each year.
At the end of the presentation, I stood at the front of the auditorium and said, “So, this is the time to let me know what you think — how you feel.”
More than 150 undergraduate students looked back at me silently, some doodling nervously in their notebooks. Only the hum of computer projectors filled the classroom. Someone coughed.
“I’m really good at these awkward silences that encourage students to speak up,” I said.
I paused again.
Veteran teachers know that if you make eye contact and provide a kind smile, students will often take that as a cue.
“Still nothing?” I said.
Their nervous stares answered: nothing.
While I don’t see much objectionable in the House bill introduced this week, I don’t think it will break that silence in my classroom or at the state’s other university campuses.

The expiration of popular federal tax credits last year led to higher health care costs across the board, and some Marylanders just couldn’t afford their previous plans, opting for cheaper, less-comprehensive health care coverage for the 2026 plan year.
It was one of the many caveats that came with the newest enrollment data, which actually showed an overall increase in enrollments — despite expectations that rising costs would push more people away from coverage.
Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, urged lawmakers to “dig deeper” into the data, because 5,743 people moved from a higher coverage policy called a “gold plan” to the bottom rung 0f coverage, a “bronze plan,” taking on significantly higher deductibles to maintain less-comprehensive health coverage.
Higher costs are only part of the changes coming to health insurance

“Most of our bronze plans carry $10,000 deductibles, so now that financial burden for medical has gone up tenfold for that family,” Eberle told senators during a Thursday briefing for the Finance Committee.
Gold plans tend to have a deductible of around $1,000, meaning plan holders only have to cover $1,000 of a significant medical cost before their insurance steps in to cover the rest.
“That’s really, really unfortunate that that’s happening,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All coalition. “That means that people are not going to be able to get the health care that they need and are going to go to the hospital and create uncompensated care … we’ll have to pay for that hidden health care tax.”
A major factor to health care costs rising is the expiration of Enhanced Premium Tax Credits, a popular COVID-era federal benefit that helped keep monthly costs down for 190,000 Marylanders who purchased individual plans on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace.
“The federal government’s inaction to extend the tax credits means those who can afford coverage will be forced to pay more while getting less,” Health Secretary Meena Seshamani said in a written statement. “The ripple effect of this will lessen access to needed health care, result in job losses for health care workers, and be a blow to our state’s economy in a time when Marylanders are already experiencing rising costs in so many areas of their lives.”
New data from the exchange supports Seshamani, as data reports that thousands of Marylanders found their previous plans were no longer affordable and dropped to lower-quality plans.
The end of the federal tax credit in December had ripple effects on the whole health care economy. Last year, state insurance officials approved an average 13.4% premium rate increase for 2026 health care plans, to compensate for the expected drop in enrollment.
Despite those rising costs, Marylanders proved they wanted health care, officials said.
State subsidy softens blow to enrollment
According to early data, about 255,600 people purchased individual health care plans from the Maryland Health Connection, with 207,797 people renewing coverage this year and 47,815 newly enrolling in the exchange.That’s about 3.4% more than in last year’s open enrollment period.
The early data eases fears of what many anticipated to be a major drop in coverage due to the expiration of the federal tax credits. But officials from the marketplace note that the 2026 data is not finalized, and there may be a drop in enrollment numbers in coming weeks.
“Individuals must pay the first month’s premium to their insurance company by the end of January to start coverage,” according to a press release from the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange. “There will be some who will get the first month’s bill and not be able to pay.”
A new state-level subsidy may help some people keep their health care plans.
Maryland lawmakers last year approved funding, called the Maryland Premium Assistance, to help replace some of the lost benefit for 2026 plans.
Senate Finance Committee Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) believes the new state-level subsidies likely helped stave off a massive drop in enrollment.
“I thought more people would leave their plans,” Beidle said. “I’m sure the state subsidy is helping people to stay.”
The Maryland Premium Assistance subsidy replaces the extended tax credit for those earning up to twice the federal poverty level. For those earning two to four times the federal poverty level, the state subsidy can replace 50% of the value of the federal tax credits.




Federal poverty level
The Maryland Premium Assistance subsidy replaces the lost federal Enhanced Premium Tax Credit for individuals making up to 200% of the federal poverty level.
In 2026, individuals making up to $31,300 a year are earning about 200% of the federal poverty level, state officials say. For a family of four, an income of $64,300 would be twice the federal poverty level.
Someone making up to $62,600 a year would be earning four times the federal poverty level and could qualify for a state subsidy worth about 50% of what the federal credit would have paid. The same level of support would apply to a household of four earning around $128,600 annually, which is 400% of the federal level.
Those making above 400% of the federal poverty level do not qualify for the state’s new premium assistance.




Without the state-level premium assistance program, the exchange anticipated that 90,000 people would have dropped their coverage when the federal tax credits expired. Even with the state subsidy in place, the marketplace estimated that some 30,000 people dropped their coverage because they can no longer afford it.
The new state subsidy is likely a temporary solution to what could be a long-term problem if Congress does not renew the lapsed federal tax credit, which is currently under debate in Washington.
The state may not be in  position financially to continue funding the program down the line.
The state’s premium subsidy is currently funded by Maryland’s reinsurance program — a special fund through which insurers are reimbursed for a portion of the costs of patients requiring the most expensive care.
The reinsurance program is funded through a 1% assessment on health insurance policies and is currently set to end in 2028 unless the federal government approves an extension on the state’s waiver for the program.
Beidle said that continuing to fund the premium subsidy past 2026 would likely require increasing the assessment or pulling from general funds. But lawmakers this year face a $1.5 billion budget shortfall in the fiscal 2027 budget.
“Our overall budget is so tight,” Beidle said. “There’s only so much you can do with a limited amount of money.”
She noted that the open enrollment data will finalize around March and the legislature would likely have some time to respond if legislative action is needed.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/healthcare-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-24 07:56:30.711528

The Kentucky Lantern won first place in the best website design category. 
Judges wrote that there is “something for everyone who accesses this site” and that it has a “great variety of stories in a well laid out format.” 
The staff of the Lantern also placed third in the general excellence category, which honors the breadth of work for an outlet. The Louisville Courier Journal placed first in that category and the Lexington Herald-Leader took second. 
Teri Carter, an opinion writer, won first place in the best columnist category. 
“At a time when dissenting voices are often silenced, I’m thankful every day that I have the support to do this work,” Carter said after receiving the award. 
Politics reporter McKenna Horsley won a second place award in the general news category, saying she is “humbled that we were honored among our fellow journalists.” 
“I’m so proud of the Lantern’s great work this year,” Horsley said. “Our commonwealth is home to a tradition of dogged reporting and I am confident that will continue in the future.”
Austin Anthony, whose photojournalism has frequently appeared in the Lantern, won a second place award in the best general news photo category. He said the award itself is “an honor,” but “I take even more pride in having the name Kentucky Lantern next to mine.” 
“As a freelancer I’ve worked with reporters at prestigious national publications, and can confidently say that the team at the Lantern is as talented and devoted to the craft as anyone,” Anthony said. “It’s not an easy time to do this work yet they continue to excel.”
Health and policy reporter Sarah Ladd placed third in the best feature story category. 
“We don’t do journalism for awards, but it always feels nice to be recognized by peers,” Ladd said. “None of my reporting would be possible without the people who trust me with their stories. All of my thanks goes to them.” 
The 2026 convention was held at the Crowne Plaza Hotel. More than 100 journalists from around the state attended.

(Courtesy of Heritage Frederick)Little is known about the two sets of skeletal remains uncovered during an excavation in downtown Frederick earlier this week — only that police are convinced they’re “historic in nature.”
The bones were discovered Tuesday by archaeological crews excavating land near the Hessian Barracks, an 18th century building on the grounds of the Maryland School for the Deaf. The excavation was part of the beginning stages of historical restoration work.
The remains were left in place and reburied to protect them, a state official said. If they are eventually exhumed, examinations could reveal more about the remains, including their approximate age.
But in the meantime, local historians have their guesses.
Could they be from the American Revolution, when the barracks held British and German, or Hessian, prisoners of war?
Could they be from the Civil War, when the barracks became a hospital for injured Union and Confederate soldiers, including from the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle on American soil?
“When you look at the history of this site and the various uses that it has had, whether as a military barracks, as a place where prisoners of war were kept, or as a hospital — I mean, it really doesn’t surprise me,” said Jody Brumage, archivist and museum manager for the Heritage Frederick historical society.
During times of peace, the barracks have served a diverse array of functions: The barracks were a supply depot for the Lewis and Clark expedition west after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803; in the late 1800s, a pair of merchants raised silkworms there.

But Tuesday’s discovery has directed attention to wartimes, when on-site burials would have been more likely.
Chad Baker, a former teacher and later deputy superintendent at the Maryland School for the Deaf, said he once read a diary entry from a Hessian soldier imprisoned there that said a fellow prisoner died and was buried outside the barracks.
“I would hope, I like, I wish — whatever — that they find out they can date it to the Revolutionary War period,” said Baker, who focused on preservation of the barracks during his decades at the school, before his 2014 retirement. “That would verify the document that referenced the possibility — and especially if there are any artifacts that they buried with them. You never know.”
Brumage, for his part, believes the remains may be more likely to be from the Civil War era, when wounded from both sides inundated the site.
“We know that in different instances with Civil War hospitals, that burials were done in almost any available place,” Brumage said, “particularly in those periods like after Antietam, where just the sheer numbers of wounded soldiers that are being dealt with in these places is really astronomical.”
But Baker said there was a temporary morgue in the Civil War era — at that time called a “dead house” — just to the east of the barracks, making him question the idea that burials could have occurred there.
“They had a place to put — in a temporary morgue, if you will — those soldiers, Civil War, who died while being cared for in the barracks,” Baker said.
The barracks were commissioned by the state legislature in the late 1770s — one of three funded by the state at that time, Baker said. Back then, they were on the southern outskirts of town, atop a hill that gained the nickname “Cannon Hill,” because townspeople fired cannons from the barracks for special occasions, such as Marquis de Lafayette’s 1824 visit, or the Baltimore & Ohio railroad’s arrival to the city.
Today, though, the barracks are tucked into the School for the Deaf’s 68-acre, 14-building campus, which is surrounded by a residential area full of historic homes in Frederick.
“Today, Frederick completely surrounds the site where the barracks stand, and the remaining structure really sits right in the heart of the Maryland School for the Deaf campus,” Brumage said.
The barracks were originally the Frederick Town Barracks, Baker said, though it was later nicknamed for the Hessian prisoners held there who later became part of the community. After the Revolution, many Hessian prisoners were freed and settled in Frederick, which already had a sizable German population, Baker said.
“When repatriation to Germany was offered, most of them said no and they just stayed locally,” Baker said. “And some, in fact, married the proverbial farmer’s daughter, and we have descendants in Frederick that have that lineage.”

That the discovery of aged remains happened in 2026, the 250th anniversary of U.S. independence, is no accident: The School for the Deaf got a $750,000 National Park Service grant in July 2023 to support the preservation of the barracks site, including “critical stabilization and foundation work,” said Amy Mowl, a spokesperson for the school, in a statement.
It was during “pre-restoration archaeological work” for this project that the buried human remains were found, said Brandon Stoneburg, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of General Services. The department is working alongside the Maryland Historical Trust on the project, Stoneburg said.
“The discovery, while unexpected, is being handled with appropriate care and historical consideration,” said Maryland School for the Deaf Superintendent John A. Serrano, in a YouTube video message delivered in American Sign Language.
“At this time, authorities are working to determine the next steps for the respectful and compliant handling of the remains. Work in the affected area will remain paused until this process is complete,” Serrano said.

With the resolution, higher education and state leaders vowed to align higher education with the best interest of students and the state.
“We remain dedicated to research and teaching that fosters academic excellence, explores new ideas, respects differing viewpoints, drives economic growth, and discovers solutions to our most complex problems,” the resolution reads.

Gov. Spencer Cox was still fresh from his State of the State address, in which he called on Utahns to build “moral infrastructure.” His Friday remarks had a similar tone, highlighting not only the economic perks of higher education, but also the development of other skills.
“Just teaching people how to think for themselves, that matters. That matters as much as any economic gain,” Cox said. “Our ability to debate one another, our ability to understand who we are as Americans, our ability to reason and to learn from our past mistakes is just as important as any of the economic boosts that we see here.”
Cox also praised the Utah Board of Higher Education, but also said that “reform is never finished,” and listed his wish list for the system, including increasing timely degree completion rates, to “always credit for prior learning,” and to continue to maximize higher education’s financial value.
“I want to just say unequivocally that higher ed matters, that we support you,” Cox said. “And I hope you feel that coming out of this legislative session.” 
Cuts may be discussed in the next weeks
Last year, flagship higher education legislation directed universities to cut and reallocate 10% of their budgets for courses, or $60 million in total, aiming to switch that funding from “underperforming programs” to initiatives that are in higher demand. With a tight deadline, some universities were left scrambling to make the cuts and had to plan for layoffs and the elimination of programs.
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said Friday there have been lots of benefits from that exercise and that he believed every area of government should be looking at similar initiatives.

The Executive Appropriations Committee directed all legislative appropriations subcommittees to identify a 5% ongoing spending reduction target this year. For higher education, that would mean a $93.7 million cut, according to a Legislative Fiscal Analyst presentation.
The Legislative Fiscal Analyst office recommended making cuts to different Utah System of Higher Education programs, like reducing the estimated budget to make an equal opportunity initiatives report, taking back engineering and computer science initiative funding approved last year, and reducing 60% of out-of-state tuition waivers, among others.
Schultz said more details about that may emerge in the next few weeks.
Why the Utah System of Higher Education may get redesigned into ‘regions’

“We just went through that process with higher education. We’re not going to cut 5% of the budget, but we’re going to look at it and say, ‘OK, do we need to reallocate some more money? (Are) there things that we need to continue to look at?’” Schultz said. “So we’ll see. I’d say, let’s give it another week or two and see what comes out of that.”
The resolution was ceremonial, Schultz said, but represented a commitment to the system’s future, to reevaluate programs that don’t work, and to keep tuition costs down.
During the signing ceremony, Geoffrey Landward, Utah commissioner of higher education, commended the effort to collaborate among institutions and government.
“My only worry is that the significance of this will be lost in an era of higher education that is marked by diminishing trust, questioned value, or turmoil,” Landward said. “Assembled here today are the elected leaders of our state and leaders of our system of higher education, gathered in unity, saying with one voice, higher education will remain a pillar of our state and thrive in uncertain times because we refuse to let it flounder.”
A bill sponsored by Clinton Republican Rep. Karen Peterson went public on Friday, which, if approved would direct “the alignment of the system of higher education into regions for vertical and horizontal integration.”
That would help ease credits transfers, integrated admission, enrollment and student services.
“I think that’s a great right. You may want to start out at UVU, but finish at Weber State. You may want to start out in Utah Tech University in the southern part of the state, but end up finishing at University of Utah,” Schultz said on Friday. “Having that collaboration together so that kids aren’t duplicating resources and costing more money, that’s a benefit for the students.”

Gov. Jim Pillen, Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., and the heads of the Omaha and Nebraska business chambers of commerce held a news conference in Omaha Friday touting Legislative Bill 1165, newly introduced by State Sen. Brad von Gillern on behalf of the Pillen administration.

Dubbed the “Grow the Good Life Act,” the proposal modifies three existing business incentive laws. Key changes ensure that a large employer undergoing a merger or acquisition gains benefits that might encourage them to stay and grow in Nebraska, said von Gillern, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee.
While U.P. is not identified by name, portions of the bill appear tailor-made for the Omaha-based railroad company as it seeks federal approval of an $85 billion merger with Georgia-based Norfolk Southern to create the nation’s first single-line coast-to-coast rail system. The merged systems would create a combined enterprise of more than $250 billion.
The union of two Fortune 500 transportation companies faces opponents and saw a setback recently when the Surface Transportation Board rejected an initial application as incomplete. U.P. said it will provide the necessary information. 
 ‘Aggressive, assertive’ 

On Friday, Pillen proclaimed as “groundbreaking” the initiative that addresses pressure business groups have put on his administration to focus more on economic development, as he has concentrated on property tax relief measures.
New Omaha Chamber report urges state business incentives overhaul, ways to stem ‘brain drain’

“This is more aggressive and assertive than anything we’ve ever done before,” Pillen said at the event, which used vintage U.P. railcars as a backdrop at Omaha’s Durham Museum.
An estimated cost has yet to be attached to the new incentives, said von Gillern, who emphasized that provisions were sure to change as the measure advances through the law-making process. 
He called it a pay-for-performance plan — “not welfare, not a give-away.”
Ewing said he hopes for a “Super Bowl” business climate. 
“We have to run new plays. We have to expect to win companies, jobs and people,” the mayor said. “We’ve got to be willing to have the courage to go for it on fourth down.”

In response to a reporter’s question, Pillen said the state had not negotiated an incentive package with U.P. He said other businesses could benefit from the legislation as well, and mentioned HDR and Kiewit Corp. as among growing companies that could perhaps tap revamped incentives. 
U.P., in a statement to the Examiner, said the railroad was “excited to grow with Nebraska.” 
“We support Governor Pillen and the Legislature’s goals of attracting and retaining high-paying jobs in the state.”
Upon announcing the acquisition plan last July, U.P. leaders said the combined company would be headquartered in Omaha and that Atlanta will remain a “core location” with a focus on technology, operations and innovation. 
U.P. employs more than 5,500 people in Nebraska (about 33,000 nationwide) and operates more than 1,000 miles of track in the state. The railroad has maintained operational headquarters in Omaha for more than 160 years, and moved into a then-new downtown Omaha headquarters in 2004.
 Nationally, Norfolk Southern has more than 20,000 employees, with more than 3,000 at its Atlanta headquarters that the company opened in 2021.
 Staying ahead of competition

Von Gillern said possible relocation should be a concern, noting that Georgia has been “very aggressive “with incentive offerings. He said the Norfolk Southern Atlanta campus is “pretty stunning.”

“We have to be ahead of our competition,” von Gillern said. “This bill will benefit the employees of Union Pacific and Nebraska taxpayers by ensuring that a high-caliber, high-paying great corporate citizen stays here in our home state.” 
Incentives laid out in LB 1165 include sales and use tax credits and grants, and modify the Key Employer and Jobs Retention Act, the ImagiNE Act, and Site Building Development Act.
Key provisions apply to private employers in the state that have more than 3,000 full-time workers and an enterprise value of more than $25 billion after a merger. As currently written, von Gillern said, those employers could be eligible for a 10% tax credit for bringing to the state 1,000 full-time jobs with $90,000 salaries over a seven year period. 
Another change, not to exceed $5 million in 2026-27 fiscal year, would provide capital improvement grants to employers following a change of ownership. 
The Department of Labor also would establish a grant program, not to exceed $300,000 annually for any employer, to provide workforce retention and recruitment support to businesses undergoing an ownership change.
LB 1165 responds to pressure from Nebraska business leaders who have been releasing studies showing the state falling behind some of its peers in job growth and economic development.
 Clear message 

Heath Mello, a former senator who had led the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee and is now CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber, said the legislation reflects months of discussion with the Pillen team to retain and expand jobs and talent.

Tax incentives, Mello said, are usually the first thing companies look for in deciding where to build a workforce and commercial enterprise. 
He noted that “some of Nebraska’s most iconic employers” currently are navigating major ownership changes, and mentioned U.P. 
“This legislation sends a very clear message: Nebraska is prepared to meet change with confidence,” Mello said.

Steny Hoyer endorses freshman Maryland Del. Adrian Boafo as his successor in Congress, the Legislative Black Caucus gets new leadership, Sen. C. Anthony Muse chooses between two jobs and more in political notes.","Del. Adrian Boafo (D-Prince George's) on the House floor Friday, the same day he received an endorsement from Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) as his successor. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)When he announced just over two weeks ago that he would not run for reelection after more than four decades in Congress, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) said he would share his thoughts about a successor “at some point in time.” Turns out that point in time was just over two weeks.
Hoyer on Friday endorsed Del. Adrian Boafo (D-Prince George’s), who worked for the congressman between 2019 and 2021, as someone constituents “could count on to resolve their problems.”
“I have known Adrian for years. He is as warm as he is smart, as principled as he is pragmatic. He genuinely loves our community and our people,” Hoyer said in a statement. “Public service defines Adrian. As a member of my staff, he earned Marylanders’ trust.”
Although Boafo, 31, hasn’t officially filed with the state Board of Elections, he does have a campaign website and he has created an account with the Federal Election Commission.
Boafo, a former Bowie mayor pro tem, said after Friday’s House of Delegates session that he was pleased to get Hoyer’s endorsement.
“To even be running in this race is a blessing in itself. To have the guy who’s been doing this job at a major national level for that long say, ‘I think he can pass, take the mantle and run with it,’ is even better,” Boafo said. “It’s still surreal and it hasn’t fully set in, but the job’s not finished. We still have a coalition to build. We still have to make sure we win this race.”
Still a crowded field — for now
Boafo could have plenty of competition in the June 23 Democratic primary.
As of Friday afternoon, 14 Democrats had either filed paperwork with the board of elections or created a campaign committee with the FEC to replace Hoyer in the 5th District, which includesCalvert, Charles and St. Mary’s counties in Southern Maryland and parts of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties.
One of the Democratic hopefuls, retired Navy officer Terry Jackson, praised Hoyer’s service in a statement Friday but also said the “moment called for something different.”

“With so many qualified candidates stepping forward, this was an opportunity for an open conversation about the future of the district — a chance to hear ideas, debate priorities, and allow Marylanders to weigh competing visions free from political pressure,” he said. “Instead, the race was effectively framed before voters had that opportunity.”
Besides Boafo, two other high-profile candidates from Prince George’s County filed with the FEC: Del. Nicole Williams and County Councilmember Wala Blegay, who was appointed last month as the council’s at-large member.
A few other state lawmakers and former congressional candidates have expressed interest and said they were “definitely considering” the possibility of a run. But that was before Hoyer’s endorsement.
Political analysts predicted a crowded Democratic primary, with the winner almost certain of a general election victory in the district, where there were 2.5 registered Democrats for every registered Republican in 2024. Analysts also expect voters in the district will choose a more progressive Democrat in June than the more-moderate Hoyer.
Candidates have until Feb. 24 to file for the seat.
New leadership for Black Caucus
The Legislative Black Caucus announced Thursday that Del. N. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County) will serve as chair of the caucus, replacing Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery) who stepped down after three legislative sessions at the helm to take over as chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.
“I am honored by the confidence of my colleagues and grateful for the strong foundation laid by those who have led before me,” Phillips said in a statement. “The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland is well positioned to continue advancing policies that strengthen Maryland’s families and communities.”
Sen. Antonio Hayes (D-Baltimore City) announced on the Senate floor Thursday that Sen. Shaneka Henson (D-Anne Arundel) will serve as first vice chair of the caucus. Del. Melissa Wells (D-Baltimore City) had been first vice chair under Wilkins, but she stepped down to chair the new House Government, Labor and Elections Committee.

	Henson received a round of applause from her colleagues that also garnered a light moment from Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City).
“It’s nice to have some Senate leadership in the caucus. We don’t often get out-voted, you know,” he said. The last senator to chair the caucus was Catherine Pugh, from 2010-12, according to the state archives.
The caucus is expected to announce its legislative priorities for the 90-day session soon. It has considerable influence in Annapolis with more than 60 members — a third of the legislature — and heavy representation in leadership positions, including House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), Senate President Pro Tem Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), House Judiciary Committee chair Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), Wilkins leading Ways and Means and Wells chairing the so-called GLE Committee, among others.
Muse resigns
Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s) said Thursday he has resigned from his job in Prince George’s County government amid an ethics investigation.
State law generally does not allow members of the General Assembly to work simultaneously for local governments, though there are some exceptions. Muse said in December that the State Ethics Commission determined his job did not qualify for an exemption from the rule, but he also said then that he intended to fight the commission’s determination.
When asked on the Senate floor Thursday why he changed his mind, Muse said simply, “I wanted to be here.”

County officials told Maryland Matters that Muse applied for and had received a job as the county procurement officer. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Muse’s resignation.
Muse said in December that he believes legislators should be able to hold other government roles, especially since the legislature works part-time. Legislators receive about $56,000 per year for their roles. Muse’s county job had an annual salary of $180,000.
State law allows legislators to keep a govenment job they held before filing to run for office, or if they are working as a teacher, non-elected law enforcement officer or emergency responder. Exemptions are also granted if the role was awarded under an entirely objective merit-based system, such as an exam.
No member of the General Assembly currently has the latter exemption, said Deadra Daly, ethics council for the legislature, in a December interview.
“The committee is pretty strict,” Daly said of the merit-based exception. “We want it to be very much an objective ranking system. Then, one can’t argue that this person only got the job because the agency was trying to curry favor with the legislator.”
Grownups like snow days, too
Members of the House got a welcome Friday break just in time for the coming snowstorm, as chairs of the seven standing committees stood up, one after another, to announced that there would be no meetings after the floor session.
But House Environment and Transportation Chair Mark Korman (D-Montgomery) assigned homework.
“All the members are instructed for two hours to think about energy,” Korman said.
“You’re going to be tested on it,” House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk chimed in.
Grownups like snow days, too: Part II
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) may be less freaked out about an impending snowstorm than many of the residents of his district. Ferguson warned the Senate, which was meeting in a pro forma session Friday, that Monday night’s regularly scheduled session might be affected by the weather.
“We’ll do the best we can. Looks like something is coming, we just don’t know what,” Ferguson said to the mostly empty chamber.
On Friday, Gov. Wes Moore (D) declared a state of emergency and warned of a winter weather system that could affect the state over multiple days, including a clean up.
The leader of the Senate isn’t worried.
“I’ll tell ya, I really want to go sledding, so fingers crossed,” Ferguson said.

Julie Emerson has pulled her name from consideration in the U.S. Senate race in Louisiana, following the entry of U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow earlier this week with President Donald Trump’s endorsement.
Emerson announced her candidacy in October, targeting fellow Republican incumbent Bill Cassidy.  In a social media post Saturday night, Trump urged Letlow to enter the Senate race, which she did Tuesday morning.
“With Congresswoman Letlow’s entrance into the race, the path to victor that was visible a couple of months ago has diminished,” Emerson wrote Thursday in a social media post. “I support President Trump and respect his decision to endorse Julia Letlow to defeat Bill Cassidy.”


At 37, Emerson is still considered to be on the upslope of her political career. In 2015, she became the youngest Republican woman ever elected to the Louisiana Legislature at age 27. She chairs the critical House Ways and Means Committee, where all tax matters originate, and has been a floor leader for Gov. Jeff Landry on issues such as state finance and education.
It was Emerson who sponsored legislation to end the “jungle” primary elections Louisiana had held since 1975, which featured candidates from all parties. Now she has opted out of the first closed primary since her bill was approved in 2024.
With Emerson out, the announced field for the May 16 Republican Party primary includes Cassidy, Letlow, Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming, state Sen. Blake Miguez of New Iberia, St. Tammany Parish Councilwoman Kathy Seiden and Public Service Commission member Eric Skrmetta.
Democrats who’ve announced their U.S. Senate candidacy are: civic activist Tracie Burke of Gretna; Jamie Davis, a farmer and former Tensas Parish Police Jury member; and Jabari Walker, who worked for nearly eight years on New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s staff.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Supporters of Alaska’s election system filed a lawsuit against the Alaska Division of Elections on Thursday, alleging that the state’s description of a roll-back-the-clock ballot measure is biased and inaccurate. 
The state has defended its language, with a spokesperson calling it “accurate, neutral, and consistent with prior initiatives.”
This fall, voters will be asked with Ballot Measure 2 if they want to return Alaska’s election system to what it was in 2020. The state’s description would be printed on ballots alongside the measure. 
Until 2020, political parties determined who could vote and run in primary elections, voters were required to pick just one candidate in the general election, and people could donate secretly to nonprofits that could then pass money to candidates.
In November 2020, Alaskans approved Ballot Measure 2, which put all political candidates for an office into the same primary election. The top four advance to a general election that uses ranked choice voting. Nonprofits that donate to political candidates are required to disclose their donors.
In 2024, an effort to repeal the primary and general election changes failed by 737 votes out of 320,985 cast statewide.
The plaintiffs in the new lawsuit are AFL-CIO president Joelle Hall, state Sen. Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, and former Juneau city council member Barbara Blake. All three are represented by attorney Scott Kendall, the prime author of the 2020 ballot measure that installed the current elections system.
The suit was organized by the Alaskans for Better Elections Foundation, Kendall said. Alaskans for Better Elections supported the 2020 measure and has opposed prior efforts to repeal it. 
“I think (Alaskans) should know that the ballot language that has been offered by the Division of Directions is materially inaccurate, and in some cases, says the measure does the opposite of what it does, and it omits very significant changes the measure will make,” Kendall said by phone on Thursday.
In particular, the suit objects to the state’s claim that the ballot measure would restore or “bring back” campaign finance rules.
“The proposed measure (24ESEG) would not ‘restore,’ ‘bring back,’ or add even a single
campaign finance rule to Alaska’s statutes,” the suit states. “Rather, 24ESEG would fully repeal a litany of campaign finance disclosure requirements, and eliminate enhanced fines.”
A key part of the 2020 ballot measure and existing state law is the requirement that nonprofit groups disclose their financial supporters if those nonprofits contribute money to election candidates. 
A prior effort to repeal the 2020 ballot measure would have left the disclosure requirement in place. The new repeal effort would eliminate the dark-money disclosure law, concealing donations.
A section-by-section analysis published by the Alaska Department of Law in February 2025 concluded that this year’s measure would “reverse several changes to campaign finance disclosure requirements.”
“It repeals a ton of very, very popular campaign finance disclosure provisions, and yet, the ballot language proposes to say it restores them,” Kendall said.
Ballot Measure 2 will appear alongside Ballot Measure 1, which would reimpose financial limits on political contributors. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Alaska’s prior limits in 2021, and the state declined to appeal that verdict. Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who ran for re-election in 2022, said at the time that he favors having no contribution limits. 
The lawsuit dealing with Ballot Measure 2 also asserts that the state’s approved language downplays the way that political parties would be permitted to determine who may vote in primary elections.
Independent candidates would not appear on primary election ballots unless one or more political parties allow them. Independent voters would not be allowed to vote in a primary unless permitted by political parties.
Before 2020, both the Republican and Democratic parties in Alaska allowed some independent voters to participate in their primaries.
“Granting major political parties in Alaska the power to disenfranchise voters for primary elections is neither mentioned, nor even implied, in the proposed ballot language,” the lawsuit states. 
The Alaska Division of Elections is being legally defended by the Alaska Department of Law, which has not been formally served with the lawsuit but has a copy of the complaint. 
“We have been in the midst of ongoing discussions with plaintiffs’ counsel, who was urging the adoption of ballot language that would have departed from the legal standard requiring accuracy and neutrality,” said Sam Curtis, a spokesperson for the Department of Law. 
“We have not yet been served with the complaint and will review it when we are. The ballot language at issue is accurate, neutral, and consistent with prior initiatives. The alternative language advanced by the plaintiffs would be confusing and inject advocacy where the law requires impartial description. We are confident the courts will uphold the State’s language.”
The plaintiffs challenging the state have diverse political perspectives: Hall is a registered Democrat, Giessel is a Republican, and Blake is a registered nonpartisan. All three have opposed prior repeal efforts and are opposing this year’s as well.
Giessel said she wants Alaskans to know what they’re voting on.
“People tell me that they’ve signed initiatives, particularly this year — and other years previously as well — and then they find out that actually what they were told they were signing was misrepresented to them. So I want them to know exactly what’s in this,” she said.
Hall is an experienced campaigner.
“People need to know what they’re being asked to vote on, as clear as possible. Because some people will walk into that booth and read that word for word,” she said. “They will not have made up their mind ahead of time. So it just needs to be really clear.”



What do you think?
Below are the two versions of the proposed language on Ballot Measure 2. Which do you think is clearer and more accurate?
First, the state-written language:
An Act Restoring Political Party Primaries, Single-Choice General Elections, and Campaign Finance Rules
This act would get rid of open primary elections and ranked-choice general elections. It would bring back political party primaries and single-choice general elections. It would also bring back campaign finance rules.
Elections will occur as they did before open primaries and ranked choice voting. In the primary election, voters will choose a party’s ballot. They will vote for one candidate in each race and the winning candidate will be the party’s nominee. In the general election, voters will select one candidate in each race. The candidate with the most votes will win. Party petitions, special runoff elections, and other parts of the prior election system would return.
Campaign finance rules would also return to the way they were in the prior election system. This act would remove the limits on donations to joint campaigns for governor and lieutenant governor. It would remove limits and disclosure rules under current law, including for digital ads, out-of-state donations, undisclosed donations, and the true source of donations. It would remove some fines and change the meaning of a campaign expenditure.
Second, the language proposed in the lawsuit:
An Act Restoring Political Party Primaries and Single-Choice General Elections, and Repealing Certain Campaign Disclosure Requirements and Fines
This Act would get rid of open primary elections, where all candidates appear on one ballot. It would get rid of ranked-choice general elections. It would replace them with political party primaries and single-choice general elections. This Act would also repeal certain campaign finance disclosure requirements and get rid of or reduce some fines for violations.
In the primary election, voters would choose one party’s ballot and vote only for candidates from that party. Political parties would be given the power to prohibit voters who are not registered members of their party, including Nonpartisan and Undeclared voters, from voting in their primaries. The winning candidate from each primary would be the party’s nominee. In the General Election, voters would vote for only one candidate. The candidate receiving the most votes would win, whether or not that candidate has a majority of the votes cast for the race.
This Act would end the ban on dark money by getting rid of the requirement that independent expenditure groups report the true sources of their contributions. It would also get rid of the requirement that such groups, when they are funded mostly by out of state money, disclose that fact in their ads.
Finally, it would get rid of or reduce the fines for some campaign finance violations.

Those foster youth live in other housing, like shelters and dorms, and struggle to access state funds to cover basic living expenses, the lawsuit says. 
The lawsuit filed by the non-profit advocacy organization, Facing Foster Care in Alaska, says the state should provide the same monthly living stipends to older foster youth for basic necessities, as they do to foster families with youth in their home.
“For youth in these alternate settings, there’s no foster care payment going anywhere,” said Amanda Metivier, executive director of Facing Foster Care. The organization is arguing that without these living stipends, the state is failing its duty of care for older foster youth in state custody, and are asking the court to require the state to distribute living stipends directly to all older foster youth. 
The Office of Children’s Services, housed within the Alaska Department of Family and Community Services, runs the state’s foster care system. It provides a “cost of care” stipend to foster families for each foster youth in their home to pay for essential items like food, clothing, toiletries and school supplies. 
But there’s no stipend for foster youth living independently, in shelters, college dorms or other housing. Instead, the department provides vouchers and small grants for living expenses, but advocates say it’s not enough — and call it a failure of the state to uphold its constitutional duty in the lawsuit.
A spokesperson for the Office of Children’s Services said older foster youth have the same funding and support as younger children, and items or services are provided by need or request. 
Plaintiffs say foster youth not placed with families are left struggling to care for themselves and find ways to pay for basic necessities like clothing, food and transportation to medical appointments, work or school, according to the lawsuit. “And so it’s a lot of going without,” Metivier said. 
She said her organization filed the lawsuit on behalf of foster youth who asked for help so they can recover a sense of financial stability. 
Youth who are not adopted or reunited with family are eligible to remain in state custody until they are 21 years old, as per state law, as a transitional period into adulthood. 
Metivier said that’s a good thing, and mirrors national trends of extending foster care to provide foster youth with additional support and improve their life outcomes. 
Foster youth are more likely to be at risk for homelessness, incarceration and mental health challenges: A national survey by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from 2020 to 2024 to track outcomes for foster youth found that 35% of foster youth in Alaska had experienced homelessness, 18% had experienced incarceration and 24% had a substance use referral by the age of 17. 
Miye D’Oench, an attorney with the civil rights firm Northern Justice Project, who is representing the plaintiffs, said the lawsuit calls on OCS to fulfill its legal duty of care.
“At the end of the day, this is to us, just plainly unacceptable, and it’s a massive failure of the foster care system, and it’s unconstitutional,” she said.
Moreover, the number of foster homes is not keeping up with the number of children and youth in need, according to the lawsuit, which is forcing foster youth to live independently in youth shelters, dorms or even in cots in OCS offices. In November, the state reported 2,493 youth in foster care and 1,184 foster homes. 
Officials with the Office of Children’s Services declined to answer specific questions but provided an email statement to address the issue generally, through Brian Studstill, communications director for the Alaska Department of Family and Community Services.
“Young adults served by OCS have access to the same funding streams available to younger children, as well as additional resources designed to support their transition to adulthood,” the statement said. 
The department provides financial incentives for participation in skill‑building activities, including independent living classes, assessments and transition planning, as well as funds to grantees and contractors who deliver independent living services, according to the statement. 
“OCS routinely offers food and clothing vouchers, bus passes, and other transportation assistance such as cab fare or limited vehicle maintenance for those who rely on personal vehicles for work or school,” the statement said. “Additional supports may include assistance with cell phones, laptops, work attire or gear, and driver’s education costs. Young adults are encouraged to seek support whenever needed.”
Studstill clarified that payments are not made regularly to older youth, like monthly stipends. “There is no re-occurring stipend paid to children or youth,” he said. 
“Services and commodities are paid for by OCS based on need or request, which may include re-occurring payments for room, board or ongoing expenses or they may be covered as the need arises such as clothing and food vouchers,” he said. 
The department’s statement cited additional federal funds available to older youth, including $5,000 per year for educational and training vouchers for attending college. In the lawsuit, plaintiffs said those vouchers fail to come close to covering student expenses. For example, University of Alaska Anchorage tuition is estimated at over $30,000 per year, according to the lawsuit, and students are shouldered with covering housing, food and school supplies. 
As of Jan. 12, there were 112 youth in state custody between the ages of 18 and 21, and 56 youth were living outside of a foster care home or group home, according to the department’s statement. 
“​​Those living outside of a licensed foster home reside in various placements such as college dorms, on trial home visits with family, unlicensed relative homes, assisted living homes to meet extraordinary needs, or are in custody of the Division of Juvenile Justice,” the OCS statement added. 
For licensed foster homes, OCS provides foster families with a monthly stipend for each child based on age and difficulty of care. For youth ages 12 to 20 years old, it’s roughly $40 per day or $1,200 per month. 
Metivier said teens as young as 14 and 15 years old are living outside of foster homes, and providing the living stipend would allow more stability. 
“This gives them an opportunity to be in care, have that safety net, but to also practice managing money,” she said. “To take care of themselves as a staggered way to be able to cover their cost of rent and food and transportation as they prepare to be able to do that on their own once they’re out of custody. And that’s successful, that’s successful in a lot of places.”
D’Oench, the plaintiff’s attorney, pointed out OCS makes a budget request from the Alaska State Legislature each year based on a foster youth count which includes older youth, estimated at 2,500 children and youth in care. 
OCS is also facing a federal lawsuit alleging systemic failures in the department and the state’s foster care system, including chronic understaffing, overburdened caseworkers and failure to find adequate placements, which is risking harm to children. The case went to trial in August, and will be decided by the presiding federal judge in the coming months.

Meanwhile, lawmakers who codified the center’s creation are pushing to make programming the center will offer a requirement for all students at the university. Lawmakers heard an update this week on what civics centers at the three state universities are doing.
Certain courses offered by the centers in the future could become required as part of general education courses as bills in the Iowa Senate and House of Representatives to change core curriculum moves ahead. Legislation to require public university students take courses in American history and government has passed out of subcommittee in both chambers.

While the original schedule for the Center for Intellectual Freedom at the University of Iowa had courses running the entire semester, the center’s interim director, Luciano de Castro, said in an interview the inability to hire faculty, figure out lecturer schedules and adequately advertise to students led him to cancel the section set to start in January and only offer courses starting in March. He said he canceled the course early in December and will use the first half of the spring semester to make students aware of it.
Both of the seven-week courses, titled “Political and Economic Institutions in the United States” and “American Culture and Values,” will operate with pass/fail grades and invite outside speakers to give lectures to students on various topics. According to his presentation to the committee, the cultures and values course will cover topics like the costs and benefits of freedom, freedom of speech, American literature, “self-reliance as an American value” and “why capitalism rocks.”
De Castro said he wanted to offer the political course twice this semester, but scheduling was more challenging than expected, especially with his focus on the center’s inaugural event that took place in December.
When asked how many students had enrolled in the center’s first course before its elimination from the schedule, de Castro said he couldn’t remember. Those students were transferred into the course taking place in the second half of the semester.
With the semester started, de Castro said he and center staff are connecting with student organizations in the hopes of engaging more with students and ensuring they know about the center and its activities.
De Castro told lawmakers this week the center has contracted with the Common Sense Institute to conduct a market demand assessment, and hired a research assistant to aid them. The center paid the Common Sense Institute $18,600 for the contract, he said in an interview, and the study should be complete by the end of the semester.
With the study underway, de Castro said during the meeting the center’s next steps are requesting funds from the UI to hire faculty.
“I will prioritize hiring adjunct faculty, they are called teaching faculty or temporary faculty, because this will allow more flexibility for the permanent director to define things on a long term basis,” de Castro said in the interview.
The executive committee within the center’s advisory council will handle the search for a permanent director. No advisory council meetings are currently scheduled, de Castro said, as they are waiting to hear back on firms that could be contracted to aid in the search. Quotes should be coming back in late February, he told the committee.
After hearing from directors of the other university centers, de Castro said he’d like to work with them on coordinating with some of the speakers they brought up as being invited to campus.
University civics centers report on activities
Nearly one year after he presented to the then-new committee on the benefits of bringing a school of intellectual freedom to the University of Iowa, de Castro spoke to the higher education committee this week about the center’s advisory council, its first event and upcoming plans for courses and the search for a permanent director.
He was joined by Center for Cyclone Civics Co-Directors Karen Kedrowski and Kelly Shaw and University of Northern Iowa Center for Civic Education Director Allison Rank. Each center has already started hosting events and seeking information from students about their current civic knowledge and what they’d like to see from their centers, and are beginning to find ways to work with each other.
“All of the centers are in their infancy, so we have just begun the effort of this collaboration,” Kedrowski said.
Iowa State University Center for Cyclone Civics
Officials at the Center for Cyclone Civics at ISU have spent the past months studying its students, developing programming and seeing just how far they can reach — potentially to each county in Iowa.
Interns at the center created a program titled “Byte Sized Civics” for Iowa State University Extension and Outreach last spring, Shaw said. The program includes short videos covering different aspects of state and local government, how they work and interact.
The center also conducted surveys in spring 2025 of then-seniors to better understand their knowledge of civics and government and examine their political attitudes and voting trends. While the data from the civics survey is still being mined, Shaw said scores of 20 multiple choice questions are averaging at 17 — in the B range for a grade.
During the fall semester and looking ahead to this spring and beyond, Shaw said the center has focused on the 250th anniversary of America’s founding. Local and national speakers came to campus throughout the semester to give talks on related topics, and more are planned in February through April.
The first discussion of the semester, hosted by Ames pastor Rev. Mark Vance, will cover the “importance of honesty and debate in an age of political tribalism,” the center’s presentation stated.
“Increasingly, students go to their corners and come out swinging, if they come out at all,” Shaw said. “But we really want to help create a way for students to have these difficult conversations moving forward.”
The center has also developed its first course, Shaw said, which will go over many of the topics raised by de Castro in his presentation about founding documents, capitalism and “why are we the way that we are 250 years later.”
Center for Civic Education at the University of Northern Iowa
Allison Rank, director of the Center for Civic Education at UNI, agreed that students need to start engaging more with viewpoints they wouldn’t gravitate to usually, and UNI faculty believe the same. That is why one of the events put on by the center was focused on how faculty can foster discussion in the classroom when students don’t want to talk.
It was the best-attended professional development session she’s had, Rank said, and she has already begun working on similar professional development sessions to bring to community colleges like Des Moines Area Community Colleges and Iowa Lakes Community College.
“We seek to be a nationally recognized leader in research, teaching and public outreach for both free speech and civic education, and the way that the center hopes to do that in terms of its vision is about university students, supporting pre K through 12 students, and also thinking about the broader public by developing and implementing civic learning strategies, respectful dialog across difference and educational resources,” Rank said.
As the state’s “teacher training college,” Rank said UNI is working to “specifically foster civic learning among Iowa’s pre-service and in-service teachers” while also aiding in professional development and curricular shifts at other universities.
One way the center is meeting this goal is through a $1.2 million grant UNI received in the fall to establish the Iowa Civic Educators Institute, which will provide professional development, seminars and course materials in American political traditions, government and history, as well as state-focused history and politics.
“We know that what teachers want is sort of this high quality, directly connected research that they can take into their classrooms,” Rank said, “and that’s what we aim to provide from this center.”
UNI students are also being engaged by the center through a birthday party for the U.S. Constitution thrown last year and upcoming programming, including a “civic culture ideation session” where around 100 students in small groups will identify issues relating to civics education and what they’re seeing on campus, develop solutions and pitch them, hopefully in a “Shark Tank-style.” The top solutions will go in the center’s strategic plan for the 2026-2027 academic year.
Rank said she is hoping to launch a program which she called the “Challenging Perspective Series,” where two individuals with “distinct viewpoints on a similar topic” would speak before students head into small groups to discuss what they heard. She is currently working on a survey to give to students who participate in center events to learn about their political viewpoint so in future events groups are made up of mixed perspectives.
“I like this idea of consistently trying to have two people on a similar topic that are articulating different approaches to understanding that topic, whether it’s different diagnoses of the cause of the problem, different ways of solving what they both agree is the same problem, but actually modeling for students both having that conversation, ensuring that you got both perspectives at the same time,” Rank said.

The Rozenbooms, like most livestock operators in Iowa, collect the hog manure in on-site lagoons, pump it into tanks and transport it to nearby fields where it is incorporated into the soil as fertilizer. 
Like other medium to large livestock operators in Iowa, Rozenboom has a manure management plan on file with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and he calculates annually the amount of manure, based on the nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen, that can be applied to the field. 
This system, according to Rozenboom, means all of the manure in his operation is accounted for and the cost of fertilizer keeps farmers from over-applying to any particular field. 
“This this isn’t done willy-nilly, like some people seem to think it is,” Rozenboom said. “It’s very precise.”

But water quality advocates in the state say these manure management plans do not sufficiently regulate the massive amounts of manure produced by Iowa’s concentrated animal feeding operations. This in turn, they say, contributes to consistently high nutrient concentrations in Iowa rivers, lakes and drinking water.
Iowa Environmental Council and Food & Water Watch have called for greater enforcement of the manure management plans, an online database of the plans and for farms to avoid over-applying nutrients. 
The environmental groups argue too much of the livestock industry’s waste ends up in Iowa waterways and negatively impacts the health of Iowans and the environment.
What is a manure management plan?
Manure management plans are required in Iowa for any confined, meaning totally roofed, livestock feeding operations with a total animal unit capacity of more than 500 units. 
The plans includes estimates, based on established values from the farm, of the amount of manure, plus the manure’s nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. 
The second part of the plan requires farmers to determine the maximum manure application rate for each of the fields where they plan to apply manure. This amount is determined using information on crop rotation and proven yields to determine how much nitrogen and phosphorus would be taken up by the crop. 
Under the manure management plan, farmers are not allowed to apply amounts of manure that would exceed these nutrient limitations on each field.
On farm records
Manure application records are not submitted to DNR, but are kept on farm in case the department decides to audit a farm’s manure plan. 
In a conversation explaining manure management on his farm, Rozenboom displayed a sheet of notebook paper where his great nephews had meticulously recorded, by hand, the date and amount of manure applied to each of the fields in his manure plan.
Critics of the plan argue these records should be submitted to DNR as part of digital, public record.
Michael Schmidt, general counsel with Iowa Environmental Counsel said records, like air emissions and solid waste discharges are public in “every other industry.”
“We clearly see that some of the nitrogen is getting from these agricultural sources into public water supplies and causing issues downstream,” Schmidt said. “This is an issue of public concern, and so it does not make sense to keep that confidential when people downstream are being directly affected.” 
Daniel Andersen, an assistant professor at Iowa State University and a manure specialist with the university extension program, said this information is not public, likely because it’s viewed as proprietary information for a farmer. 
“Most farms today, I don’t think they’re putting on malicious amounts of manure on purpose,” Andersen said. “ I think generally, fertilizer prices have risen enough, relative to the cost of manure application, that they’re trying to use manure responsibly.” 
Plus, Andersen noted, farmers who rely on commercial, non-manure, fertilizers, are not required to report the amounts they applied, nor adhere to a nutrient limit. 
Because manure is difficult and expensive to transport, it works out that 25% to 30% of all nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium used to support crop production in the state comes from manure. The rest of those needs are met with synthetic fertilizers, according to Andersen.
Schmidt with Iowa Environmental Council said it’s also problematic that manure management plans, while public, are not more accessible. 
Tammie Krausman, the communications director with DNR, said the manure management plans are “available for review at the field offices or via public records requests.” 
Records maintained by the facility to demonstrate compliance with the plans are “statutorily mandated as confidential records” Krausman said. 
Schmidt said this means that even if a neighbor suspects someone is doing something wrong on their field, “there’s no way that they can prove that by checking the records.” 
Rozenboom argued that “spot checks” work in a number of systems to keep players honest. Plus, the economics mean a farmer wouldn’t want to apply more manure than what his field needed.
The way the math works out, the manure he applies is worth about $280 per acre in nutrients. 
“Now, I don’t know too many people, farmers, or otherwise that are gonna burn half their money – they can’t afford to do that,” Rozenboom said.

Andersen said manure management plans typically include more fields than where a farmer typically applies manure to account for a year where they might have more manure than they planned for.
Audits 
While some of the records are not public, DNR can request them from farmers at any time, and they are reviewed by the department in the event of an audit.
According to Krausman, in 2025 DNR staff conducted 745 onsite inspections of animal feeding operations that would have included a review of manure management plans. 
Krausman said DNR has “consistently pursued enforcement actions” since 2020 for animal feeding operation violations like late manure management plans, construction violations and prohibited discharges. 
“A top priority for the DNR is manure discharges that reach state waters,” Krausman said in an email. “All such incidents are referred to DNR Legal Services for review and potential further enforcement action.” 
Since 2020, DNR has issued 97 enforcement actions related to manure management plans and 62 enforcement actions related to prohibited discharges at animal feeding operations. 
The environmental group Food & Water Watch issued a blueprint for clean water in Iowa, with a slew of legislative suggestions that would “ensure that Iowa’s water is drinkable for generations to come.” Several suggestions related to manure management in the state.
The blueprint called for a “publicly available database” with manure management plan data, requirements for DNR to inspect one-fifth of all permitted animal operations annually and a mandate that farms monitor for discharges “during and immediately after land application.”
DNR relies on producers and the public to report spills of manure and other contaminants that end up in Iowa waterways. An analysis from Food & Water Watch, using DNR records, found that between 2013 and 2023, there were 179 instances of manure discharges to Iowa waterways, killing approximately 2 million fish over the time frame.
Food & Water Watch’s proposed solution is to mandate that all large concentrated animal feeding operations require federal discharge permits that are enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Dani Replogle, an attorney with Food & Water Watch, said these permits would give “transparent information” to the public and regulators about pollution entering waterways.
“We need federal nutrient management plans instead of Iowa’s manure management plan, and we need those permits to include monitoring so that we can see what’s actually happening, what pollution is coming off of these facilities, and then have a way to force facilities to make changes when it comes out that they are polluting water,” Replogle said. 
Replogle said manure management plans are a “completely inadequate way to address the pollution crisis” in Iowa, because the plans are written by farmers. 
“It’s really a case of the fox guarding the hen house,” Replogle said. 
A limit, not a recommendation
Andersen said the biggest point of confusion he sees with manure management plans is that producers will often view the nitrogen and phosphorus maximums as an application recommendation. 
“I think for a long time, people thought of it sort of as a recommendation tool – that’s how much nitrogen I should be putting on – and that’s not the case,” Andersen said. 
He explained that while the current nitrogen use factors in Iowa, as shown in part of the manure management plan, range from 0.9 pounds of nitrogen per bushel, to 1.2 pounds per bushel, data gathered from on-farm trials by the Iowa Nitrogen Initiative show that on average, farms need 0.93 pounds of nitrogen per bushel of corn. 
Andersen said these trials give a recommended amount of nitrogen that should be applied, which is lower than the value that most farmers can put on their manure management plan. 
“The manure management plan is sort of setting a limit of where most fields won’t be nitrogen limited,” Andersen explained. “It is not a nitrogen recommendation tool, and shouldn’t be treated as such.” 
He said in most manure-applied fields, farmers try to apply manure as close to the nutrient limits as they can. 
Part of this, he explained, is because it takes about 60 working days to apply all of the estimated manure produced in Iowa each year. Add in rain delays and the time it takes to move equipment and the reality is more like 80 to 90 days needed for application. 
“It’s easy to sit and say, ‘We should legislate so that no one’s allowed to put manure on before X date on the calendar’ but if we don’t have the capacity to do that, we run into other issues,” Andersen said. 
Replogle with Food & Water Watch said in addition to nitrogen and phosphorus running off of a field and into waterways, manure application can lead to other types of pollution. Replogle said things like fecal coliform bacteria, chloride, heavy metals and traces of antibiotics are all pollutants that could be in manure. 
“There’s a lot of other stuff in CAFO waste that is not being accounted for with a manure management plan or a nutrient management plan for that matter,” Replogle said. 
Andersen said when it comes to manure application’s relationship with water quality, ground cover, rather than application rate, is more important. 
A field with vegetation in the ground is more likely to hold on to nutrients, especially during a rain event, than an empty field. 
“Cropping system matters a lot, and we need to try and encourage having vegetation all the time,” Andersen said.
The state-led Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy has encouraged farmers to adopt cover crops and optimized nitrogen application strategies as methods to reduce the nutrient load ending up in Iowa waterways. 
The state has also implemented grants and funding programs to help establish vegetation along waterways, saturated buffers and other strategies aimed at improving nutrient concentrations in watersheds.
A group of Iowa Democrats previewed legislation to improve water quality in the state. The plan did not include farm regulations, but called for a boost in the incentives to farmers and landowners to implement these strategies. 
“I worry less about an individual farm’s records, and more about, how do we generally help support farmers, use manure as a resource, make better manure decisions,” Andersen said. “Because I think generally people are in compliance – our real problem is that people are applying close to that manure management form (limit).”

,California,2026-01-24 00:55:00+00:00,CalMatters,Los Angeles might tweak its ‘mansion tax.’ Here’s why that matters for the rest of California,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2026/01/measure-ula-raman-howard-jarvis-ballot/,The ballot measure do-over is intended to restart apartment development across Los Angeles and ward off a statewide anti-tax crusade.,"In summary
The ballot measure do-over is intended to restart apartment development across Los Angeles and ward off a statewide anti-tax crusade.


To save the City of Los Angeles’ controversial “mansion tax” — and fend off the threat of fiscal calamity across the state — Angelenos need to re-write the law.
That’s according to City Councilmember Nithya Raman who introduced a motion on Friday to put a mansion tax do-over on the June 2026 ballot. The council is scheduled to vote on the measure Tuesday.
The tax, known as Measure ULA, has stuck high-value real estate sales with supersized transfer taxes — 4% on sales of between $5 million and $10 million and 5.5% for anything higher — since it was passed by nearly 60% of local voters in 2022. All that revenue, $1 billion and counting, is reserved for affordable housing development and upkeep and low-income tenant assistance.
The measure has fierce defenders, among them tenant rights groups and public sector unions. 
Apartment developers hate it just as ferociously. Despite its moniker as a “mansion tax,” the policy draws no distinction between single family compounds in Beverly Hills and large new apartment buildings constructed for renters.
In the years immediately following the enactment of ULA, multifamily property sales did see a steep drop compared to those in other cities around the county. 
More recently, the fate of the Los Angeles mansion tax has become a statewide concern. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, a group that advocates for lower taxes in California, is gathering signatures to put a measure on California’s November 2026 ballot that would, in part, sharply curtail the ability of more than two dozen cities to charge heightened transfer taxes like the one in Los Angeles. 
If it passes, it would deal a multibillion dollar blow to municipal budgets in some of California’s largest cities. But even if qualifies for the ballot and ultimately fails, opponents of the measure such as public sector unions and other allies of California Democrats would likely feel compelled to spend millions on electoral offense. A growing number of Democratic lawmakers in the state capitol are eager to avoid either outcome. They hope that tinkering with Measure ULA will defang the anti-tax crusade statewide.
Hence Friday’s proposal by Raman. 
The motion calls for a local ballot measure that would make a series of tweaks to the original tax. The most significant would exempt apartments, condos, commercial and mixed-used projects from ULA’s transfer tax for the first 15 years — removing what has come to be seen by many developers as an impediment on construction. 
The motion would also change some of the rules about how money gathered by the measure can be spent.
At a council meeting on Friday, Raman described the proposed measure as an effort to “protect” the heart of the mansion tax.
“Multifamily and mixed-use housing production has slowed in the City of L.A., lenders are pulling back from the market entirely and there’s multiple efforts to un-do ULA entirely — to take it away from us completely,” she said, directing her message to the crowd of protesters who showed up to rally against any proposed changes to the tax. “There may be different ways of thinking about how we protect this going forward, but I stand here with you in deep agreement with the comments that you’re making.”
Opponents did not seem convinced. 
“Measure ULA is working,” said Joe Donlin, director of the United to House LA, a coalition of labor unions, affordable housing developers and private development skeptics that launched the initial ballot measure, said in a press release. “It’s irresponsible to propose changes without even an analysis of how much it would cost. Why would we give ‘The People’s Billion’ to the billionaires who already have so much?”
The council voted to circumvent the typical committee process and push the motion to a full and final vote at the Tuesday meeting, which begins at 10am.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/090821-Beverly-Hills-Mansion-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-23 19:56:53.583912

ISU English professor Jo Mackiewicz and Jeanine Aune, an English teaching professor and director of the university’s advanced communication program, recently published a study on how prevalent the use of anthropomorphizing, or humanizing, language is when it comes to artificial intelligence programs.
They were surprised to find that AI was not typically described in human terms. Even the use of humanizing verbs like “learns,” when considered in context, did not always treat the technology like a person.
“It’s the exact opposite of what I was expecting,” Aune said.

Aune said the pair got the idea for this research from a conference they both attended. The discussion included the suggestion that educators emphasize that AI is a tool that cannot replace communication principles and practices and to avoid anthropomorphizing the technology when they talk about it.
Iowa State University alumni were also involved in the study, including current Brigham Young University associate professor of linguistics Matthew Baker and University of Northern Colorado assistant professor of English Jordan Smith.
Heading into their research, Aune and Mackiewicz said they both had their assumptions as to what they’d find — that  humanizing the technology would be widespread. Prior research has shown people anthropomorphize when working with robotics, and Aune said they’ve read articles written about how people use and perceive AI that have suggested humanization is happening.
The research team used News on the Web to study language relating to AI, Mackiewicz said, as it includes the most recent data aggregated from news articles originating from 20 different countries. The database has topped 20 billion words, and it includes some of the earliest news articles about AI to recent articles covering the technology.
“When we started to do an analysis of the individual pairings, that’s where the findings became most interesting, because the overall finding was that, oh, they don’t really pair as frequently as prior research or opinion pieces would have you think,” Mackiewicz said.
Words the team was on the lookout for focused on “verbs that reflect cognition,” Mackiewicz said, also known as “mental verbs” — needs, learns, means, and understands are just a few examples. They also narrowed the search to references to AI or ChatGPT, as it was one of the first AI tools to become publicly available and known.
What they found is that these mental verbs are not often paired with the identified terms, and there was nuance to the instances where they were used together.
“AI means, or AI needs, or ChatGPT knows — you put those together, just on the surface, they seem anthropomorphizing, but they’re not necessarily,” Mackiewicz said.
Anthropomorphization “exists on a spectrum,” Mackiewicz said, where a word like “means” could apply to different senses and meanings depending on how it is being used. Other words have different meanings in their common usage or usage by different disciplines, such as “learns.” Mackiewicz said the terms “AI” and forms of “learn” were paired together frequently in the data, which to some would seem to say that the technology is learning like a human could, but to others would mean something completely different.
It’s this nuance that shows why strict guidelines of what words can and cannot be used in relation to AI are flawed, she said, and what advice the researchers would offer instead is that people need to be careful about knowing who their audience is when writing about AI and thinking about how their words could be interpreted.
Mackiewicz said that in a way, this work showed the value of human beings. It’s easy for a computer to count how many times words are paired together, but it’s harder to analyze it within its context and determine the language’s actual meaning.
While it would be a bigger lift than this study, the researchers said they would be interested in studying what language is used to refer to AI in other areas of writing, like social media. This would require them to create their own database and scrape social media for the necessary information, Mackiewicz said, but it could yield interesting results.
While journalists utilize style guides created by the Associated Press or other organizations when deciding how to write on certain topics and receive editing on their writing, Mackiewicz said, social media generally doesn’t follow such rules.
“We now even had some students refer to ChatGPT with a male pronoun, not talk about it as ‘it,’” Aune said. “So I personally really advocate being intentional with the language, so talking about output text and it uptakes the prompt, you could really kind of emphasize that it is a tool that’s really helpful, but it’s not replacing our brains.”

At least 94 Democrats and 153 Republicans have qualified to run in Alabama state and federal elections this year. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)At least 94 Democrats and 153 Republicans were listed to run for the Alabama Legislature in state and federal elections later this year as candidate qualifying ended on Friday evening.
While lists were being finalized Friday, several notable developments emerged:

Alabama Democrats appeared to be fielding their most robust slate of candidates since 2018;
Alabama Republican Party Chair John Wahl entered the race for lieutenant governor late on Friday, after an unexpected endorsement from President Donald Trump;
Former U.S Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Madison, qualified to run for a Huntsville-area House seat;
At least 12 candidates – seven Republicans and five Democrats – will run to succeed outgoing U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who is running for the Republican nomination for Alabama governor.

In addition to the candidates for the Legislature, there are five Democratic and three Republican candidates for governor, two Democrats qualified for lieutenant governor, joining eight Republicans, and a crowded U.S. Senate race on both sides of the aisle.
Wahl declined to comment about his bid for lieutenant governor Friday evening, saying he would have a formal statement on Monday. In a phone interview Friday afternoon, prior to qualifying, he said Tuberville is a shoe-in for the gubernatorial nomination.

“This is obviously Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s race. He has almost cleared the field. The fundraising difference, the polling numbers,” Wahl said. “At the end of the day, though, every race is decided by the voters of Alabama, and we leave it up to the candidates to convince the voters that they should vote for them.”
According to campaign finance reports, as of Jan. 20, Tuberville has raised over $7 million in campaign donations.
Other GOP gubernatorial candidates include Ken McFeeters and “Alabama” Will Santivasci.
On the Democratic side, five candidates qualified for the state’s highest office. Joining former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones will be pastor Will Boyd, hemp businessman Chad “Chig” Martin, former state Rep. Nathan Mathis, and former gubernatorial candidate Yolanda Flowers.
In 2022, 87 Democrats ran for office, according to paperwork submitted to the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office. For the 2026 midterms, there were 94 as of early Friday evening.
“I think a healthy democracy does include more candidates rather than less,” said Alabama Democratic Party Vice Chair Tabitha Isner, a candidate for Senate District 26 in the Montgomery area. “I see more candidates on the ballot as evidence of a healthier democracy, or at least a desire to have a healthier democracy.”

There are eight Republican candidates running for Lieutenant Governor. Current Secretary of State Wes Allen, George Childress, Army veteran Patrick Bishop, Pastor Dean Odle, current Commissioner of Agriculture & Industries Rick Pate, Alabama Ethics Commission member Dr. Stewart Hill Tankersley, Nichole Jones Wadsworth and Wahl who was endorsed by President Donald Trump Thursday night.
Allen sharply attacked Wahl’s candidacy in a statement Friday evening. Referring to Wahl as “Nehemiah Wahl,” the GOP chairman’s legal name, Allen said Wahl’s candidacy would hurt the Republican Party.
“By entering this race, Nehemiah Wahl has, once again, betrayed his obligation to the Alabama Republican Party,” he said. “Instead of living up to his duty to promote Republican values and the success of Republican candidates, he has chosen self-promotion that will undercut the campaigns of Republicans up and down the ballot. Democrats are fielding the strongest slate of candidates in recent history and the chairman of the Alabama Republican Party is giving them ammunition to attack every Republican candidate in the state.”
On the Democratic side, Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery and 2010 legislative candidate Derryl Perryman will run for lieutenant governor.
Republicans qualified for Alabama’s 1st Congressional district include former congressman Jerry Carl, James “Jimmy” Dees, small business owner Rhett Marques, Army veteran Joshua McKee, John Mills, Marine Veteran James Richardson and Air Force veteran Austin Sidwell. Army veteran Clyde W. Jones, Jr., is the sole Democrat running for the seat, left vacant by current Republican U.S. Rep. Barry Moore’s bid for Tuberville’s Senate seat. Moore is endorsed by President Donald Trump.

The Legislature

Former U.S Sen. Mo Brooks came out of retirement and qualified Friday for Alabama House District 20, currently held by Rep. James Lomax, R-Huntsville.
“An elected official and a long time friend, Stan McDonald, asked me to go out to lunch with him. I did, and they asked me, urged me, to run for the state legislature,” Brooks said in an interview Friday. “That was followed up with over a period of time, total of about five or six elected officials asking me to run in the House District 20 position coupled with a number of people who were not office holders, asking me to run and they would, each of them give their reasoning for why it would help the state of Alabama.”
Efforts to contact Lomax Friday were not immediately successful.
Brooks ran for U.S. Senate in 2022 and initially got Trump’s endorsement in the race. But the president withdrew the endorsement as Brooks struggled to get traction and after the congressman made comments at a Trump rally saying that the president had no legal pathway to overturn the 2020 presidential election, won by Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
Three districts have multiple Democratic candidates in seats that have been left by their former holders running for other offices or retiring. House District 74, currently held by Phillip Ensler, running for lieutenant governor, has two Democratic candidates, Jasmyne Crimel and Austin Smith, and Republican Alva Lambert.
Debra Foster and David Reddick qualified for House District 32, currently held by Rep. Barbara Boyd, D-Anniston, who is retiring.
Senate District 2 in Huntsville has three Democratic candidates, Rudolph Valentino Drake, Alex House and Guy Sotomayor, and Republican John Roberts. Current Sen. Tom Butler, R-Huntsville, announced he would not seek re-election last summer.
Isner said the Huntsville-area seat is one the party is focusing on, with hopes of flipping.
“Actually flipping of seats is pretty rare. The balance hasn’t changed much in recent years, but if we’re talking about a seven point swing that puts more into play,” Isner said. “Having more candidates on the ballots has big, long term impacts in terms of civic engagements and Democratic enthusiasm.”
Isner said that the party will measure success in the midterms not by flipped seats, but by narrowed margins. Specifically, it is keeping an eye on Senate Districts 2; Senate District 7, also in Madison and represented by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville; and Senate District 26, held by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road and the subject of a redistricting battle.
In the House, Isner said the party would watch Huntsville-area districts 20 (where Lomax and Brooks will battle); 21 (held by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville) and 25 (held by Rep. Phillip Rigsby, R-Huntsville). The party will also be watching two Jefferson County-area districts: House District 15, currently held by Rep. Leigh Hulsey, R-Helena and House District 47, currently held by Rep. Mike Shaw, R-Hoover.
“Certainly a big reason that people are so interested in elections in 2026 is because we are seeing the possibility of more Democratic victories, as evidenced by other states such as Georgia lending to public service commission seats. Virginia and elsewhere have seen elections that went blue that might not have otherwise,” she said.
While there is not a Democratic candidate for every legislative seat, Isner said recruiting candidates that reflect voters is what the party focused on.
“That’s the other reason that it’s so important to have people running everywhere is because, even if a candidate can’t themselves win, if they can increase Democratic turnout in an area that can help our statewide candidates perform better,” Isner said.
Democrats will also have candidates for every statewide office; all seven U.S. House congressional districts; three Public Service Commission seats; four State Board of Education districts and a seat on the Alabama Supreme Court.

Second homes already pay more, and squeezing them further won’t solve Vermont’s education crisis.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dan Petherbridge: Stop treating camps like a cash cow.","Dear Editor, 



Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, wants to tax second homes at a higher rate to pay for education. 
First of all, nonhomesteads already pay a higher education rate. I’m a retired Vermont homeowner who pays ridiculously high property taxes on my home and camp. 

READ MORE

Rather than spend money on an RV, cruise or elaborate trip, we decided to buy a small camp as our way to recreate and vacation. 
Why should camp owners be singled out every year to make up the ever-increasing burden of education costs, while others who enjoy different leisure activities are untouched? 
Taxes have risen at unprecedented levels, and increasing them even more on our so-called second home—which we can only use about three months a year—may force us to sell and move out of state.
I think people believe second-home taxation is going after wealthy out-of-state families, but many camps are owned by Vermonters. Camps are nonhomesteads and thus treated like second homes and pay higher rates already.
When considering the bill for education, legislators should first look at reducing expenses. These expenses have risen dramatically while the number of students has decreased significantly. 
Expenses need to decrease, not rise. We also need to transition from using property taxes to pay for education toward income-based sources. Property taxes should only fund one’s city or town services, not education. If you want to know why retirees are moving out of Vermont, in my mind, a major factor is taxes.
There needs to be a philosophical shift to deal with the costs of education, not the same old approach, which is not solving the problem. 
We need innovation to solve the education crisis, and taxing second homes is not the answer; it’s a bad idea.
Dan Petherbridge, Essex, Vt.

President Trump’s “America First” agenda is undoing decades of U.S. leadership, alliances and global trust.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peter Welch: The perils and promise of ‘America First’.","This commentary is by Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who represents Vermont in the U.S. Senate.



As far back as the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, our small state has wielded outsized influence in the nation and the world. 
Former Vermont senator Warren Austin was the country’s first ambassador to the United Nations. My predecessor, Sen. Patrick Leahy, worked tirelessly to build relations with people and governments in other countries. 

READ MORE

In Washington and abroad, Leahy found ways to project a positive face of America. His efforts not only helped improve the lives of countless people enduring poverty, injustice, conflict and disease, but also enabled the U.S. to find ways to work together with governments that had previously been aligned with our adversaries. 
Vietnam is an example: Leahy worked to build trust and address some of the worst legacies of the Vietnam War, like cleaning up contamination from Agent Orange and helping tens of thousands of people injured by landmines and bombs. 
Those and other war legacy programs continue today; they formed the foundation for U.S.-Vietnam reconciliation and our comprehensive strategic partnership.
There are many other instances where our foreign aid has been a catalyst for closer relations and partnerships with governments and the world: efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, Ebola, and other infectious diseases; educational and cultural exchanges; the Peace Corps; programs to combat hunger and protect biodiversity and endangered species; work to counter corruption, repression and impunity. 
These efforts required proactive, sustained engagement, cultivating relations over many years with foreign officials and average citizens in those countries, on a bipartisan basis. 
This was Leahy’s vision of “America First.” He and his Senate colleagues understood that what happens beyond our borders directly affects us. To deal with climate change, terrorism, pandemics and other threats, the U.S. needs allies and partners who share our goals.
President Trump’s new “America First” National Security Strategy is the opposite of what bipartisan leaders have spent decades working hard to achieve. In a mere 12 months, much of that work has been undone.
President Trump and Elon Musk dismantled our foreign aid programs practically overnight. Billions of dollars for those programs—which passed with bipartisan support—have been rescinded. 
This has life-and-death consequences for hundreds of millions of people who depend on U.S. aid. Thousands of career Foreign Service officers and local employees at the State Department and our embassies have lost their jobs. They were our eyes and ears, providing objective analysis of evolving threats around the world and building relations with counterparts in foreign countries.
President Trump’s misguided policies extend far beyond U.S. aid. His national security strategy lampoons building alliances in defense of democracy and freedom, while lauding business deals with dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Saudi royal family. 
He is trying to dominate weaker neighbors. His economic agenda hinges on reckless tariffs, which immediately led to a trade war. These tariffs not only amount to tax hikes for Americans and lost revenue for our farmers and businesses; they have also weakened our alliances and partnerships, including with our closest neighbors Canada and Mexico. 
Today, these and many other countries no longer see the United States as a reliable partner and are seeking stronger trade and security ties with our adversaries, China and Russia. 
Last November, 194 countries attended COP30, the United Nations climate conference in Brazil. The U.S., the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, was absent, along with two failed states, Afghanistan and Burma. 
To President Trump, “America First” means mining for as much carbon-polluting coal, oil, and natural gas as possible, including on public lands. 
Meanwhile, China, the world’s largest carbon emitter, sent nearly 800 delegates to COP30, and it is the largest producer of renewable energy technology, including over 80% of the world’s solar manufacturing. President Trump is turning over the keys to America’s future security to the fossil fuel companies and our global competitors.
And recently, with the unauthorized use of military force to capture Venezuela’s dictator Nicolas Maduro, the President has entangled the United States in a costly, open-ended nation-building venture in Venezuela that harks back to the days of 19th-century gunboat diplomacy.  
A year ago, speaking of Greenland, he said, “One way or the other, we’re going to get it.”  Last week, he warned, “We are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not. … If we don’t do it the easy way, we’ll do it the hard way.”  
The President’s foreign policy strategy is rooted in greed and bullying. It breeds resentment and anger, and over time, that will become a dangerous liability. 
We are already seeing the seeds of that, as one foreign leader after another looks for alternative markets and partners. 
It may make an easy campaign slogan, but it is the American people who will struggle to pay the price for his ill-conceived, isolationist policies. President Trump’s foreign policy might be more accurately summed up as “Trump First.” It is certainly not putting Americans first.
Under this administration, our values, our credibility, and our reputation are under assault. As Vermonters, we face a choice: pull the covers over our heads or renew a commitment to global leadership and engagement consistent with our ideals. 
The United States must continue to set an example as a generous nation. We must continue to stand for democracy and freedom. 
Austin did this at the United Nations, and Leahy did this so effectively throughout his Senate career. They showed that diplomacy and cooperation are almost always better than conflict. 
I am working to carry on their vision in the Senate. When we make that effort, we allow for the possibility of better outcomes for ourselves, for our country, and for people everywhere.

(Photo Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)With a massive winter storm just hours away, North Carolinians found warmth and hope Friday in a message of peace from a procession of Buddhist monks.
Thousands of people lined their route as they approached the Triangle area in chilly rain.
This was Day 90 of a 2,300 mile journey from Fort Worth, Texas, to Washington, D.C., to encourage loving kindness and compassion.
The walk is led by Venerable Bhikkhu Pannakara, who urged the audience of more than a thousand gathered at Jordan Lake to concentrate on the present moment, breathing in and out.
“That is mindfulness,” he said. “Do not multitask anymore. Do one thing at a time.”
Renee McHugh of Apex acknowledged it was easy to feel overwhelmed in today’s deeply partisan country. She said this message resonated.
“We’re so plugged into what’s going on in the world that we hear everything now,” said McHugh. “Back in the day, you could kind of buffer it, and you can’t anymore. So when something good like this happens, I need to go see that.”
Frauke Rona-Bowler was born in Germany, but has called North Carolina home for 30 years. Like McHugh, she was hungry for hope.
“I started following them online a little bit, and it’s the only thing of positivity that I see when I’m online, so I wanted to be part of it. It was important to be here today.” Rona-Bowler said.
Jim Curtis drove 50 miles from Southern Pines to hear the monks, and said he wasn’t disappointed.
“I had such a sad feeling about the way things are, and I see a group of individuals trying to make us think better, and I was inspired,” said Curtis.
Curtis said it was encouraging to see so many people committed to peace.
“It is wonderful when you think sometimes, you’re the only one,” he said. “And then I see all kinds of people around me, various colors, various genders, young and old.”
Pannakara told the audience that in all lives there will be moments of suffering, greed, hatred, and anger, but the key is to slow down and quiet the “monkey mind” — the restless, wandering thoughts many people have.
For those still feeling anxious, he offered a simple daily task.
“Every day when you wake up, get a piece of paper out, write out the statement, ‘Today is going to be my peaceful day,'” Pannakara said.
“Write it down, read it over and over,” he told listeners. “Tell the universe that today is our peaceful day, my peaceful day, so that no one can mess it up except ourselves. And please, don’t mess it up.”
As a small token to represent inner peace and a blessing, the monks offered the people gathered to hear them in Apex woven peace bracelets at the end of the program — a wearable reminder to maintain a calm, positive mindset.
The Venerable Buddhist monks and their dog Aloka, who continues to recover following surgery in South Carolina, will continue their Walk for Peace through North Carolina this weekend. A support team is ready to make adjustments in the schedule if the weather becomes too dangerous.

Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) during Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's final State of the State address on Jan. 20, 2026. (Kate Russell for Source NM)New Mexico came one step closer Friday to entering an interstate medical compact that would make it easier for doctors licensed in other states to practice in New Mexico.
The state Senate voted 40-0 to approve Senate Bill 1, the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Act. Supporters of the bill hail it as a critical step in addressing the state’s shortage of health care workers and expanding telehealth services in rural areas. 
Advocates for entering the compact have in recent years faced pushback from some lawmakers. Some Democrats have also been reluctant to focus on more than two compacts at a time, contending that entering several could overburden the state Regulation and Licensing Division.
Lawmakers who spoke from the Senate floor on Friday praised the bill, but were quick to add that they don’t see it as a silver bullet for the many problems facing New Mexico’s health care system. They said the health care worker shortage will persist until the state reforms its medical malpractice laws, which currently have no cap on damages payments. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has made such reform a priority for her final year in office.
“Some have said it’s not a silver bullet. I prefer to say it’s not the only solution,” Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe), one of the bill’s sponsors, said from the Senate floor Friday.
In a subsequent interview with Source NM, she said she thinks that loan forgiveness for health care professionals and affordable housing are also key steps toward solving the worker shortage.
“There’s a lot of work to do and it isn’t just found in one particular piece of legislation,” she said. 
While similar legislation failed in the 2025 session, lawmakers this week praised SB1’s passage and several stressed the importance of entering similar compacts for other licensed professionals. Representatives in the state House on Wednesday advanced nine bills focused on interstate compacts for several licensed occupations, including physician’s assistants, physical therapists and social workers.
Trujillo told Source that several of those multi-state compacts do not yet have enough participating states to be considered “active.” Others have not yet done the proper rulemaking needed to become active compacts, leading her to question whether signing onto them in this 30-day legislative session is the best use of the Legislature’s time.
Republicans in the Senate on Friday showed nothing but enthusiasm for those other compacts, though.
“I would just like to remind this chamber that this is just one little piece of the pie and that we have a lot more compacts lined up, too,” Sen. Steve Lanier (R-Aztec), who’s seeking the Republican nomination for governor, said during the Senate’s discussion of the bill.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bykaterussell-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 19:56:53.583912

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ new appointees to the Board of Corrections moved swiftly Friday to assert control of the panel she’s been at odds with for over two years, firing its attorney and taking over the board’s top spots.
The moves showed the new power the Republican governor has won with a majority on the seven-member board she’d previously clashed with over control of the state prison system. The decisions were met with consternation by members who had been appointed by previous governors.
Sanders’ spokesperson Sam Dubke wrote in an email that the governor chose the new board members for their abilities and “is glad [her appointments] have taken this opportunity to end the Board’s distracting legal issues and focus on the mission of keeping Arkansans safe.”
Board member Dubs Byers said in an interview that he didn’t doubt the new members were “highly competent people,” but said the vote to allow new board members to take the officer positions was still premature. He’d asked during the meeting to hold elections in 30 or 60 days to give the members time to get to know one another.
“They don’t know about the Department of Corrections. They haven’t learned anything yet,” Byers said. “I’ve been on the board now for ten years, and I worked for the [Department of Corrections] for 39 years, and there’s still things … I need to learn.”
By the end of the day, the board had voted to rescind a 2024 vote to hire an outside attorney used by the board in its lawsuit against Sanders.
Friday’s meeting was the first since Sanders had appointed Jamie Barker, Nathan Lee and Boyce Hamlet to the board.
Barker, Sanders’ former deputy chief of staff who left her office to work for a lobbyist two weeks before his appointment, was voted as the board’s new chairman despite officer elections not being placed on the agenda by Byers, who became chair after Benny Magness’ term expired last month. The chair places items on the board’s agenda for consideration.
Barker was voted chair by all four of the Sanders appointees. Watson and Alonza Jiles voted for Byers, who did not vote since chairmen typically only vote to break a tie.
Lee was voted as vice-chair, and Hamlet, who is the chair of the Post-Prison Transfer Board, was voted as secretary.
It did not take long for the new board members to begin undoing board actions Sanders and her allies had criticized. Within two hours of becoming chair, Barker adjourned the board to call a special meeting, initially to rescind the “illegal hiring” of Abtin Mehdizadegan and his law firm in litigation against the governor. The reference to the lawsuit against Sanders was removed from an amended agenda.
Mehdizadegan did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.
The Barker-led board then voted to rescind the 2024 vote to hire Mehdizadegan, 4-3. Mehdizadegan is also representing the board in a separate but related lawsuit filed by Attorney General Tim Griffin, who says the board — then led by longtime chairman Benny Magness — violated public records laws when it hired the attorney.
Judge says Arkansas corrections secretary serves at pleasure of Board of Corrections, not governor

A Pulaski County judge ruled in favor of the board in its lawsuit against Sanders last year. The board sued over state laws passed that shifted oversight of the Department of Corrections’ secretary from the board to the governor, arguing they were an unconstitutional power-grab. Sanders and Griffin have appealed the ruling. The case filed by Griffin is still ongoing.
The special meeting was called with the minimum two hours of notice permitted under the state’s public records laws.
Griffin did not immediately commit to ending his case against the board, which is based on his contention that Mehdizadegan’s hiring violated state laws.
“I am pleased that under new leadership the Board is taking the necessary steps to correct this error. My office will continue to assess the situation as it develops and take steps as necessary to reach satisfactory conclusions in both lawsuits,” Griffin said in a statement.

Tax Appeal Boards are required by state law of every county and allow a citizen to appeal their property taxes. They are to be made up of, at minimum, three people appointed by county commissioners. 
Broadwater County recently had one member die and another move, County Commissioner Debi Randolph told the Daily Montanan, and just one member was listed on their website last week.
Randolph said the county has addressed the issue, but not before Broadwater County resident Linde Hoff ran into a situation where she says she was unable to appeal a property tax bill this year.
When Hoff got her property tax bill this year, rooms were added to her residential home that aren’t included in the house, so she and her husband appealed. Hoff, along with her neighbors, are also in a lawsuit against another neighbors regarding junk on the property. 
That’s important because because during that lawsuit regarding junk, Hoff had a private assessor come to her property and found the neighboring property was devaluing theirs. This private assessment was also used to calculate her taxes, she said.
Tax Appeal Boards are supposed to give citizens a voice in their taxes, and in nuanced situations like Hoff’s, can allow for additional information to be presented to the county.
As Cascade County puts it on their website: “The primary purpose of the County Tax Appeal Board is to review the market value assigned by the Department of Revenue and to determine if the taxed property is correctly appraised at 100% market value.”
And if it’s not, that’s when changes to a person’s taxes can be made.
Hoff learned that the Tax Appeal Board wasn’t functioning while trying to go through with the process of filing an appeal. She was shuffled around between Broadwater County and the state, eventually being told to call Lewis and Clark County about the issue. Hoff said she was told to fill out the wrong form by Broadwater County treasurer Melissa Franks. 
Broadwater County didn’t comment directly on Hoff’s situation, but said the tax appeal process is “confusing” and suggested citizens should use an attorney or accountant.
Hoff did call Lewis and Clark County Treasurer Amy Reeves and was told they can’t pull up that information from other counties, so they couldn’t help.
Hoff was also in contact with the state Department of Revenue. But DOR doesn’t “really play a role in the county’s tax appeal boards,” DOR communications director Jason Slead wrote in an email.
DOR sends a letter out and people have 30 days to appeal, which they need to do through a county form referred to as an “8026,” Franks said. If a property owner doesn’t like the response they get from the Department of Revenue, then there’s a separate form a person has to fill out to appeal it to a county tax board.
Hoff filled out the first form and a state employee did come out to their property, but nothing ever seemed to come out of it, she said. She then filled out the second form, was told there would be a call if something was wrong with it, and never heard back about it.
Now, Hoff said, she was told she has no recourse and will have to wait until next year. The new Broadwater County Tax Appeal board needs to be trained, and the county said they would wait until it was closer to a time they’d meet again. Tax Appeal Boards generally meet between July and August.
There is a Montana State Tax Appeal Board, but that’s an independent board separate from DOR, with members appointed by the Governor. That board handles disagreements that haven’t been resolved in a county Tax Appeal Board, though neither Franks nor Randolph appeared to know this during an interview on Friday, something the state clearly says in a video regarding the process.
Hoff said she feels “insulted,” though county officials did meet with her on Friday, she said. Hoff has successfully appealed property taxes before.
“I feel like I’m being ripped off by my government,” Hoff said, adding that someone needs to “take responsibility.”
 ‘No one wants to take that on’

Board vacancies are not unique to Broadwater County, nor is it limited to county Tax Appeal Boards.
In Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, there are currently only two members of the Tax Appeal board. It’s not for lack of trying — they are looking for someone to fill the position, secretary Jessica Dailey said, but they haven’t been able to do so.
“There’s been a vacancy for quite a while now,” Dailey said. “And I mean, we advertise it in the newspaper every so often, and we just don’t get any bites. It’s almost as if no one wants to take that on.”
And small numbers of board members can also put people in odd situations. In one instance Dailey said, one Tax Appeal Board member had to make the decision on one of the other board members’ taxes. Without any other board members, there was no other option.
“It would have been super helpful if we had another member on the board,” Dailey said.
Some Tax Appeal Boards, though, have no issue filling their ranks. Lake County Tax Appeal Board Secretary Kate Stinger said it’s “probably the easiest board” she’s had to fill.
“I think that’s probably because residents are interested in property taxes and frustrated with rising property taxes and maybe that’s the impact that they can have on that situation,” Stinger told the Daily Montanan.
There has been significant noise on the property tax issue in the Flathead and a lawsuit was filed this week by multiple current and former legislators, including Sen. Greg Hertz, a Polson Republican. Rising property values in one of the most scenic parts of the lower 48 states has been an ongoing issue in the area and second homes in the state are now taxed at a higher rate.
Both Stinger and Dailey said they were seeing significant increases in the number of appeals going through their boards. Franks said she hasn’t seen one since becoming Broadwater County’s treasurer.
Blaine County, meanwhile, recently went through the process of selecting a new Tax Appeal Board member. County Commissioner Miles Hutton said that board wasn’t a huge issue to fill, but others are.
“There’s lots of boards nobody wants to serve on,” Hutton said.
Across the state, many counties have a huge number of appointed boards. In Broadwater County, for example, there’s an airport board, a broadband advisory board, a county compensation board — all intended as a method of citizen engagement.
And if people don’t apply for these positions and serve terms, it doesn’t leave counties with many options.
“We rely on those boards a lot,” Randolph said. “They do a lot of research work for us, and deal with a lot of projects, where we don’t have time to deal with the beginning steps of them, and then they come to us, which is a wonderful community service that they provide.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BroadWater1-23-26.png,,,2026-01-23 18:57:34.749857

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Heading into 2026, Iowans currently holding statewide offices are largely leading in campaign fundraising for state positions ahead of the upcoming primary and general elections, according to recent state campaign finance reports — with one exception.
In the midterm elections, all of Iowa’s statewide offices — governor, attorney general, auditor, secretary of agriculture, secretary of state and treasurer — are on the ballot.
Sand leads governor’s race fundraising
In the race for governor, Democrat Rob Sand, Iowa state auditor, reported raising more than $9.5 million in 2025, according to state reports for the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board. Candidates were required to file their fundraising totals for the previous year, from Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 2025 by Jan. 20.
While the Democrat faced criticism for receiving $7 million in donations from his wife and her family in 2024, these family members did not donate in 2025. The most recent reported $9.5 million came from roughly 117,000 individual donations. These included many small contributions, as well as some high-profile large donors such as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential candidate who donated $50,000 to Sand’s campaign; Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder who gave $250,000, and former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Fred Hubbell who contributed $200,000.
That fundraising combined with 2024 contributions puts Sand at a total of roughly $18 million heading into the 2026 election season, surpassing other gubernatorial candidates on both sides of the aisle.
“Rob Sand didn’t just outraise every candidate in this race — he outraised all of them combined,” Sand’s campaign manager Kyle Buda said in a statement on the fundraising totals. “Iowans across the state and the political spectrum are rallying behind Rob Sand in record numbers because they’re ready to turn the page on ten years of one-party control that has left them behind and made their problems worse.”
There is one other Democrat running for governor, Julie Stauch, who raised $32,078 in 2025, according to fundraising reports.
More Republicans are seeking the nomination for governor in the 2026 campaign season following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she would not seek another term as governor.

U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, currently representing Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, raised the most money among Republicans at $4.3 million in 2025. His total came from nearly 2,000 individual donations, and he ended the reporting period with $3.2 million in cash on hand.
He said in a statement earlier in January he was “blown away” by the Iowans’ support for his campaign, as it set a record for campaign fundraising for GOP gubernatorial candidates during a non-election year.
“Our campaign set this record of $4.3 million raised because Iowans believe in our vision to take our state to new heights and advance President Trump’s America First agenda in Iowa,” Feenstra said in a statement.
While other Republican gubernatorial candidates reported smaller fundraising figures, Zach Lahn — an eastern Iowa farmer and businessman who worked for the conservative group Americans for Prosperity — also entered the year with a significant campaign reserve. While he reported raising $156,931, Lahn also loaned his campaign $2 million and ended 2025 with more than $2.1 million cash on hand.
Former director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services Adam Steen ended the year with less in the bank at $336,073, but raised more than Lahn from outside contributors at $499,975. Former state Rep. Brad Sherman, who entered the race before Reynolds announced she would not seek reelection, raised $201,815 in the reporting period, and Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, raised $40,285.
While Sand has a strong fundraising lead and will not be running against a GOP incumbent, Republicans have dominated recent election cycles in Iowa. Political forecasters like the Cook Political Report and Sabato Crystal Ball are rating the race as “leans Republican” heading into the midterms.
Bird raises $2 million in attorney general reelection bid

The highest fundraiser in 2025 for statewide offices beyond the governor’s race was Attorney General Brenna Bird, who reported raising just over $2 million in 2025 and ending the reporting period with $2.2 million cash on hand. Bird had weighed a bid for governor but ultimately decided in July to seek another term leading the AG’s office.
Democrat Nate Willems, a former state representative and lawyer, reported raising $717,599 over the past year in his bid to unseat Bird in the 2026 election.
Challenger leads fundraising for secretary of state
In the race for Iowa secretary of state, the Democratic challenger, Ryan Peterman, outraised the incumbent Republican Paul Pate. Peterman, a former U.S. Navy pilot, raised $200,784 in 2025 while Pate reported raising $62,104.
In a news release, Peterman said the fundraising totals “reflect a lot about our campaign.”
“I hear it everywhere I go—Iowans are supporting this effort because they want elections that are secure and accessible,” Peterman said. “They’re tired of career politicians, and they’re ready for a new generation of leadership that’s focused on truly serving the public. I am incredibly grateful for the support we’ve received, and I’m looking forward to building on this movement everyday until Election Day.”
Other statewide offices
While there are two Democrats — Chris Jones, a water quality advocate, and farmer Wade Dooley — who have announced they are running for Iowa Secretary of Agriculture, both launched their campaigns after the most recent reporting period. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, who is running for reelection, reported raising $164,942 and starts the year with $315,922 in campaign reserves.
Iowa Treasurer of State Roby Smith, a Republican who was first elected to the position in 2022, reported raising $31,595 in the past year. There are currently no other candidates who have announced campaigns for treasurer.
There is only one statewide elected position with no incumbent in the race in 2026 — the Iowa auditor seat, currently held by Sand. So far, there are no Democrats who have launched campaigns for the office, but two Republicans have launched their bids for the position.
Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer announced in May she would run for state auditor, months after she was appointed to the lieutenant governor position under Reynolds in December 2024. She raised $180,412 since announcing her campaign. Republican Abigail Maas, an Iowa County supervisor and farmer, launched her campaign for the seat in July, and reported raising $35,216. Of that total, Maas loaned her campaign $20,000 in the last reporting period.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sand.newton.2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-23 18:57:34.749857

Under the new AHSAA classification, private schools and public schools will still compete against each other in the regular season but will not compete for the same championships, the first time that will happen in state history.
The reclassification also included dismantling the “financial barriers for private school eligibility.”

In a statement released Friday, AHSAA executive director Heath Harmon said the decision came after discussions with private schools.
“Through multiple meetings with our private school members, they expressed a desire for greater financial flexibility,” Harmon said in the statement. “This model directly addresses those concerns while maintaining fair play for all.”
A message seeking comment was left with Harmon Friday afternoon.
AHSAA was sued by Gov. Kay Ivey and House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter last year over an AHSAA policy prohibiting transfer student-athletes from immediately participating in sports if they receive CHOOSE Act funds. In November, Judge J.R. Gaines did not hear arguments and instead ordered both parties to remediation.
During her final State of the State Address earlier this month, Ivey mentioned what she calls the “Let the Kids Play Act.” She said the law would be carried in both chambers of the legislature to ensure “no family benefitting from the CHOOSE Act is unfairly benched again.”
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that extends tax credits for private school tuition and other non-public education related expenses.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)As debate on the New Mexico Senate floor stretched into Friday afternoon, Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee staff members addressed the crowd in a committee room with an apologetic tone: Committee Chair Sen. Linda López (D-Albuquerque) was concerned about the impending winter storm creating dangerous road conditions, they said, so the hearing on several pieces of proposed legislation would be rescheduled for Monday.
Frequently during debate on the Senate floor, lawmakers reminded one other of the impending storm as a reason to adjourn early.
That didn’t stop some, like Sen. Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho), from engaging in debates over proposed legislation before the Senate. Senate Bill 2, which would fund statewide highway infrastructure projects in part with increased registration fees for passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. It would also allow the State Transportation Commission to issue bonds to finance road projects.
“Adding fees and taxes onto businesses, which are going to pass that onto the consumers — I hear about affordability all the time from those on the left. You’re actually making it worse with this bill,” Block said during debate over the bill, which passed 31-9 with amendments.
Among the proposed laws the Senate Health and Public Affairs committee was scheduled to discuss were Senate Bill 6, which aims to appropriate nearly $547 million for a new University of New Mexico School of Medicine, and Senate Bill 8, which would funnel $650 million into the state’s Behavioral Health Trust Fund. The fund was signed into law after the 2025 legislative session as a way to rebuild the state’s behavioral health system.
Medical compact bill advances
New Mexico moved closer to entering an interstate medical compact Friday afternoon.
The state Senate voted 40-0 to pass Senate Bill 1, the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Act. The bill aims to ease the state’s health care worker shortage by making it easier for licensed professionals from other states to practice in New Mexico.
“This is a big step forward,” Sen. Rex Wilson (R-Ancho) said on the Senate floor. After voicing his support, though, he told his fellow senators that the legislation was not a cure-all for the many health care challenges facing the state. “This is not a substitute for the big issue we need to deal with in terms of revisions to our malpractice laws.”
Fellow Republicans shared Wilson’s sentiment.
“Make no mistake, we are far from truly accomplishing our goals for New Mexicans,” Senate Minority Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. “If we fail to reform our state’s medical malpractice laws, New Mexico will continue to drive healthcare providers out of our state.”
Reading bill moves forward
Members of the Senate Education Committee on Friday advanced the High-Quality Literacy Instruction Act, which would build on the state’s structured literacy requirements in public schools. Senate Bill 37, sponsored by state Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Joy Garratt (D-Albuquerque), has been endorsed by the Legislative Education Study Committee. Stewart told the committee the bill builds on work the Public Education Department has done over the last several years to improve literacy rates and ”attempts to set in framework a way that we can help everybody learn to read in our public schools.”
Suicide Awareness Day
New Mexico’s most recent health data shows a 9% increase in suicide deaths in 2024. Rosella Sanchez, the director of community and stakeholder relations for the state’s 988 crisis line, said she wants more New Mexicans to understand their options for free resources. The 988 phone line is a free, confidential resource for people experiencing mental health crises.

“It’s for anyone, any time, any struggle. It’s not just for suicidal ideation, anybody can call no matter what situation they’re going through,” she told Source NM. “There’s no judgement, no shame.”
Sanchez offered resources in the Roundhouse rotunda as part of the Legislature’s “Suicide Awareness Day.” The line has reached more than 80,000 New Mexicans, she said. 
The state revamped the 988 line in 2022 following the federal passage of the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, which funded the resource for mental health, substance use or suicidal crises. In addition to the phone number, the NMConnect app allows for text messages and provides videos and links to local resources. 
The New Mexico Crisis and Access Line, which answers the 988 calls made in New Mexico, offers counseling, Sanchez said, along with connections to resources for alcohol or substance misuse. Additionally, there is a peer-to-peer warmline to offer a “non-crisis line, for a listening ear,” she said.
Looking ahead
After a busy first week for the legislative session, the halls of the Roundhouse were noticeably less lively Friday morning.
Source NM had planned to cover the Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee hearing Friday afternoon, and will keep eyes on legislation for the new UNM School of Medicine and the Behavioral Health Trust Fund when they are discussed next week.
Also early next week, the House Education Committee will review House Bill 47, which would amend insurance contributions for public and charter schools across the state, and House Bill 24, known as the “Professional Recruitment and Retention Act,” which would aid licensed professionals including registered nurses and dentists with buying a house.
The House Judiciary Committee will also review a slew of bills related to entering interstate compacts for licensed professionals.
Later in the week, the House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources committee plans to hear the “Green Amendment,” a proposed change to the state’s constitution to enshrine a right to “clean and healthy air, water, soil and environment.” House Joint Resolution 3 is sponsored by Democratic Reps. Joanne Ferrary (Las Cruces), Joseph Franklin Hernandez (Shiprock) and Patricia Roybal Caballero and Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, both of Albuquerque. If passed, the voters would decide on the constitutional amendment in the next general election.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)A New Mexico district judge will rule next week on a request by social media giant Meta to limit recording or streaming during the upcoming trial in Santa Fe centered on allegations the company allowed child exploitation on its sites.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez first brought the civil suit in December 2023, arguing in the complaint that Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on its sites, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaint further argues Meta “profits from its exposure of young users to harmful material.” The NMDOJ sued both the social media company and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
Meta’s attorneys told the court in a Jan. 16 hearing that the company had “security concerns” for witnesses who work for Meta, and requested limits on filming or recording the trial “because the case pertains to such sensitive issues that invoke strong feelings.”
The New Mexico Department of Justice countered in a filing that Meta’s attorneys did not follow the proper procedure to request limits on broadcasting the trial and requested instead that the trial allow for video and audio recording.
“Consistent with the spirit of New Mexico law and the transparency protections it provides, the trial in this case should take place in a public forum, with access for members of the media and the public who wish to cover it or observe the proceedings,” the NMDOJ’s motion stated.
In a statement emailed to Source NM, an unidentified Meta spokesperson said the NMDOJ made “sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments” in its lawsuit and said the company will “show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.”
Jury selection for the trial is scheduled for Feb. 2, and arguments are set to begin one week later.

Fans of Vermont Green FC, the popular semi-professional soccer team based in Burlington, may not need a bumper sticker much longer to flex their support out on the road.
The club — along with Vermont State Treasurer and Green fan Mike Pieciak — is asking legislators to create a new, specialty license plate featuring its colorful crest. The Senate Transportation Committee held a hearing this week on the proposal, S.234.
Vermont Green got widespread attention last August when it won the national championship for its summertime league, USL League 2, over Ballard FC of Seattle. But the team has also won eyes for its outspoken support of climate justice, immigrants’ rights and other progressive causes since its founding in 2022.
Revenue from sales of the license plates would be shared between Vermont’s Transportation Fund and a new, separate state fund managed by the Treasurer’s Office, according to the bill. Roughly 20% of the money would go to the T-fund, while about 80% would go to the new fund. The latter would likely pay out grants to environmental sustainability projects and outdoor recreation initiatives throughout the state, Pieciak told senators on Tuesday. 
Those are both causes, he said, “that are mission-aligned with the Vermont Green — but also, things that are really critical to Vermont.”
Fans would purchase Vermont Green plates the same way they can get one of the state’s existing specialty plates, such as the ones featuring loons, deer or brook trout that help fund wildlife protection and water quality efforts. The Green — with a capital G — plate would cost $45 a year, paid when one’s vehicle registration gets renewed, according to the bill.
Vermont Green’s plate would be the state’s first to commemorate a sports team, said Damien Leonard, an attorney with the Office of Legislative Counsel. But he noted many other states already sell such plates. New York, for instance, has options for fans of all its major teams — and even still sells one commemorating the New York Yankees’ most recent World Series win in 2009.
Senate Transportation hasn’t decided whether it will advance Vermont Green and Pieciak’s proposal yet. But committee members generally like the idea, said Sen. Richie Westman, R-Lamoille, the panel’s chair, on Friday.
He noted that it’s one of multiple license-plate-related measures before the committee this year. In its proposed miscellaneous motor vehicle bill for 2026, the state DMV is asking legislators to nix a requirement in state law that people display a license plate on the front of their vehicles, in addition to the rear. The motor vehicle bill got an introductory hearing this week, too.

In the know
The House and Senate’s Joint Rules Committee set the dates for this year’s crossover deadlines on Friday. Those are the lines in sand by which a bill, at least in theory, must clear at least one House or Senate committee if it has a real shot of becoming law. 
The first crossover deadline is Friday, March 13. But for bills that have a fiscal impact — and must pass through the appropriations committees, or the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee — the deadline is a week later, on March 20.
Of course, bills are never truly dead unless the powers that be condemn them so. Some major bills are exempted from that timeline, such as the state budget. But given that it’s the second year of the legislative biennium, most proposals not moving by this year’s crossover will be facing real peril.

Gov. Phil Scott wants to expand the state’s pre-trial supervision program, which tasks the Department of Corrections with keeping a closer eye on people who are at risk of committing new crimes while they’re awaiting trial. 
In his budget address, Scott proposed a $200,000 increase to the state’s general fund to expand the program statewide. But before that happens, lawmakers will have to figure out why defendants aren’t being referred to the program. 
Only one person in the state is currently under pre-trial supervision, said David D’Amora, who evaluates the program for the Council of State Governments. 
When the program was first piloted in Newport, fewer than 10 people took part in the program, D’Amora told representatives in the Corrections and Institutions Committee Friday. And since the pilot was moved to Chittenden County this fall, only six people have been referred to the program, he said. 
“Why are the numbers so low?” asked Rep. Alice Emmons, D-Springfield, who chairs the committee. The committee will have to bring in defense attorneys and prosecutors to find out, she said.

On the move
The House passed a bill Friday to broaden the state’s power to procure vaccines and issue immunization recommendations. In a roll call vote this morning, H.545 passed with 127 representatives voting yes, 12 abstaining and 9 voting against the measure.
The bill’s approval follows efforts by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under the helm of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to loosen the recommended pediatric vaccine schedule. Vermont’s health commissioner has testified in favor of the bill. 
“Today’s vote on H.545 is another example of the Vermont House of Representatives taking action to protect the health and safety of Vermonters in the face of the federal government refusing to do so,” said House Speaker Jill Krowinski in a statement, adding that the bill does not mandate any immunizations.

Read it here.
Durante décadas, los estacionamientos del Parque Balboa de San Diego estaban abarrotados, con filas de conductores que serpenteaban por los carriles en busca de un raro lugar libre.
 El sábado pasado había muchos espacios abiertos, y el miércoles varios lotes estaban medio vacíos, mientras la gente hacía fila detrás de los quioscos para pagar las nuevas tarifas de estacionamiento.
 Este mes, la ciudad de San Diego impuso las primeras tarifas de estacionamiento para este sitio cultural centenario, lo que provocó confusión y desprecio. Los museos informaron que las visitas disminuyeron un 20 % de inmediato, vándalos dañaron los parquímetros y los alcaldes del condado de San Diego instaron a la ciudad a revertir esta impopular política.
 “Los impactos negativos del estacionamiento de pago en el Parque Balboa han sido inmediatos y mensurables”, declaró Jessica Hanson York, directora ejecutiva del Museo Mingei y presidenta de la Asociación Cultural del Parque Balboa, que representa a los museos del parque, en una conferencia de prensa el miércoles. “Nuestros visitantes lo están notando, al igual que nuestras instituciones culturales y museos en todo el parque”.
 El alcalde de San Diego, Todd Gloria, dijo que las tarifas de estacionamiento proporcionarán ingresos estables para el parque y sus museos, y ayudarán a cerrar una brecha presupuestaria de la ciudad de aproximadamente $300 millones este año fiscal y $110 millones el próximo año.
 “La alcaldesa Gloria, con el apoyo del ayuntamiento, tomó la difícil decisión de poner en marcha el programa el año pasado para crear una fuente de financiación específica para que el Parque Balboa, la joya de la corona de la ciudad, siga siendo un espacio especial para las generaciones futuras”, declaró Dave Rolland, portavoz de Gloria, en un comunicado a CalMatters. “Entendemos que este es un cambio importante, pero es necesario”.
 Reacción instantánea
 El programa de estacionamiento tuvo un comienzo difícil. Las estimaciones actuales de la ciudad para los ingresos por estacionamiento este año representan aproximadamente una cuarta parte de su objetivo original. Mientras tanto, los directores del museo advierten que la pérdida de ingresos por entradas podría superar con creces las ganancias, ya que las nuevas tarifas dificultan el acceso al parque.
“Creo que siempre hemos considerado los parques de nuestra ciudad y región más como algo sagrado que como una forma de equilibrar el presupuesto”, dijo Jim Kidrick, presidente y director ejecutivo del Museo del Aire y el Espacio de San Diego.
 Incluso los días de entrada gratuita se vieron afectados. Los martes, el parque ofrece entrada gratuita a museos selectos para los residentes del condado de San Diego. Este mes, la participación disminuyó un 25 % en comparación con enero del año pasado, lo que la convierte en la asistencia más baja en una década, según Judy Gradwohl, presidenta y directora ejecutiva del Museo de Historia Natural de San Diego.
El personal y los voluntarios del parque están exentos de pagar, pero deben estacionarse en estacionamientos más lejos. Las autoridades del museo afirmaron que esto representa un problema de seguridad para el personal que trabaja de noche y una carga para los voluntarios.
 “Mis voluntarios son casi exclusivamente personas mayores y traen trenes, herramientas y todo lo que usan a diario para operar las maquetas”, dijo Michael Warburton, director ejecutivo del Museo del Ferrocarril en Miniatura. “Es un reto para ellos traer todas estas cosas y luego encontrar un lugar para estacionar”.

 El Ayuntamiento de San Diego está sintiendo la presión. Dos concejales que votaron a favor del programa ahora piden la suspensión de las tarifas de estacionamiento para residentes. El concejal Stephen Whitburn, cuyo distrito incluye el parque, votó en contra de las tarifas de estacionamiento , argumentando que desalentarían a familias, estudiantes y personas mayores de visitarlo. Ahora está redoblando su oposición.
 “La gente se está perdiendo el disfrute y el enriquecimiento cultural del parque, y los museos están perdiendo los ingresos que financian sus exhibiciones y personal”, declaró Whitburn a CalMatters. “Me gustaría que el ayuntamiento llegara a un consenso para derogar las tarifas y restablecer el estacionamiento gratuito en el Parque Balboa”.
 Lawrence Frank, profesor de estudios urbanos y planificación en la Universidad de California en San Diego, quien estudia políticas de transporte, cree que el cambio es inevitable. Frank, quien estudia los efectos negativos de la cultura del automóvil en la salud, afirmó que el nuevo sistema de pago de estacionamiento podría disuadir a los conductores y fomentar el uso del transporte público y la transitabilidad peatonal en los alrededores del parque.
“Es razonable”, dijo. “Es comparable a lo que se hace en otros lugares. No es único. Lo que es único es que era gratuito”.
 San Diego no es el único estado que ha revisado las políticas de acceso gratuito a los parques. El verano pasado, la Junta de Supervisores de San Francisco votó a favor de imponer tarifas de estacionamiento en el Parque Golden Gate para recaudar fondos para su Departamento de Recreación y Parques. Mientras tanto, la administración Trump eliminó la entrada gratuita a los parques nacionales el Día de Martin Luther King Jr. y el Juneteenth, y añadió el cumpleaños del presidente Donald Trump a su calendario de días sin tarifa. 
 La joya de la corona de San Diego
 San Diego reservó 1400 acres para el Parque Balboa en 1868, con el fin de crear un espacio urbano similar al Central Park de Nueva York, inaugurado una década antes. En 1915, el Parque Balboa albergó la Exposición Panamá-California, y su icónica arquitectura neocolonial tomó forma con extensas plazas, arcos españoles, fachadas talladas y azulejos moriscos.
 El parque alberga actualmente 17 museos de arte, ciencia e historia, además del Zoológico de San Diego. Estos museos abarcan desde el Museo de Historia Natural de San Diego, con esqueletos de mastodontes y megalodones, y el Museo del Aire y el Espacio de San Diego, con un módulo de mando del Apolo y aeronaves históricas, hasta el Museo de Arte de San Diego y el Museo de Arte Timken, de acceso gratuito, que exhibe obras de antiguos maestros europeos.
 Lugares más pequeños, como el Museo del Ferrocarril Modelo de San Diego y cabañas internacionales, atienden pasatiempos o culturas específicos, mientras que grupos de artes escénicas, un club de bridge y bolos sobre césped ofrecen actividades recreativas.
 También es un lugar de encuentro para miles de habitantes de San Diego que caminan, hacen picnic o hacen turismo todos los días.
 “Veo gente paseando a sus perros, empujando a sus bebés y reuniéndose con amigos para tomar un café”, dijo Hanson York.

 El estacionamiento tradicionalmente gratuito ha sido un atractivo, dijo Joyce Miller, residente de San Diego y voluntaria del Departamento de Policía de San Diego, en el parque el sábado.
 “Cuando patrullamos aquí, todos los que nos hablaron dijeron que era el mejor lugar porque el estacionamiento era gratuito”, dijo Miller. “Es una gran ventaja para nosotros en San Diego y una excelente atracción turística”.
 El mantenimiento y las operaciones del parque se financian con el fondo general de la ciudad de San Diego, pero Gloria quería crear una fuente de financiación directa. Inicialmente, propuso un plan que, según sus estimaciones, generaría $11 millones para el año fiscal en curso. El ayuntamiento revisó esa cifra a $15 millones, y luego redujo el plazo y la estructura de tarifas, lo que resultó en una estimación de ingresos de $2.9 millones para este año fiscal. 
 ‘La gente está realmente enojada ‘
 Los directores del museo están molestos ante la noticia de que los ingresos del estacionamiento no se sumarán al presupuesto del parque (al menos este año), sino que cubrirán los gastos del fondo general, de modo que la ciudad pueda usar ese dinero para otros fines.
 Los parquímetros cuestan $2.50 por hora y las tarifas diarias oscilan entre $5 y $16. Es menos que los estacionamientos comerciales, que pueden costar más de $30 por día en San Diego. Pero para quienes visitan el Parque Balboa semanalmente o incluso a diario, es excesivo, se quejan los críticos. Es una añadidura a la herida para quienes sufren la inflación, y para los residentes de San Diego se suma a las nuevas tarifas de basura y al aumento de las tarifas del agua.
 San Diego se ha clasificado regularmente entre los mercados inmobiliarios más caros del país, y un análisis reciente reveló que solo el 1.6% de las viviendas en San Diego son asequibles para el hogar promedio. Los precios de la gasolina en California son aproximadamente un 50% más altos que en el resto del país, y hasta el jueves, los precios en San Diego eran 20 centavos más altos, con un promedio de $4.40 por galón, según la AAA.
 En la ciudad de San Diego, los votantes aprobaron por un estrecho margen una medida para cobrar a los propietarios por la recolección de basura , que históricamente era asumida por la ciudad. Sin embargo, el costo final (43,60 dólares) fue al menos un 50 % superior a las estimaciones previas de entre 23 y 29 dólares por vivienda. Mientras tanto, los residentes de la ciudad pueden esperar un aumento del 14,7 % en las tarifas del agua el próximo año y del 14,5 % en 2027.
En otra medida controversial, el consejo aprobó una estructura de tarifas escalonadas, con tarifas más bajas para los residentes de la ciudad de San Diego y tarifas completas para todos los demás, incluidas las personas en otras partes del condado de San Diego.
 Un grupo de alcaldes de otras ciudades protestó porque el Parque Balboa es un recurso regional.
 “He visitado el Parque Balboa toda mi vida y es un valor regional”, dijo la alcaldesa de San Marcos, Rebecca Jones. “Los parques deberían ser gratuitos. Quienes más los utilizan son quienes realmente los necesitan: quienes viven en viviendas multifamiliares”.

 Los visitantes que llegaron al Parque Balboa el sábado estaban furiosos por las nuevas tarifas.
 “Lo detesto”, dijo Caden Mays, estudiante de kinesiología de la Universidad Estatal de San Diego. “Muchas de las exhibiciones son gratuitas; es una pena que el estacionamiento cueste dinero”.
 La caótica implementación de las tarifas de estacionamiento no hizo más que aumentar la animosidad pública. Kidrick, del Museo del Aire y el Espacio, describió el programa como mal concebido y “autocrático”.
 “Alguien debe haber hecho una pasantía de seis meses en ACE Parking”, dijo.
 Los residentes de la ciudad de San Diego tuvieron problemas para inscribirse para el descuento local, y muchos visitantes tuvieron problemas con quioscos de estacionamiento que presentaban fallas y brindaban instrucciones confusas, rechazaban tarjetas de crédito o devolvían a los usuarios a la página de inicio cuando intentaban pagar.
 En represalia, vándalos dañaron al menos 10 estaciones de pago rociando sellador de espuma en las ranuras para tarjetas y monedas, según informó el agente Terrell Totten, portavoz del Departamento de Policía de San Diego. La reparación de cada una costó $400.
 En otros incidentes, la gente rompió las pantallas de las estaciones de pago, esparció pintura verde sobre ellas y untó heces en una de ellas, dijo.
 “Ha habido mucha controversia sobre el estacionamiento pago en Balboa Park últimamente, pero eso no les da a las personas el derecho de destruir los parquímetros”, dijo en un correo electrónico a CalMatters.
 ¿Que sigue?
Frank dijo que la ciudad podría lograr la aceptación pública de las tarifas, pero sólo si invierte el dinero en programas en el parque y en mejorar el acceso mediante el transporte público.
 “Me parece muy razonable que se cobre el estacionamiento, pero debería haber cierta responsabilidad por el uso del dinero para asegurarse de que beneficie al parque y al público”, dijo.

 Reconoce que pertenece a una minoría. Los vecinos lo han rechazado al enterarse de que está de acuerdo con cobrar por estacionar en el Parque Balboa.
 “Esta gente está furiosa”, dijo. “Muy, muy furiosa”.
 Para suavizar el golpe para los usuarios regulares, San Diego ha ofrecido pases anuales de $150 para los residentes de la ciudad y $300 para otros visitantes del parque.
 Hasta el lunes, la ciudad había emitido 2405 pases, incluidos 2236 para residentes, según Rolland, portavoz del alcalde. Gloria también indicó que revisaría los resultados del programa de tarifas de estacionamiento y haría los ajustes necesarios.
 Peter Comiskey, director ejecutivo de la asociación cultural, instó a Gloria a revisar el programa de estacionamiento de inmediato, señalando las advertencias de los directores del museo de que los escasos ingresos por estacionamiento y la disminución de las visitas crean una espiral descendente.
 “Esa espiral descendente podría convertirse rápidamente en una espiral de muerte, todo por unos pocos dólares en ingresos por estacionamiento”, dijo Comiskey. “Como región, como guardianes de este distrito cultural histórico, no podemos permitir que esto suceda”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012126_Balboa-Parking_AH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-23 18:57:34.749857

The National Weather Service in Albuquerque is warning residents in most of northern and eastern New Mexico to prepare for another storm, this time with several inches of snow and frigid temperatures. (Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Meteorologists and state officials are urging New Mexicans to take seriously forecasts of a winter storm hitting the state this weekend.
As of Friday afternoon, most of central and eastern New Mexico remained either under a winter storm warning or advisory, according to the National Weather Service, beginning Friday afternoon through Sunday afternoon.
The warning for much of eastern New Mexico predicts total snow accumulation of four to eight inches, with up to 16 inches in areas at 9,000 feet or higher of elevation. 
Forecasters warn travel will become “very difficult to impossible,” primarily from Tijeras Canyon to the Texas border along Interstate 40. Roads appeared clear in that area around 4 p.m. Friday, according to NMRoads, which offers up-to-date driving conditions. 
Power outages are also possible due to the accumulating snow weight, and temperatures are expected to drop into the single digits, with wind chills below zero. 
‘Snow drought’ observed across the West, amid higher-than-average winter temps

Elsewhere in the state, including northwestern New Mexico and as far south as Ruidoso, between two to five inches of snow or rain are forecast, except at elevations about 8,000 feet, where as much as 10 inches of snow could accumulate, according to the NWS.
On Friday afternoon, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued an emergency declaration, authorizing $200,000 in state funds for the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management to help the public stay safe through the freezing temperatures and hazardous driving conditions. 
“I’m grateful to those working around the clock in extreme weather, and to the New Mexicans who are doing their part to keep themselves, their families and responders safe,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. 
DHSEM officials warned residents statewide in a statement Thursday to expect several days of “frigid temperatures, snow and ice” that increase risks of hypothermia and frostbite. 
DHSEM offered a list of warming centers, but encouraged residents to reach out to local officials for the most current information on the centers. 
The department is also activating its Emergency Operations Center in anticipation of the extreme weather, they said.
The looming snowstorm comes as much of the state and elsewhere of the West experience “snow drought,” marked by higher than average temperatures and drought that reduce precipitation or turn snow into rain. 
As of Thursday, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder, snow covered about 2,900 square miles of land in New Mexico. The median snow cover for this time of year is about 14,000 square miles.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/snow1-scaled-e1769210238171-1024x972.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 18:57:34.749857

Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency proclamation Friday afternoon, saying it would allow the commonwealth to access funds and make resources available to prepare for and respond to impacts from the storm. The National Weather Service said snow accumulations would exceed 12 inches across much of the state by Monday.
PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll said crews were pretreating roads across the commonwealth and would work around the clock to keep them clear and passable when the snow begins early Sunday. But the intensity of the storm, with snow falling one or two inches per hour, means roads won’t be completely free of ice and snow until the storm clears, he said. 
“For us, the rate of snowfall is as important as the amount of overall snow,” Carroll said in a news conference with other public safety and transportation officials Friday.

PennDOT is imposing a Tier 4 travel restriction, which prohibits commercial motor vehicles on the highways. Also prohibited are school buses, motor coaches, motorcycles, recreational vehicles/motorhomes and passenger vehicles towing trailers.
The weather system formed Friday in the Rocky Mountains and southern Great Plains. It is forecast to spread snow and ice across a swath of the eastern half of the country this weekend, continuing into next week. It will be accompanied by bitter cold temperatures through next week, with high temperatures in the teens and low 20s.
“We know that this storm is or has the potential to have major impacts across the commonwealth, not just during the storm, but for days afterward,” Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency Director Randy Padfield said.
PEMA is coordinating with state and federal agencies and county emergency officials to review likely impacts from the storm and assess the state’s readiness. The agency has opened its Commonwealth Response Coordination Center, where multiple state agencies and other organizations can work together efficiently, Padfield said.
But, Padfield stressed, preparedness begins with the public.
“The sad fact is that despite our best attempts, this storm will most likely result in tragedy somewhere in the commonwealth,” he said.
Padfield noted vehicle crashes, house fires from improvised heating sources and stress on heating systems and carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use during power outages are common causes of injury and death in winter weather.
He urged Pennsylvanians to be prepared for themselves and their families, check on neighbors and relatives and look out for their communities. Padfield noted little things, such as ensuring fire hydrants are cleared of snow, can save crucial minutes in an emergency.
Pennsylvanians looking for guidance on how to prepare for weather emergencies should visit ready.pa.gov, he said.
Carroll noted that while the storm is not expected to meet the National Weather Service’s criteria for blizzard conditions, conditions Sunday will be blizzard-like. He urged people to stay at home and not drive. If travel is unavoidable, motorists should visit www.511PA.com to check road conditions. The site also shows the location of snow plows, he said.
In addition to interstate highways, the Pennsylvania Turnpike and its extensions, the following roads are covered by the travel restriction:

The bill would also ban camping and “symbolic” tents from overnight use on state property. It would allow the state to hold tents or other items left on state property in violation of the code for up to 90 days. 
Idaho state legislator Bruce Skaug (Courtesy of the Idaho Legislature)
Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, introduced the bill Friday in the House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee. 
He said the bill “enhances that security” provided by the Department of Administration and state police. 
If passed by the Legislature and approved by the governor, the bill would allow individuals to be banned from Capitol and Supreme Court buildings for one year, if the person: 

Refused to comply with lawful orders of government officials or law enforcement
Violated one or more laws, rules, more regulations governing conduct in those buildings
Threatened to or disrupted conduct of “legitimate government business,” or,   
Threatened the safety of people or the property 

The determination of whether to ban someone could be made at “the sole discretion” of the director of the administration department or ISP, or their designees. 
If someone was banned, they would need to contact the Department of Administration security office if they have “legitimate business” to conduct on the property they are banned from. Those who violate the ban would be charged with criminal trespass. 
The ban on symbolic tents would mean that any tents or other “enclosed structures” would need to be removed from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., unless other rules are created by the Department of Administration. 
In 2022, a large encampment was erected near the state Capitol in Boise to raise awareness about challenges related to homelessness. Gov. Brad Little and then-attorney general Lawrence Wasden sued to remove the protesters, BoiseDev reported. 
In 2025, the Legislature passed a bill criminalizing sleeping outside or in cars on public property in large cities. 
Under Skaug’s bill, camping would be banned outright. The legislation’s definition of camping includes erecting tents or other enclosed structures as a “temporary or permanent place of dwelling, lodging, residence, or living accommodation.” The ban may include storage of personal items, food, cooking, sleeping or laying out a sleeping bag or blanket. 
The code would allow non-enclosed shelters, such as a canopy without side walls, to be erected “as long as it is not used for sleeping or camping.” 
Anything left unattended on state property in violation of these regulations would be subject to the agency taking those items and holding them for up to 90 days. The agency could charge a “reasonable storage fee” when the person comes to claim their items. 
The committee on Friday voted to introduce the bill Friday with no discussion. Its introduction means the bill may come back to the committee for a public hearing and vote.

Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, sent a letter to leaders at Iowa’s private universities Thursday urging them to require three-semester-hour courses in American history and government for all students — a change he is trying to make law for public institutions.
“For too long, we have seen a gradual erosion of foundational knowledge about our nation’s history, its founding principles, and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship,” Collins said in the letter. “Restoring a robust understanding of American history and civics is essential not only in producing informed citizens, but also to fulfilling the mission of a true liberal arts education.”

Legislation has moved out of subcommittee in both the Iowa Senate and House of Representatives that would require universities governed by the Iowa Board of Regents to include American history and government courses in their general education criteria.
Described in a press release sent out with the letter as “forthcoming law,” Collins said in the letter that when state universities adopt these rules, the state’s community college system will “develop parallel courses that satisfy the same requirements” to ensure a seamless transfer of credits.
Private universities are not included in the bill, but Collins said in the letter having them align their requirements would “preserve maximum flexibility for students who transfer between the many institutions of higher education in our state.” He added that he and his staff are ready to begin discussions on the topic with university faculty, provosts and other “stakeholders.”
Iowa Association of Independent Colleges and Universities President Gary Steinke commended Collins for leaving private universities out of the general education requirements legislation, saying their curriculum “is the sole responsibility of each of our private institutions and nobody else’s.”
Most of Iowa’s private institutions are already having students participate in civic learning in one way or another, Steinke said, often implemented as community engagement and volunteering opportunities.
“Do you have to offer curriculum, and do students have to take classes in American history in order to learn what a great country this is? No, you don’t need to take classes to do that,” Steinke said. “And it’s oftentimes better if you don’t.”

Burlington’s Howard Center intends to shut down its sterile syringe distribution program, and the services surrounding it, this summer, according to a letter from its CEO and confirmed by the Health Department.
The Safe Recovery Program is one arm of the substance use treatment, mental health treatment, and developmental disabilities services that the Burlington nonprofit offers. The program provides people with free, sterile needles to prevent the spread of blood-borne disease. It also offers narcan, drug testing strips, overdose prevention training, and linkages to care management. The Safe Recovery Program also hosts a clinic, offers Hepatitis A/B vaccination and testing, as well as medications for opioid use disorder. They provide counseling and care management.
All of these programs are set to shutter this summer, when the Howard Center’s current contract for the syringe services program with the Vermont Agency of Human Services ends on June 30. The center will continue offering its other services for mental health care, developmental disabilities services and substance use treatment.

“This decision is not a reflection of the importance or effectiveness” of syringe services programs, Howard Center CEO Sandra McGuire wrote in an email Thursday to Chittenden County lawmakers and Burlington city officials. “Rather, it reflects Howard Center’s need to steward our limited resources in those areas where Howard Center is best positioned to make a significant impact in the future.” 
Six employees will be affected by the closure, but offered other positions within the Howard Center to avoid layoffs, according to Katherine Levasseur, a spokesperson for the center.
The nonprofit center is the state’s designated agency for mental health and developmental disability services in Chittenden County — meaning it receives state funds to coordinate this care locally. But it has faced consistent challenges with the high costs of staffing and operating its other programs that support people with mental health challenges and substance use disorders. 
In July, the center announced it would cut over 50 staff roles and tighten some programming, citing years of multimillion dollar operating deficits. 
The syringe service program has been controversial in Burlington, with many neighbors concerned about how many syringes end up as litter and not properly discarded or returned to the center. 
The Howard Canter and the Vermont Department of Health reaffirmed they are working to transition the syringe service program to other providers. 
“Ensuring access to these services and a responsible transition for the people who rely on them is extremely important to us,” McGuire wrote in her Thursday email, citing that the center has been working with for “several months” to continue the service elsewhere.  
The state said it learned of the Howard Center’s intention not to renew its contract on Wednesday. 
Kyle Casteel, a spokesperson for the department, said that the Health Department will continue working internally and with other community providers to prevent any interruption in local access to these services that fell under the Howard Center Safe Recovery Program. 
The state provides Syringe Service Program funding to three other organizations in Vermont, including Vermont Cares, which already operates some mobile services in parts of Chittenden County.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-23 22:49:38+00:00,Mississippi Today,AMA recap: School choice debate heats up,Mississippi Today,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/23/ama-recap-school-choice/,Mississippi Today education reporter Devna Bose (left) and political reporter Michael Goldberg answered readers' questions about school choice online.,"The state Legislature kicked off its current session with a heavy focus on school choice, or expanding K-12 options beyond traditional public schools. 
Those conversations, and related policies, address a broad swath of policies such as expanding charter school accessibility and using public funds to pay for private-school tuition. Both chambers want to expand school choice in Mississippi over the next three months, but they don’t agree on how. 
Mississippi Today education reporter Devna Bose and political reporter Michael Goldberg have been at the state Capitol reporting on those and other education policy discussions since the session began. 
On Jan. 16, Bose and Goldberg answered questions from readers on Reddit and Facebook. The following are some highlights from those conversations. 
If you want to be alerted about future AMAs with our reporters, sign up here.
Some questions have been edited for length and clarity.
Q: We were promised that charter schools would thrive where districts were performing poorly. How have charter schools scored over the last few years compared to the public schools near them?
Click for the answer.
The latest state accountability scores show that six out of seven of Mississippi’s charter schools that were graded this past year are rated a D or F. But all of the state’s charter schools are located in the Jackson metro area or the Delta — areas with economically disadvantaged populations and adverse socioeconomic conditions. Charter school leaders say they struggle for the same reasons the local public school districts struggle. 
Experts who met with the Mississippi Legislature last year said the most robust and successful charter sectors are well funded and less limited than they are in Mississippi. Current state law only allows new charter schools in areas where the local public school district is rated a D or F. Those experts encouraged lawmakers to loosen charter regulations, but the Senate appeared hesitant to do so when the state’s current charter schools are rated poorly.  — Devna

Q: Why are lawmakers singling out Copiah County School District and Hazlehurst City School District, and FORCING a school board consolidation?
Click for the answer.
I can’t say why these specific districts are targeted in House Bill 2. Hazlehurst is a C-rated district and Copiah is a B-rated district. House Education Chairman Rob Roberson told us that the consolidation proposal could be used as a model for future district consolidations. The House may want to test the waters with these districts before considering wider reaching consolidation measures in the future.  
The potential for school closures as a result of district consolidation has been a fear cited by many parents in rural areas. HB 2 would not require school closures even if the districts that govern these schools are abolished. — Michael

Q: Will private schools be required to accept all students who want to attend? Will private schools have public financial reports so taxpayers can see where their money is going?
Click for the answer.
No, even if they accept the public dollars, private schools will not be required to accept all students. Very little will change about the way private schools conduct business under this program. 
But lawmakers have expressed concern about the House education savings account program’s price tag after reviewing what happened when similar programs in other states ballooned in participation and costs. That’s why, House leaders say, they’ve capped the program at 12,500 students in the first year, and there’s a slow rollout every year after that. — Devna

Q: How are private schools that receive funding originally allocated to public schools going to be held accountable? Why are they not held to the same methods (state tests and accountability model) that public schools use?
Click for the answer.
Proponents of HB 2 have acknowledged that private schools would not be subject to the same accountability standards as public schools even though this bill would send taxpayer dollars to private schools. That was the central criticism of the bill during the House debate on Jan. 15. This element of the legislation raises questions about whether some private schools might end up maintaining poor standards on the public’s dime.
But the bill’s supporters argue parents offer sufficient accountability. They contend that if a private school performs poorly, families can withdraw their children and take their funding elsewhere, creating market pressure that will force private schools to maintain high standards. — Michael

Q: Is HB 2, the House’s school choice bill, constitutional?
Click for the answer.
Parents for Public Schools previously sued the state over sending public dollars to private schools, but the Mississippi Supreme Court didn’t make a decision about the law’s constitutionality. Instead, the court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue.
So, it’s possible that this could go to the Supreme Court again if someone sues. I’m not sure who would have the right to sue, but the defendants would almost certainly argue that these funds aren’t appropriated directly to private schools, they’re given to parents.
Rep. Jansen Owen told me: “We believe it will pass constitutional muster in both state and federal court.” — Devna",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/23162022/School-Choice-AMA.jpg,,,2026-01-23 17:56:54.599985

(Photo by Jason Post/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)I live along the Yukon River, where my family has harvested salmon for countless generations. Every summer used to bring the same reassuring sight: Busy fish camps. Full smokehouses. Families coming together to pass down traditions that have thrived for thousands of years. Happy kids, curious babies, loving grandparents, moms, dads, aunties, uncles and cousins. Each is an intrinsic part of a beautiful summer day at the smokehouse. 
Today, summers mean less time on the river, empty smokehouses and fish camps, and no intergenerational learning. The State of Alaska tells my community and over 50 other Indigenous communities in Alaska and Canada that we are the ones who must stop fishing, we are the ones who must sacrifice, we are the ones who must somehow bear the burden of a crisis we did not create. 
Salmon were the living thread binding generations. Now, they’re a precious memory, one my youngest child has yet to experience. How can this be?
Over the past three decades, by NOAA’s own data, more than one million Chinook and many millions of chum salmon have been killed and discarded as bycatch in the pollock trawl fishery. According to the best available genetic information, at least 114,000 Chinook salmon and 615,000 chum salmon from Western and Interior Alaska rivers – including the Yukon – were part of this bycatch in the past 15 years alone. 
At the same time, runs of Chinook and chum in the Yukon, Kuskokwim, Norton Sound and even historically abundant Bristol Bay tributaries have collapsed. Early numbers from 2025 show no meaningful recovery: Yukon Chinook remain at record lows, chum returns again failed to meet escapement goals and food insecurity is rising sharply.
Our true wealth and health is a freezer of dry fish, half dry, whole fish. Every single part of the salmon holds value and meets the traditional dietary needs of thousands of families and Elders. From the tail to the head, every part is carefully taken care of, eaten, shared, and put away for the harshest and most extreme temperatures. 
Decades of unmanaged and discarded salmon have impacted so many families. People in my region now rely on food aid in places where salmon once filled every smokehouse. Elders can no longer teach their grandchildren what was taught to them. Families are forced to choose between buying expensive store food — if they can afford it — or leaving the region entirely. 
This is an ecological crisis, a cultural trauma, an economic emergency and a public-health disaster. Entire communities — especially Alaska Native villages whose identities are inseparable from salmon — are being pushed to the brink of extinction right alongside the fish.
Yet the State of Alaska and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council act as if nothing is wrong. They hide behind bureaucratic language and point to other agencies or factors as the problem, avoiding responsibility and accountability. They talk about draggers’ bycatch as a percentage of the total of millions of tons of catch, echoing trawl industry talking points that minimize the fact that a small percentage of an enormous number is, cumulatively, an enormous number. 
They ignore what Indigenous people have been saying for decades: when runs are this low, every salmon matters. Beyond that, every egg matters. When escapements fail year after year, entire age classes disappear, and the very survival of a species hangs in the balance, bycatch could be the difference between recovery and collapse.
The State controls most in-river management through the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Alaska’s Governor controls the majority of appointments to the Council — the very body shaping offshore rules. This is not a divided system. It is the choice of the State Administration to, with one hand, give trawlers a permission slip to kill hundreds of thousands of salmon offshore, while the other hand closes our subsistence fisheries and criminalizes us for feeding our families. 
On the Yukon River, the State of Alaska and Government of Canada forced a seven-year moratorium and ambitious escapement goal for Chinook salmon. The in-season fall chum salmon run estimates have been below the minimum drainage-wide escapement goal that does not support mainstem subsistence harvest. We have absolutely no subsistence salmon fishing opportunities.
Hard bycatch limits and adherence to subsistence law could help us save our salmon. Our lives depend on the science of Indigenous knowledge — and putting our right to fish above corporate profits.
Our salmon are being pushed toward extirpation. And so are we.

James Townsend (R-Artesia) in his Roundhouse office, pictured Jan. 22, 2026. Townsend is asking the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene as the New Mexico Legislature considers prohibiting public entities from contracting with ICE. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)A Republican New Mexico senator announced Friday he asked U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and the federal Department of Justice to “engage” or “intervene” in New Mexico as the Legislature moves toward passing a bill prohibiting public entities from contracting with federal agencies for immigrant detention. 
Sen. James Townsend (R-Artesia) posted a letter on Facebook he said he sent Thursday to the USDOJ. It says House Bill 9, aka the “Immigrant Safety Act,” “raises serious constitutional concerns,” particularly in light of a recent federal Court of Appeals ruling involving CoreCivic, which also operates two detention centers in New Mexico.
In that case, CoreCivic sued New Jersey over a 2021 law that company lawyers said improperly banned CoreCivic from renewing a contract with ICE to house detainees. 
NM House committee advances bill to ban immigrant detention in NM

In July, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the state cannot ban private companies from contracting with the federal government to detain immigrants. Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote in the majority opinion that the law effectively seeks to regulate the federal government and to prevent the federal government from carrying out a core function.
Townsend’s letter said HB9 in New Mexico presents “materially similar issues” as the overturned New Jersey law and says the New Mexico bill’s “practical effect would be to foreclose federally authorized immigration detention contracting within New Mexico.”
Two of the bill’s sponsors, Reps. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces) and Eleanor Chavez (D-Albuquerque), did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Neither did Becca Sheff, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who defended the bill during a contentious debate Thursday before a House committee.
But Sheff responded to a similar argument from HB9 opponents during the hearing Thursday, saying that the New Jersey and New Mexico laws are different. The court’s ruling, she said, applies only to the part of the New Jersey law that sought to “directly regulate contracts between private companies and ICE.” 
NM governor will include proposed ban on immigrant detention on legislative agenda

It would not apply in New Mexico, she said, because the bill seeks only to prohibit public entities, like counties, from cooperating. Three New Mexico counties are currently entered into “intergovernmental service agreements” between ICE and private prison companies, agreements the “Immigrant Safety Act” would render illegal. 
The bill, if passed, would not affect private companies’ ability to contract directly with ICE, supporters say. In fact, the chair of the Torrance County Commission, one of the three counties that contracts with ICE, previously told Source New Mexico that his best guess is that ICE and CoreCivic will contract directly should HB9 pass. 
The House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee passed the bill Thursday after several hours of debate. Majority Democrats in both chambers have said they expect the Legislature to quickly send it to the governor for consideration.

After a weekend of projected extreme cold temperatures, Vermont is expected to be hit with heavy snowfall as a massive winter storm rolls over the state.
The National Weather Service is predicting between 8 inches of snow in the north part of the state and 12 to 18 inches in south and central Vermont. Temperatures are expected to drop to well below zero over the weekend and snow storms are predicted to last from Sunday until early morning Tuesday.
“Every truck that we have with a plow and a wing … will be deployed for this storm,” Greg Smith, a district transportation administrator for the Vermont Agency of Transportation, said of the state’s snow removal fleet.
“There won’t be any trucks sitting.”
Temperatures are anticipated to drop Friday night as an arctic front crosses over the state, with wind chills expected to be as low as minus 40 degrees in some areas, per the weather service forecasts. 
But as soon as Vermonters get a slight respite from the subzero temperature on Sunday, the top edge of a massive winter storm that stretches from Texas through the Carolinas and up to Maine will bring the largest snowfall of the season, according to Scott Whittier, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Burlington.
While the snowfall is not anticipated to set any records for Vermont, it will be the largest of the last few seasons, according to Whittier. Whittier has not seen a multistate winter storm of this magnitude hit Vermont in quite some time, he said. 
The weather service has already issued an extreme cold advisory for all of Vermont, and Whittier expects that a winter storm warning and an advisory to drivers to limit travel is likely to be issued for Sunday and Monday. 
Vermont’s unhoused and unsheltered population is most imminently at risk as temperatures drop, according to officials. Emergency shelters and warming centers began mobilizing earlier this week. 
Eric Forand, Vermont Emergency Management director with the Department of Public Safety, said he and his staff have already begun coordinating efforts to set up emergency shelters across the state, focusing on informing vulnerable people of shelter locations. Forand recommended that residents prepare their home heating sources for the extended cold snap and asked that neighbors check in on elderly community members.  
Vermont travelers should expect significant snow on the roads Monday, according to Smith. The Vermont Agency of Transportation will prioritize snow removal on major highways and travel arteries throughout the state, Smith said. 
Smith urged people to limit their travel during the snowstorm, but if needed, to travel at lower speeds and stay clear of snow plows. He added that if a traveler does become stranded, they should stay in their vehicle and call emergency services rather than venturing into the cold. 
Vermont State Police also announced on Friday that troopers will conduct overnight “freeze patrols” on highways over the weekend to look for stranded motorists.
Meanwhile, Smith feels his crew is ready.
“We’re doing everything we can, pulling out all the stops,” Smith said. “But that’s pretty typical for us.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)On the heels of a record-breaking influx of new legislation in 2025, a new bill would limit how many bills individual lawmakers can ask the Idaho Legislature’s research arm to draft. 
The Senate State Affairs Committee on Friday introduced a resolution that would cap lawmakers’ requests to 10 finished pieces of draft legislation from the Legislative Services Office each year. The bill’s sponsor Sen. Jim Guthrie, a Republican from McCammon who chairs the committee, said the limit was not requested by the Idaho Legislative Services Office, which drafts bills for lawmakers.
 

 Number of pieces of legislation prepared for legislators or committees

2025: 1,378
2024: 1,234
2023: 1,155
2022: 1,046
2021: 1,226
2020: 1,053
Source: 2025 Idaho Sine Die report



Senate Concurrent Resolution 114’s statement of purpose says the number of bills legislators have brought in recent years “has ascended to problematic levels,” which “creates logjams for bill drafters and has placed unreasonable expectations on that critical human resource.”
To pass, the resolution would need to pass both the Idaho House and Senate with at least two-thirds support. If it succeeds, it would establish a new joint rule for both chambers of the Legislature. 
Here’s how the proposed rule would work:

Each year, from July 1 to June 30, legislators could ask the Legislative Services Office for a maximum of 25 pieces of draft legislation and 10 completed routing slips, or RS for short. Those are the final forms of draft legislation before they are officially introduced for consideration and become available for the public to see.
Legislation revised in the drafting process would count as one piece of draft legislation.
Several exceptions would apply to: Budget bills, amendments, trailer bills that are essentially add-ons to other bills, bills brought by interim committees, and when exceptions are granted for lawmakers by the leader of their legislative chamber.

In the first week of this year’s legislative session, the Legislative Services Office prepared 179 draft pieces of legislation — more than the first week of every legislative session since 2021, according to the Legislative Services Office’s weekly progress report. But only eight bills had been officially introduced in the first week of this year’s legislative session.
The resolution capping draft legislation requests could return for a full public hearing in a Senate committee in the coming days or weeks, before it would go for a vote in the Senate.

“I am proud of what I have accomplished in elected office, including leading on legislation to ban child marriage; protect women’s health and expand access to care; improve outcomes for young people in the juvenile justice system; and make it easier for people to protect their rights,” Hope said. “I am also pleased to have been part of broader efforts to reduce gun violence, protect civil rights, and provide every K-12 public school student with free breakfast and lunch. And it has been gratifying to see state investments that I supported in public safety, housing, and education improve life for district residents.”
Michigan Advance asked if there were any declared contenders running for the seat prior to her announcement. She said in a text message that the district was a safe seat for Democrats by a wide margin, but was unaware of anyone — on either side of the aisle — who was stepping up to succeed her.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderA federal judge has dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger Friday, placing another roadblock in the path of the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to obtain sensitive voter information from states across the U.S. 
Georgia is now one of at least three states in which federal judges have dismissed lawsuits seeking sensitive voter information.
The lawsuit was filed in December, with the Department of Justice arguing that Georgia’s unredacted voter registration list was needed as part of an ongoing investigation into “Georgia’s compliance with federal election law.”

Earlier this week, attorneys for the secretary of state’s office filed a motion requesting that Georgia’s case be dismissed, arguing that the Justice Department had exceeded its authority in requesting the records, that it lacked the jurisdiction to sue and that the Macon-based court in which the case was filed was the wrong venue.
In Friday’s ruling, Judge C. Ashley Royal sided with the secretary of state, writing in his order that the Macon-based court lacked jurisdiction over the case “because the Attorney General’s demand was not made, and the demanded records are not located, in the Middle District of Georgia.”
Raffensperger had previously sent Justice Department officials some of the state’s voter registration data, but he argued that state law prohibited his office from divulging the Social Security numbers, full dates of birth and driver’s license numbers of Georgia residents. He also maintained that stance in the face of an escalating pressure campaign from some state lawmakers and members of Georgia’s State Election Board urging him to turn over the data.
Raffensperger rebuffs pressure campaign to hand over sensitive voter data to feds

In a statement following the case’s dismissal, Raffensperger, a Republican who is running for Georgia governor, said he is committed to protecting voters’ personal information.
“I will always follow the law and follow the Constitution,” he said in a statement. “I refuse to violate the oath I took to stand up for the people of this state, regardless of who or what compels me to do otherwise.”
The ACLU of Georgia, which was representing nonprofit government watchdog group Common Cause Georgia in their motion to intervene, also celebrated the judge’s ruling.
“We’re relieved that the court has stopped the Trump administration’s current attempt to access Georgia voters’ private information, and we hope this illegal effort will now end,” said ACLU of Georgia Legal Director Cory Isaacson. “Georgians are entitled to confidentiality in their personal data and to trust in the voting process, and we will fight to protect those rights if threatened again.”
The U.S. Department of Justice attorney on the case did not immediately respond to a request for comment, or to questions about whether the Justice Department plans to re-file their complaint in the Northern District of Georgia.
Georgia is among at least 44 states who have received requests from the Justice Department for their complete voter data, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which is tracking the requests. It is also among the 24 states that the Brennan Center says are currently facing lawsuits for refusing to turn over all the requested data, which includes voters’ names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. 
In September, the Trump administration confirmed that the Department of Justice is also sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-23 22:03:51+00:00,CT Mirror,"Amid child care crisis, CT tries new source of funding: employers",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/23/tri-share-pilot-new-london-ct/,Advocates framed the Tri-Share model as an investment for CT employers to improve child care affordability while boosting retention and more.,"Two years ago, Connecticut legislators backed a novel idea: making the cost of child care more affordable by encouraging employers to help pay for it. 
They designed a pilot program for New London County to test a model known as “Tri-Share”, a cost-sharing program that evenly splits child care costs among three groups: employers who volunteer to participate, eligible employees of those companies and the state. 
The program, part of a larger $100 million dollar initiative to support state early education programs, received $1.8 million in federal pandemic relief funds to support the effort. 
The Connecticut pilot is still in the early stages, but businesses in New London County got significant updates this week at an event hosted by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. 
The model has spread to a number of states in recent years as officials try to address the ongoing child care crisis, an issue that threatens to leave a $329 billion hole in the national economy over the next decade and costs Connecticut an estimated $1.5 billion a year. 
Alongside speakers from the state and LEARN, the local organization helping to coordinate the pilot, child care advocates framed the Tri-Share model as a smart financial investment for Connecticut employers, enabling them to help address child care affordability for working families, while boosting employee retention, increasing productivity and improving recruitment. 
“It’s important to look at this when you’re talking about wages or scheduling,” said Elle-Jordyn Sherman, the executive director of the Northeastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce.  “It’s truly like infrastructure.” 
But the program’s success is largely dependent on how many people, both employers and employees, are willing to actually use it. And that will require an increase in both awareness of Tri-Share and adoption of the program. 
A new tool for employee recruitment and retention
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, families should spend no more than 7% of their income on child care. 
Most families in Connecticut are spending far more than that.
Data on child care affordability in the state put costs at anywhere from $14,000 to $20,000 a year, with the exact cost changing depending on things like the age of the child, the amount of time they need care and the type of care a family enrolls in.
The Tri-Share model allows a family’s contribution to shrink by two-thirds. The program is largely targeted at moderate- and middle-income households in Connecticut. Employees who are enrolled in other state child care subsidies, like the Care 4 Kids program, cannot use Tri-Share.
Cost sharing, advocates said, gives both employers and employees flexibility in the process. Employees are able to select the child care provider. 
Employers, meanwhile, can set the specific amount and duration of their contributions to an employee’s child care. Speakers at the CBIA event encouraged New London employers to set their specific programs up in a way that will minimize disruptions to employees and will keep them from sudden financial shocks. 
“There was definitely a huge appreciation from so many employees” who have entered the pilot, said Adrenna Paolillo, the assistant director of early childhood education at LEARN, the educational service center tasked with administering the pilot program and managing the paperwork for local employers and employees. 
“Their children were in a place that they felt comfortable, employees were in a place that found comfortable, and then in turn, they’re hopefully being a really productive employee.”
That is especially important in New London County, where ALICE families — an acronym for households that are asset-limited, income constrained, and employed — are spending close to a third of their salaries on child care. 
“If your employees are paying upwards of 27% of their income, that’s not health care, that’s not food, it’s not housing,” said Kathleen Hollister, the facilitator of the SECT Childcare Collective, a 40-organization collective housed in the United Way of Southeastern Connecticut. “I think that just reinforces this whole need for flexibility to understand that this is what people are experiencing in our community.”
So far, the earliest adopters of the pilot program have, ironically, been child care providers themselves. These providers usually already offer child care subsidies and discounts to their employees, lowering the costs for their children in exchange for their work. Adopting the Tri-Share model allows those providers to pay even less. 
“It saved us money as an employer,” said Linda Fecteau, a business advisor for child care programs and the founder of her own early childhood education business. “It’s really been very helpful for the staff members and as a recruiting and retention tool.”
So far, the pilot program is still in the process of drawing in new employers. In November, submarine manufacturer Electric Boat announced that it would enter the Tri-Share pilot to help employees as the company launches an ambitious expansion effort in the state. 
Tri-Share is gaining national support — and criticism
The Tri-Share model, supporters say, gives businesses the ability to directly assist their employees by helping share a significant expense. In this framework, child care costs are treated much like other employee benefits like a flexible spending account or health care. And similarly to those benefits, employers hope that offering child care support can increase employee loyalty and productivity. 
The model, which first drew attention in Michigan after the state launched a pilot in 2021, is becoming a popular initiative in states looking to address child care gaps in ways that reduce the amount state governments need to invest. Close to a dozen states, including West Virginia, Ohio and New York, have launched full programs or are currently running pilots.
There’s federal interest in the concept as well: members of Michigan’s congressional delegation introduced a bill that would create a federal Tri-Share pilot late last year. 
But the Connecticut pilot, which expects its $1.8 million in funding to last through 2027, faces some visibility challenges as the program gets underway. Around 150 families are currently enrolled, according to LEARN. One of the biggest issues highlighted at the CBIA event was the need to make more employers aware of the fact that the pilot even exists. 
And there’s still a question of exactly how the program will scale and what types of employers will embrace the model. 
Some child care advocates in the state have also voiced concerns that Tri-Share, while making costs affordable for employees working at participating companies, does not increase the number of child care providers in the state and is also unlikely to help many of Connecticut’s lower-income residents. The program also doesn’t address the state’s shrinking child care workforce, which urgently needs more workers.
Some of these criticisms have been echoed nationally, with policy organizations noting that while the Tri-Share model has an obvious impact on affordability for working families, the program is not structured to address a more fundamental issue: supply. 
And on a deeper level, there is a worry that an overreliance on Tri-Share will shift responsibility for addressing the child care crisis from policymakers onto the private market, forcing people to rely on their employers to maintain access to affordable child care.  
“I’ve never been really excited about the idea,” said Merrill Gay, the executive director of the Connecticut Early Childhood Alliance. “If I’ve got my kids in a child care program, and then either my employer downsizes or I’d rather work for somebody else, I now lose the subsidy that made it possible for me to pay for the child care program where my kid is comfortable.”
“It’s not my preference on how we do things,” he added. 
In an interview, Gay said that he is currently focused on shoring up the Care 4 Kids program for low-income families, which is currently dealing with a significant waitlist, and monitoring Connecticut’s new Early Childhood Education Endowment, which will be used to expand funding for various state programs. 
“We’ve been much more focused on efforts that will serve more families and focus on the families who are most in need of care,” he said, noting that the state’s lowest income families will not benefit from Tri-Share.  
That reality was acknowledged at this week’s event, with participants noting that Tri-Share is far from a singular solution that can fix the range of issues driving child care needs in the state. CBIA has also acknowledged that Tri-Share isn’t the only way businesses can help employees struggling with child care costs, noting that employers could explore flexible and remote work options, on-site child care, and stipend programs to help. 
But at a moment where state funding must address a variety of child care system crises, and a lack of affordable child care continues to impact the workforce, advocates say the model is still worth trying.
“The issues related to child care are complex, and no one organization can fix it,” said Hollister. “This is a situation where everyone needs to come to the table and see what role they can play, what part they can play.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2824-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 17:56:54.599985

As part of that same case, the U.S. Department of Justice is objecting to what it views as a request for sanctions against an Omaha-based immigration judge who once worked for Homeland Security and now denies claims for asylum at a much higher rate than her colleagues around the nation.
The case involves the asylum claim of 25-year-old Philander Dambreville of Urbandale, a native of Haiti who has been in the United States since January 2024.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
As part of what the U.S. Department of Justice calls a “routine screening” of Iowa jail inmates to locate potential deportees, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials encountered Dambreville in the Polk County Jail on Nov. 18, 2025.
At the time, Dambreville was facing misdemeanor charges of public intoxication and interference with official acts, stemming from his arrest outside an Urbandale apartment building where police were responding to a disturbance.
Dambreville ultimately pleaded guilty to a public intoxication charge, and the interference charge was dismissed. Before he was released from jail, however, ICE officials determined he was in the United States without authorization and issued an “immigration detainer” on him, essentially holding him in the county jail indefinitely while the Department of Homeland Security initiated deportation proceedings.
Days later, in immigration court, Dambreville was denied a bond hearing at which he could have argued for release while his request for asylum was processed. That denial was based on the Trump administration’s position, adopted last summer, that federal law mandates the detention of all individuals suspected of having entered the country illegally, even if they’ve been living and working in the United States for years or decades.
Dambreville’s lawyer, Jessica Donels, took Homeland Security, the Omaha Immigration Court and the Polk County Jail to U.S. District Court over the matter, arguing that the federal government was denying her client his due process rights and that “without relief from this court, Mr. Dambreville faces months, or even years, in immigration custody, separated from his family and his community.”
Since July 2025, more than 300 U.S. District Court judges in 1,600 cases have rejected the government’s argument, finding the new interpretation of the law is contrary to ICE’s own regulations, its published enforcement guidelines, previous court rulings, and “the overall logic” of the nation’s immigration system.
Even so, Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to use that interpretation of the law to argue for mandatory detention. Immigration judges — who are not part of the Judicial Branch and instead function as administrative employees of the Executive Branch led by the president – are continuing to deny detainees bond hearings unless otherwise ordered by a federal judge in U.S. District Court.
Bond hearing questioned by attorney
On Jan. 12, Chief District Judge Stephanie M. Rose issued a ruling ordering the federal government and the immigration court to provide Dambreville with a bond hearing.
Court records show the bond hearing was held on Jan. 14 before Immigration Judge Alexandra Larsen. At the hearing, Department of Justice lawyers argued Dambreville was a danger to the community, citing his November arrest, and that he posed a flight risk.
According to court filings by Dambreville’s attorney, Larsen questioned why the government shouldered the burden of proof in arguing against Dambreville’s release, and then, without detailing the underlying rationale for her decision, said, in effect, “Whoever has the burden of proof, I find that Mr. Dambreville is a risk of flight and a danger to the community.”
That ruling resulted in Donels, Dambreville’s lawyer, going back to U.S. District Court where she recently filed papers seeking to have the government held in contempt for failing to comply with Rose’s order by denying Dambreville his due process rights during the bond hearing.
Larsen, Donels argues, didn’t articulate how the government had met its burden of proof in concluding Dambreville posed a flight risk and threat to the public. She is now seeking sanctions against the federal government in the form of payment of Dambreville’s legal fees.
DOJ opposes a ‘monetary sanction on the judge’
The Department of Justice is fighting back, arguing that Donels is seeking to hold Homeland Security and ICE in contempt for the decision-making of an independent immigration judge.
“The immigration judge fully complied with this court’s order,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Peyton Gaumer argued in court papers filed Friday. “The immigration judge is not required to document in her written decision the burden of proof.”
Gaumer also suggested Donels’ contempt motion was aimed at Larsen, adding that Donels had cited “no authority in support of the remarkable proposition that a U.S. District Court may hold an immigration judge in contempt of court and impose a monetary sanction on the judge.”
If, Gaumer argued, Donels is seeking only to hold Homeland Security and ICE in contempt, she has failed to show how those agencies’ actions resulted in Larsen’s denial of bond for Dambreville.
Gaumer went on to argue that Dambreville is, as the judge ruled, a danger to the community and a flight risk. Dambreville, he told the court, “has only been in the United States a relatively short time, around two years. He is unemployed. He has no assets. He is not married and has no children.”
Judge once worked for ICE and Homeland Security
Prior to becoming an immigration judge in 2019, Larsen served as assistant chief counsel in the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor for ICE and Homeland Security, according to the TRAC, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research center affiliated with Syracuse University.
From 2011 to 2012, she served as deputy chief and chief of Office of the Principal Legal Advisor in the District Court Litigation Division of ICE and Homeland Security. Prior to that, she served an associate legal advisor for the ICE and Homeland Security.
According to data compiled by TRAC, Larsen has denied asylum in 89.6% of the cases that have come before her, while immigration judges nationally denied 58.9% of asylum claims over the same time period.
In 2024, the ACLU of Nebraska issued a report, Courting Disaster, detailing a list of concerns with immigration court practices in Omaha by Larsen and others.
The report cited the three-minute duration of many immigration court hearings, judges’ repeated failure to advise people of their rights, and the high number of cases handled without attorney representation.
Recently, the federal government’s firing of immigration judges, followed by the hiring of what it calls “deportation judges,” has come under fire, with some legal advocates suggesting the Trump administration is attempting to fill the positions based on political considerations.
The attorney for one Iowa detainee recently cited in court the federal government’s written solicitations for applicants to the position of “deportation judge.”
The solicitation states: “YOU BE THE JUDGE. Help write the next chapter of America…  DEFINE AMERICA FOR GENERATIONS… Preside over cases in federal Immigration Court and determine whether an alien has to leave the United States or gets to stay. Make decisions with generational consequences… Restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system.”

Lawmakers push for improved data collection on greenhouse gas emissions to meet statewide requirements to cut carbon

Instead of launching a shiny new climate program this year, lawmakers are looking at a more concrete means to meet legally binding goals to reduce carbon emissions: data collection. 
A proposed greenhouse gas reporting program would collect data on emissions from fuel suppliers, largely for heating and transportation, which together make up about 70% of state emissions. The Agency of Natural Resources submitted a memo in December estimating the program would cost the state $800,000 to start, and then require an annual $500,000 to pay staff and run a public website.
“That’s a lot of money anytime, and especially right now,” said Rep. Kathleen James, D-Manchester, who filed H. 740 on Wednesday and included the $800,000 budget request.

For Vermonters, the stakes are practical as well as political. Without more reliable data on where exactly emissions come from, some lawmakers lack a detailed roadmap as they debate costly climate policies that could affect home heating bills, gas prices or future taxes. Better reporting, the bill’s supporters say, could help the state avoid repeating past battles over sweeping emissions programs. 
Now, with Vermont appearing to miss its legally binding climate targets and federal support shrinking, lawmakers say credible data may lay the groundwork that bigger policy swings have lacked. 
James planned to take testimony to determine whether the budget request is a fair amount. The new program could be modeled off of neighboring New York, which launched its own program in December. 

While Vermont has taken on a host of climate proposals over the last decade, the state has so far largely failed to meet the requirements set by legislation. 
Since 2017, the state passed: a Renewable Energy Standard that requires most Vermont utilities to get 100% of their energy from renewables like solar and wind by 2030; the Global Warming Solutions Act, which binds the state to cutting greenhouse gas emissions; the Climate Superfund Act, the first program in the nation to make major carbon polluters like Chevron and Exxon pay the state for their carbon emissions.
But recent reports show the state has likely failed to meet legally binding targets for reducing carbon emissions. Legislators have failed to pass programs that could move its energy sectors closer to those goals, and the state’s GOP leadership has proposed bills that would weaken the state’s renewable energy plans. Under the second Trump administration, Vermont lost tens of millions of dollars in funding for clean energy projects on top of expensive court battles brought by the federal government against Vermont’s landmark climate policies.
“We’re on the famine side of feast or famine in the moment we find ourselves in,” Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore told the House Committee on Energy and Digital Infrastructure earlier this month. “We’ve had unprecedented federal investment in climate action, and it’s ending really abruptly. This requires some pretty significant changes in the assumptions about what financial resources are available to Vermont in terms of making investments in climate action.” 
Such shifts, plus statewide issues of affordability, have made lawmakers wary of spending on the programs needed to ensure Vermont meets its climate goals.
“In previous sessions, the legislature has taken up a clean heat standard, taken up a cap-and-invest program, and these are big, meaty policy pieces,” Moore said. “The fact of the matter is we haven’t necessarily done something smaller and more manageable in the short term.”  
A study of the potential data collection program stemmed from the 2025 Vermont Climate Action Plan, a report released every four years that seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote climate resiliency in the state. The Climate Council, a 23-member body of state officials and appointed members, includes the state’s climatologist, a farmer and a high school senior. 
The plan received a strong endorsement from the vast majority of the Climate Council, whose members also backed the financial request from ANR. The exception was Matt Cota, a fuels lobbyist, who did not sign onto a letter supporting the plan. 
One of the flaws in the clean heat standard, relegated to legislative obscurity last session, was the lack of detailed data to build sound policy, James said in early January. 
“No matter what we do in the future, whether it’s cap and invest or something else, we need solid data,” she said.
Cota disagreed. 
“I am not convinced that spending $800,000 of taxpayer money on a new data collection system is essential,” Cota said Thursday. 
Tracking emissions as they move across state lines and between counties is tricky, according to Cota. County-level data would be required by the program, but he said such figures are “not information that suppliers routinely collect or can readily access.”
He also warned of redundancies.
“All gallons are already counted and reported, and this data is publicly available,” Cota said. 
Vermont already collects some fuel and emissions data, but not in a way that lets regulators clearly see who is producing how much pollution. Without detailed, enforceable reporting from fuel suppliers, the Agency of Natural Resources can’t reliably track emissions or hold specific emitters accountable — a gap that lawmakers say must be closed before the state can meet its legally binding climate targets
The Agency of Natural Resources doesn’t need the legislature’s permission to mandate such a program under the Clean Air Act, but Moore said other states that didn’t have their legislature’s endorsement to implement a greenhouse gas reporting rule had faced extensive legal challenges.
“There is benefit in the environment we currently find ourselves in having the legislature specifically authorize this work,” Moore told the committee. 
But Moore wasn’t convinced of the necessity of such a program either. 
“In the moment we currently find ourselves in, personally, I wouldn’t say this is a priority,” she said. She also noted the thin line she was trying to weave. She had been critical of programs like cap-and-invest and the clean heat standard in the past because the programs lacked such data. 
Tracking emissions data is only becoming more difficult for states like Vermont under the current administration, according to Jane Lazorchak, director of the Climate Action Office. 
“In this time of significant federal uncertainty and rollbacks in the data being collected by the Environmental Protection Agency that Vermont relies on for our greenhouse gas inventory to produce annually,” Lazorchak said in a committee meeting discussing the plan, “it would help us move in house the data collection that we now rely on from federal data sets.”

Gov. Tate Reeves on Thursday announced a state of emergency through Jan. 30 in anticipation of prolonged freezing temperatures and possible  sleet, freezing rain and ice, which were expected to begin in parts of the state Friday night and continue through next week. 
The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency has a list of warming shelters on its website. The agency also encourages Mississippians to prepare for the winter weather by preparing an emergency supply kit. 
Hannah Maharrey, executive director of Good Samaritan Health Services in Tupelo, said the organization has spent the last week working to ensure that unhoused people are aware of the severity of the impending storm and have a plan to seek shelter. Though the nonprofit is accustomed to communicating about severe weather in the summer, preparing for cold and ice of this magnitude is a “new experience,” she said. 
The organization has helped several people this week to obtain identification cards, a requirement for some area shelters.  
She encourages people to be proactive about seeking shelter, and for those who don’t, to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they experience health problems from the frigid temperatures. 
“Don’t wait until it’s too late,” she said. 
In Alcorn County in the northeastern corner of the state, A Place of Grace is serving hot meals three times a day and setting up accommodations for people to stay overnight at the Gospel Tabernacle Church in Corinth. Kelly Thornton, the organization’s executive director and cook, said the nonprofit is working with local emergency management services to transport people to the church, where she and others set up at least 50 cots and mattresses.

The organization is planning to continue these services until at least Feb. 2. Thornton said she expects roads to close and recommends people in the area call the organization early, at 662–287-7737, if they need transportation to the shelter. 
Thornton, who lived through the Mississippi Delta Ice Storm of 1994, said the early reports of the looming cold front feel reminiscent of it. 
“It kind of caught people unaware,” she said. “We knew something was coming. I don’t think they really predicted the magnitude of what it turned out to be.”
Roderick Gordon, the director of the North Delta Planning and Development District Area Agency on Aging, said meals originally scheduled for delivery this weekend or early next week to homebound seniors were being  distributed Friday to ensure people are prepared for the storm. 
Schelika Chisolm, who runs Salvation Army of Tupelo, said her shelter will be operating with special rules for the winter storm and the following week, during which temperatures are expected to drop below freezing. However, the food pantry will only be open during its regular hours: weekdays 9 a.m.-2 p.m.
Special rules include allowing people to stay in the shelter during the day, rather than requiring them to leave at 8 a.m. and return at 4 p.m. As of Friday afternoon, the shelter only had six beds available, out of 61. 
“We are going to provide meals and beverages, shelter, cold weather supplies like blankets, gloves and hats,” she said. 
Her team will be out in the community checking on people as soon as it’s safe to do so, Chisolm said.
“Once the roads are clear, we take our canteens (trucks) out, and we try to find those areas where maybe the lights are out, and we distribute hot meals and things of that nature,” Chisolm said. “So, that will be part of the second phase once the storm passes a little bit.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-23 21:44:16+00:00,CT Mirror,GOP’s Betsy McCaughey promises to eliminate CT income tax,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/23/betsy-mccaughey-income-tax-ct-governor/,The Betsy McCaughey campaign for governor of Connecticut opened Friday afternoon in Hartford with a New York tabloid brashness.,"The Betsy McCaughey campaign for governor of Connecticut opened Friday afternoon in Hartford with a New York tabloid brashness, offering quotable critiques of Gov. Ned Lamont, fulsome praise of Art Laffer’s supply-side economics and a recycled GOP promise to eliminate the income tax.
“Right now, Connecticut ranks 48th out of 50 in economic growth, near rock bottom. Gov. Ned Lamont — Moneybags Lamont — claims that the state’s economy is resilient,” said McCaughey, one of three Republicans running for governor. “That’s a lie. This state’s economy is almost dead.”
McCaughey, a Sunday morning host on right-wing Newsmax, shrugged off a report earlier Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that found Connecticut’s economy grew at a 5.6% annual rate in the third quarter of 2025, ranking 4th nationwide. She pointed to dismal ratings by business groups.
She was similarly unconcerned that eliminating the income tax has been a foundation of campaigns by two previous Republican gubernatorial candidates.
Eight years ago, Bob Stefanowski opened his campaign with a similar promise, albeit one made less colorfully, if with slightly more detail in a 10-page plan — and the actual presence of Laffer. Stefanowski lost to Lamont in 2018 and barely mentioned the income tax idea during their rematch in 2022.
In his successful run in 1994, Republican John G. Rowland promised to cut the income tax over five years and eventually eliminate it. Over a decade as governor, Rowland never proposed a budget that would have significantly reduced income taxes.
No matter, McCaughey said. She also would help elect a Republican legislature, flipping control of a General Assembly where Democrats currently enjoy at least 2-1 supermajorities in each chamber.
McCaughey announced her candidacy last week with a video. The press conference Friday was her first as a candidate.
As a Newsmax host, McCaughey has been a friend to President Donald Trump, whose endorsement she would welcome. McCaughey is 77, competing with former Mayor Erin Stewart, 38, of New Britain and state Sen. Ryan Fazio, 35, of Greenwich for the GOP nomination. Lamont is 72.
McCaughey said she is confident of qualifying for a Republican primary, which requires winning 15% of the state convention vote in May, and then the GOP primary in August. In dismissing age as an issue, she borrowed from Ronald Reagan.
“They will choose a battle tested, proven fighter. I’ve got decades of experience. I’m not going to make age an issue in this race. I don’t want to belittle my opponent’s youth and inexperience,” she said, smiling.
Standing in the Legislative Office Building before a color-coded U.S. map identifying the eight states with no income tax and others taking steps to eliminate them,  McCaughey said times have changed. 
“None of them could point to a map like this, in which the other states are doing it right now,” McCaughey said. “This is an unprecedented moment in terms of the competition among states for business growth. You’ve never seen anything like this.”
McCaughey offered no specifics Friday on how the state would manage to eliminate the income tax, other than asserting that cutting taxes generates economic activity that produces more tax revenue, allowing a phase-out she would predicted would take five years. She said she would leave other tax rates in place.
She released a two-page press release that promised a panel of experts who would map out concrete steps based on actions under way in other states. It included a quote from Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform saying, “Five of those states have already passed laws that trigger income tax rate reductions down to zero as growth brings in more tax revenues.”
McCaughey’s personal and professional life long has been fodder for New Yoirk tabloids, and she was playful during the news conference and then in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror.
McCaughey was born in Pittsburgh and raised in Connecticut but came to public notice in New York in 1994 as the author of an influential and controversial critique of health care reforms Hillary Clinton was advancing on behalf of her husband’s administration.
The piece, published by The New Republic, won a National Magazine Award for “Excellence in Public Interest” in 1995, the judges stating, “More than any other single event in the debate, what she wrote stopped the bill in its intellectual tracks.”
Her analysis later came under withering fire over what critics contended were factual errors and wrong-headed conclusions, including an assertion that the plan would have prohibited doctors from accepting private payments for services. But her newfound role as influential Clinton critic won her a spot as the lieutenant governor of New York under Gov. George Pataki.
She had a falling out with Pataki, who jettisoned her from the ticket before seeking a second term. McCaughey briefly became a Democrat in a failed effort to unseat him. All appears forgiven: Pataki recently offered a statement of support for her run in Connecticut.
While she writes a column for the New York Post, the tabloid hasn’t always been kind, noting her difficulty with Pataki and her divorce from Wilbur Ross Jr., the wealthy financier who would become Trump’s commerce secretary.
“The woman who’s most famous for being dumped — first as lieutenant governor by George Pataki, then as wife by wealthy hubby Wilbur Ross — says she wants to be taken seriously in her new role as a public-policy scholar for the Hudson Institute think tank,” Amanda Peyser wrote 25 years ago in the Post.
On Friday, McCaughey said she stood by everything she wrote about health care and didn’t much care about gossip about her love life. She has married for a third time and has lived in Greenwich for a decade. 
“You know what? When you’re a romantic, you can get married a lot of times, right? I’m a romantic,” she said.
As for Trump, an endorsement would be nice, but not necessary.
“I would welcome an endorsement, but I stand on my own two feet. Donald Trump is doing everything he can for America, and I’m going to do everything I can for Connecticut,” she said.
But would she seek an endorsement? a reporter asked at the news conference.
“I don’t have to seek it, honey,” she replied.
What that means was not explained. An aide interrupted.

Oct. 10, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMichigan attorney and 2022 Republican attorney general candidate Matthew DePerno returned to court on Friday to argue whether a private investigator and a computer analyst should be admitted as witnesses in the case against him. However before the hearing had even begun the court determined that it would not make a ruling as it awaited the outcome of a separate but closely-linked case. 
DePerno was indicted in 2023 alongside former state Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City) and attorney Stephanie Lambert Junttila following an investigation into a conspiracy to gain access to voting tabulators after the 2020 election. 
D.J. Hilson, the special prosecutor overseeing the case, alleged DePerno, Rendon and Lambert Junttila coordinated with private investigator Michael Lynch to “investigate” the 2020 election, though Lynch was not charged. 
Judge Jeffrey S. Matis of the Oakland County Circuit Court remanded DePerno and Rendon’s case to the 44th District Court in Royal Oak for a preliminary examination, where the judge reviews evidence brought by the prosecution to determine whether it is sufficient to move to trial. Lambert Junttila, however, opted to move straight to trial.

While DePerno’s attorney, Michael Cronkright, argued that Lynch, alongside Ben Cotton – who analyzed voting machines in multiple battleground states including Michigan – should be blocked from taking the stand in the case, Judge Derek Meinecke held firm that he would not be ruling on a motion to strike the witnesses until a similar motion pertaining to the same individuals is addressed by Matis in the Lambert Junttila case.
While Meinecke acknowledged that defendants must feel as if the case is in limbo, he argued it would be foolish for the court to forgo an attempt to understand the issues Matis is looking at with the same two witnesses. 
He noted that Matis would address the motion at either a hearing set for Wednesday, Jan. 28, or on Feb. 4.
“I don’t think it is a unnecessary or prejudicial delay when we’re talking about weeks, rather than months and months, to try to see if we can get some sort of guidance,” Meinecke said, after emphasizing that Lambert’s case is connected to those before him.
The next hearing in DePerno’s case is slated for 1:30 p.m. on Feb. 27, with Meinecke telling the court he intends to issue a ruling, regardless of whether the matter in the Lambert Junttila case had been decided or not. 
“There is no utility in continuing to adjourn and push and delay, because once again, the court will have been disappointed in its efforts to try to just make sure it has all the best information in making a ruling,” Meinecke said, acknowledging the many delays in the Lambert Junttila case.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6417-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210

(Photo by Getty Images)A state legislative committee is intensifying scrutiny of alleged fraud involving Maine’s Medicaid program, MaineCare, following an ongoing state investigation and a new federal audit that identified $46 million in questionable payments tied to autism services.
During the Government Oversight Committee meeting on Friday, lawmakers reviewed a letter from three Republican members of the committee citing several concerns about fraudulent billing, particularly related to Portland-based health provider Gateway Community Services, and its alleged overbilling for interpreter services. The letter urged the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability (OPEGA) to open a formal investigation into the Maine Department of Health and Human Services’ handling of Medicaid funds.
After halting payments to Gateway in December, the Health Department is conducting a probe into overbilling for interpreter services. Gateway has appealed the notice of suspended payments, and the department will soon hear that appeal. But some Republican lawmakers, including those who wrote the letter, have said they want additional scrutiny on Maine DHHS, alleging that the department is not doing enough to uncover and prevent fraud.
“Based on the letter and based on the concerns that I’ve heard from people, there was fraud, people were alerted to it, and action wasn’t taken,” said Rep. Chad Perkins (R-Dover-Foxcroft) at the Friday committee meeting. “Whether that was intentionally, or whether that was from incompetence, or whatever the reason, I think that’s what the core of the issue is.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determined in an audit released Thursday that the state also made more than $45 million in improper payments to several providers of autism services for children.
Federal government’s investigation into improper payments
According to that report, released by the federal health agency’s Office of the Inspector General, Maine’s Medicaid payments for rehabilitative and community support services for children diagnosed with autism increased substantially in 2023, initiating the audit. The office found that Maine’s payments for autism treatment services did not comply with federal and state requirements, and that the federal share of the improper payments was $28.7 million, which the federal government is asking Maine to refund.
The department “did not provide effective oversight” of Medicaid payments for autism treatment services, the audit found. The report notes that since the program began in 2010, the state agency has not performed a postpayment review of payments to verify that providers complied with federal and state requirements related to documentation, nor did it provide sufficient guidance to providers for documenting rehabilitative and community support services.
The state health department responded to the federal agency in a November 2025 letter agreeing to most of those findings. 
Michelle Probert, director Office of MaineCare Services, wrote at the time that prior to notification of the audit, the office’s program integrity unit “has previously identified the need to review” rehabilitative and community support services.
The federal audit required the state to conduct postpayment reviews of the services providers billed for, train them to improve documentation of those services and instate annual reviews to ensure providers have proper guidance. 
However, Probert also said the office will conduct its own reviews of the identified providers and claims to determine whether violations occurred before paying the federal government back. 
“To the extent those reviews identify overpayments, OMS will recover overpayments from providers and refund the federal share of any such overpayments,” she wrote. 
Lindsay Hammes, spokesperson for DHHS, told Maine Morning Star on Friday that the audit was part of a routine programmatic review that included multiple states, and it was not triggered by any allegation specifically against Maine.
“It should be noted that the report does not include findings or allegations of fraud,” she said. “The audit identified potential documentation and compliance issues, which the state is now reviewing. The report does not question the appropriateness or necessity of services, nor does it allege intentional wrongdoing by providers or the state.”
Gateway investigation 
Meanwhile, leaders from three different DHHS offices — including the Program Integrity Unit that is investigating Gateway — presented information last week to the Health and Human Services Committee on the most common types of Medicaid fraud, and how they investigate and recover funds.
“Maine DHHS takes allegations of fraud very seriously, and that commitment is reflected in our rigorous oversight, transparency, and coordination with law enforcement and providers,” Hammes said in a statement after the presentation. “The Department’s work is governed by a clear legal framework of audit, review, and compliance monitoring.”
The latest Gateway investigation is the third “comprehensive, multi-year audit” of the provider’s billing practices, according to Hammes. The department’s MaineCare Program Integrity Unit analyzed more than 15,000 claims Gateway had filed, and found that the Portland-based community health provider had overcharged by more than a million dollars for interpreter services. 
There were many examples throughout the review when documentation identified the patient
spoke English while charging for interpreter services, the interpreter was a family member, or the record of the patient visit (called a “progress note”) did not document that an interpreter participated in the session despite MaineCare being billed for these services, according to the department’s audit.
The audit also found instances where MaineCare had been charged for services delivered by non-qualified staff, or the scope of the service fell outside what MaineCare covers.
In a Dec. 30 press conference held by Republican lawmakers, Assistant Senate Minority Leader Matt Harrington (R-Sanford) said the department’s investigation into Gateway is “only scratching the surface” of the actual fraud going on in Maine.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/health-insurance-form-1024x6811707346143-1.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210

Patrick Morrisey addresses reporters Friday, Jan. 23, 2026, ahead of a snow storm that’s expected to bring snow and ice to West Virginia over the weekend. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Ahead of a “significant snow storm” expected to hit much of the Southeast United States this weekend, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey urged residents to prepare for “very difficult weather conditions.”
“We want to make sure that you’re getting prepared for this storm and also for any of the conditions in the winter,” Morrisey said during a news conference Friday. “Also if you need help, reach out to that 211 number and get the assistance that you need. Because it’s better to be prepared than to be stuck in a really bad place.”
Morrisey said snow and ice will make travel difficult in parts of the state. 
“We know that in different parts of the state there are some forecasts for snow, it can range depending on where you are from 3 to 7 inches,” he said. “But also, importantly, there might be a line where it’s wintery snow and icy mix, and that could create a very dangerous cocktail that we want people to avoid partaking in.”
Morrisey has issued a state of preparedness for all 55 counties ahead of the storm. 
The West Virginia National Guard is on standby to assist in emergency response if needed, he said. The State Emergency Response Center will be activated and staffed as needed, he said. 
The National Weather Service in Charleston has issued a winter storm for its forecast area through Monday.  
The snow is expected to start Saturday afternoon for much of West Virginia, said James Zvolenski, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Charleston. 
By Saturday night, warm air will change the snow into a wintry mix of sleet and freezing rain. All of West Virginia could see a wintry mix by Sunday morning, he said. The snow will return Sunday night as colder temperatures return with an arctic air mass, he said. 
“So at first, we’re going to get a lot of heavy snow, and then it’s going to turn into a wet mess, mixed bag of wintry precips,” Zvolenski said. “And that’s going to continue, basically ensue an ice storm. We’re looking at pretty decent ice amounts over the two-day period of this whole event.”
From Saturday night to Sunday morning, ice accumulations are possible across the state, with the exception of the Northern Panhandle, he said. The state’s higher elevations will see the most ice — up to a half an inch in some localized areas, he said.
The storm will “for sure” cause “massive travel impacts” and power outages, Zvolenski said.  
“At first it’s going to be a dry, fluffy snow, and it’s going to switch over to a wet, heavy, icy conditions,” he said. “So that’s going to drop down trees and power lines for sure.”
The power outages could be particularly unfortunate in light of colder temperatures that are expected after the storm dwindles, Zvolenski said. The temperature will be in the teens on Sunday, and won’t rise above freezing on Monday, he said. Tuesday’s temperature is expected to be in the single digits, he said. 
“All this wet mess and ice and snow is going to stick around,” he said. “It’s not going to be able to melt. If you’re out of power, God forbid, it’s going to be cold. We’re going to have extreme cold warnings, most likely, for Monday night and Tuesday. 
“It’s just going to be one heck of a mess,” he said.”



Matthew Blackwood, West Virginia’s deputy director of emergency management, said residents should take the following steps to prepare for the snow storm.
“This is about our response as a government, but also about the need for neighbors to look out for neighbors and plan ahead,” Blackwood said.
Before the storm: 

Review emergency supplies including food, water, medications, flashlights, batteries and blankets.
Review backup plans for medical equipment that requires power.
Check to be sure smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors work properly.
Refill vehicle fuel and ensure approved alternative heating sources have adequate fuel and are used safely.
Bring pets indoors and include them in emergency planning.

As the storm approaches:

Fully charge cell phones, medical devices and backup power supplies.
Check trusted weather forecasts and official alerts.
Adjust travel and work plans ahead of time, avoiding unnecessary travel once conditions worsen.
Ensure you have multiple ways to receive emergency alerts (weather radios, mobile alerts, local media).
Check on family members, neighbors and anyone who may need assistance, especially older adults and those with medical needs.

During and after the storm:

Travel should be limited to essential trips only.
Use emergency heat sources only if properly ventilated. Never operate grills, generators, or fuel-burning devices indoors or near open windows. Generators must be operated outside, at least 20 feet away from homes.
Take frequent breaks when shoveling snow to avoid overexertion.
Never approach downed power lines, and report outages to utility providers.

The judges, shown in a September 2024 photo, are from left, Kelly C. Broniec, Robin Ransom, W. Brent Powell,  then-Chief Justice Mary R. Russell, Zel. M. Fischer, Paul C. Wilson and Ginger K. Gooch (Pool photo by Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch).The Missouri Supreme Court on Friday threw out a law passed last year to keep politicians in control of writing ballot summaries and give the attorney general extraordinary appeal power.
The bill was changed too much during its path through the General Assembly, Chief Justice W. Brent Powell wrote in the unanimous opinion. The changes, he wrote, violated the Missouri Constitution’s requirement that amendments should not change the original purpose of legislation.
The original bill contained one section intended to prevent the courts from rewriting ballot language for measures referred to voters by the General Assembly. By the time it was passed, it changed five sections of state law, completely revising the process for court challenges to ballot suumaries and granting the attorney general authority to appeal preliminary injunctions preventing enforcement of state laws or regulations in any field.
In arguments on Jan.7, Deputy Solicitor General Samuel Freedlund tried to convince the judges that changes to how ballot summary cases are managed are germane to the attorney general’s appeal power because the bill, from the start, was designed to amend the process for judicial review of state laws.
“This argument stretches the boundaries of logic,” Powell wrote.
The court considered allowing the changes to ballot title cases to remain in effect, which was the result when Cole County Circuit Judge Danel Green ruled in September. Green found that the original purpose of the bill had not been improperly changed but there was no legal basis for allowing the attorney general’s office to have special appeal power.
The Supreme Court considered whether the bill would have passed absent the provisions for the attorney general, Powell wrote. 
“While it remains possible the General Assembly would have passed (the law) without the amendment…this mere possibility is not enough for this court to save the non-offending provisions (the law),” he wrote.
The decision restates what lawmakers should have known when they passed the bill because what is and is not allowed procedurally has been argued repeatedly in court, attorney Chuck Hatfield said.
Hatfield represented Sean Nicholson, who sued in part because the new ballot summary process is more expensive and creates delays for ballot initiatives
“Every few years, the Supreme Court needs to remind the Legislature that they have to follow the procedural requirements of the Constitution when they pass a bill,” Hatfield said. “It’s not that hard. They need to vote on things separately.”
The ballot summary provisions of the law were written to take revisions out of the hands of the courts. In lawsuits during 2023 and early 2024, the courts rewrote the language for the abortion rights initiative petition, finding the original version written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft “replete with politically partisan language.”
Instead of a judge making changes when summaries are deemed unfair or biased, the law gave the secretary of state three chances to make revisions.
The law was used last year during a challenge to the summary of a proposal to reinstate Missouri’s almost-total ban on abortions. Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green approved a summary from Secretary of State Denny Hoskins after rejecting two previous versions, but that decision was overturned at the Western District Court of Appeals, which issued its own revision.
By throwing out the law, the judges put revisions to a referendum on Missouri’s gerrymandered redistricting plan into the hands of Cole County Circuit Judge Brian Stumpe. Hoskins has already admitted in court through his attorneys that the ballot summary “is close to the line of being inherently argumentative.”
In the effort to save the law, Freedlund during oral arguments asked the court to reject the lawsuit entirely. Nicholson is not working for any initiative campaign engaged in litigation over a ballot title and therefore had no injury, he contended. 
And there is no standing, or right to sue, for anyone to challenge the appeal power because it involved no new expense for the state, he argued.
The court did not address the first argument and rejected the second. While in many cases a challenge could not be sustained if the only expense is for state employees who would be paid a salary anyway, this case is different, Powell wrote.
Lawmakers added the appeal power to the bill specifically to allow the attorney general to challenge a preliminary injunction in the court battle over abortion rights playing out in Kansas City.
Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri are suing the state over laws and regulations that prevented Missourians from immediately accessing abortion following the passage of an abortion rights amendment in 2024. 
Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang found some of the regulations to be unconstitutional under the new abortion rights law and issued two preliminary injunctions.
Immediately after the bill was signed, Bailey used the new authority to file appeals that were ultimately unsuccessful. Those filings, Powell wrote, are a use of state funds that would not have been made absent the new legal authority. 
“In connection with the attorney general’s appeal of a preliminary injunction filed after passage of (the law), tax dollars necessarily have been spent on the pursuit of that appeal when no appeal was previously allowed,” Powell wrote. “This expenditure establishes taxpayer spending.”

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt/Getty Images)Members of the New Mexico Legislature’s Senate Education Committee on Friday advanced the High-Quality Literacy Instruction Act, which would build on the state’s structured literacy requirements in public schools.
Senate Bill 37, sponsored by New Mexico Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Joy Garratt (D-Albuquerque), and endorsed by the Legislative Education Study Committee, would require public schools to administer literacy assessments approved by the Public Education Department for all students between kindergarten and third grade, and would mandate literacy instructional materials be consistent with the science of reading for English and biliteracy. 
Other provisions include requiring schools to notify parents if their K-12 child has difficulty reading and have a plan for both school and home support. For instance, if a school identifies a student has dyslexia, the school would notify parents and create an improvement plan and a read-at-home plan.
“Reading at home to students is one of the best ways to ensure that they learn to read,” Stewart said. “It’s book language, it’s different from talking. It’s vocabulary, it’s comprehension.”
PED would also have to assign literacy instructional coaches to elementary schools in the lowest quartile of reading proficiency.
The bill does not include an appropriation, but according to its fiscal impact report, it would increase operational costs for schools and the PED starting in Fiscal Year 2028.
“We have worked so hard for the last four to five years with the governor, with the Public Education Department, on improving our literacy rates, and they’re going up….We are starting to see real gains,” Stewart told committee members, while still pointing out there is work to be done. “We’ve got implementation gaps all over the state, and this bill attempts to set in framework a way that we can help everybody learn to read in our public schools.”
The K-3 assessments would begin in the 2027-2028 school year with “minimal” impact on instructional time, Stewart said.
Marla Shoats, representing New Mexico Coalition of Educational Leaders, spoke in favor of SB37, but said the coalition has concerns about where PED intends to recruit literacy instructional coaches to work in  underperforming elementary schools.
“Are we pulling high quality teachers from classes?” Shoats asked the committee. “We are strong proponents of structured literacy. The training is invaluable. It takes time to put into practice though, and schools are still implementing and addressing. We ask to give time to fully implement.”
She also said the coalition is concerned about adding to teachers’ already heavy workload, and about funding to implement the bill.
Sen. Anthony Thornton (R-Sandia Park) said he supports the bill, but also voiced concerns about PED having enough funding and staff to implement the various requirements of the bill.
“Are they going to be prepared to do all the necessary staffing to do the assessments for their K-3 screenings?” Thornton asked during the meeting. 
Stewart said the department has time to address staffing needs as the assessments will not roll out until FY2028. She said the only area of funding she is “concerned” about is for instructional coaches. “That is what we still are trying to get into the budget,” Stewart said. 
PED Executive Manager of Curriculum and Instruction Jacqueline Costales added that the PED is “ready to go” and already working on creating a template schools can use to communicate with parents about students’ reading assessments. 
“Our whole assessment team is ready to do what we need to do,” she said during the meeting. “I think we will be OK with the below-the-line funding that [the legislature continues] to provide and is in the budget.”

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The community hospital in southwest North Dakota in financial distress is one step closer to solvency after the Legislature voted to pass emergency legislation this week. 
Senate Bill 2403 authorizes the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to issue a low-interest loan of up to $5 million to nonprofit hospitals in small communities in financial distress. 
Jacobson Memorial Hospital in Elgin, which is operating “payroll to payroll” and in danger of shutting down, is the only institution in the state that meets the program’s eligibility requirements, according to the North Dakota Hospital Association. 
“Once a rural hospital closes, reopening it is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible,” said bill co-sponsor Rep. Karen Rohr, R-Mandan, whose district includes the hospital. 
Hospitals must meet strict criteria to be eligible for a loan, including submitting financial documents to prove the business plan is sustainable. 
Jacobson Memorial Hospital provides care to residents of Grant, Morton, Sioux, Hettinger and Adams counties. Those residents could face drives of 45 minutes or more to the nearest medical facility if the hospital closes. 
“Critical access hospitals are not optional infrastructure in North Dakota,” Rohr said. “When minutes matter, there is no substitute for a nearby staffed facility of professionals who know their community.” 
The bill largely sailed through the Senate on Thursday 46-0. But it was the subject of vigorous debate in the House on Friday morning as skeptics questioned whether the hospital would be able to return to solvency.

“This is a facility that has been operating in the red for a few years, and so far what I haven’t heard is what they plan to do better,” said Rep. Matthew Ruby, R-Minot, who ultimately voted in favor of the bill. “Aside from poisoning the water, how do you get more people sick to get them to come in?”
The hospital’s administrator and a member of the board testified to lawmakers Wednesday that the hospital has worked with consultants to develop a strategic plan. The hospital has already begun implementing cost-cutting measures, collecting additional revenue by taking full advantage of a federal drug pricing program, and parted ways with the former CEO in November. 
“This is going to work,” said House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson. “This is a big deal for rural health care.”
Other representatives expressed concerns the bill, designed for a single hospital as the intended recipient, may violate the state constitution’s prohibition on gifting. Rep. Keith Kempenich, R-Bowman, said there is no constitutional question because it’s a loan, not a grant, and open to any hospital to apply. Rep. Ben Koppelman called it a “shell game.”
“It seems a little disingenuous to say it’s open to everybody, but really only funded for the amount we want for that one hospital,” said Koppelman, R-West Fargo. 
Rural hospital on the verge of shutting down could be saved by lawmaker’s bill

The bill originally authorized $10 million and capped an individual loan at $5 million. It was amended in committee, cutting the funding to $5 million, enough for a single loan at the maximum amount. 
Other legislators pointed out this wouldn’t be the first time the Legislature has authorized a loan with a particular target in mind. 
“Fifteen years ago, we were in a special session and we gave loans for flood victims in Minot under similar terms,” said Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot. “So I would encourage a yes vote.”
Rep. Alisa Mitskog, D-Wahpeton, said a loan application would be scrutinized by the Bank of North Dakota.
“We cannot allow entire communities or regions of our state to face limited or delayed access to care,” Mitskog said. 
The House passed the legislation 80-12.
The Bank of North Dakota will examine how the hospital arrived at this point and review comprehensive financial documentation, said Kelvin Hullet, an executive with the state-owned bank.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, speaks during a special session of the Legislature on Jan. 23, 2026. (Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
“We’ll be going in depth with them through an application process. It will be treated like any other loan that we would review at the Bank of North Dakota,” Hullet said. 
Sen. Michelle Powers, R-Fargo, emphasized the hospital’s dire situation is the result of poor management in recent years and not because of fraud. 
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, said the situation in Elgin should serve as notice to hospitals across the state. The boards, often composed of local community members, should check to ensure their business model is sustainable.  
“They should be asking tough questions because we’re not gonna be able to bail out every single hospital in the state,” Cleary said. “There’s only so many dollars we have available, and frankly in a situation like this, if this plan fails, that’ll cast a pretty long shadow on other entities that are looking for support.

Curtis Water Treatment Facility. Tuesday, July 19, 2023.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Jackson’s third-party water manager said it doesn’t expect any major service disruptions this weekend as a winter storm approaches Mississippi. 
“JXN Water has completed winterization efforts across its operations and is prepared for the upcoming cold weather,” the utility said in a statement on Thursday. “System facilities are being actively monitored, and crews are ready to respond if issues arise as temperatures drop. At this time, JXN Water does not anticipate widespread service impacts related to cold weather conditions.”
In 2021, many in the capital city went weeks without running water after a winter storm impaired O.B. Curtis, Jackson’s main treatment plant. Cold weather has frequently jeopardized the city’s ability to deliver water to residents, including in 2010, 2014 and 2018. 
Not only was equipment at the treatment plant exposed to the cold conditions, but aging, undersized distribution lines throughout the city often break during fluctuating temperatures.
Since taking over the system in 2022, the private utility has winterized O.B. Curtis to withstand cold conditions. The utility is also much better equipped to respond to line breaks, JXN Water spokesperson Aisha Carson told Mississippi Today.
JXN Water now has a mapping system in place which makes it easier to identify breaks, Carson explained. She added that the utility is nearly fully staffed in both of its treatment plants as well as its repair crews, compared to having just a quarter of positions filled during the 2022 water crisis. Moreover, the thousands of repairs to leaks and broken valves JXN Water has made in the last couple years should put it in a “better position” to address service issues, Carson said.
Utility say it can’t make Jackson’s next debt payment
U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate called a last-second status conference on Friday after JXN Water manager Ted Henifin again alerted the court of ongoing financial troubles. 
The utility won’t be able to make Jackson’s next debt payment of $1.5 million due on Mar. 1, Henifin wrote in a letter. JXN Water has sought a rate increase for nearly the past year, saying it lacks funds to pay its contractors or make sewer repairs. Because JXN Water must first advertise any rate change for 30 days beforehand, there isn’t enough time for the utility to accrue the necessary revenue by the Mar. 1 due date, the letter said. 
In response, Jackson City Attorney Drew Martin told the court it was JXN Water’s responsibility to make the payments as the debt belongs to the water system. The city made the last payment of $5 million in December on behalf of the utility. Mississippi Today reached out to city officials to ask if Jackson would be able to take on the next payment, but did not hear back by this publication.
If the city is unable to make future debt payments, it could be subject to losing sales tax revenue, the utility said. 
In his letter, Henifin said the only way JXN Water could make the March payment is if it receives $54 million in reallocated EPA funding by mid-February. In the fall, the city convinced Congress to redirect that money from $450 million originally set aside for capital projects.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100026/3X0A3937-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210

(File photo by Michael Smith/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Every classroom in public K-12 schools and colleges would have to display a copy of the Ten Commandments under a bill that advanced in the House this week.
The House Judiciary Committee voted 18-to-3 to advance the bill, which also creates the option of displaying numerous other historical documents in classrooms and allows schools to accept volunteer chaplains.
Alongside the 11-by-13-inch posters or framed copies of the Ten Commandments, all teachers would also have to display a “context statement” about the history of schools teaching the text.
Schools would not have to pay for posters listing the Ten Commandments under the bill. Districts and universities can collect donations for the posters, or they can use free versions, which the bill requires the Department of Education to provide.
The Wednesday vote came the same day an appeals court heard arguments on a nearly identical law Louisiana’s legislature passed in 2024.
Although both the Louisiana law and the South Carolina bill listed U.S. Supreme Court decisions legislators claimed made the practice legal, a federal judge in Louisiana stopped the law from taking effect in the state in 2024. A subset of a federal appeals court found the law unconstitutional, before an appeal brought the case before a full, 17-judge panel for a hearing this week.
“This is still in limbo,” South Carolina Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Columbia Democrat, said of the bill. “It’s going to be determined probably by the U.S. Supreme Court.”
South Carolina’s bill repeats nearly the entire Louisiana bill, including a quote attorneys challenging Louisiana’s law say is attributed incorrectly to James Madison.
Defending the historical value of the Ten Commandments, the bill cites Madison as saying “(w)e have staked the whole future of our new nation upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments.” But no one has proven that Madison actually said that, Louisiana lawyers argued in court.
South Carolina’s version expands the bill to classrooms at publicly funded universities. And, after a change made during the committee meeting, it lists the Emancipation Proclamation as one of the other documents teachers could display, though that is not required.
Teachers could also put up copies of the Mayflower Compact and the Declaration of Independence, though neither is required.
All three are historical documents, supporters of the bill said.
“We’re proud in South Carolina to put America first by continuing our history, our heritage and, of course, our faith,” Rep. Richie Yow, a Chesterfield Republican and Baptist pastor, told the SC Daily Gazette.
Students aren’t meant to unquestioningly accept the text but to engage with it as they would with any historical document, said Rep. Kathy Landing.
“For our young children to be exposed to that, to be able to ask questions and maybe even be able to debate and discuss sometimes some of those commandments is not a bad thing,” the Mount Pleasant Republican said. “It actually helps strengthen the education process, and Lord knows we need plenty of that.”
Opponents argued the bill violates the establishment clause in the Constitution’s First Amendment, commonly referred to as requiring a separation of church and state. Including the Ten Commandments but no equivalent for other religions can exclude students who aren’t Christian, said Rep. John King.
“While I am a Christian and believe in the Ten Commandments, I also am not blind in reference to other people, and they do not believe in what we believe in,” King said.
Rep. Justin Bamberg, a Bamberg County Democrat, said he didn’t mind teachers displaying the Ten Commandments but didn’t understand why that document was required while other important pieces of history were simply allowed under the bill.
Despite his concerns, Bamberg voted in favor of advancing the bill.
“I don’t think anybody has a problem with history,” Bamberg said. “The question is, what and whose history?”
The bill would also allow school districts to create policies for allowing volunteer chaplains to visit school grounds and counsel students on religious issues while there. Students would need parent permission to opt into any services involving the chaplains.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ten-Commandments-1024x668.jpg,,,2026-01-23 16:58:01.687210

This story by Tracy Brannstorm was first published in The Bridge on Jan. 22, 2026.
Vermont is the only state in the Northeast without a freestanding birth center. That could soon change: a team of Vermont midwives is developing the Green Mountain Birth Center and inviting the public to weigh in at an event on Feb. 1. 
A state law passed last May cleared the way for freestanding centers, establishing a licensing system and requiring insurers to cover their services. Several of the midwives behind the budding Green Mountain Birth Center were active advocates of that legislation.
The team is currently fundraising $3 million to cover startup costs and the first year of operations. The aim of the project’s first phase is to open a small prenatal and postpartum care practice in Morrisville this year, with estimated operating costs of about $25,000.
They are also searching for a permanent site for the birth center itself, ideally near a hospital that could serve as a transfer partner. Waterbury is among the top locations being considered.
Freestanding birth centers are standalone health care facilities that provide prenatal care, labor and delivery services and postpartum support for people with low-risk pregnancies. Typically led by midwives, they operate outside the hospital setting but maintain relationships with hospitals for transfer if complications arise.
Supporters often point to research indicating that birth centers deliver strong outcomes for uncomplicated pregnancies while also reducing medical interventions, achieving high patient satisfaction while costing less than hospital births.
Midwife Erinn Mandeville, a founding member of the Green Mountain Birth Center, said the model can also offer greater satisfaction in the workplace because it gives practitioners more autonomy. “You’re not beholden to hospital budgets or administrators who don’t understand our vision,” she said.
Mandeville was on staff for five years at Copley Hospital’s birthing center in Morrisville before it was closed last November. “I loved my job at Copley and thought I would retire there,” she said. “But when the hospital announced the unit’s closure, I was like, ‘OK, I guess I’m starting a birth center.’”
She is joined by four other founders — Alison Fischman, Heidi Riendeau, Lindsay Lachant and Mary Lou Kopas — who together bring decades of experience across hospital, birth center and home-based care, with a particular focus on serving rural and underserved communities. 
Several of them have long been involved in advocacy that supports birth center licensure — efforts that culminated last May, when lawmakers passed a law creating a statewide licensing system with fewer barriers. Previously, applicants had to demonstrate need through a review that allowed hospitals and other stakeholders to weigh in. The new law exempts freestanding birth centers from that process and requires insurers to cover their services by early 2027.
With the new law in place, the Green Mountain Birth Center organizers formalized their nonprofit, began recruiting volunteers and opened a patient waiting list — all while continuing their hospital and home-based midwifery work.
“So far it’s exciting and it’s daunting,” Mandeville said. “We’re all committed to serving our community, but now we’re having to become administrators, and business people, and marketers at the same time, when I just want to catch babies and help people through menopause or whatever’s going on with them.”
Mandeville said she is most excited about rethinking prenatal care by connecting patients with social services such as Women, Infants and Children care and housing assistance, offering early support through movement and body work that could prevent complications during birth or postpartum, and allowing for longer, more in-depth patient visits. “We really need to broaden our concept of what needs to be supported,” she said. 
The Vermont Department of Health is currently finalizing how the state’s new licensing system will operate. And while that’s happening, the Green Mountain Birth Center team will be continuing to plan the center’s next steps.
The event, scheduled for Feb. 1 from 2 to 4 p.m. at Emerge in downtown Montpelier (15 State St.) will be hosted by Amy LePage, a bodyworker and childbirth educator. The event is an opportunity to learn about the center’s plans, meet the founders, find out how to get involved and is open to the wider community, LePage said. “Not just people who are in this realm and time of their life of being pregnant, but really anyone interested in investing in family health and community care in Vermont.”
“We really want it to be a conversation,” she added.  LePage will be offering a donation-based class for stress relief and better sleep following the event, from 4:40 to 6 p.m., with all proceeds going to the Green Mountain Birth Center.

Jeff Landry is asking Louisiana lawmakers to double state funding for vouchers that pay for students’ private education expenses. The request has put him at odds with legislative leaders, who said state officials still won’t answer basic questions about the program’s structure. 

State legislators, with Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie leading the resistance, rejected a request from Landry last year to give Louisiana’s publicly funded voucher program called LA GATOR an additional $50 million. 
Landry is asking for an extra $44.2 million for vouchers for the 2026-27 school year. The governor’s budget architect, Commissioner of Administration Taylor Barras, said the allocation would expand the program to cover another 4,000 to 5,000 students.  

But Henry and other legislative leaders said their reservations about the program haven’t changed. 
“If you want to take a kid from a failing school and put them in a good school, I don’t think many people would object to that,” Henry told officials with the Landry administration Friday. “It’s all the other stuff that’s involved in [LA GATOR] that has muddied the water, that no one likes to discuss, that people have a difficult time justifying.” 
The Senate president’s comments came at the end of a public presentation of Landry’s overall budget proposal for the state fiscal year that starts July 1. 
Henry has repeatedly expressed concerns that Louisiana’s new private education voucher program could grow beyond what the state can afford to fund. The Senate president is also unhappy the grants can be used by families to pay for ancillary school expenses such as uniforms, laptops and tutoring for private school students – and not just tuition. 
Approximately three-quarters of the students who applied for LA GATOR last year were already attending private school, according to information released by lawmakers last year. It raises questions about whether extending vouchers to more families would actually help children escape inadequate public education or simply subsidize families who are already sending their children to private schools, according to Henry and others. 
“The reason I didn’t like GATOR because every year it has to double, right? And lo and behold, this year, it’s doubled,” Henry said. 

Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, who chairs the budget-writing committee in the Louisiana House, said he shares Henry’s worries about LA GATOR. Like Henry, he is concerned voucher funding can be used on expenses other than tuition, when families with public school students don’t have those same opportunities. 
“The devil is in the details, and we need to see what the devil is doing,” McFarland said in an interview.

While the governor wants to see public spending on private education go up, his $47 billion budget plan does not include approximately $200 million needed to avoid a cut to public school teacher and support staff pay in the next school year. 
Instead, the governor and legislators are hoping voters approve a constitutional amendment on the April 18 election ballot that will free up state money to give the teachers and support staff annual pay increases of $2,250 and $1,125, respectively. The salary hikes would replace stipends of $2,000 and $1,000 school faculty and staff have received the past two years. 

The April ballot measure specifically asks voters to dissolve education trust funds that currently support higher education and K-12 schools in order to pay down $2 billion worth of educator retirement debt. Local school districts will then be required to use their debt savings to give out the raises in the 2026-27 school year. Voters rejected a similar amendment Landry pushed last year, but the new proposal has been rewritten to address teacher compensation more directly and leaves out tax policy changes that weren’t as popular with the public. 

If the amendment fails, however, teachers and school support staff will be at risk of seeing their pay cut under Landry’s budget plan. It could also send lawmakers scrambling to try to fill the gap as they did last spring. 
In addition to private school voucher funding, Landry’s budget proposal for next fiscal year includes large state funding increases for prisons ($82 million) and a Louisiana Economic Development program called High-Impact Jobs ($75 million).

(Photo courtesy of Sarah Simmons)The American College of Nurse-Midwives sued Mississippi in federal court this week to challenge a state requirement that nurse-midwives must practice in collaboration with a physician.
In Mississippi, advanced practice nurse practitioners, including certified nurse-midwives, can’t practice without a signed “collaborative practice agreement” with a doctor. This typically involves the nurse midwife paying a monthly fee, the lawsuit states, and obstetricians can refuse to enter into such agreements.
Many states enforce similar requirements. Supporters say such rules protect patients and foster communication between advanced practice nurses and physicians. But the nurse-midwives group argues that they are unreasonable and do little to ensure that physicians are available when needed.
The case, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi against the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure, alleges that the requirement violates federal and state antitrust laws by limiting the number of certified nurse-midwives, thereby reducing competition for physicians.
The lawsuit, filed by Pillsbury Law and the Mississippi Center for Justice, also argues that the rules prevent nurse-midwives from filling gaps in maternal health care in a state that has some of the worst maternal and infant health outcomes.
For years, Getty Israel has been advocating to repeal the requirements. Israel, founder of Sisters in Birth, wants to build Mississippi’s first freestanding birth center, but the state’s collaborative practice requirement has hindered the project and made it difficult to hire nurse midwives, she said.
Mississippi state Democratic Rep. Dan Eubanks has written letters to the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces federal antitrust laws, arguing that the state requirement has “created an unfair economic disadvantage for [certified nurse-midwives] in Mississippi, effectively barring them from practicing.” Eubanks filed a bill this session that would repeal the requirement.
“Currently, there are only 26 [certified nurse-midwives] registered with the Mississippi Board of Nursing, he wrote in a 2023 letter, and “only several practice midwifery care” because of the rules. The others can’t find jobs as nurse-midwives, he wrote, and have been forced to take lower-level nursing jobs. He wrote another letter to the FTC in October.
Clarke Edwards, acting director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Office of Policy, wrote back to Eubanks last month.
“State-mandated collaboration or supervision requirements that restrict [advanced practice registered nurses] from practicing to the full extent of their abilities, may impede access to care, and may frustrate the development of innovative team-based approaches to health care,” Edwards wrote.
The lawsuit also references a 2014 report by FTC staff, which recommends that state legislatures set the rules but notes that based on the agency’s review of the available research, “supervision requirements… do not appear to be justified by legitimate health and safety concerns.”

Sharice Davids to hang onto her seat. Hawkins and Masterson are pictured during a Jan. 8, 2026, legislative hearing. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas governor candidate Philip Sarnecki took to social media to chastise fellow Republicans for lack of action by the Kansas Legislature to redraw boundaries of the four U.S. House districts to disadvantage the state’s lone Democratic incumbent in Congress.
Sarnecki, a candidate for the Republican Party’s nomination, accused the GOP supermajority in the House and Senate of deciding to “forfeit” its part in a national congressional redistricting fight between states controlled by Republicans and those dominated by Democrats.
“Kansas Republicans have a supermajority and can pick up a Republican House seat if they redraw the map,” said Sarnecki, founder of RPS Financial Group. “They are choosing not to. While Democrats redraw congressional maps to gain power across the country, Topeka is standing down.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican also running for governor, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, worked during October to secure support from two-thirds of members in both chambers to allow a special legislative session to redraw congressional boundaries. Enough Republican senators signed a petition to trigger a special session, but not enough GOP House members agreed with a plan to bring lawmakers together in November 2025.
The objective would have been a map that made it difficult for U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, to win reelection to her seat in November 2026. The tentative scheme was to split Johnson County between two or three congressional districts, which would disperse that county’s voters into GOP-majority districts.
Traditionally, Kansas congressional maps were redrawn every decade to reflect population shifts documented by the U.S. Census. The current map was passed in 2022 after the Kansas GOP pledged to keep Johnson County in a single district.
Masterson and Hawkins said they were interested in working on maps during the 2026 regular session of the Legislature. Masterson said it would be a “top priority,” while Hawkins said it was the “right thing to do.”
In two weeks of the current legislative session, there has been no substantive action in House or Senate committees to indicate progress on redistricting.
President Donald Trump and his allies, in a bid to cling to Republican control of the U.S. House, urged states to gerrymander enough Democrats out of Congress to prevail in the upcoming election cycle.
Sarnecki, who loaned his gubernatorial campaign $2 million in 2025, said he was convinced “weak GOP leaders in Kansas just chose to stand down and forfeit the fight for a Republican congressional map.”
“That’s not leadership and that is exactly why I’m running for governor. It’s time for a change,” Sarnecki said.
Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, said she was skeptical a new congressional map would be adopted by the House and Senate in the 2026 session. If a new map was passed, the governor could veto it. The House and Senate could override a veto with two-thirds majority votes in both chambers. If an override was successful, lawsuits challenging the new map would be likely.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1080267-1024x663.jpg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-23 20:44:54+00:00,CT Mirror,How well is CT meeting the needs of incarcerated young women?,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/23/how-well-is-ct-meeting-the-needs-of-incarcerated-young-women/,Recent data from the Judicial Branch has renewed questions about how well CT is addressing the challenges young women face in detention.,"More than two years ago, on the heels of allegations of abuse and neglect at a girls’ group home, the Connecticut legislature instructed a group of experts to study services available for girls involved with the juvenile justice system. 
Now, recent data from the state Judicial Branch has renewed questions about the availability and effectiveness of programs designed to meet the unique challenges young women face in incarceration. 
According to a presentation given to the state’s Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee in October, the number of juveniles in detention has declined — but the number of boys dropped faster than the number of girls over the last five years. In 2025, the number of boys in detention was almost 20% lower than it was in 2019. For girls, the decline was 9.8%. 
The overall number of boys in detention remains significantly higher than girls — 450 boys compared to 101 girls as of October 2025. But the slower rate of decline in female juvenile detention has drawn the attention of people in the field. Those who’ve worked with girls in the justice system said they believe the reason lies in a combination of the unique challenges girls and young women face and a lack of services to address those specific needs.
Connecticut has long been a leader in gender-responsive strategies in juvenile justice — that is, methods for working with people that take into account the specialized needs of men and women. The state began to incorporate these strategies into the juvenile justice system about 25 years ago. Over that time, multiple laws were passed limiting detention for certain offenses, and new programs were established geared specifically toward girls, including a specialized probation model, according to a presentation at the May 2024 meeting of the state’s Gender Responsiveness Workgroup. 
Catherine Foley Geib, director of juvenile clinical, education and residential services for the Judicial Branch, said the number of teenagers in detention has dropped significantly over the last quarter-century, thanks to changes in state law. In the mid-2000s, the state changed its laws so teenagers would no longer be detained for things like running away or chronic absence from school. Another law change in 2016 limited the conditions under which a teen could be held in detention.
The result, Foley Geib said, was that the young people who did end up in juvenile detention were often the ones with the greatest needs. 
“If you don’t get at the root cause of what’s driving that behavior, we start to see the repeat behavior, the chronic offenses and that inability to exit the system,” said Tasha Hunt, the agency’s director of juvenile probation services. 
Hunt said that many girls come in with a history of trauma and victimization. That trauma, she said, can present itself in delinquent behaviors, like low-level assaults or charges for breach of peace. Hunt said more community-based services are needed for girls, particularly intensive, in-home services that address mental health challenges, substance abuse and trauma. 
“We know we don’t have enough,” she said. 
Erika Nowakowski, executive director of the Tow Youth Justice Institute at the University of New Haven and a leader of the working group, said she believes it’s time for Connecticut to revisit the research on gender responsiveness and see if some of its recommendations should change. 
“ It’s been some time and that’s why we’re doing this research now to see what are the newer interventions and what shift that they do to address the needs of women or females in the justice system,” she said. 
Trauma and poverty
In 2023, the state legislature passed a law creating the working group within the Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee. The group was tasked with finding improved ways to help young women who had lived through sexual abuse or human trafficking. 
The experience of trauma and abuse, particularly sexual abuse, is one of the most common attributes among women who have been involved with the criminal justice system. Data from Roca, a nonprofit that works with high-risk young women between the ages of 16 and 24 in Hartford and parts of Massachusetts, shows that more than 85% of the women they serve have lived through domestic violence, and a significant number have been victims of human trafficking.
Sunindiya Bhalla, an executive vice president with Roca, said young women — more so than young men — struggle to trust. All of the women Roca works with have been victimized in some way, she said, which makes them vulnerable and leaves them feeling scared. 
“They do perceive people that they don’t know and they don’t trust as a threat both physically and emotionally,” said Bhalla. 
Roper, the director of Roca Hartford, said the organization has seen an increase in young women committing violent crimes in recent years. “It seems with all of those factors coming up in their lives or within their lives, that they are now picking up weapons, fighting. I think it’s survival, to be honest,” she said. 
Bhalla and Roper said poverty is also a common factor among young women involved in the justice system. Many of the people Roca works with are struggling to find food and housing. And the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to financial insecurity for many women. 
Advocates also expressed concerns about state-run juvenile residential facilities, known as STTAR homes. Some girls who are placed in STTAR homes end up running away or getting into trouble. 
“That’s the irony. They go to a place that’s supposed to keep them safe and then they end up getting arrested at the STTAR homes for additional charges,” Martha Stone, an attorney and founder of the Center for Children’s Advocacy, said. 
Frank Gregory,  administrator of behavioral health community services for the state Department of Children and Families, which runs the STTAR homes, said young women have complex needs and running away can be a coping mechanism. He said it’s crucial for programs at STTAR homes to connect with young people and earn their trust, and he said DCF is investing in new programs to address that.
Ken Mysogland, a spokesperson for DCF, said, “These are some of our most vulnerable youth, and there is no other way to say that.” 
“We recognize they require some very specialized programming,” Mysogland said. 
Reintegration
Experts point to the importance of robust programming for young women who are returning home after periods of incarceration. Mentorship, mental health care, employment opportunities and counseling — as much of it within the communities where they live — are part of the range of support services needed for reentry. 
A 2023 task force also recommended that state agencies coordinate to make sure young people leaving the juvenile justice system are connected back into their school system, are given help with job or career readiness programs and have access to transportation and stable housing. 
Hunt, of the Judicial Branch, said juvenile probation officers stay in regular contact with schools. They’ll attend meetings for a child’s special education needs and work with “juvenile justice liaisons” in larger school districts to help young people transition back to school after being in a residential program. She said they assess young people for mental health needs, survey their housing needs and work to connect them to community organizations that can help. They also work with cities and towns to find job opportunities, Hunt said. 
Foley Geib said that young people in residential facilities are provided with “reintegration mentors” who work with them for up to a year after they are released, and help connect them to services in the community.    
“I think we sometimes overlook, when we’re thinking of deep-end care, what someone needs to feel a part of their community and not stigmatized in their community,” said Erica King, a senior manager at the Center for Effective Public Policy. 
“Do they have a place they can go to the gym and take a shower and work out? Do they have a favorite smoothie spot where the person knows them at the counter?” King said. “Just helping them to map their communities of where their safe anchors are, and how to help them build those.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/JUVENILE-GIRLS-1215-Participants-Kasani-and-Tylasia-collaging-1024x684.jpg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817

Jan. 3, 2026. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.The Detroit Red Wings are officially hosting a Pride Night game in the 2025-26 season, adding that specific tag to the team’s game against the New Jersey Devils on April 11.
The team made the change after criticism emerged online as to why the Red Wings were one of only three teams — alongside the Los Angeles Kings and the Utah Mammoth, the latter of which do not appear to have any themed games — to not schedule a Pride-related game during the season.
Pride Night will be held alongside the team’s “People of Hockeytown” night, to highlight the “diverse range of fans, cultures, and communities that make Hockeytown one of the NHL’s most passionate fan bases,” along with “Fan Appreciation Night,” as the game will be the team’s last regular season home game.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The NHL’s official promotional schedule for the team now lists “PRIDE Night” as a part of the April 11 game, but that is a recent change — archived versions of the website show that as of at least late December, that wording was not present on the page.
“We have always planned to celebrate Pride within our People of Hockeytown Night on April 11. To clarify this, we’ve added the title of Pride Night, during which we will continue our longstanding support of team partners and fans within the LGBTQ+ community,” Ilitch Sports + Entertainment, which serves as the combined business operations of the Detroit Red Wings and the Detroit Tigers, wrote in a statement to the Michigan Advance.
In past years, the Red Wings have hosted specific Pride Night events, and the MLB’s Detroit Tigers, who have the same main ownership as the Red Wings, hosted their own Pride game in June.
A spokesperson for Ilitch Sports + Entertainment spotlighted those events, as well as the participation of the teams in the annual Motor City Pride Parade. The teams also participate in the Pride Month “Game Changers” Recognition Program with Comerica Bank, which gives awards to LGBTQ+ leaders around the state from groups like Equality Michigan and Stonewall Sports Detroit, as well as partnerships with local LGBTQ+ organizations like the Ruth Ellis Center and the You Can Play Project.

Pride events in the NHL have been a source of controversy for seasons, and in 2023, the league banned teams from wearing themed warmup jerseys, including Pride jerseys, after a number of players publicly refused to wear them. The use of Pride Tape on players’ sticks was also initially banned, but that was rescinded shortly after, following the use of the tape by an Arizona Coyotes player.
Teams and individual players have skirted the themed jersey ban by wearing them during player arrivals prior to warmups, and the Seattle Kraken this year auctioned off pride-themed jerseys to benefit local LGBTQ+ organizations. It remains to be seen whether or not the Red Wings will offer any Pride Night-specific merchandise, or if players will don themed gear before or during the game.
LGBTQ+ acceptance in the hockey world more broadly has come into the limelight in recent months following the release of the Canadian TV show “Heated Rivalry,” based on a novel of the same name, which tells the story of two closeted queer hockey stars who fall in love over the course of their professional hockey careers. (SPOILER ALERT) The show features a grand reveal of another gay hockey pro, who brings his boyfriend onto the ice for a dramatic kiss after his team wins the league championship. 
But grand gestures of LGBTQ+ acceptance are not the norm in the real NHL. There are no out LGBTQ+ athletes in the NHL, and there never have been — making them the only major men’s pro sports league in North America to never have an active or retired player come out publicly, according to LGBTQ+ sports website OutSports.
Hudson Williams, who plays one of the two leads in the show, has said that closeted professional athletes — in the NHL and in other leagues — have reached out to him and to Rachel Reid, the author of the books, expressing how unsafe it would be to come out as a professional athlete. 
“Sometimes they’re just reaching out privately through Instagram, and those ones are the ones that really just kind of hit you and go, ‘Oh, so this is a fun show, and it’s celebratory, but also sometimes it’s just hitting people right in the nerve,’” Williams told Andy Cohen on his SiriusXM show earlier in January.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2581-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817

The State Board of Higher Education appointed Berg this week to lead the campus after President David Cook steps down. Berg will start Feb. 9.
Berg, a real estate developer, served in the state Legislature from 1985 to 2010 and served one term in Congress. He is a graduate of NDSU and a longtime supporter of the university.
“Berg brings extensive national‑level leadership experience along with sharp entrepreneurial and business expertise, strengthening NDSU’s ability to build and expand key relationships,” State Board of Higher Education Chair Kevin Black said in a statement.
The appointment is expected to continue until the next president is hired, likely in late spring. The board selected an interim president based on recommendations from North Dakota University System Commissioner Brent Sanford, who issued a request for letters of interest from people who wanted to be considered for the interim post. 
“NDSU has shaped so many lives across our state, including my own, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to support our students, faculty, and staff during this transition,” Berg said in a statement.
Cook, who has led NDSU since spring 2022, accepted a job as president of Iowa State University, his alma mater. His last day is Feb. 8.

“This isn’t the end,” he said at a noon press conference after the Legislature brought its special session to a close. “This is the beginning — now we’ve got to implement it.”
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services will start accepting grant applications from organizations interested in program money in February, according to Interim Commissioner Pat Traynor.
 
North Dakota Monitor special session coverage


The $50 billion program was created by Congress last summer as part of its budget reconciliation bill. It was advertised as a way to partially make up for funding rural states will lose from Medicaid cuts included elsewhere in the legislation.
The Legislature convened for three days this week to authorize the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services to spend its share of the money. Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said the cost of the special session is expected to be roughly $225,000.
The flagship legislation of the session, the state’s Rural Health Transformation Program budget, passed in the Senate unanimously Friday morning.
House Bill 1623 appropriates $397.9 million for the program for the 2025-2027 budget cycle, the amount the state expects to receive for the first two years of the program.
North Dakota in December learned its award for 2026 would be $199 million. The state plans to dedicate $33.4 million of that on technology, $116 million to expand health care access in rural areas, $32.2 million to address workforce issues and $17.1 million to promote healthy lifestyles.
Armstrong said he’s particularly excited about the prospect of the grant being used to expand mobile health clinics and telehealth infrastructure in the state.
“If you have access to it and you don’t have to drive 100 miles in a blizzard for an appointment that you could do in that space, I think that’s really, really exciting,” he said.
The budget also includes a provision to enable the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to provide up to $40 million in stop-gap loans to grant applicants awaiting reimbursement from the federal government.
He said the Department of Health and Human Services will now submit the budget to the federal government for final approval.
The agency has launched a webpage for the Rural Health Transformation Program where people can sign up for email updates.
Organizations will have a short timeline to apply for grants. The Department of Health of Human Services has to commit the money by the end of October and spend it within the following year.
The agency will soon organize listening sessions to field questions from grant applicants, Traynor said.
The department will have personnel available to assist with applications. That includes hiring a liaison to help Tribal communities navigate the grant process, given their unique legal status as sovereign nations.
Rep. Collette Brown, a Warwick Democrat and a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation, highlighted workforce shortages on the reservation as a major area where funding is needed.
“We need doctors, we need dentists, we need mental health, we need chiropractors,” Brown said.
Rep. Jayme Davis, a Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa citizen, in the fall pushed for 5% of North Dakota’s award to be set aside for tribes in the state’s budget, but the Rural Health Transformation Committee rejected her proposal.
Davis said she’s concerned about rural communities in the state getting their fair share of the funding.
“I want to make sure that the frontier, the real rural, is at the top of everybody’s list,” the Rolette Democrat said.
North Dakota Senate narrowly defeats free school meal bill

Armstrong on Friday afternoon also approved four policies that the Trump administration incentivized states to adopt by promising extra Rural Health Transformation Program money.
One of those policies, Senate Bill 2402, allows pharmacists to prescribe some medications to patients and order some lab tests.
House Bill 1621 requires North Dakota students to participate in the presidential physical fitness test. 
Armstrong also signed Senate Bill 2401, which mandates doctors receive one hour of education on nutrition and metabolic health as part of their continuing education.
The fourth policy, House Bill 1622, allows North Dakota to join a licensure compact for physician assistants.
The Legislature this week also passed a handful of unrelated bills, including an amendment to clarify how the residential property tax credit is applied.
House Bill 1626, brought by Rep. Craig Headland, R-Montpelier, would change how counties apply a 5% discount to homeowners who pay property taxes early. Currently, the 5% discount is applied after the primary residence credit, which Headland said prevents some homeowners from receiving the full $1,600 property tax credit promised to them during the 2025 Legislative session.
Lawmakers also approved legislation to set aside $325,000 for litigation funding for the Public Service Commission. If more money is needed, the bill authorizes the commission to take out a loan from the Bank of North Dakota as well. The legislation also earmarks $1.5 million for North Dakota Information Technology to bring state websites and other digital content into compliance with American Disability Act requirements.
Other legislation passed by the Legislature would allow the University of North Dakota to use proceeds from a land sale for renovations to the Ray Richards golf course or to support the school’s varsity golf teams. The university is selling 6.5 acres of land to the Department of Transportation to accommodate a railroad underpass project.
Additionally, the Legislature approved a resolution brought by Rep. Glenn Bosch, R-Bismarck, celebrating the 175th anniversary of the YMCA.
Armstrong as of Friday afternoon had not signed the additional bills.

(Daniel Montaño/KUNM)Early results of a study into how New Mexico runs a federal food assistance program show relatively low rates of fraud, but also a stubbornly high rate of mistakes, according to a presentation this week from Legislative Finance Committee analysts.
Republicans in the Legislature convinced majority Democrats at the end of the November special legislative session to include $50,000 for the LFC to evaluate the state’s handling of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Lawmakers sought answers about the extent of intentional fraud as well as how the state could bring down its “error rate,” a measure of accidental SNAP over- and underpayments.
The Legislature required the LFC to present preliminary findings by the 30-day session that began earlier this week. 
Analysts told lawmakers they reviewed federal data about SNAP benefits theft, along with state court filings, to glean insight into the extent of SNAP fraud, which they defined as “intentional activity intended to steal or improperly receive SNAP benefits.”
New Mexico Legislature passes, acting governor signs $162.5M to cover SNAP payments if needed

According to the analysts’ presentation Monday, 1.8% of New Mexico SNAP recipients, approximately 4,600 households, received approximately $2.3 million in federal funds to replace SNAP benefits stolen between October 2022 and December 2024. Analysts said the SNAP theft occurred primarily through the use of card skimmers, which thieves affix to the top of grocery store card readers to steal SNAP debit card information.
The $2.3 million in stolen SNAP benefits represents a fraction of the more than $1 billion the state would have paid in benefits during that time period.
Analysts also looked at state court data to determine the prevalence of buying, selling or trading SNAP benefits, which lawmakers have made illegal through specific criminal statutes.  
The report found that police and prosecutors have only brought 12 such fraud cases to court over the last five and a half years. 
New Mexico Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) told Source on Friday that his takeaway from the report’s findings is that if fraud “happens one time, it’s one time too many.” 
New Mexico agency seeks funds to bring down SNAP error rate — but not too quickly

But he said he is confident the state, with the help of the LFC report and promised reforms, is taking steps to reduce SNAP fraud, as well as unintentional overpayments. 
The LFC report does not calculate the total amount the state overpays each month. But it notes that 12% of SNAP payments each month are overpayments, which would amount to roughly $11 million of approximately $90 million the state distributes each month. 
“There’s a lot of money changing hands here,” Padilla said. “Obviously we want to make sure it gets to the people who actually deserve it, need it, and so I think the department is implementing safeguards to make sure that that happens.”
In addition to efforts at calculating the extent of fraud, analysts also sought to explain how New Mexico’s rate of SNAP administration errors became among the highest in the country. Unlike fraud, the analysts described the error rate as a result of unintentional mistakes by either state officials or applicants.
The Income Support Division at the state Health Care Authority oversees SNAP and is tasked with reducing New Mexico’s error rate. State officials are seeking funding for staff and technology that they said will bring the error rate down in time to avoid significant financial penalties in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that President Donald Trump signed last year. 
The analysts said the state has focused primarily on getting benefits out quickly, particularly amid an influx of applicants when the COVID-19 pandemic began. That emphasis on quick payments coincided with more incorrect payments, analysts said.
As evidence, the report compares the state’s error rate to the state’s “timeliness” in distributing benefits within federal deadlines over a 15-month period. At the same time that the state’s error rate increased from 14.6% to 16.7% between July 2024 and September 2025, the state increased its rate of on-time payments from 78% to 98%. 
Analyst Clayon Lobaugh said that data shows the “tradeoffs” required to reduce errors while also filling benefits on time.

Lobaugh and fellow analyst Alma Kassim stressed during the presentation Monday that the results were preliminary, and the analysts solicited additional questions from lawmakers to try to answer in the final report due by July. 
Sen. James Townsend (R-Artesia), the Senate minority leader and one of the lawmakers who pushed for the study, told Source New Mexico in an interview Thursday at the Roundhouse that the early findings validate his concerns about waste and abuse in a program upon which roughly one in five New Mexicans rely. 
“I am quite certain, based on looking at that report and looking at other facts, that there is fraud and misrepresentation that is rampant in the program that’s got to be addressed,” he said. “And the quicker we get it straightened out, the better off we are.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817

Phil Murphy hugs Jamal Muhammad, whose prison sentence he commuted in April 2025, during a news conference on Nov. 10, 2025, at Princeton University. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A trio of Democratic lawmakers want to alter the pardon powers of New Jersey’s governors after Gov. Phil Murphy issued waves of clemencies that lifted sentences for some convicted of serious violent crimes, up to and including murder, shortly before leaving office.
Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) and Assemblywomen Margie Donlon (D-Monmouth) and Luanne Peterpaul (D-Monmouth) urged changes to state pardon powers, arguing the wave of state clemencies and alleged abuses at the federal level demanded change.
“At a time when we are seeing a federal administration exploit executive power, New Jersey leadership must remain committed to serving the public welfare, not abusing power to sidestep our justice system,” they said in a joint statement.
A commutation Murphy granted to Maria Montalvo, a Monmouth County women convicted of murdering her two toddler children, has incensed Gopal, his running mates, and Monmouth County Prosecutor Raymond Santiago.
A jury convicted Montalvo of killing her children, aged 18 and 28 months, in 1996. Prosecutors said she doused them in gasoline before setting her car ablaze in the driveway of her husband’s parents. The court sentenced her to 100 years, with parole ineligibility until 2054.
Murphy’s grant of clemency did not release Montalvo, but it did make her immediately eligible to seek parole.
Montalvo has maintained her innocence. Witness accounts of the incident varied, and her attorneys have argued the evidence used to convict her was based on science that has since been discredited.
Backers of Murphy’s expansive clemency program, which pardoned or commuted the sentences of 455 individuals, urged against denuding clemency powers, calling it a valuable tool to reduce the state’s prison population.
“From the mid ’90s to 2024, we only saw around 100 instances of clemency being granted in New Jersey over 30 years across so many governors. It’s a tool that is widely underutilized, and it’s something we should use to address systemic injustices in the criminal legal system,” said Amol Sinha, executive director of the ACLU of New Jersey.
The road to limit the governor’s pardon powers runs uphill.
The power to overwrite state criminal convictions and penalties stems from New Jersey’s constitution, and the document provides no means for anyone — not legislators or courts — to review grants of gubernatorial clemency.
That means only a constitutional amendment could change how pardons and commutations are meted out in New Jersey.
Amending the state constitution requires a voter referendum, but getting a constitutional question on the ballot requires legislative approval — either by simple majority votes in the Senate and Assembly in two consecutive years or by a single vote that wins a three-fifths supermajority in both chambers.
It’s not clear whether a broader set of legislators is willing to make those votes, especially with Murphy out of office. Gopal said he had not polled his colleagues broadly on changes to pardon powers.
“I can tell you my running mates and I are outraged,” Gopal said, adding he’d heard concerns about clemencies from members on both sides of the aisle.
Also unclear are what changes Gopal and his fellows might seek to make to gubernatorial pardon powers.
The senator said legislators were still in the process of determining how reformed pardon powers would function, a process that would include reviews of clemency authorities in other states.
Most commonly, clemency powers belong solely to the governor, though some states require a recommendation from a third-party board before the governor can issue a pardon or commute a sentence. Four states vest clemency powers solely in a board or advisory group, according to the ACLU.
“I think I would be potentially comfortable if there was a board that was not political that was a third-party board that looked at these types of reforms and politicians had nothing to do with it,” Gopal said.
Murphy convened a Clemency Advisory Board to solicit and review clemency applications and make recommendations in June 2024.
Sinha questioned whether an independent body could actually exist in New Jersey, noting any members would likely be nominated by the governor and could face Senate confirmation, including vetoes by individual legislators invoking senatorial courtesy, a tradition that allows senators to indefinitely and unilaterally block gubernatorial nominees from their home county or legislative district.
“They can all be influenced,” he said. “I don’t think that means we stop doing the work. I think it means we make sure there are objective, clear and transparent criteria to determine who gets clemency and who doesn’t.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0JS13124_1-1024x667.jpg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817

(Photo by Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)One of the biggest winter storms in at least a decade is expected to hit Pennsylvania Saturday night. Snow is projected to fall across the state with the National Weather Service forecasting anywhere between six inches to 18 inches, depending on the county.
Pennsylvanians are being reminded to limit their travel and stay sheltered — but for the more than 12,000 people  without homes, emergency shelters may be their only option.

The state’s 211 site lists 71 extreme weather shelters across the state, including ones that cater exclusively to men or women as well as one that focuses on LGBTQ services. Some operate as “Code Blue” shelters, meaning their doors open only if temperatures fall below a certain threshold. 
For examples of how they work, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reached out to a dozen organizations in different parts of the state, though most didn’t respond. 
The YMCA’s Allentown Warming Station plans to collaborate with several organizations — including the United Way, city and county services, Valley Youth House, Ripple Community, Inc., and Magellan Health — to open their doors two hours earlier on Saturday at 5 p.m. The building, which regularly houses 80 guests, will try to accommodate up to 85 with the storm. It is looking for additional community partners, according to a Friday email from Michael Reisman, the association’s director of communications. 
“A determination to return to regular warming station hours will be made on Monday. The YMCA is also looking to expand bed capacity during the storm, if needed,” said Reisman. 
Lehigh County diverted $10,000 in funds to help the shelter pay for the extra staffing, blankets and food, he noted. Thursday night was the first night the building hit its 80-person capacity. 
According to the 2025 Point-in-Time count, 401 people were unhoused in Lehigh County.
In Bradford County, vouchers to two hotels will be distributed through law enforcement to accommodate the extra need, according to county housing specialist Mary Sturdevant. 
“Nobody in this county, during this kind of situation, should need to go without shelter,” said Sturdevant.

Sturdevant shared that she once sheltered in her car decades ago when she was unhoused. 
“It’s still pretty fresh in my mind and I empathize, regardless of the reasons that people are unhoused,” she said. “I don’t want to see anybody suffer unnecessarily.” 
People in need must contact law enforcement, who will screen the requests before hotels can distribute the vouchers. Though normally capped at 10, Sturdevant said extras could be secured as needed during the forecasted weather. 
“These two hotels we work with are wonderful,” said Sturdevant, not sharing their names. “They’re so willing to do that social service piece for us. Without that, we really would not be able to pull this off.” 
Last year’s count identified 50 unhoused people, and Sturdevant said that planning ahead was tough financially. 
“We have a church-run shelter that’s small, so it’s already full,” said Sturdevant. “So when something like this comes up … they only have so much space. We offered this resource to expand on that already existing service.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/snow-day-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-23 15:57:02.206817
