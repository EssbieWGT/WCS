More states are considering regulations for artificial intelligence and other automated systems. (Leon Neal/Getty Images)As the recent stench of war grew stronger, I noticed once again how much we love our machines, be they bunker-busting or surgical, life-saving or high-earning, analog, digital or artificially intelligent. But what happens when our doodads and thingamajigs act human … you know … err?
To wit: Last week in this space, the modern marvel autocorrect changed one letter in one word (“defund” to “defend”) in one sentence, in one paragraph of an entire 750-word commentary. The “correction” altered the entire meaning of the piece. But those were simply the details.
More pressing appears to be that we’re moving from machines being able to help us express our thoughts and ideas to machines making them for us — intentional or not. All in the name of technological progress. 
Common wizardry
Such wizardry as autocorrect, ChatGPT or any of a number of AI tools is commonplace today, whether to construct a good declarative sentence or to plan and execute a bombing mission 7,000 miles away. I’m only speculating on the latter, but surely AI played some role when the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear facilities. Perhaps AI will also be used to resolve with accuracy the debate between “obliterate” and “two months,” a chasm both linguistic and political.
We can stop already with that annoying longing for the good old days. The AI genie is long out of the bottle and is not going back in. While government, business, medicine, manufacturing, agriculture and science race to capitalize on its wonders — which are legion and spectacular — we should also know and embrace its limitations. 
Please don’t confuse me with the Luddite down the block. I have for some time embraced technology, even making peace as a former professor of academic writing with the untimely death of the college essay at the impressive hands of large language learning models such as the aforementioned ChatGPT. 
You remember ChatGPT: Feed some information into it, such as “Write 600 words making the case for slavery reparations.” Click once and within 30 seconds, you have yourself a serviceable essay, probably in the realm of “Cs get degrees.” A second try might ask it to provide two citations. Which it will. (C+?) Try it. Perhaps you’ll want to retake Comp 101 from freshman year.
But, as I’ve written before, what is missing in these essays is a sense of humanity, not simply in language but also in tone, word choice and if you will, a measure of the writer’s passion for the subject — none of which, to date, ChatGPT can provide. A productive bot may be many things. A moral being is not one of them.
Our health can be affected, too. A critical reading of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” uncovered serious flaws, including citations of research that did not exist. Whether or not AI was used to generate the report remains unclear. This much is clear: It makes little difference whether it was the bots or the humans. The information was wrong. 
Often right
AI gets it right most of the time. The question we have to ask ourselves is whether most of the time is good enough. Is it better than a human most of the time? Worse? I’m intolerant of one incorrect word out of 750. What would be our tolerance level in war, surgery, a banking transaction or an immigration hearing?
These AI problems, called hallucinations, have led to PR disasters for American businesses from McDonald’s to Sports Illustrated to Amazon. Mickey D’s had to scuttle its foray into AI ordering when a video of the AI “crew member” ringing up an order of 260 Chicken McNuggets after the customers had begged it to stop went viral. SI somehow gave bylines to AI-generated authors, and Amazon was hyping a recruitment tool that somehow only recruited men.
Pardon my cherry picking. Regular readers here know that of all the modern barriers between us and a better future, access to the truth is paramount. AI can be a powerful force in that kit of democracy’s tools. AI and someone accountable for it.
Had last week’s autocorrect snafu gone unedited, the republic would have survived. But as we edge forward (or backward) with cease fires and bombings and the potential for a wider war, we should ensure all the AI and technological wizardry we have at our disposal has a capable human — a moral agent — attached.
To read more about AI and hallucinations, Google them. An AI bot will tell you all you need to know.

(Photo by Anteia McCollum/Idaho Capital Sun)Update: This story was last updated at 9:10 p.m. Mountain time on June 29.
Two people have been killed and another is injured after firefighters in north Idaho responded to emergency calls of a brush fire and a shooter opened fire on their response, according to Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris.
Kootenai Health spokesperson Kim Anderson said three victims were brought to the hospital, the Associated Press reported. Two were dead on arrival and the third was being treated for injuries, Anderson said, according to the AP.
“The wounded firefighter’s condition wasn’t known,” the AP reported.
The fire was reported around 1:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday near the east side of Canfield Mountain in Coeur d’Alene. The shooter opened fire around 2 p.m., Norris said at a Sunday afternoon press conference.
At about 8:50 p.m. Sunday, the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release that a responding SWAT team located a dead man with a rifle nearby on Canfield Mountain.
A shelter-in-place order from the Kootenai County Emergency Management system has now been lifted, according to the sheriff’s office.
However, the brush fire is still burning because firefighters had to suspend their response while the shooter was still active.
“There is still an active wildfire on Canfield Mountain,” Kootenai County Emergency Management said in a post on Facebook. “Local residents should be prepared and ready in the event that the situation escalates. Please continue to follow official sources for accurate information.”
The Canfield Mountain area has been designated a no-fly zone, “including a strict prohibition on drone use,” the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said in Sunday night press release. “Unauthorized aircraft or drones in the area pose a serious risk to firefighting and law enforcement operations.”

 Shooter opens fire on firefighters responding to emergency call

“The first call was at 1:21 (p.m.) on a fire, and then we started receiving over our radio that the firefighters were receiving shots fired from the mountain,” Norris said at the Sunday afternoon press conference.
Norris said he believes that the two people killed were firefighters. The responding fire crews, which included three engines, were dispatched from from Kootenai County Fire and Rescue and the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department.
“We are actively taking sniper fire as we speak,” Norris said at a press conference at 4:35 p.m. Pacific time. “This is an active situation. We have multiple agencies that are on scene from local and federal authorities, and we are prepared to neutralize this suspect who is currently, actively shooting at public safety personnel.”
The sheriff said “it appears modern-day sporting rifles are being used” in the attack.
Norris said law enforcement is unsure if there is one shooter or multiple attackers. He said officers and deputies are reporting from the scene that the shooter is “blending in with their surroundings” and that shots were being fired from what seemed like multiple directions.
“It’s going to be a tough next couple hours. I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize (the shooter),” Norris said at the afternoon press conference. “Because they are not showing at this point in time any evidence that they are wanting to surrender.”
Multiple local North Idaho, state and federal agencies have responded to the incident, Norris said.
Dan Bongino, the FBI’s deputy director, said in a post on X said that officials from the FBI had been dispatched “to provide tactical and operational support” to the scene. U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, reposted the update on his account.

 Idaho officials respond to Coeur d’Alene shooting

“Multiple heroic firefighters were attacked today while responding to a fire in North Idaho,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a post on X. “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters. I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. (Idaho first lady) Teresa and I are heartbroken.”
The governor and emergency response officials urged the public to stay away from the area while police secure and process the scene.

“Gut-wrenching news coming from Coeur d’Alene,” Simpson posted on X. “As the situation develops, our thoughts and prayers are with the brave firefighters and all first responders on the scene.”
U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, both R-Idaho, also posted on X that they are monitoring the reports on the incident and are praying for the first responders and their families.
“I am monitoring the horrific reports out of Coeur d’Alene this evening,” Crapo posted. “I urge local residents to follow recommendations of law enforcement. My prayers are with victims and first responders.”
In a statement at 7 p.m. Sunday, Idaho House Republican leadership said they were “shocked by such a vicious attack.”
“We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d’Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues,” the statement said.
An additional press conference is scheduled for 9:30 p.m. tonight, according to a Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office press release.

Ned Lamont sounded to be in complete denial about both the moment we are living in and just how disappointing his own decisions have been since Donald Trump took office.
It amazes me completely that after seeing historic primary turnout, engagement from new voters, and massive activation of young volunteers coming together to defeat a corrupt and scandal-ridden candidate who Lamont himself endorsed, Lamont’s tone is anything other than “it’s time to scrap the old playbook.” This complete inability to read the room is unacceptable given the moment we are in nationally, and we must demand more. 

Shontá Browdy
As a working-class mother in Hartford and a member of its board of education, I find that this administration is, at best, ignoring residents in my city and, at worst, outright hostile to us.
Our governor continues to vehemently defend our state’s irrationally strict fiscal guardrails, which have made it virtually impossible for my school district to even dream of someday having fully funded schools for our children.
On top of that, he remains the main barrier to our state being able to raise equitable tax revenue, meaning that the state budget remains balanced on the backs of working people rather than on billionaires. In what world does it make sense for you and me as workers to be responsible for paying for our state’s many needs while Connecticut’s wealthiest residents continue to coast on capital gains and inherited wealth? 
The governor’s recent vetoes of an affordable housing bill and a measure for unemployment insurance for striking workers, coupled with his threat of vetoing a bill that would have protected our immigrant neighbors from Trump’s ICE kidnappings, speak volumes. We’ve reached the point where we have to ask: “Can a governor of immense personal wealth genuinely be the voice fighting for working people in Connecticut?” 
Right now, we face relentless budget cuts from the federal government, paired with federal tax breaks for the same super-wealthy billionaires that our state refuses to tax locally. Meanwhile, in my role on the board of education, I witness the way our state’s austerity leads to a lack of resources, overcrowded classrooms, and missed opportunities for the very students who need the most support.
By remaining loyal to the illusion of “responsibility,” we are creating entire generations of students who will struggle and come to believe that their government does not give a damn about them. 
It’s time for our state’s leadership to truly listen to voices from places like Hartford, and to learn lessons from historic elections across the region. We need fiscal policies that are flexible, compassionate, and truly reflective of the significant needs of our residents in childcare, education, and healthcare.
We cannot afford a governor who is this out of touch; we need a leader who understands that true fiscal responsibility means investing in our people, our future, and especially, our children.

The vast majority of Americans are skeptical of AI and want it slowed down. This is the moment for Massachusetts to show its leadership.
The post Mass. must resist Congress’s proposed moratorium on state AI regulation appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","PRESIDENT TRUMP has demanded that Congress pass his “One Big Beautiful Bill” by July 4, putting enormous pressure on the House and Senate to move quickly.
The House version passed on May 22 gave tech industry lobbyists a massive victory tucked deep in the bill: a 10-year moratorium on state law regulating the development or deployment of AI. 
Since then, members of Congress, tech executives, researchers, and more have decried the potential harms of preempting states from constraining the potential dangers of AI for a decade—a lifetime for this rapidly accelerating technology. And yet the proposal is largely intact in the most recent Senate version of the bill, even though the vast majority of Americans are skeptical of AI and want it slowed down.
This is the moment for Massachusetts to show its leadership on AI. As we have previously written, the state has taken action to support AI development with the new Massachusetts AI Hub. But global leadership isn’t just the propulsive development of new technology; it’s making sure that such innovation benefits, and does not harm, real people. Unfortunately, Massachusetts lags in lawmaking to protect citizens, consumers, kids, and workers from the harms of online platforms and AI.
Dozens of bills have been introduced in the Massachusetts Legislature to address a wide variety of potential AI harms. For example, S.264 would require companies to disclose when the online representative you’re talking to is not a human, and hold them accountable for statements made by their virtual agents. S.44 would prohibit misleading deepfakes shared before elections. S.994 would preclude landlords from using AI to collusively set rents. 
Beacon Hill should draw national focus to the threat of a federal AI regulation moratorium by immediately holding joint hearings, passing meaningful regulation on AI, and – as we do in other policy domains – fighting alongside other states in court for our laws and rights if the moratorium gets enacted.
Contrary to the AI industry’s assertions, regulating technology to protect people’s well-being actually creates pressure for better innovation. The Clean Air Act of 1970 didn’t just reduce air pollution but fundamentally transformed automotive technology, leading to computer-controlled engines, advanced materials science, and sophisticated emission control systems that are now standard worldwide. The Americans with Disabilities Act’s web requirements led to breakthrough innovations like voice search, predictive text, and flexible interfaces—features that benefit all users, not just those with disabilities.
The federal moratorium, if passed this summer, would have little direct impact on Massachusetts because we have yet to enact the kinds of protections Congress threatens to undermine. Some on Beacon Hill have publicly opposed the federal preemption of AI regulation. But the Commonwealth has not yet taken action to back up this rhetoric.
Other states, however, are actively legislating AI policy to protect their citizens. New York just passed comprehensive security and safety requirements for AI model developers. New Hampshire prohibits state agencies from using AI to surveil the public. Florida prohibits certain uses of deepfakes in political advertising. California requires disclosure when providers use AI to communicate with health care patients. Moreover, in the absence of federal action on digital technology and online platforms, other states have moved to restrict smartphones in schools, protect kids online, strengthen users’ control of their data, and enhance consumer privacy.
These laws are in their infancy, but their existence will enable us to learn what policies work best to govern and steer AI so that we can eventually scale them nationally to benefit all Americans. But the prohibition in the “Big Beautiful Bill” on state regulation of AI would destroy states’ vital role as policy labs exactly when we need them the most — as AI is poised to bring generational upheaval to our lives, our communities, and our society.
Throughout its history, Massachusetts exemplified the American tradition of US states as laboratories of democracy. It has been a national leader in policy innovation to protect people and improve their well-being. 
It was the first state to require kids to attend school, passed the nation’s first minimum wage law, and one of the first workers compensation laws, helping establish the modern system of workplace injury protection. More recently, the Commonwealth’s universal health care mandate became the model for the popular Affordable Care Act that has provided health insurance to more than 50 million Americans. 
Now, Massachusetts must meet the moment and lead in the digital age to protect its people from the harms of AI and steer this transformative technology in the public interest.

Don Bacon, finds himself in position to cast a potentially pivotal vote. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — President Donald Trump and Republican leadership in Congress are pushing a presidential-pressured deadline of July 4 to send a “big” tax and spending bill that Trump calls “beautiful” to the president’s desk. 
And once again, Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District Republican, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, finds himself in position to cast a potentially pivotal vote, after expressing concerns over Senate Republicans’ efforts to find more cuts to Medicaid in their version of the bill to offset the rising costs of the megabill. 
The bill would make the tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for high earners. It also introduces some new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less, boost funding for immigration enforcement, start funding Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile defense program and accomplish other goals from Trump’s domestic agenda. The bill also cuts the social safety net, adding new requirements for Medicaid and food stamps.
Fight over details
The Trump tax bill has multiple provisions that several different groups of Republicans have issues with, which have caused Republican leadership on the Hill to try to wrangle Congress and House Republicans to be lockstep. 
Bacon told the Examiner in recent days that he had received assurances that the bill would not degrade the quality of healthcare for people covered by Medicaid. He also was part of a group of 16 House Republicans who said they won’t support the Senate’s reconciliation bill if it cuts the Medicaid provider tax rate 
“I love Senator Ricketts and Senator Fisher, but hearing, ‘We got to put our own fingerprints on the bill,’” Bacon said, “Well, please don’t do it on Medicaid, put your fingerprints on some other places.” 
After some hiccups with some parliamentary rulings, Senate Republicans appear to be on track to pass their version and send it back to the House later this week, in time for Trump’s deadline. Congressional experts have estimated that the package would add $3.253 trillion to the debt during the next decade, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Some Senate Republicans have proposed cutting more from Medicaid via an amendment that would reduce federal government spending on Medicaid in states that expanded the program as a result of the Democrats’ 2010 health care law. 
Voters in Nebraska and a combination of voters and legislators in 40 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, have supported Medicaid expansion, according to the health care research organization KFF.

The House version introduces Medicaid’s new work requirement, shortening the enrollment period and eliminating what Republicans describe as “waste, fraud and abuse” in the system by adding more paperwork. 
The proposed change in the House version, also in the Senate bill, would require able-bodied people and working-aged individuals to show the government proof of employment to remain on the program every six months. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 5.2 million adults would lose Medicaid coverage due to the stricter requirements, which are expected to save the federal government $280 billion over six years.
Bacon said he can “defend that all day long.”
“We’re doing smart savings and protecting those who need it under the house plan,” Bacon said in an interview late last week. 
Senate-House squabble
Bacon said the Medicaid cuts that the Senate is proposing are undermining the strength of the GOP’s argument of going after “fraud and abuse” and also emphasized that he didn’t like specific provisions in the bill, such as those related to SNAP. 
For months, state lawmakers, left-leaning political advocacy organizations, medical professionals, activists and some everyday Nebraskans have expressed concerns about the “disastrous” consequences of the “one, big beautiful bill’s” Medicaid cuts for healthcare access and rural hospitals.

Angie Lauritsen, state director of the political advocacy group Nebraska For Us, said Bacon has sided “with the ultra-wealthy over the Nebraskans he was elected to serve” but said he could “redeem” himself. 
“Does he want to stand with the ultra-wealthy or will he finally put working families first?” Lauritsen said. 
Scrutiny of Bacon’s position on the bill could prove less effective after news broke that the retired Air Force brigadier general is not seeking reelection in 2026, causing political shockwaves as he represents one of the nation’s most competitive congressional districts.
Bacon has been pushing back on the Senate version of the bill, as both Nebraska senators — U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts do interviews on the importance of preserving Trump’s tax cuts. 
“We want to make sure [we] deliver on our promises to the American people,” Fischer said on Fox News. “We can’t see these tax cuts expire.” 
Few places have faced more political pushback to the bill than in swing districts like Nebraska’s 2nd District, with its slight GOP tilt.  A bipartisan group of state lawmakers in Nebraska expressed concerns in a letter to Nebraska’ U.S. senators over how the Trump Tax would impact SNAP. Republicans and Trump have pushed back on the framing of the reductions as cuts. They say they are targeting abuses.
At least one of the most recent Senate versions would require states to cover some of the costs of SNAP benefits, which are currently mostly funded by the federal government. Senate Republicans are also considering additional reductions to the program than the House version, which independent analysis shows would likely cut at least 3 million people from the program. 
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon will not seek reelection in Nebraska’s 2nd District

“Nebraska would be on the hook for approximately $16 million in benefit costs and an additional $12.1 million in administrative expenses to maintain program operations,” the letter from Nebraska lawmakers read. “These policy choice dynamics would put significant pressure on our state budget and may result in reduced benefits or more restrictive eligibility.”  
Still deciding
Bacon said he wouldn’t know how he would vote until the Senate had passed its amended version.
Bacon has emphasized that he has received concessions or reassurances from House leadership for his vote. As Bacon told the New York Times earlier this month — he “doesn’t like voting “no” but likes “fixing things.” He also told the national outlet that he was a “no” on advancing a White House request to claw back $9.4 billion that the federal government had already approved for international aid and public media funding — but flipped his vote after ‘reassurances’ of some funding for AIDS help and public media.
He also told the national outlet that he wouldn’t follow his party ‘off the cliff.’ Multiple polls indicate that Trump’s signature piece of legislation is unpopular among Americans who are aware of it. 
Former White House employee Elon Musk has criticized the legislation, saying “destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm” to the nation. He has been especially critical of how much it adds to the national deficit and debt. 
For Bacon, he said he liked the direction the Senate version was taking. 
“I’ve had a lot of media saying, Are you going to support the Senate’s version?” Bacon said. “I don’t … know.”

(Anteia McCollum/Idaho Capital Sun)Two people have been killed after firefighters in North Idaho responded to emergency calls of a brush fire and a shooter opened fire on their response, according to Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris.
The incident was reported around 1:30 p.m. Pacific time Sunday near Canfield Mountain in Coeur d’Alene.
“Multiple heroic firefighters were attacked today while responding to a fire in North Idaho,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in a social media post. “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters. I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families as we wait to learn more. (Idaho first lady) Teresa and I are heartbroken.”
The governor and other emergency response officials urged the public to stay away from the area while police secure the still-active scene.

As this…
— Brad Little (@GovernorLittle) June 29, 2025

Norris said in a press conference Sunday evening that law enforcement is unsure if there is one shooter or multiple attackers. He said officers and deputies are reporting from the scene that the shooter is “blending in with their surroundings” and that shots were being fired from what seemed like multiple directions.
“The first call was at 1:21 (p.m.) on a fire, and then we started receiving over our radio that the firefighters were receiving shots fired from the mountain,” Norris said.
The brush fire is still burning, and Norris said that until the shooter is caught, emergency personnel cannot respond to it.
“It’s going to be a tough next couple hours. I’m hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralize (the shooter),” Norris said. “Because they are not showing at this point in time any evidence that they are wanting to surrender.”
Multiple North Idaho, state and federal agencies have responded to the incident, Norris said.
Dan Bongino, the FBI’s deputy director, that in a post on X said that officials from the FBI had been dispatched “to provide tactical and operational support” to the scene. U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, reposted the update on his account.

FBI assets are headed to the scene in Coeur d’Alene to provide tactical and operational support.

“Gut-wrenching news coming from Coeur d’Alene,” Simpson posted on X. “As the situation develops, our thoughts and prayers are with the brave firefighters and all first responders on the scene.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)North Carolina’s U.S. Senate race was already set to be one of the most closely watched elections in the country next year.
That attention reached new heights after U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican who has held the seat since 2014, announced Sunday he would not seek another term.
“I still look forward to continuing to serve North Carolina over the next 18 months,” Tillis said in a statement. “I look forward to solely focusing on producing meaningful results without the distraction of raising money or campaigning for another election.”
North Carolina’s race will be crucial in a midterm cycle that will play key role in determining control of razor-thin majorities on Capitol Hill. While Republicans aim to hold the seat for another six years, Democrats are seeking to flip it and turn the state’s U.S. Senate delegation purple.
Multiple candidates have already made campaigns for the seat official. Now, with the incumbent stepping aside, North Carolinians can expect to see contested primary elections on both sides of the aisle.
The Cook Political Report, as of Sunday, rated the North Carolina race “lean Republican,” though that could change with news of Tillis’ retirement.
Here’s who has announced their intention to run for the seat; who’s taken their name out of the running; and who could still throw their hat in the ring.

Who’s running
Former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel (D) — Nickel was the first major candidate to enter the race. He served one term in the U.S. House before Republican-friendly redistricting spurred him to drop his re-election bid.
Nickel is a criminal defense attorney who previously served in the state Senate. He’s repeatedly tied Tillis to President Donald Trump, and has proposed that Democrats form a “shadow cabinet” to monitor and respond to the Trump administration.
He has just over half a million dollars on hand as of April, according to campaign finance filings.
“It doesn’t matter what MAGA Republican Trump handpicks for North Carolina,” Nickel wrote on social media Sunday. “I’m the Democrat running because WE CAN flip our great state blue and win back the Senate majority.”
Don Brown (R) — Brown, a former U.S. Navy JAG Officer, author and attorney from Charlotte, provided aid to those who participated in the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. He has billed himself as “your America First candidate.”
He has done little fundraising thus far, raising just $21,600 as of April.
  Former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
Who’s not running
Mark Robinson (R) — Robinson’s campaign for governor in 2024 was derailed by a series of controversies and scandals, and he came up well short against Gov. Josh Stein.
He said in January he “will not run” for the seat, and that he did not intend to seek elected office in the future.
But he has remained an active voice online, frequently blasting Tillis and calling on conservative activists to oust him and other Republicans he deems not satisfactory. And it remains a possibility, however remote, that he could reverse course in the wake of Tillis’ retirement — though he would face major opposition from national party leaders if he chose to do so.
Robinson’s former campaign spokesperson, Matt Hurley, wrote online Sunday that Tillis’ retirement “is the end of a terrible era in North Carolina politics.”
“A new era of grassroots leadership in North Carolina is coming… you can count on it,” Hurley wrote.
Robinson shared the post and chimed in: “I couldn’t have said it better.”
Who could run
Former Gov. Roy Cooper (D) — The former two-term governor is widely viewed as the most prominent and formidable potential Democratic candidate.
Cooper is a familiar name in Democratic politics — a former attorney general and state senator. His name recognition, fundraising and political connections would make him an instant favorite for the party’s nomination if he chooses to run.

However, he’s yet to make an official decision. In the meantime, Cooper has served as a teaching fellow at Harvard University’s public health school.
Since 1986, 48% of governors who ran for U.S. Senate seats have been elected, according to data from Ballotpedia. Democrats have won 16 of those races, lost 12, lost six in the primary and had one withdraw before the primary.
Lara Trump (R) — The president’s daughter-in-law has for years been floated as a possible North Carolina U.S. Senate candidate. Tillis’ retirement provides an opening for her to make a run official.
She’s married to the president’s son Eric, grew up in Wilmington, and attended undergrad at NC State University. Last year, she was elected co-chair of the RNC along with another North Carolina figure, Michael Whatley. She resigned from the post in December 2024, and currently hosts “My View with Lara Trump” on Fox News.

Trump’s strength as a candidate speaks for itself — sharing name recognition, connections and fundraising with the leader of the Republican Party and its most significant endorser.
But any rumors of her candidacy could once again be just that — as they were ahead of a North Carolina seat in 2022, and amid a Senate opening in Florida late last year. She stepped away from the field on both occasions.
Attorney General Jeff Jackson (D) — Jackson has run for the U.S. Senate before — he launched a campaign during the 2022 cycle, before later suspending his campaign and backing the eventual nominee, Cheri Beasley.
The open seat provides a path back to Capitol Hill for Jackson, who served a term in the U.S. House before winning the attorney general’s office last November.
But it remains to be seen whether he would choose to jump back into the political fray only a short time into his first term in the AG’s office, which has also been a stop for Cooper and Josh Stein before winning the governorship.

Jackson said Sunday he respected Tillis’ decision to end his tenure “when he felt the time was right,” and praised his vote against the Trump-backed budget mega-bill.
“I saw that he spoke about having the pure freedom to call balls and strikes over the next 18 months, and I genuinely look forward to that,” Jackson said. “It’s the approach that will serve North Carolina best and I’m glad to see that’s how he sees his mission with his remaining time in the Senate.”
Dan Bishop (R) — Bishop, a loyal Trump supporter, lost the state attorney general’s race to Jackson in November. Instead, the former congressman has remained in Washington — serving as deputy director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.

He served two districts across three terms in the U.S. House. And during his prior stints in the North Carolina legislature, he authored the controversial “bathroom bill” restricting transgender people’s access to public restrooms.
Michael Whatley (R) — The head of Republicans’ national elections machine could jump into a race himself.
Whatley formerly served as chair of the North Carolina GOP before being elected chair of the Republican National Committee last year, a position in which he still serves.
The nonprofit news outlet NOTUS reported Sunday that Whatley was considering running for the seat, citing an unnamed source.

North Carolina’s U.S. House delegation (D & R) –Any of the state’s 14-member House delegation could aim to make the jump to the higher chamber.
Four of them are Democrats — including U.S. Rep. Don Davis, who represents one of the most closely contested districts in the country. U.S. Reps. Deborah Ross, Valerie Foushee and Alma Adams are also multiple terms into their House tenure. Ross was the Democratic Senate nominee in 2016, losing to then-incumbent Republican, Richard Burr.
Of the 10 Republicans, U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx is the most senior, having served since 2005. But if Foxx were to run, she’d be sacrificing significant power as the chair of the Rules committee. And she is one of the 10 oldest members of Congress, having turned 82 on Sunday.

Another possibility is U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, who leads the campaign arm for House Republicans. NOTUS also reported the possibility of a Hudson campaign Sunday.
Spectrum News reported Sunday that U.S. Reps. Greg Murphy, Pat Harrigan and Tim Moore are also considering campaigns.
North Carolina’s legislative leaders (D & R) — The most prominent legislators on Jones Street could aim to make the jump to Washington.
Among them are Republicans Phil Berger, 72, who has been Senate leader for more than a decade, and Destin Hall, 37, the newly-ascended Speaker of the House.
The Democrats’ caucus heads are House leader Robert Reives, 54, and new Senate leader Sydney Batch, 46.
Other state lawmakers besides those in leadership could also seek to launch campaigns.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2217838562-594x594-Tillis.jpg,,,2025-06-29 17:01:29.140731

Free.,"US Senate launches debate on GOP mega-bill, but passage still not assured",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-launches-debate-gop-mega-bill-passage-still-not-assured,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate began floor debate on Republicans' “big, beautiful bill” Sunday afternoon, though there are several steps to go before the legislation can become law, and any one of those could lead to additional GOP opposition — potentially dooming the measure. Senators must wrap up an ongoing review of the bill with the parliamentarian to ensure it meets the strict rules for using the reconciliation process and then run the gauntlet during a marathon amendment voting session.Additional changes to the sweeping tax and spending cuts package, some of which were being worked on as debate took place, need to garner the support of nearly every Republican in Congress. Otherwise, it will never become law.Senate Majority Leader John Thune signaled during a brief hallway interview there may be enough votes for a new twist in the Medicaid changes in the bill — an amendment reducing in some way how much the federal government spends on Medicaid in states that expanded the program as a result of Democrats’ 2010 health care law. The federal government currently pays 90% of the costs for enrollees in the expansion.“We're going to do what we can to support the effort,” Thune said, referring to an amendment offered by Florida Sen. Rick Scott that was not yet public. “It's great policy and something that there's a high level of interest in our conference in getting made part of the bill, and obviously scores a substantial savings.""But Thune, R-S.D., sidestepped a question about whether making that change would create vote-count issues if Republicans in the House with affected districts object, potentially preventing the bill from reaching President Donald Trump’s desk.“We have had some of these conversations with (Speaker Mike Johnson) and others over there, and then also with our colleagues for some time,” Thune said. “But I think the way this is designed, and the way that Sen. Scott has written it; it should be something that I don't know how Republicans couldn't be in favor of what he's trying to get done here.“So, you know, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Obviously, we've still got to get into the debate over here and get through the amendment process and we'll see what the fate of the amendment is on the floor.”Currently 41 states, including the District of Columbia, have adopted the Medicaid expansion, according to the health care research organization KFF.A Scott spokesperson told States Newsroom they would share his amendment once it was final.Still fluidTypically when a major piece of legislation comes to the Senate floor the text is set and amendment debate is closely controlled to ensure delicately negotiated deals don’t crumble in full public view.That isn’t the case this time around and much could change before senators take a final passage vote later this week, potentially as soon as Tuesday.GOP leaders using the complex reconciliation process to move their signature policy bill through Congress means every provision must have an impact on federal spending or revenue that is not “merely incidental.""That involves Democrats and Republicans going before the Senate parliamentarian, the chamber’s official referee, to argue over dozens of provisions. She then decides if a given policy meets the strict and sometimes murky rules.That process hadn’t yet wrapped up when debate on the megabill began and is expected to continue as the 20-hour clock ticks down toward a marathon amendment voting session.Senate bill would add $3.2 trillion to deficitsThere are also increasing concerns among Republicans, including those in the House Freedom Caucus, over how the bill will impact the federal government’s balance sheet during the next decade.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office announced Sunday morning the Senate’s revised tax and spending cuts package will add $3.253 trillion to deficits during the next decade compared to current law.Trump appeared to try to assuage concerns through a social media post.“For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected,” Trump wrote. “Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before.”The latest score came just hours before senators officially began floor debate on the sweeping package that will extend the 2017 GOP tax law, rework how much state governments have to contribute to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, overhaul several aspects of Medicaid and cut its spending, restructure higher education aid programs and much more.Senators voted mostly along party lines late Saturday to proceed with the legislation, though leaders had to hold the vote open for more than three hours as they worked to get the votes needed.Even after taking that crucial procedural step, the bill continued to evolve.The parliamentarian ruled Sunday morning that another six provisions must be revised to comply with the rules or be removed from the 940-page package. One Alaska sweetener knocked outGOP senators cannot include, or might need to restructure, language meant to bring Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski on board by enhancing the federal matching rate for Medicaid in two states with high poverty guideline levels: Alaska and Hawaii. The program for low-income people and some people with disabilities is run as a state-federal partnership.Since Hawaii is represented in Congress by a Democratic delegation, the Republican benefit would largely have applied to Alaska’s two GOP senators.Senate Republicans did receive some good news from the parliamentarian in her latest ruling, which cleared language that will steadily lower the maximum percent states can set for Medicaid provider tax rates from the current 6% to 3.5% in 2032.The in-the-weeds policy has caused considerable frustration among GOP senators across the political spectrum, who argued a prior version would likely cause financial strain for rural hospitals by beginning the process one year sooner.Planned ParenthoodThe parliamentarian is still reviewing several other policy changes in the bill, including whether Republicans can prevent Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for one year, effectively blocking beneficiaries from receiving care there at all.Federal law already bars federal taxpayer dollars from going toward abortions with limited exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant patient. So this change would prevent Medicaid patients, who may have few other options, from using Planned Parenthood for other types of health care, like annual physicals, contraception and cancer screenings.A prior version of the bill blocked federal funding from going to Planned Parenthood for the next decade.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, did not immediately respond to a request from States Newsroom about how the rulings might impact the bill going forward.Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., wrote in a statement the latest rulings show ""that Republican attempts to give away goodies that benefit certain states will not pass muster under Senate rules.""“Senate Democrats have also successfully challenged a giveaway to Big Pharma, as well as policies that make it harder for seniors and kids to get affordable health care through Medicaid,"" Wyden wrote. ""Republicans wanted to bring back the health care tactics of yesteryear, like waiting periods, lock-outs and annual limits on care, but Democrats have wrestled these out of the bill. I am disappointed that the Republican rewrite of the provider tax changes will remain in the bill: this policy will force states into devastating cuts to health care that seniors, kids and Americans with disabilities depend on. We will continue to fight any attempt to sneak through harmful health care policies in this morally bankrupt legislation.”Amendment fights aheadRepublicans hope to pass the entire package before the Fourth of July, though they have several hurdles to jump over before they can meet that goal.Senate floor debate can last up to 20 hours.

I look forward to having the pure freedom to call the balls and strikes as I see fit and representing the great people of North Carolina to the best of my ability.”Targeted by Trump over voteTills’ announcement followed several hectic days on Capitol Hill, where GOP leaders sought to sway him to support the party’s “big, beautiful bill,” though he ultimately voted against advancing the tax and spending cut legislation toward final passage on Saturday night.That vote elicited a torrent of rebuke from Trump on social media.“Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against ‘Senator Thom’ Tillis,” Trump wrote in one post. ‘I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks, looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina and, so importantly, the United States of America. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Tillis, 64, became a member of the state House of Representatives in 2007 before rising to become speaker in 2011. He held that position until 2014, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate.Tillis secured reelection in 2020 with 48.7% of the vote compared to his Democratic opponent’s 46.9%. The two were separated by fewer than 96,000 votes out of more than 5.2 million cast.His term will officially expire in January 2027, but the contest to replace him is expected to begin quickly.2026 electionRepublicans will want whoever emerges from their primary well positioned to fend off a general election challenge.

A lifelong Nebraskan, U.S. Navy vet and dad, Randall had developed a father-son-like relationship with Jazon Gonzalez Perez, a Guatemalan migrant who managed a couple of local restaurants in the Plattsmouth area where Randall lives. He described Gonzalez Perez as an inquisitive, eager-to-learn hard worker.
The mentorship had grown to the point that Gonzalez Perez called Randall on June 7 when he — while looking for a bank branch to deposit funds on behalf of work — wound up in a snag with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
A cell phone search had led Gonzalez Perez toward a branch on Offutt Air Force Base, where he was stopped and detained at a checkpoint when he could not produce a valid driver’s license.
Gonzalez Perez called Randall, who told the Nebraska Examiner he was blindsided by seeing immigration agents take away his buddy. He said conversations with on-site local law enforcement officers led him to believe Gonzalez Perez would be allowed to leave if Randall drove the car. 
Randall said it looked as though the plain-clothed ICE agents were called into duty unexpectedly. One brought a child with him as if the two had been on a family outing. 
“I said, ‘Hey wait, he’s not a terrorist. He manages a restaurant. He’s a good kid. He just made a wrong turn,” Randall said, recounting the episode. “I thought we were arresting gang members, murderers and rapists. 
“He’s none of those.”
 Expected ‘God-fearing’ workers last 

Gonzalez Perez now sits in ICE custody at an Iowa jail, awaiting possible deportation for being in the country without proper authorization. And Randall says he is fuming over tactics he said turned out not to be what he voted for last November. 
He expected “God-fearing” workers to be last in line. For the Plattsmouth-area resident who considers himself an independent swing voter, a different reality has “hit home” and shifted his mindset on federal immigration enforcement.

“Call me naive, but my clear understanding was we were going to go after the bad actors, not hardworking immigrants,” said Randall. 
His frustration intensified in the days after the Offutt turn, as ICE and Homeland Security Investigations on June 10 detained nearly 80 workers from a worksite raid at an Omaha food plant. Not since a 2018 immigration operation in and around O’Neill, which ensnared 133 workers, had Nebraska seen such a large-scale enforcement action.
ICE officials said the raid at Glenn Valley Foods was prompted by a federal criminal search warrant suspecting widespread use of stolen identifications by workers there to gain the jobs. So far, available federal court records show three of the workers that were detained have been charged criminally as a result of the operation, including one for stolen ID, though an ICE spokeswoman said Thursday the probe continues.
Raids were conducted days prior to Omaha’s in places such as a Home Depot and in a garment district in Los Angeles, sparking protests that then spilled across the country. Trump’s call for the Marines and California National Guard troops without the consent of that state’s governor escalated tensions.
Polling shows Randall is not alone in his frustration, as people witness the reality of stepped-up immigration enforcement at worksites, on streets and in courthouses coinciding with quotas demanded by the Trump administration. 
A CBS News survey conducted June 4-6 — prior to widespread protests of ICE arrests in Los Angeles — found 54% of people approved of Trump’s approach to deportations. 
A more recent Quinnipiac University poll, released June 26, indicated 41% of voters  approved of the way Trump is handling immigration issues, compared to 46% who approved three months earlier in the university’s poll from March. 
Approval from independent voters on the immigration question dropped to 32% from 41% in March.

Trump himself has delivered conflicting signals, reportedly ordering officials on June 12 to tap the brakes on raids at farms, hotels, restaurants and meatpacking plants. Days later, his social media post called for federal officials to “do all in their power” to deliver the “single largest mass deportation” program in history. His major targets: the Democratic strongholds of Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.
 Flip flop

The flip-flopping concerns leaders at the Omaha-based Center for Immigrant & Refugee Advancement, saying it “further erodes trust for immigrant communities.” 
CIRA, which provides legal services statewide, said any claim that enforcement is focused on “dangerous” individuals does not align with what its lawyers are seeing on the ground. It said mothers and fathers, including some who had been in the U.S. for decades, are being “ripped” from their families.
“This is not a public safety initiative — it’s political theater and our communities are paying the price,” the statement said.
According to TRAC, a widely-used national clearinghouse that tracks immigration and detention trends, ICE as of mid-June reported detaining 56,397 people  — up from 38,525 a year ago and a record high since 2019 when the Syracuse University-based Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse began publishing semi-monthly statistics.
TRAC said nearly 72% of the detainees had no previous criminal conviction. Of the 28% who did, TRAC said many had been convicted of offenses such as minor traffic violations.

Longtime Omaha immigration attorney Rachel Yamamoto said she has noticed a pivot by federal officials to go after “easy pickings, low-hanging fruit,” apparently to meet the reported quotas of up to 3,000 arrests daily demanded by the Trump administration. 
She pointed out her own clients: a mother-daughter duo detained June 4 at an appointment that in years past was a routine “check in.” 
Maria De Leon of Huehuetenango, Guatemala, had entered the U.S. in 2014, with 3-year-old daughter Hermelinda in tow. She was released at the border to await a “credible fear” interview with federal officials that came six years later.
Her plea to stay was denied, and she was under an Order of Supervision to check in annually with immigration officials, Yamamoto said. Federal officials did not violate any rules in detaining De Leon, the attorney noted, as the food plant worker had an outstanding order of removal. But she called it “a drastic change from usual procedures.”
“She’s been on this order of supervision since 2014,” Yamamoto said of De Leon. “Everything was fine every year, until now. She’s never been arrested. She’s had a work permit. Her husband is working legally.” 
Yamamoto and De Leon’s husband, who was waiting in another room, were particularly taken aback that Hermelinda, 14, also was detained. Yamamoto was with the mom and daughter when agents asked the teen to empty her pockets. She pulled out her phone and a lip gloss.
“That moment was horrible,” Yamamoto said. “Her eyes got big, like, ‘Am I being detained right now?’ I’m glad they didn’t cuff them.”
In past experience, Yamamoto said, youths typically were allowed to stay with the other parent. De Leon’s husband, Abel, had arrived in the U.S. two years prior to his wife and daughter, fleeing gangs, and has had an active asylum application pending for more than a decade in a backlogged court system. The couple’s 10-year-old son, born in the U.S., remains with dad in their South Omaha home.
De Leon’s family received word a few days later that mother and daughter were together in a family ICE facility in Texas. Yamamoto said the mom likely has no chance to stay in the U.S., though Hermelinda appears eligible for an asylum interview. 
 Businessman’s view

Immigration arrests have increased nationwide and more than doubled in 38 states since Trump took office Jan. 20, the New York Times reported Friday.
Nebraska has averaged 4.3 daily arrests — a 343% rise from 2024, the newspaper reported, based on data obtained through a Freedom of Information lawsuit by the Deportation Data Project at the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.
The data covers administrative arrests (those in which ICE seeks to deport rather than criminally prosecute the arrestee) conducted by the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division through June 10. It does not include criminal arrests, arrests made by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations divisions or Customs and Border Protection.
From a small businessman’s perspective, Gary Jenkins of Omaha said he was confused and in unfamiliar territory when a Guatemalan crew member was apprehended by ICE agents who followed him and his brother on a recent Saturday work morning into a gas station.
Omahan who is U.S. citizen spends two nights in jail on immigration ‘hold,’ drawing criticism

Jenkins said he jumped into action to find legal help for the man he said reported loyally to housing renovation job sites for years. He described the man, in his early 40s, as a father of three. His understanding is that the worker had missed an immigration court date in New York while living in Omaha.
Soon after his detention, the man was returned to his homeland. His wife and kids remain in the Omaha area, as does a brother, who Jenkins says has legal status.
“These guys are over here doing great work,” he said. “Now I have to go out and find somebody I can trust and believe in.” 
Federal officials paint a different picture. Mark Zito, special agent in charge of a Homeland Security Investigations office that covers Omaha, recently took aim at people supporting workers detained at Glenn Valley — pointing out havoc that can occur if an undocumented worker uses a stolen Social Security number to gain employment. 
Federal officials have said that 100 “real victims” face financial and emotional consequences as a result of their identities being used fraudulently at Glenn Valley.











These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans.


– Mark Zito, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations office in Omaha 



“These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans,” Zito said in a statement. “If pretending to be someone you aren’t in order to steal their lives, isn’t blatant criminal dishonesty, I don’t know what is.”
ICE offered a handful of examples, including: a Texan struggling to get Social Security disability payments as their ID was being fraudulently used to earn wages at Glenn Valley; a Coloradoan asked to repay $5,000 after their income was falsely increased due to wages earned at Glenn Valley, and a nursing student from Missouri losing out on college financial assistance because fraudulent use of ID pushed up income. 
 Gov. Pillen calls hard workers ‘A-OK’

Longtime South Omahan Sharon Boll sees the complexities, and sides with Trump policies.
She recently sat in a lawn chair watching an anti-ICE rally unfold in her neighborhood. She expressed empathy for families separated by deportations and trying to fix their residency status and respected the right to protest. 
“I know the long citizenship path is a pain in the butt, but they need to be here legally,” said Boll, who had a large framed image of Jesus Christ propped on a chair next to her.  “A lot less harm will come to them.”
Even Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, — quick to say he is “a 100% supporter of ICE” — has revealed a nuanced opinion of immigration enforcement, depending on the situation.

He said he has been to the border: “I’ve seen criminals and terrorists and kids being loaded like pack mules full of fentanyl and synthetic methamphetamines coming from China. Safety is the highest calling of government, that we get the criminals and terrorists out of here. That’s the focus and what I believe in.”
Pillen told the Nebraska Examiner he was “not talking about” established immigrant families, though, and urged Congress to “fix the immigration issue.” 
“Anybody that is here working hard and being a good neighbor, they’re A-OK. They’re fine,” Pillen said.
He said he did see a problem at the Glenn Valley operation because of “concentration of folks doing criminal activity of stealing people’s ID — that’s a grave offense.”
 Stopped at Offutt gate 

Randall said he had been supportive of Trump’s crackdown when he understood the target to be high-level criminals.
Admittedly, he said he does not know all the intricacies of immigration law and what it takes for a foreign-born worker to enter or remain in the country with U.S. permission. He said he is familiar, however, with the manager at one of his go-to diners that he came to know as a sort of “adopted son.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Over time, he learned that Gonzalez Perez had left his homeland to try and make a better living and help his siblings. His dad is a farmer in Guatemala, and his mom is deceased.
On a recent Saturday, Gonzalez Perez set out to make a bank deposit for his employer. The regular bank site was closed at the time. His boss told him it could wait, but Gonzalez Perez said he wanted to make sure payroll could be met, said Randall.
The online search led Gonzalez Perez to a satellite branch on the Offutt base property. A statement from Offutt’s public affairs chief said the man was detained at the gate, after presenting a Guatemalan ID card rather than a valid driver’s license.

Per security protocol, 55th Wing Security Forces contacted the Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office and ICE “due to the individual operating a vehicle without a valid license and presenting a foreign identification card with no documentation authorizing access to the installation,” said Kris “Krispy” Pierce, who heads public affairs for the 55th Wing and Offutt. 
“The safety and security of our installation and personnel remain our highest priority,” said Pierce.
Randall, called by Gonzalez Perez, said he first spoke by phone to an onsite sheriff’s deputy and, based on conversations, believed he would be able to drive his friend off base. Upon arriving, he found Gonzalez Perez sitting in his car blocked by cones. 
Immigration agents later arrived, ran information through a device and put his friend in handcuffs, respectfully and without incident, Randall said. Gonzalez Perez is in ICE custody at the Pottawattamie County Jail.
 ‘Tipping point’

Gonzalez Perez has an immigration court hearing scheduled in early July.
His attorney said she prefers not to comment on the case.
Randall said he is monitoring closely. He believes deportation and immigration policy could be a political “tipping point” for independent voters like himself. 
“I’m all for arresting bad actors. I think we all are,” Randall said. “That’s not what happened here.”

(Photo by Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states and Washington, D.C., have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
 
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
 
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

BAY VIEW, Skagit County — On a cloudy Friday morning, a group of volunteers huddled on the shore of the Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, peering over Angelica Lucchetto’s shoulder at an array of shed crab exoskeletons, called molts.
“You can tell this is a green crab because it has five marginal teeth,” explained Lucchetto, an invasive species specialist at the Reserve, pointing out the spikes along the front of a spotted greenish molt.
At that same time, similar groups gathered across the Salish Sea as part of a “Molt Blitz” to see if they could find any molts belonging to the invasive European green crab.

Though invasive crabs are a concern to ecosystems across Puget Sound, Padilla Bay must protect something extra special: 8,000 acres of eelgrass.
A powerful meadow 

	
Eelgrass might not seem like a top priority — it certainly doesn’t look like one. At low tide, when Padilla Bay turns into a muddy expanse, the soggy eelgrass is left strewn across the ground like forgotten party ribbons.
But Jude Apple, the research coordinator at Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, insists that the eelgrass meadow, which is the second largest on North America’s Pacific Coast, is worth protecting.
“It’s habitat for all the commercial organisms that we’re interested in … juvenile Dungeness crabs, herring, salmon — all kinds of organisms use the eelgrass as a home or as a nursery,” Apple said.

Many of those organisms are also “culturally significant species and first foods,” according to Sophia Ammons, a GIS program manager for the Samish Indian Nation’s Department of Natural Resources.
“It’s really important that we have that habitat so we can continually protect the species that are important for Samish and other coastal tribes,” Ammons said.
Eelgrass also has other superpowers. It keeps the sediment on the Bay’s floor in place, which reduces erosion of the shoreline and lowers flood risk. Studies show that landscapes like Padilla Bay also capture and store a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere — more than a forest the same size could. That helps slow the rate of climate change and keeps the ocean’s water from turning too acidic, which harms organisms like shellfish.
One 2024 study even found that eelgrass could clean up pathogens that would otherwise end up in seafood. Though they aren’t sure how it works, the authors of that study found that mussels living near eelgrass contain up to 65% less harmful bacteria than mussels far from eelgrass, suggesting eelgrass could be used as a tool to ensure food safety and security.
Threats to eelgrass 
Padilla Bay’s eelgrass is going to get harder to protect, as rising ocean temperatures will make it harder for eelgrass to survive and facilitate the spread of fatal eelgrass wasting disease. If European green crabs become common, they’ll put even more pressure on the already threatened ecosystem. The crabs tend to uproot the eelgrass as they dig for sea worms or shellfish in the silt, and sometimes even gobble up the eelgrass itself.

“It’s not a threat yet, but there’s potential as the population increases,” Apple explained. “That’s why we’re doing a lot of trapping to prevent green crab populations from getting established.”
On Washington’s outer coast, established populations of European green crabs now dominate some coastlines. In 2024, more than 1 million European green crabs were caught between Willapa Bay and Gray’s Harbor alone.
Laura Kraft, a Washington State University researcher working in Willapa Bay, hopes that biologists around Puget Sound can keep invasive crabs out of precious sites like Padilla Bay. The urgency of that goal became even clearer in May, when a study Kraft worked on found that even young European green crabs could be a big threat.
Kraft’s team observed that juveniles are just as capable as adults of breaking open many species of clams and oysters to eat. Plus, they’re menaces around eelgrass.

“Not only were European green crabs feeding on eelgrass, but they were also just arbitrarily clipping it,” Kraft said, “and when the leaf is gone from the plant, it’s no longer able to grow.”
Kraft’s team conducted the study to try and figure out which species are the most important to protect now that it’s likely too late to get rid of European green crabs on the outer coast. But the reality of it being too late was hard for Kraft to come to terms with.
“I almost want to pause and grieve that for a moment,” Kraft shared. “It’s very frustrating to not have a better solution.”
Puget Sound is more protected than the outer coast — with shallower waters and only one way in and out — so it took some time before the European green crabs wound up here. The first one was spotted in the Sound in 2016. But the numbers have only gone up since then: In 2023, only a few dozen green crabs were found in Puget Sound; in 2024, that number shot up to more than 200.
A Salish Sea-wide effort
Padilla Bay — let alone Puget Sound — is massive. That’s why Washington Sea Grant, the organization that coordinated the Molt Blitz, created a way for citizens to help with monitoring efforts.

The blitz was not the only opportunity to contribute to invasive crab monitoring efforts; any Puget Sound resident can help collect data for the Molt Search program, any time of year.
At the end of their search on Friday, volunteers circled back together to sort the crab shells they found by species, counting up how many of each kind they had. Their piles only contained the multicolored molts of familiar native crabs — no European green crab molts in sight.
“That’s what we like to see,” Lucchetto said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Is it possible that the predictions of the death of offshore wind power – one of our single best tools in the fight against climate change – were greatly exaggerated? 
The post Offshore wind is alive and well. Maybe we should just keep quiet about that.  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IS IT POSSIBLE that the predictions of the death of offshore wind power – one of our single best tools in the fight against climate change – were greatly exaggerated? 
While fossil fuel lobbyists and wealthy waterfront landowners in beachfront communities were cheering on the impending death of offshore wind power a funny thing happened: Turbines continued going up, large-scale projects got built and began turning wind into electricity, and the wind projects continued their progress toward construction. 
Candidate Donald Trump vowed that, if he were elected, the offshore wind industry would end on “day one” of his second term, and his Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and Environmental Protection Agency immediately began the process of pulling approvals and denying permits on projects up and down the East Coast. 
Some projects did fold in the face of poor approval prospects and investor departures – but the industry is quietly completing massive projects that will supply power to millions of homes. 
Dominion Energy continues to work toward completing the nation’s largest offshore wind project in the waters off Virginia after battling years of fossil-fuel funded opposition and weathering the Trump administration’s repeated – albeit inconsistent — moves to shut down wind. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is more than halfway complete about 30 miles from Virginia Beach.  In many ways, between the jobs, the power and the investment, it may simply be too big to fail.  
With 176 turbines, the $6 billion project will power 660,000 homes with clean energy when finished in 2026. It has already created 2,000 jobs and stands as proof that offshore wind is alive and well. 
So while the naysayers were busy writing obituaries, offshore wind continued to do what it was always meant to do: generate power, create jobs, and help secure a livable future. 
Meanwhile, the most audacious attack on offshore wind, a stop work order from the Trump administration against New York’s Empire Wind, was rescinded earlier this month. That project, 20 miles southeast of Long Island, is now back under construction.  
Empire has created 1,500 jobs and will power half a million New York homes when completed in 2028. To the extent reports that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to fresh consideration of one or more fracked gas pipelines in exchange for allowing Empire to proceed are accurate, such ill-advised and outdated proposals face major obstacles, including stiff public opposition. Meanwhile, construction of the critical clean energy that New York actually needs proceeds in the form of Empire Wind. 
Revolution Wind, 15 miles off the coast of Rhode Island, began work two years ago and is on target to be finished and powering 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island by next year. Revolution has faced an onslaught of legal attacks from wealthy waterfront owners concerned about their ocean views. But at least for now, the project has been safe from Trump’s anti-wind attacks. And again, size and economic clout may have helped keep the project viable. Revolution has spent more than $100 million shoreside redeveloping waterfront in both Connecticut and Rhode Island and, by creating 1,500 jobs, has strong political and union support. 
Finally, there is Vineyard Wind.  
After a devastating turbine break stopped construction last July, Vineyard Wind has quietly – very quietly – managed to get back to work on its 806-megawatt project 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard. The project will power 400,000 homes in Massachusetts, revitalize the port of New Bedford, and generate 2,000 jobs. The project is now generating electricity from 10 of 62 planned turbines. 
Each of these projects has – so far – survived in the face of relentless attacks from the Trump administration, fossil fuel proponents, and greenwashed fronts. Baseless charges that wind power kills whales; lawsuits targeting transmission cables, substations, and transmission cables; phony “grassroots” organizations bankrolled by waterfront homeowners and/or oil and gas companies; attacks by the Trump bureaucracy – all so far have failed. 
Silence about success and ongoing work seems to be a part of the strategy for offshore wind developers – and maybe you can’t blame them. 
In May, one of the directors of the Dominion project said that continued construction came from “keeping our head down” and keeping the project away from any fanfare. Dominion has also managed to keep working by touting offshore wind not as clean, green, or planet saving – which, of course, it is – but simply as homegrown American power. 
Like federal biologists and health experts, offshore wind developers have learned not to bring the benefits of clean air and cuts to pollution into their conversations. 
They can’t say it. But we can: When these four projects go on-line in the next three years, they will power two million homes while taking millions of tons of carbon pollution out of the air we breathe – the equivalent of taking 2.3 million cars off the road. That means less asthma, better heart health, and a planet moving further from a future marked by increasing heat and drought, flooding and erosion, real damage to marine life, and more houses being swallowed by a rising ocean. 
Jobs, measurable economic impact, and the promise of reliable domestic power – these may be keeping offshore wind on track to survive the current headwinds and thrive when the coast is clear. But for now, just don’t say out loud that it could also help protect our health and save the planet.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)WATERTOWN — It’s a simple life that seemed impossible two years ago. Now it could be in jeopardy. 
In the South Dakota home of displaced Ukrainians Ilona and Valerii Biliaze, sun shines through gauzy curtains as their 7-month-old baby naps below a window. Their 16-year-old son scrolls Instagram in his room after school, and their 12-year-old daughter lounges on her bed, sandwiched between school friends while gossiping.
Valerii is a self-employed contractor. Ilona stays home, watching their infant son when the kids are at school.
A town saved a nonprofit office to help laid-off immigrant workers find jobs. Now it’s all in peril.

Two years ago, they were refugees in France struggling to find work and make a living. They fled their home of Mariupol — one of the first cities Russia attacked in Ukraine — five weeks after the war broke out.
When the invasion began in 2022, electricity and heat were cut off as shelling became a constant background noise. Their children slept in a closet, never allowed to leave or approach the windows. They found shelter in a relative’s apartment after their own apartment building was razed by tank fire. 
Valerii passed dead bodies — neighbors, friends, strangers — as he sought food and water for their family. He risked his life each time he stepped outside their door, while snipers aimed at him and others as they collected water near the seaside.
They escaped all that and found a new home in South Dakota. But by Aug. 17, the life they’ve built could be gone.

The Biliazes are among 117,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States through the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) program after fleeing the Russian invasion.
The effort is known as a humanitarian parole program. It’s carried out under the U.S. Homeland Security secretary’s authority to allow noncitizens into the country with a sponsor on a temporary, case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons.
Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota — the state’s designated refugee resettlement agency — has welcomed 484 Ukrainians to the state since the U4U program started in 2022. The nonprofit additionally worked on parole cases involving 90 Haitians and 169 Cubans in federal fiscal year 2024. There may also be legally admitted Ukrainians, Cubans and Haitians in South Dakota who haven’t opted to work with LSS.
The Trump administration and its Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — the former governor of South Dakota — have terminated the humanitarian parole status of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, among other sweeping changes to immigration policy and enforcement. 
The administration has not terminated the status of U4U participants, but has paused new applications to the program, including extension requests. The Department of Homeland Security erroneously sent emails to U4U participants in April saying their protected status was revoked. Although the emails were sent in error, they stoked fears that an actual revocation could follow.

Congress has not offered a pathway to legal permanent residency for Ukrainian parolees. When the Biliazes hit their two-year anniversary of arriving in Watertown in August, their parole will expire. They were denied in April for asylum — another form of legal residency for people with a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country. Their options include returning to war-torn Ukraine, seeking refuge in a new country or waiting as they appeal their asylum case.
The Biliazes do not know where they will go. If they return to Ukraine, Valerii and their oldest son might have to fight in the war they worked so hard to escape. They already sought refuge in France, but were not able to secure work and were moved every three months within the country.










We don’t have a plan. We don’t even want to think about starting over again.


– Ilona Biliaze


The couple have been taking English classes in the U.S., anticipating they would make Watertown their permanent home. Humanitarian parole, before this administration, could be extended for decades on a case-by-case basis. Humanitarian parole in the U.S. began in 1956.
The Biliazes’ daughter is nearly fluent in English. Their youngest child is an American-born citizen.
“We don’t have a plan,” Ilona told South Dakota Searchlight through a translator. “We don’t even want to think about starting over again.”
Taxes, work and school: ‘They’re contributing’
Susan and Bruce Buhler sweep into the Biliaze house with full-bodied hugs. Susan lifts the baby from his mother’s arms, doting on him and urging him to say “Babushka” or grandmother. She’s been studying Russian to more easily communicate with the family.
The two retirees live a few blocks away, and they serve as the family’s main sponsor. Their basement was the Biliazes’ home for 10 months after they arrived in the United States.
“We had space,” Bruce said. “They were people in need and we felt terrible about families being displaced.”

Ilona filled out an application online for the U4U program while they were in France and posted a profile of their family, hoping to find a required American sponsor to help pay the family’s way to the country, secure jobs and fill out paperwork. Bruce helped Valerii secure construction work within three days of living in Watertown. The couple also taught them how to drive in South Dakota.
Eight families from the Buhlers’ church pooled funds to sponsor a family after Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Bruce and Susan selected the family off a website “like a dating site,” based on their family photo and a resume, Susan recalled. 
The two families spent most summer nights visiting and playing games on the Buhlers’ screened-in backyard deck. Once Ilona and Valerii found out they were expecting, they rented their own house.
Valerii and Ilona own two vehicles. They bought furniture for their new home. Valerii paid thousands in federal taxes this year. They named their son Brian — the most American name they could think of.
“An All-American name for an American boy,” Valerii said in English, smiling proudly.

Bruce chafes when he thinks about the family being forced out of the country.
“It just doesn’t make any sense,” he said. “They’re living their lives, paying taxes, contributing. They’re here legally. Anyone I bring it up to would tell you it’s crazy.”
Bruce said there are about a dozen other Ukrainian families living in Watertown on humanitarian parole. More families followed in the months after the Biliazes arrived, moving to Watertown under other sponsor families.
Two of the families left the country before the end of their parole, hoping to find refuge in European countries.
“They’re kicking people out who are good and hardworking,” Bruce said. “We need as many people in the workforce as we can get.”
Uncertainty creates anxiety within Ukrainian, Haitian communities
Ilona and Valerii applied for asylum in August last year, hoping it would offer a new avenue to citizenship or stall their impending deportation if the Ukrainian humanitarian parole program wasn’t renewed. Fleeing a war does not necessarily justify asylum. The status is based on persecution of a person’s race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or social group membership in their home country, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
The Biliazes received a rejection in April, and their attorney wrote a 19-page rebuttal. They are waiting for a determination on their appeal, but they don’t have much hope.
Since they applied for asylum, though, they were approved for a new work permit authorizing Ilona and their daughter to potentially live and work in the United States through June 2030, as long as their asylum case remains pending. The family is waiting to hear if they’ve been approved work permits for Valerii and their oldest son.
  Susan Buhler admires Dominika Biliaze’s makeup in Watertown on May 12, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Those permits could keep them in the country past August, if the case isn’t decided before then. The average processing time for asylum is five years, said Lutheran Social Service State Refugee Coordinator Dana Boraas. The Trump administration hopes to speed the process up.
If the asylum office doesn’t make a decision on the family’s appeal before their August deportation date, or decides to reject it, it’ll be forwarded to an immigration court. There, the Biliazes will be placed in deportation proceedings, where they’ll have another chance to have asylum decided by a judge.
Bruce Blumer, founder of Haiti Alive, sponsors a Haitian family living in South Dakota. The family of four are in the country under humanitarian parole, Blumer said, but they have “gnawing anxiety” after their work permits were terminated. They have until August before they have to leave the country.










The part that really disturbs me is that these people did exactly what this administration says they should do. They went through immigration, they filed and came here legally to our country.


– Bruce Blumer


The Federal Aviation Administration has extended its ban on U.S. flights to Haiti’s capital until Sept. 8, citing security risks from armed gangs.
“You’re sending these people back into dangerous, difficult and probably life threatening situations,” Blumer said.
Fortunately, Blumer said, Canada is accepting Haitians. The family he sponsors has been able to secure Canadian visas and plans to relocate there, he said, instead of returning to Haiti.
Ending the United States humanitarian parole programs is “nothing short of vindictive,” Blumer added.
“The part that really disturbs me is that these people did exactly what this administration says they should do,” Blumer said. “They went through immigration, they filed and came here legally to our country. They had an added step of having a sponsor to willingly contribute financially and vouch for these families.”
The Buhlers have sought help from South Dakota’s congressional delegates, but they have only received “generic responses” back. They don’t know where else to turn.
The Biliazes hope something will change.
“We’re still hoping we get to stay,” Ilona said. “This is our home.”

But now those neighbors face uncertainty as federal policy changes force them out of the workforce and potentially out of the country. And the nonprofit is struggling with an uncertain future as federal funding and policy changes impair the organization. 
Sioux Falls-based Lutheran Social Services of South Dakota announced it would close its Yankton office in March due to a loss of federal funding. More than $50,000 fundraised by the Yankton community since then will help keep that LSS office open for at least another year.
‘This is our home’: Ukrainians settled in SD fear Trump-Noem policies will force them to leave

President Donald Trump cut funding used to help new refugees adjust to life in the United States through organizations like LSS, which resettles refugees on behalf of the federal government.
The nonprofit eliminated 13 positions due to the loss and absorbed hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenses to provide resettlement services to those who arrived in America in the months before Trump assumed office, said CEO Rebecca Kiesow-Knudsen. The nonprofit also provides adoption, foster care, juvenile justice and behavioral health services to South Dakotans beyond its resettlement services.
She anticipates more funding cuts in the coming months. The changes are part of a “systematic dismantling of resettlement in the U.S.,” Kiesow-Knudsen said.
“What we’re feeling is we’re not going to see any substantive refugee resettlement in South Dakota in the near future.” 
Yankton population increases supported by immigration growth
Lutheran Social Services opened the Yankton office in 2022 to meet the needs of the area’s growing immigrant population.
The number of people identifying as Hispanic or Latino doubled in Yankton County between 2010 and 2020. The county’s overall population increased by about 872 people during the same period, according to Census data. Its Hispanic and Latino population alone increased by 620.
Driving much of that increase in Hispanic and Latino populations was a wave of Cuban immigrants moving to the area, Kiesow-Knudsen said. Many Cubans are living and working in the community legally through humanitarian parole, which is a temporary immigration status for individuals to live and work under a sponsor in the United States because they face a humanitarian crisis in their home country.
Lutheran Social Services worked with 143 Cuban humanitarian parole cases, or 169 people, in federal fiscal year 2024. There may be additional humanitarian parolees in South Dakota who haven’t contacted LSS for help, according to the nonprofit. 
The Yankton LSS office closure announcement coincided with the March closing of Cimpl’s Meats, a major employer in Yankton, which laid off more than 250 employees in March, many of whom were Cuban humanitarian parolees.

Those immigrants relied on Lutheran Social Services to find reemployment, said Rita Nelson, who formerly worked on workforce development at Yankton Thrive and sits on the Connecting Cultures Yankton board, which is affiliated with the economic development organization. The Yankton LSS office offers legal services, community orientation, health care navigation and job-seeking services. The state Department of Labor and Regulation also hosted a job fair to help workers apply for employment.
Immigrants in Yankton provide a sense of vibrancy and economic stability needed in the community, Nelson said. People moving in and starting families — whether foreign-born or not — work, live and spend money to support their families and area businesses.
“We all want individuals to be able to navigate the immigration process legally,” Nelson said, “and they can’t do that without a resource and someone who can help them.”
That feeling motivated Nelson and others to start a fundraising effort in April to keep the local LSS office open. Muddy Mo’s Coffee House owners posted about the fundraiser on social media and set a tip jar on the counter labeled “Help Your Neighbors.” The shop is owned by Katie Hunhoff, owner of South Dakota Magazine and daughter of the magazine’s founder and former state lawmaker Bernie Hunhoff.

The support reminded Bernie of times when farmers get sick or injured and neighbors rush to harvest the corn or bale the hay. It was an opportunity for people whose “hearts are with the Cimpl’s workers” to help.
Clients who use the LSS office were notified when it intended to close. They were also notified when their neighbors stepped in to keep the office open “because the community cares about them,” Hunhoff said.
“I think what happened in Yankton is powerful evidence this is where our community wants to go: We want to be good neighbors to everybody, and America is better as a welcoming place,” Hunhoff said.
Uncertainty for immigrants remains after community saves LSS office
Weeks after the community raised thousands of dollars to help their neighbors find reemployment through LSS, many of those same workers have been laid off again.
This time it was because the Supreme Court at the end of May upheld the Trump administration’s revocation of the Biden-era Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela parole program and elimination of the legal status of over 500,000 immigrants.
Cuban parolees are able to apply for U.S. citizenship through the Cuban Adjustment Act. While that pathway to citizenship is still open, said LSS State Refugee Coordinator Dana Boraas, the work permits of immigrants in the program were terminated. Several were laid off because “their work permits aren’t valid in the system anymore even if they expire next year,” she said.

The nonprofit is working with about 500 people affected by the terminated work permits statewide, to direct them toward legal services.
“A lot of people, unless they talk to an attorney, think they have no options to stay, they can’t file, and they have to leave,” Boraas said. “They get this scary notice saying, ‘You have to go home.’ We keep saying, ‘Talk to an attorney, talk to an attorney.’”
Yankton will be hurt if dozens of local immigrant families are forced out of the country, Hunhoff said.
“Of course, life will go on in Yankton and the other communities, but it’s a loss — not just economically but more so in terms of decency and fairness — and it’s contrary to everything we always believed about small town America,” Hunhoff said. “Maybe we aren’t the beacon of hope and morality we’ve always thought we were? That’s being tested.”
LSS faces more federal funding cuts
The Yankton community’s work to help its neighbors and the nonprofit is a “bright spot” for Lutheran Social Services, Kiesow-Knudsen said. But the organization’s funding troubles persist.
The nonprofit incurred about a half-million dollars in costs after the changes to immigration policy at the federal level, Kiesow-Knudsen said. Much of it was reimbursed by the federal government, after U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., argued that those funds were committed before Trump’s immigration overhaul. About $100,000 in expenses remain, Kiesow-Knudsen said.
The nonprofit continued to provide resettlement services for refugees who arrived in the United States within a few months of President Trump’s inauguration.
“It didn’t seem ethical to us to cut those people off,” Kiesow-Knudsen said. “It’s a story as old as our country. We welcome people.”
The nonprofit will have to cover the costs with funds from its foundation if the remainder is not reimbursed by the end of June.

The nonprofit is also working to understand what its role will be in the new federal fiscal year. As of October, Lutheran Social Services will no longer receive federal support for refugee resettlement directly from the federal government, under Trump’s new immigration policy.
South Dakota is one of 14 “replacement designee” states for refugee resettlement, meaning the funding goes directly to a nonprofit agency — such as LSS — rather than through the state. LSS has been the exclusive provider of refugee resettlement services in South Dakota for 25 years.
Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration will have to decide if South Dakota state government will take on its refugee program internally, like North Dakota or Minnesota; or contract the work out to another agency, in which case LSS could potentially be selected again; or decide not to accept any refugees. Wyoming is the only state that does not accept refugees.
LSS also lost a grant to help refugees find employment faster and a nearly $300,000 Department of Homeland Security grant used to provide education and legal assistance for immigrants working to become citizens. The legal services formerly cost $50 and classes were free. Now, legal services and classes cost $800 for anyone seeking citizenship. 
“That’s our breakeven cost to be able to pay the staff,” Boraas said.
The nonprofit is also facing additional cuts proposed in the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” under consideration in the U.S. Senate, that would eliminate funding for adult education and to help refugees who are in the United States for less than five years.
“I feel comfortable that we can provide services through September 2026, and then we’ll see based on what happens in Congress,” Kiesow-Knudsen said.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Dallen Michael Greene still remembers the fear he felt when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1999.
“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.

Living longer

People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.











The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares



“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.

Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.

Uncertain grants

Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help to shore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.

Skipping pills

In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”

We need Phil Scott to oppose the cruelty of the administration in Washington in the strongest possible terms.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Larry Satcowitz: Gov. Phil Scott, we’ve never needed you more. Where are you?.","This commentary is by Larry Satcowitz of Randolph. He is a Democrat representing the Orange-Washington-Addison District in the Vermont House of Representatives, and the ranking member of the House Environment Committee.


I was scheduled to be the final speaker at the “No Kings” rally in Burlington last week. Unfortunately, the event ran longer than anticipated, and I was not able to address the crowd. Here’s what I had planned to say: 
Good afternoon. My name is Larry Satcowitz. I’m a state representative from Randolph.
In these terrible and deeply disturbing times, it is a great joy to see you all today. Your presence gives me hope that we are a part of a large and growing resistance movement. Your presence gives me hope that we will thwart the billionaires and fascists that are currently in control of our federal government. 
We heard many wonderful speakers today. One person, however, was notably absent: Our governor, Republican, Phil Scott.
The Democratic Party is united in its opposition to Donald Trump. Every time a Democrat, like me, stands up, exactly no one is surprised. But opposition to Trump should not be a partisan issue. The president is destroying our democracy. He is destroying our economy. He is actively undermining our national security and the rule of law. These should not be partisan issues. 
A Republican governor who spoke out loudly, boldly and vigorously against the travesty taking place in Washington would do so with a special kind of authority. I remind you that Donald Trump and Phil Scott are on the same team.
I and others have recently published commentaries that ran in outlets all over the state, calling on our governor to speak out forcefully against the horrors that we are protesting here today. Days later Phil Scott issued a statement saying, “We must not allow ourselves to be distracted or live in a constant state of fear, anger or outrage.”
I can tell you that I have been terribly distracted since Jan. 20, I’ve been afraid for my country ever since that date. I am angry every single time I read the news. This is our reality, and we must face it.
Phil Scott called what’s going on “national rhetoric.”
He further wrote: “To move the Nation past the chaos Washington is causing, we need to rise above it and lead by example.” 
We do need to lead by example. The leaders who have preceded me on stage here today have done just that. If we followed our governor’s lead, we would not be here today at all.
There are Republicans who are opposed to what the president is doing. I believe Phil Scott is one of them. Imagine if he, as governor, took a clear, moral stand against the wrongdoings of the Trump administration. Imagine his leadership inspiring other Republican governors to stand up and do the same. Imagine the difference that would make for our country.
We need Phil Scott to oppose the cruelty of the administration in Washington in the strongest possible terms. We need him to oppose its recklessness in the strongest possible terms. We need him to oppose its outrageous corruption in the strongest possible terms.
Phil Scott frequently reminds us about how he is the governor of all Vermonters. All of us. Well, Phil, at this moment, we need you. We’ve never needed you more. Where are you? Why aren’t you here, with us, right now?

But with net population decline projected by 2050 and sub-par educational outcomes among Michigan children, we need to be serious about creating a state where kids can get ahead. Immigrant families are critical to our state reaching its full potential. 
In the past decade, immigrants have accounted for nearly 60% of the state’s population growth, while contributing billions in state revenue and economic activity. Yet a new swath of regulations, largely aimed to deter immigration, could do irreparable harm to many of our state’s youngest and most vulnerable residents.
In recent years, a surge of Unaccompanied Children (UCs) has crossed the southern border, entering Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody. These minors flee extreme circumstances where migration becomes an option of last resort. Michigan nonprofits serve children who made deadly journeys to earn money for their mothers’ cancer treatments or escape coercive recruitment into criminal enterprises.

The Trump administration has characterized these vulnerable children — 67% of whom are aged 16 or younger — as a national security threat, directing ICE to specifically target them for deportation. A multi-agency review of 450,000 unaccompanied minors is underway, enabled by revoking the DHS sensitive locations policy that previously protected schools, churches and hospitals from immigration raids.
In February, ICE began conducting “wellness checks” on immigrant children at schools — what the Young Center calls “a pretext to locate, interrogate and deport children and families.” A new plan proposes mobilizing 21,000 National Guard troops to round up UCs.
The administration also targets children by attacking the adults they rely on. After arrival, UCs transfer to ORR custody for shelter and basic necessities. Most unaccompanied children are then released to the custody of a sponsor, usually a close family member, until their legal status is adjudicated. However, new policy changes enable ICE to obtain the legal status of sponsors from ORR, putting undocumented sponsors at deportation risk.
Central to this campaign is terminating the Flores Settlement Agreement — the backbone of child protections requiring the provision of food, water, clean clothing and medical care in government custody. While courts have historically upheld the Flores Settlement Agreement, successfully overturning it would enable indefinite detention of children in prison-like conditions.
Already, new Trump administration rules requiring stringent sponsor identification verification now keep children in shelters an average 217 days before family release — up dramatically from previous timelines.
On top of this, a proposed budget reconciliation fine could charge sponsors up to $8,500 per child, while other provisions impose $1,000 asylum application fees and $500 Special Immigrant Visa fees — visas UCs often need when aging out at 18. These barriers create pay-to-play systems, effectively holding children ransom from families.
Funding cuts are eliminating vital services. The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC), the state’s primary legal provider for unaccompanied minors, supporting 800 children, faced a March stop-work order cutting legal funding and forcing 72 layoffs. This leaves young children — including toddlers — to navigate the U.S. legal system alone.
Budget reconciliation threatens additional vital benefits for children. The proposed Child Tax Credit changes would require both parents to have Social Security numbers to qualify, potentially denying the $2,000 credit to 4.5 million American citizen children under age 17 based solely on their parents’ immigration status. Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could affect 400,000 legal refugees and asylum recipients, while broader benefit reductions threaten extended family support systems that children depend upon.
When parents face deportation or detention, children experience toxic stress, which impairs brain development and increases risks of chronic mental health conditions, including depression and PTSD, plus physical conditions like cancer, stroke, diabetes and heart disease. Research shows most children experience at least four adverse behavioral changes following immigration-related parental arrests — such as chronic fear and disrupted eating and sleeping patterns.
These trauma responses directly undermine educational achievement and workforce preparation at a time when immigrants account for nearly 60% of Michigan’s population growth over the past decade.
The cumulative effect could devastate Michigan families. With 300,000 Michigan children living in immigrant families — including 70,000 high schoolers representing 15% of the state’s high school population — Michigan’s economic future depends on these families’ stability.
Michigan teachers and superintendents already report declining attendance among immigrant children, imperiling long-term development while families rush to create guardianships fearing deportations. By destabilizing families representing such a significant portion of Michigan’s emerging workforce, these enforcement policies risk creating a traumatized generation while threatening the state’s economic growth and development goals.
The Michigan League for Public Policy and our partners are working to make sure all kids have a chance to grow up strong and healthy in our state. We can’t risk Michigan’s future, or the lives of thousands of innocent kids who are looking for opportunity and family reunification, with shortsighted and harmful restrictions like these.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/asylum-seeker.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983
,Mississippi Today,2025-06-29 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Cindy Hyde-Smith hopes 2026 will be her first easy U.S. Senate campaign,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/29/cindy-hyde-smith-2026-hopes/,"Column: So far, Cindy Hyde-Smith's campaigns for U.S. Senate have not been easy in any way. Will her reelection bid in 2026 be any different?","The recent announcement that state Agriculture and Commerce Commissioner Andy Gipson plans to run for governor has fueled speculation about who will be running for what office in a wide open 2027 Mississippi election cycle.
Will all or any of the combination of Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, Auditor Shad White, Attorney General Lynn Fitch enter the gubernatorial donnybrook? Who will be the Democratic Party standard bearer, and will Democrats field competitive candidates for any of the other down-ticket statewide offices that could be vacant based on who is running for governor?
Perhaps, most importantly, will billionaire businessman Thomas Duff of Hattiesburg enter the gubernatorial race after showing numerous signals that he intends to?
But before the 2027 elections roll around there will be another consequential statewide race in Mississippi: for the U.S. Senate in 2026.
Incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith will be running in her third U.S. Senate race, and she surely hopes it will be her first easy one. Her first race, a special election in 2018 after longtime Sen. Thad Cochran retired, was the closest non-party primary U.S. Senate race in modern Mississippi history. Hyde-Smith, running then as the interim appointment of former Gov. Phil Bryant, captured 53.6% of the vote compared to 46.4% for Espy in the special election held to fill out Cochran’s term.
Trent Lott’s first race for the U.S. Senate was almost as close in 1988, when he won 53.9% to 46.1% against 4th District U.S. Rep. Wayne Dowdy. And in a 2008 special election, Republican Roger Wicker, appointed by Gov. Haley Barbour to fill a vacancy left when Lott retired, garnered 55% to 45% by former Democratic Gov. Ronnie Musgrove.
But after those relatively close elections, both Lott in 1994 and Wicker in 2012 had easier second elections.
Lott captured 69% of the vote against former state Sen. Ken Harper of Vicksburg. Wicker, on the other hand, had a little tougher race against Albert Gore, winning 57% to 40.6%. Gore was little known and underfunded, but was in many ways an attractive candidate with a noteworthy resume. Interestingly, Gore, like Wicker, was a Pontotoc County native.
In Hyde-Smith’s second race, she again faced Espy in a rare Mississippi campaign when the Democrat raised more money than the Republican. It is practically unheard of in the South — and assuredly in Mississippi — for a Democrat to raise more campaign funds than an incumbent Republican senator. Espy did.
Still, Hyde-Smith, who remains Mississippi’s only woman elected to a federal office, won 54.1% to 44.1%, but the campaign was far from easy for her.
The trend for decades has been that once a U.S. Senate seat is won in Mississippi, the incumbent holds the post for a long time with minimal opposition.
Hyde-Smith is still looking for that minimal opposition race. Will 2026 be when Hyde-Smith finally has an easy path to victory like other incumbent Mississippi senators normally have in their reelection efforts?
Perhaps hoping to ensure that easier path, President Donald Trump already has endorsed Hyde-Smith for her 2026 campaign.
But Trump also endorsed her in 2018 and 2020. Those endorsements did not result in easy campaigns for Hyde-Smith. In both of those campaigns, Hyde-Smith underperformed Trump’s Mississippi results.
Democrats Ty Pinkins and Albert Littell, both of whom have military backgrounds, already have announced their candidacy for 2026. Speculation is that District Attorney Scott Colom of Columbus also will challenge Hyde-Smith. And on the Republican side, author Sarah Adlakha, a Gulf Coast resident who works in health care, also has announced her campaign.
Whether other candidates emerge remains to be seen. And whether Hyde-Smith can experience a less stressful 2026 also remains to be seen.
So far the campaigns have not been as easy for her as for other incumbent U.S. senators from Mississippi.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/06203518/AP_20309179341434-scaled.jpg,,,2025-06-29 08:01:48.549378

Vermont’s farmers are growing crops that better suit the state’s warmer and wetter climate — and branching into products that provide income even when traditional crops fail. 
Since 1900, annual temperatures in Vermont have increased by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit and annual precipitation has increased by 21% over the same span, according to the state. The changes have forced agriculture to adapt in sometimes surprising ways.

Now that winters are milder, it has become commonplace for Vermont orchards to grow peaches. Nick Cowles owns Shelburne Orchards, and 35 years ago, he saw a bedraggled peach tree at a hardware store and bought it on a whim. Since then — especially in more recent years — peaches have become a lucrative addition to his business. 
Peach trees like rain, and so the increased precipitation in Vermont does not bother them. Historically, temperatures posed a problem for peach-growing.
“It takes around 15-17 degrees below zero in the winter to kill the bud, and it used to be that there would be a stretch in the winter that we would get those temperatures. I figured we would get a peach crop maybe every third year,” Cowles said.
Now, he said, “it’s rare that they freeze out.” 
Innovation is also making Vermont a more peach-friendly place. 
Farmers have used new technology to develop more cold-hardy peach varieties, Cowles said, and he now has trees that ripen at different times so that the picking lasts longer and brings in more customers. 
In Ferrisburgh, Erik Andrus has turned his hayfields into rice paddies. 
His Boundbrook Farm uses the rice-and-duck farming technique, a pesticide-free method in which ducklings are released into rice paddies. They control weeds and pests — and provide fertilizer. 
The farm mostly grows cold-tolerant rice varieties from Japan, which sits at a similar latitude to Vermont, but has recently started to grow loto rice from Italy. 
The farm once accidentally planted Koshihikari, a variety of Japanese rice poorly suited to the cold. It did eventually mature, but not until October, which Andrus said was “a little bit of a nailbiter.”
Floods and droughts appear to be striking Vermont more frequently, but the rice grown at Boundbrook Farm is fairly immune to both, Andrus said. 
The plants can be underwater for two days without being harmed, and the grains are protected by a husk that means they won’t be contaminated by pollution from floodwaters. Because the varieties can be planted in floodplains, they can get water even during droughts. 
Andrus said “flood-prone bottomlands” are the best places to create rice paddies. Vermont has many such areas, and rice could represent a path forward for farms impacted by flooding. 
He works as a consultant at Cornell University, where a team of researchers is studying rice-farming techniques in the Hudson Valley. They are also offering workshops and creating resources for farmers. 
But nothing like that exists in Vermont, and acquiring the tools, seeds and knowledge to create and manage a rice paddy without help is unrealistic for most farmers here. 
Andy Jones, the manager of Burlington’s Intervale Community Farm, said it has become easier to grow crops that like it warm: peppers, eggplants, melons, sweet potatoes. 
The member-owned farm has also seen increased yields of cold-weather spinach, lettuce and kale grown in unheated greenhouses in the winter. The flip side is that, for several weeks in the summer, the farm has had to stop growing some of those crops because it gets too hot. 
Precipitation is becoming more intense but also more inconsistent. An increase in dry periods means more irrigation is needed, and bigger rainstorms mean plants get wet and stay wet, leading to an increase in diseases, Jones said. 
Climate change has hit Intervale Community Farm particularly hard because the entire farm sits in the floodplains of the Winooski River.  
Jones said that they are used to floods, but “what’s been changing is the magnitude of the flooding.” Tropical Storm Irene and the flooding events of 2023 and 2024 devastated the Intervale area. In 2023, Jones estimates the farm lost 80% of its crops. 
In response, the farm is doing more succession cropping, or planting and harvesting the same crop multiple times. Its farmers plant crops that take little time to mature, so that if there is a flood, they have new ones ready quickly. 
The farm has been renting fields at another farm in Hinesburgh to plant slower-growing crops. It’s also moved a lot of crops into hoop houses and to higher elevations to keep them dry. 
In spite of the flooding, Jones believes the farm is there to stay. 
“The Intervale has been in agriculture for more than a thousand years, and that’s not going to change,” he said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 90% of American farms take in $250,000 or less per year, which usually doesn’t leave much profit. A failed crop can mean disaster for a small farm. 
For apple trees, thunderstorms pose a special danger, particularly ones that include hai. Cowles, from Shelburne Orchards, said that hail can “in five minutes just wipe out a whole year’s worth of work.” 
After losing 80% of his main crop, McIntosh apples, to a frost last year, he decided to buy crop insurance, which has provided some peace of mind. But that does little to address the increasingly unpredictable nature of farming. 
“You used to be able to think seven generations ahead, but right now, really if you can even make it through the next couple years it will be good,” he said. 
Many farmers are adapting to the uncertainty by diversifying their products. Since 2016, University of Vermont entomologist Margaret Skinner has been studying saffron farming in Vermont. The spice sells for $20-75 per gram, according to the state, and grows in or out of a greenhouse. 
It ripens later than most other crops, meaning farmers have more time to devote to saffron’s tedious harvest. 
Vermont’s warming is too subtle to impact saffron’s growth. And even if erratic weather makes harvests less consistent, saffron has an advantage: longevity. It lasts two or three years if dried properly, Skinner said, and farmers can count on it to bring in money when other crops fail. 
Vermont saffron is also appealing to customers because it is niche. As Skinner put it, “People are really into local cool crops.” 
The cool crop factor also applies to Boundbrook Farm’s rice. The farm sells to specialty retailers, restaurants and consumers who pre-order it from an email list.
Cowles said the novelty of fresh peaches in Vermont made them a coveted commodity, as is the experience of going to an orchard to pick them. Shelburne Orchards’ peaches are so popular that some customers sign up in advance for pick-your-own days to ensure the pickers don’t outnumber the peaches, Cowles said.
The orchard also distills its Dead Bird Brandy from those pears and apples. 
“We bottle it after nine years, and that’s income that comes in regardless of whether we have a failed crop or not,” Cowles said.

Area officials marched in the parade down Broadway including Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell, State Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Nashville Democrat, and a contingent of Metro Nashville Councilmembers. O’Connell and supporters wore shirts with the words, “Choose How You Love” — a play on the name of O’Connell’s transit program, “Choose How You Move.”
The festival portion of the event, held at Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, took a several-hour hiatus mid-afternoon as a thunderstorm spurred a “shelter in place” order.
This year’s event comes amid increased targeting of the LGBTQ+ community  by President Donald Trump. On Thursday, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth confirmed the U.S.S. Harvey Milk — named for assassinated political leader, LGBTQ+ rights champion and Korean War Veteran — would be named the U.S.S. Oscar Peterson, a Medal of Honor winner who died in World War II. Among other anti-LGBTQ+ actions, Trump has also prohibited transgender people from serving in the military.
Pride was first celebrated in the aftermath of the 1969 Stonewall Riots, in which patrons of a New York bar and drag queens fought against police who had raided the Stonewall Inn because of its same-sex clientele. Nashville held its first Pride celebration in 1989.
The festival will also be held Sunday.

RED SPRINGS —Early one evening this April, Kim Overstreet had just turned off the stove when she heard a boom. The panel box in the kitchen swung open and fuses shot out of their holders, bouncing off the fridge.
Less than a block away, Debra Duncan’s robot vacuum bolted off its charging station toward her, trailed by a blue flame.
In a home across the street, a light bulb exploded near a teenage boy, showering him in glass shards. “It frightened him so severely that he believed he had been shot,” one of his parents later wrote to town officials. It was the third power surge at the property in six months, they said.
These homes were among roughly 40 in Red Springs, a Robeson County town of 3,000, that were damaged by power surges on April 7. Residents lost appliances collectively worth tens of thousands of dollars: televisions, stoves and microwaves, washers and dryers, refrigerators, coffeemakers, HVAC systems, dishwashers, generators. Even surge protectors could not handle the voltage coursing through the electrical systems.

Officials with the town of Red Springs, which owns and operates its electric utility, have refused to cover the damages. They attribute the surge to the severe storms passing through that afternoon.
“We are deeming these losses as the result of Acts of God and were beyond the town’s control,” Town Manager Shanelle Harris wrote in an announcement on the Red Springs website April 17. “The power surges were not the result of lack of maintenance to the utility system or negligence. Our system meets modern, acceptable standards and the poles are annually inspected.”
Yet public documents and interviews show the Red Springs electric system is in disrepair. There isn’t enough money to cover major improvements, according to financial documents, in part because the town has used proceeds from its electric fund to float other government operations.
Red Springs is one of roughly 70 municipalities statewide that own and operate their own utilities. The town buys power from Duke Energy, but is responsible for the maintenance, improvements and operation of electrical lines, transformers and poles. It also sets rates and collects payments from customers.
Audits by the town’s accounting firm filed with the Local Government Commission, a division of the state treasurer’s office, reveal Red Springs routinely used customer payments deposited in the electric fund to fill gaps in the general fund, which covers day-to-day town operations, such as payroll.
State law allows municipalities to transfer those funds, but the amounts are capped, based on a percentage of the electric department’s gross annual revenues, or gross capital assets, for the previous year.
The state established those limits to “ensure electric funds are not being used to support municipalities’ general operations,” according to the town’s most recent audit.

In 2022 and 2023, the electric fund covered several months of health insurance premiums for some employees who did not work for the Electrical Department, including the town manager and the town clerk. The fund also covered a vacation payout for then-town manager David Ashburn when he retired in the spring of 2023.
“This practice has been stopped,” the town wrote to the Local Government Commission in response to the 2023 audit.
But a June 2024 audit showed Red Springs had transferred nearly $348,000 from the electric fund to plug holes in the general fund over the previous year. That amount was $101,000 more than the limit.
Since that audit, the town has reduced those transfer amounts well below the legal threshold, Red Springs’ Harris told Inside Climate News.
However, records show that even transfers within legal limits have significantly drained the electric fund.
The fund had an operating loss of more than $239,000 in fiscal year 2022, according to public documents. “This is largely due to the amount of subsidy provided to the General Fund, and inflation related to operating materials,” town officials wrote at the time.
In fiscal year 2021, electric capital reserves contributed $164,000 to the general fund; a second town account, the electric fund, transferred $176,000 to the water and sewer fund.
The storm and the power surges
Harris, who had been town manager for six months at the time of the April surges, wrote on the Red Springs website a storm with high winds caused electric lines to cross or “slap” at an intersection downtown.
A storm did pass through Red Springs that day. The first surge occurred at 2 p.m., and blew parts of Duncan’s meter base 10 feet, where they landed near an azalea bush.
Although the weather was calm, neighborhood residents said, a second surge occurred around 7 p.m., and destroyed their appliances.

Harris said the second surge happened when Duke Energy tripped a breaker at its substation. A Duke Energy spokesman told Inside Climate News that some of its Robeson County customers experienced storm-related outages at 2 p.m. and again at 7 p.m. after a tree fell on a line. He could not confirm whether a breaker had been tripped.
After the second surge, Overstreet said she called the town dispatch and told them she needed to speak to someone as soon as possible. Electric department workers then arrived at her home.
She and her husband noticed the wires leading from a pole to the top of the house had come loose.
“Every time we have an outage, it’s that transformer. They come out and fix it,” but the repairs don’t last, Overstreet said.
The Overstreets have experienced problems with the electrical system, and in one case, the town’s insurance covered it. In 2013, a voltage issue affected the fridge, Overstreet said. A receipt from that time shows the town paid $1,055 for “property damage.”
Harris also attributed the widespread damage to electrical problems within individual homes. When town staff replaced damaged meters, she wrote, “some customers were advised their homes had outdated meter bases that weren’t … properly grounded, old panel boxes or faulty wiring.”
Overstreet’s home was built in the 1940s, but she said her meter had been updated. Workers who came to the house after the surge did not go inside to check the wiring, she said, nor did they comment on the age of her meter.

The home next door that sustained three power surges was built in 2007. Duncan’s home is 42 years old, constructed in 1983. “I went through Hurricanes Fran, Matthew, and Florence, and nothing like this happened,” she said.
Property records show that with the exception of one historic home, the 15 damaged houses in east-central Red Springs were built between 1941 and 2019.
“We all had the same thing happen, no matter what year our homes were built or how good the wiring was,” Overstreet said. “We all had one thing in common: where we got our electricity.”
A former Red Springs employee told Inside Climate News that about half of the town’s transformers are capable of accommodating a higher voltage, but the rest are not. “It’s harder to get transformers for the lower voltage,” said the former employee, who asked not to be named because they still have connections to the town. “One of these days, it’s going to go down and not come back up.”


The former employee’s account matches comments Red Springs has provided to the Office of State Budget and Management. Two years ago, the town received a $1 million grant, half of which was supposed to cover electrical upgrades. To receive the funds, the town had to submit a scope of work document.
According to that document, “a much-needed electric utility upgrade is converting areas of town from 4 kVA power to 24 kVA power.”
A kilovolt-ampere, or kVA, is a unit of measurement that indicates the total energy supplied to an electrical system. When an energy load is unbalanced, equipment can overheat, fail, increase power consumption and degrade the overall performance of the system.
Red Springs would also “assess low-voltage areas and a full upgrade,” the town wrote, “and eliminate an obsolete substation and improve lines and infrastructure.”
The town received the grant in February 2025, according to an Office of State Budget and Management spokesperson, but has not yet reported any expenses.
The town’s electric fund is more solvent now because rate increases “provided significant revenues to the once-struggling fund,” according to a proposed town budget presented to the commissioners in early June. The budget calls for $210,000, within the legal limit, to be transferred to the general fund.
Earlier this month, Overstreet spoke before the town commissioners and told them the April 7 power surge could have been handled differently. “Even if you would have told us to give you a list of the things we lost, and to tell you what happened to us that day,” she said. “A little bit of respect and compassion goes a long way.”
The Overstreets did file a claim with their insurance company and received a small sum to replace the food in their burned-out refrigerator. A dryer also had to be replaced, but insurance did not cover that. Overstreet estimates the family has spent $5,000 out of pocket on new appliances and light fixtures.
“We pay the town, we entrust our safety to the town,” she said. “When I lay down at night, I used to feel reassured that they have my safety as their first interest. Now I don’t feel that at all.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Red-Springs-town-hall-Inside-Climate-News-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983

Jeff Landry took more control over Louisiana's public defense system in 2024, chief public defender contracts have been irregular. (Getty Images)Last year, the attorneys who run local public defender offices noticed an unexpected clause in their annual state work contracts. It dictated the state public defender would have “sole authority” to increase their compensation “at any time for any reason.” 

The provision ran contrary to a law the Louisiana Legislature approved a few months earlier requiring the state public defender to set pay rates for lead local public defenders “according to a compensation plan established by the board,” that oversees the public defender system. 
State Public Defender Rémy Starns had asked the legislature to give him exclusive control over chief public defender pay in February 2024, but the lawmakers declined. Instead, they added the stipulation to state law that requires him to use the Public Defender Oversight Board’s pay guidelines. 
Some local public defenders believe Starns slipped the extra clause into their contracts – which started on July 1, 2024, and run through the end of this month – to give himself power the legislature wouldn’t. Three of the state’s 36 chief public defenders crossed out the language before signing their contracts and sending them back to Starns. 
In response, Starns did not sign those three contracts, though the three attorneys – Michelle AndrePont of Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson of Natchitoches Parish and Trisha Ward of Evangeline Parish – continued to work the past year as if they were in place. 
Their experience is indicative of a wider pattern of irregularities since Gov. Jeff Landry and lawmakers restructured the public defender system last year to give Starns more authority. The Louisiana Illuminator obtained and reviewed copies of the annual contracts of the 36 chief public defenders currently working through a public records request. 
Over the past three months, Starns has refused to answer calls, texts and written questions sent through a series of emails about this report. 
Public defender contracts are late, unsigned 
In all, Starns had not signed contracts for 10 attorneys running local public defender offices as of March, nine months into the 12-month term of their agreements. Five weren’t signed by either Starns or the applicable chief public defender, though the attorneys continued to oversee the local offices as if the agreements were in effect. 
Of the contracts Starns did sign, at least 20 were signed late. All but two of the contracts with 36 current chiefs had a start date of July 1, 2024, but Starns signed only four before that deadline. 
It’s unclear why so many contracts were not completed or signed before they took effect. The chief public defenders in question have not commented, with 21 either not responding to phone calls made to their offices or declining to talk to a reporter. 
People who have previously worked in Louisiana’s public defender system said it is unusual for so many employment agreements to not be completed by their start date. 
“As far as I recall, all the contracts were always signed,” said Jay Dixon, who served as Louisiana’s state public defender from 2013-19. “When I was there, there was never anybody whose contract was not renewed.”
For nearly two decades, a state public defender board was in charge of hiring chief public defenders and had to vote on their contracts. That all changed in 2024 when the governor and Starns successfully lobbied for the state public defender to have more control over those positions.

Starns now mostly controls the hiring of chief public defenders instead of the board. Louisiana’s sprawling public defense network includes 850 attorneys who represent 146,000 people annually, accounting for approximately 88% of criminal defendants in the state. 
Frank Neuner, a Lafayette corporate defense attorney who was chair of the state public defender board from 2008-13, was taken aback when told about the irregularities in the contracts under Starns’ watch. 
“That’s very abnormal,” said Neuner, who serves on the board for the Legal Services Corp., a legal aid nonprofit, as an appointee of President Donald Trump. “That’s your contract. That shows me poor administration.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Starns adds pay incentives without board approval
When hiring two new chief public defenders this year, Starns ignored the state public defender board’s pay scale he was supposed to follow. Instead, he used a compensation plan he asked the board to adopt three times in the last year but that board members rejected. 
The board compensation structure bases pay on a chief public defender’s experience as well as the size and complexity of the offices they run. For example, some oversee offices in more than one judicial district, and they would be compensated more under the board plan. 

Starns’ proposal, which the board has never agreed to use, relies more heavily on offering incentive pay to chief public defenders who personally try cases in court. It also encourages chiefs with smaller offices to run private law practices in addition to their public criminal defense work. 

In some cases, Starns’ compensation plan would cut the pay of individual chief public defenders by tens of thousands of dollars, which is a primary reason the board has declined to approve it. Starns has said he believes some current chief public defenders are paid too much. 

In August, Chris Bowman signed a contract Starns drafted to become chief public defender in Winn Parish. It stipulates Bowman will be paid $60,000 per year, with the potential to earn up to $75,000 as long as he personally represents clients in court. It doesn’t give a specific number of cases that Bowman must pick up, but it appears to allow Starns to decide if Bowman has done enough work to earn the salary boost. 

Bowman could not be reached at his office for comment about his contract. 
In November, Antonio Birotte signed a contract from Starns to become chief public defender of St. Landry Parish. His base salary is $84,000 per year, with the potential to earn up to $112,000 as long as Birotte personally represents defendants in murder cases as well as parents in juvenile court. 
As with Bowman, no specific number of cases is mentioned, presumably leaving it up to Starns to decide if Birotte has done enough work to receive his bonus pay. Birotte hasn’t responded to phone calls and messages left at his office. 
Public defender board members are angry with Starns for structuring contracts with his own compensation plan and not the one they have approved. They said Starns is breaking the law enacted just last year. 

“It’s our authority to approve a compensation plan,” member Adrejia Boutté told Starns at a board meeting earlier this month. “It’s still violating something that we’ve already passed.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
New contracts with more control for Starns

The contracts Starns has asked chief public defenders to sign for the fiscal year that starts Tuesday give him even more power over their compensation. 

They stipulate that Starns and the chief public defenders can terminate their contracts at any time for any reason with 30 days notice. The chief defenders also have to waive the right to appeal their termination to the public defender board and decline their right to use the board’s compensation plan. 
At the June board meeting, Starns said he would not agree to use the board’s compensation plan in any of the contracts. 

“I’m not going to have contracts that have those provisions in them,” he told the board members. 
“That’s why they were waived,” he added. 

Starns’ new stipulations appear to be in response to five chief public defenders who he is trying to oust that have challenged their dismissals. Earlier this month, a board committee recommended the full public defender board block Starns from firing the attorneys. Members are expected to vote on whether to try and stop the dismissals Monday. 
Starns is trying to dismiss AndrePont, Brunson and Ward – the three attorneys who struck language from their contracts that Starns wanted to include last year. He also wants to terminate Deirdre Fuller of Rapides Parish and John Hogue, who works in  East Carroll, Madison and Tensas parishes. 
The five attorneys have been the most vocal about opposing Starns’ policies since he first became state public defender in 2020 under former Gov. John Bel Edwards. They have pushed back on his proposed compensation plan several times in front of the board and state lawmakers. 

Starns said 30 chief public defenders have agreed to his additions to their contracts that give him more control over their pay and more ability to fire them without cause. 

Board member Frank Thaxton is skeptical, saying chiefs have only agreed to those conditions because they are afraid Starns will retaliate against them otherwise. A retired district court judge, Thaxton said some have contacted him personally asking for help. 

“The district defenders are afraid to even discuss this among themselves, due to a well grounded fear of immediate termination if their opinions get back to the state public defender. We have no protection at all other than the board,” Thaxton said, reading from an email sent from a chief public defender whose name wasn’t disclosed during this month’s board meeting. 
“The overwhelming mood is fear. I am even afraid to send this message,” Thaxton said, quoting the email further. 

Derwyn Bunton, Orleans Parish chief public defender from 2009-22, said the concessions Starns has inserted into the chiefs’ contracts for the upcoming year are substantially different from what was expected when he worked in Louisiana’s public defense system. 

Bunton is now the chief legal officer of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization that fights racism and other forms of discrimination, particularly in the criminal justice system. 
“It is a level of interference that no district attorney would ever allow or tolerate,” Bunton said. “The idea was to have the public defender stand on equal footing with the district attorney … and this is certainly a departure from that.”
Starns’ overwhelming control over the chiefs’ jobs could also make it more difficult for the attorneys on the frontlines of the public defender system to do their jobs. The state public defender is appointed by the governor, whose political goals often run contrary to the mission of the public defense system. 
Defendants have a constitutional right to legal counsel when facing criminal charges, but that doesn’t make it a popular choice to represent people accused of heinous acts. 

In order to represent their clients adequately, public defenders often have to be insulated from powerful political groups, said Nathan Fennell, an expert on indigent defense with Southern Methodist University’s Deason Criminal Justice Reform Center in Dallas. 

“The more that a public defender has to worry about how to keep their job … then the bigger the structural problem is … and the more the client may suffer,” Fennell said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gavel-GettyImages-876701606-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983

A new state law that raises Mississippi’s gasoline tax by 3 cents a gallon and cuts the state grocery tax by 2% will take effect on Tuesday, along with other statutes the Legislature passed and governor signed into law earlier this year. 
Mississippi currently has a flat 18.4 cents a gallon excise tax on fuel, one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation. The law will raise the tax to 21.5 cents a gallon this year, then increase it three cents a year until July 1, 2027. At completion, the state gas tax will be 27.4 cents a gallon, a 9-cent total increase. 
Proceeds from the tax will go toward building and maintaining state roads specified by the Mississippi Department of Transportation. 
Mississippi also has a 7% sales tax on non-prepared food, commonly called the grocery tax. The tax, the highest of its kind in the nation, will be reduced to 5% in July. Municipalities around the state receive a portion of this sales tax. The new law ensures cities will receive a larger diversion rate, and be “made whole” from the cut. 
“The decrease is part of House Bill 1 that passed during this year’s Regular Session of the Mississippi Legislature,” Revenue Commissioner Chris Graham said in a press release. “We are excited to be able to administer this reduction to help provide relief on the cost of groceries to Mississippi families.”

Sweeping Mississippi tax overhaul passed … by mistake. Gov. Reeves eager to sign typo tax swap into law

Mississippians will also see a reduction in the state income tax rate because state officials are still phasing in a 2022 law that is reducing the income tax to 4%. The Legislature this year passed a new law that will reduce the 4% tax rate in 2027 to 3% over four years. Starting in 2031, the remaining 3% tax will be eliminated over time, based on economic growth triggers. 
 In addition to the tax overhaul, other laws will also go into effect on July 1, including:
Direct wine shipment
A new law legalizes shipping some wines to Mississippians’ homes. Supporters pushed to allow direct wine shipment for over a decade before they succeeded this session. Mississippi was one of only a handful of states that didn’t allow direct shipment. 
Under the new law, shippers must obtain a permit from the Department of Revenue to ship wine, and they are capped at 12 nine-liter cases of wine annually to any one address. The measure also restricts citizens to ordering only certain specialty or rare wines that may not be available at Mississippi package stores. The law aims to generate taxes by enacting a 15.5% tax on direct wine shipments. Some of the tax revenue will fund mental health programs.
Kratom banned for people under 21
Mississippi will limit kratom purchases to people 21 and older and outlaw more potent forms of the herbal substance. The new law institutes fines for people under 21 who buy or possess kratom and retailers that sell it to them. The measure also bans synthetic kratom extracts, which are considered more dangerous than “pure” forms of the herbal substance because of their higher potency. 
More than thirty counties and cities in Mississippi already restrict or ban kratom products, which can be found widely in gas stations and tobacco or vape shops. Any ordinances that have been adopted by municipalities or counties to regulate or ban kratom will remain in effect. 
Rape kit mandate 
Mississippi hospitals will now be required to perform rape kits on sexual assault victims who come to their ERs. A new law mandates all hospitals stock rape kits, have a provider available to perform a rape kit, and that they do not turn rape victims away.

The legislation was inspired by several cases where survivors did not receive routine treatment at hospitals, according to sexual assault advocacy organizations. 
Turkey stamps 
Mississippi hunters must obtain a turkey stamp before harvesting the wild birds, a new state law requires. The measure requires in-state hunters to purchase a $10 turkey stamp and out-of-state hunters to pay a $100 fee for the stamp. In addition to the new stamp, the law still requires hunters to obtain a normal hunting license. 
Proponents of the measure said the stamp fees would be used to maintain and improve turkey-hunting lands around the state.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24151925/3X0A5170.jpg,,,2025-06-29 07:05:42.805983

To access, click on the player above.
On a recent Tuesday afternoon in a Hartford courtroom, a small crowd of about 20 people waited to be called before the judge.
Some fidgeted nervously. None of them had a lawyer of their own.
U.S. Immigration Judge Ted Doolittle called them forward, one by one, to the table facing him. An interpreter sat to his right, and an attorney from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was on a video monitor.
Those waiting their turn listened closely to the interpreter. 
“I am looking for a lawyer, but most either don’t answer or say that they are busy,” one woman told Doolittle. “I’ve looked for them, contacted a few, some didn’t answer and some didn’t want to take my case because they were working on other cases.” 
The lack of an affordable and available lawyer was the common thread that bound this group together. 
Immigration courts fall under the federal executive branch, not the judicial branch, like most courts. And immigration cases are civil, not criminal, meaning certain due process protections don’t apply — including the right to a court-appointed lawyer. 
Judge Doolittle gave each of the individuals before him a list of free and low-cost attorneys and emphasized the importance of having representation.
“[The lawyers] are often too busy to help everyone, and it can be hard to get in touch,” he told them. But the judge added that families with good attorneys win their cases more often. 
The judge warned the people in the room to be careful as they looked for an attorney. They shouldn’t give money to people they don’t know, he said.
As Doolittle dealt with each case, setting new court dates for most, the room gradually emptied.

CT’s shortage of immigration attorneys
It’s not unusual for immigrants to go through court without legal representation. But a Connecticut Mirror investigation found that Connecticut stands out for having one of the lower representation rates in the country — and that matters when someone is trying to avoid deportation. As Doolittle noted in court that day in June, people are far more likely to win their cases when they have a lawyer.
A shortage of judges and immigration court staff, a recent influx of migrants to the United States and the labor-intensive nature of cases have rendered it impossible for Connecticut’s small community of immigration lawyers to meet the demand for representation. 
As a result, tens of thousands of immigrants in Connecticut are left without legal support, even as stories of immigration enforcement grow more frequent, from a mother taken from her car in New Haven to men detained at a Southington car wash.
Every time I look at [the case backlog], it just keeps growing again.Sheila Hayre, Quinnipiac Law Professor, supervisor at Quinnipiac Civil Justice Clinic
Even attorneys who have worked on immigration cases, like Maggie Rodriguez, formerly a lawyer with Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services (IRIS) in New Haven, don’t have much capacity to take on new clients with immigration cases.
“If you are taking on this case from start to finish, you’re signing up for a many-year-long representation,” she said. “Once your docket is full, it remains full for a long time.”
That’s true not only for Rodriguez but for most other immigration lawyers in Connecticut. IRIS and other aid organizations have gathered and distributed materials to help people understand their rights in immigration proceedings and when interacting with law enforcement.
“That is all that we’re really able to offer the immigrant community right now,” said Ellen Messali, an attorney with the legal aid organization New Haven Legal.
Immigrants in the U.S. illegally — those who entered without proper documentation or overstayed a visa — have the right to due process when authorities bring a case seeking to deport them. 
But the immigration courts that handle these cases are overloaded, facing a backlog that has grown for nearly two decades and ballooned in 2023 and 2024. At the end of last year, the number of pending cases nationwide was over 3.6 million. 
Immigration court backlog
In Connecticut, more than 42,000 cases were pending as of May, before just two judges. In fiscal year 2024 alone, more than 20,000 new cases were added to the docket. On average, cases in Connecticut take nearly 500 days to be resolved.
“Every time I look at that number, it just keeps growing again,” said Sheila Hayre, a clinical professor at Quinnipiac University School of Law and supervisor at Quinnipiac’s Civil Justice Clinic.
Lawyers say the legal process can be lengthy and unpredictable in immigration court, and outcomes can vary depending on which judge is hearing a case. The judges in Hartford’s Immigration Court, for example, denied nearly 70% of asylum cases from the 2019 through 2024 fiscal years, while the national average is below 60%, according to data gathered by the research group Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse and analyzed by CT Mirror.
Since many immigrants lack access to legal representation, it often falls to judges to explain the complexities of a defendant’s various legal options.
For example, in federal court that day in June, one man told Judge Doolittle that he had hired a lawyer, but they didn’t collect evidence. Another man told the judge he wanted to keep fighting his case but had already been defrauded by an attorney. Because the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was seeking to deport him quickly, both the judge and the government attorney suggested he find a new lawyer soon so the attorney would have time to prepare to fight deportation proceedings. 
“This is some good advice from the government attorney,” Doolittle said. “Don’t wait.”
Doolittle also took time to explain options to two single moms who didn’t have lawyers.
One young mother, whose daughter wore a pink dress, said she had tried three attorneys, but none would take her asylum case. The judge told her the next hearing would go forward with or without a lawyer and suggested she look into Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). She had never heard of the program before. 
But giving people extensive legal advice “is obviously not a good way for a judge to spend time,” Hayre said. In cases where a defendant’s son or daughter could be sent back to their home country, she said, judges know that an extra five minutes of explanation could end up being a matter of life or death for the child — given the threats some immigrants face back home.

“There’s nobody else to explain it,” Hayre said. “The whole thing is so frustrating.”
But even as immigration enforcement is ramping up, while case backlogs have grown across the country over the past five years, the federal government fired 20 immigration judges in February.
The number of immigration judges in Hartford recently dropped from three to two. There are concerns that immigration cases in Hartford will now take longer to process and may suffer in quality at a time when courts are already overwhelmed and expecting even more cases.
Dozens of members of Congress signed a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi expressing their concerns, including U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District.
The importance of legal representation 
Hayre recalled the story of a Guatemalan woman she represented who was trapped in an abusive marriage. The woman, mother to two U.S. citizen teenagers, lived in constant fear.
The woman’s husband used her immigration status to threaten her safety if she looked for help. 
“I have status,” her husband would tell her, Hayre said. “You have no rights in this country because you are undocumented.” 
Hayre said she remembered how he would threaten his wife: “If you call the police, I will tell them lies about you, and they will listen to me because I am legal.”  
For people with very good cases where maybe their family is in danger in their home country, [the court delays are] really much more of a problem.Michael Boyle, immigration attorney
The woman’s husband told her if she tried to ask for custody or child support, the judge would give him custody and she would be deported.
Without access to an immigration attorney, many victims don’t realize they could qualify for protections under federal law. 
The woman was able to get legal status through a program under the Violence Against Women Act. Soon after, Hayre heard from her for the first time in four months. That was the first time that she spoke in English to Hayre.
“She told me that getting status gave her a new lease on life and a new connection to this country,” Hayre said. “Divorced from her abuser, she was now working two jobs, making more money than her husband, and her kids were excelling in school. One child was starting his military service.”
Immigrants facing removal proceedings are more likely to prevail in their cases if they are represented by a lawyer. Most do not have representation. 

While immigrants have the right to legal representation, they must pay for it themselves.
And  lawyers are hard to find.
In Connecticut, just over 26% of immigrants with pending cases are represented by a lawyer, TRAC data shows. And for those with newer cases, about 28% are represented. 
Compared to other states, Connecticut ranked 17th from the bottom for legal representation in immigration court cases as of May 2025.

That includes all cases that are still waiting for a decision in immigration court. Some cases may only need one hearing, while others can stretch over many years with multiple court dates, according to TRAC.
In some cases, it takes time to even be added to the court docket. Some people arrested at the border and released to pursue their cases end up stuck in limbo at the border. Their cases are not filed with an immigration court, sometimes for years. 
“For people with weak cases, that’s fantastic, because they often got work authorization, nobody’s going to bother them for years. So they’re picking up extra years here,” said Michael Boyle, an immigration attorney with offices in Danbury and New Haven. “For people with very good cases where maybe their family is in danger in their home country, it’s really much more of a problem.”
At the start of the process, many people don’t have lawyers. But as cases move forward, particularly closer to a final decision like an asylum ruling, people are more likely to find legal representation. That’s why early-stage cases tend to have lower representation rates.
Cases without lawyers are often resolved faster, according to TRAC, because “without representation, more often than not, no one is available with the knowledge and skills required to effectively mount a defense.” Over time, this leaves a growing share of the backlog made up of people who do have lawyers.
For example, in the 2025 fiscal year, 74% of pending cases involved people without a lawyer, while 26% were represented. In initial hearings, 91% of cases were unrepresented, but in later-stage hearings where decisions are made, 89% of people had lawyers, according to a CT Mirror analysis of TRAC data. 
It’s not clear exactly how many immigration lawyers are working in Connecticut. But if the total number of immigration lawyers in the U.S. were evenly distributed by population, it would be fair to estimate Connecticut has only about 200. And they’re expensive: Legal fees can range from $10,000 to $20,000 or more per case. 
With so few available, it isn’t possible for immigration lawyers to represent every client that seeks their help. 
“What if you’re a family fleeing Venezuela? How do you represent the whole family? So the lawyer is making a very hard decision of who has the strongest case,” Hayre said.
Representation and court outcomes
Representation plays a crucial role in deportation case outcomes. Among those granted relief, 97.5% were represented, while only 2.5% were not. Of those removed, only 26.8% were represented, while 73.1% were not.
But the growing backlog has placed mounting pressure on the entire immigration legal system, cutting down the time and resources available. So immigrants with stronger or less complicated cases often have an easier time finding representation — and a higher likelihood of winning their cases. 
“People in immigration court are having their absolute entire life decided in one to two hours,” Boyle said. “It used to be, up until a couple of years ago, it used to be you at least got three or four hours.”
Getting more time if front of a judge often requires pushing back, Boyle said. Otherwise, life-altering decisions are made in an incredibly short window without adequate time to build a detailed record and establish the applicant’s credibility, he said.
In Connecticut, in asylum cases from Fiscal Year 2001 through May 2025, more than 37% of asylum decisions — involving people who are seeking relief from deportation because of conditions in their home country — were granted on their merits when defendants had legal representation. In cases where the defendant didn’t have a lawyer, roughly 10% were granted asylum or other relief, according to a CT Mirror analysis of TRAC data. 
If an immigrant gets arrested and detained, representation becomes even more complicated. Some may find themselves no longer able to afford a lawyer because they’re unable to work. 
“You think that you know what you might be doing for a client to help them one day, and then, within a matter of days, that option that you thought you have may no longer even be available,” New Haven Legal’s Messali said.
Not everyone wants to work in situations where people are so traumatized.Ellen Messali, New Haven Legal
It also shifts the logistics of working a case, Messali said. Visiting clients in detention is an all-day commitment because there are no immigration detention centers in Connecticut. 
Some of New Haven Legal’s clients are in Plymouth, Mass. Others are in Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Clients have also been sent to facilities even further away, leaving them far from their contacts and their families.
“We’ve had clients get sent south to Georgia,” Messali said.
Securing bonds for detained immigrants can significantly improve their chances of success in immigration court, allowing them to be home with their families and properly prepare their cases, Messali said. When released on bond, their case returns to the court’s regular docket, giving them years to find legal representation and prepare their applications. But with so few lawyers available, it still leaves many scrambling.
Those who remain detained face an expedited process, having just weeks or months to prepare for removal proceedings. There often isn’t time to find legal representation. 
Remote hearings further complicate the process, with detainees appearing before a judge over a screen and relying on phone or video interpretation.
“While accessing clients who are detained out of state is very taxing and resource-intensive, we do not advocate for Connecticut to begin detaining immigrants in its correctional facilities,” Messali said. “We are opposed to immigration detention anywhere and want to see it abolished.”
Limited options
The supply of lawyers isn’t meeting demand because providing low-cost or free legal services to immigrants requires substantial funding, which “just kind of doesn’t exist” in Connecticut, Rodriguez said. That means fewer open positions for lawyers interested in representing immigrant clients in the state.
Back at the courtroom, one woman said she had spoken to three lawyers but was told that none had capacity to take on her case. Another woman had filed her petition for asylum with an attorney at a nonprofit who was later let go due to lack of funding at that organization. The woman was on two lists for legal aid services in New Haven and Bridgeport, but the clock was ticking on her case. She told Doolittle she’d looked into private defense but found it was unaffordable. 
“I understand that it’s hard, and there’s a lack of funding,” Doolittle told her. The judge granted several of the individuals before him an extra year to find an immigration attorney. 
People who want to practice immigration law are more likely to find jobs in Boston or New York, Rodriguez said. That leaves immigrants in Connecticut with limited options. The highest concentration of immigration cases in the state are in Bridgeport, Danbury, Hartford, Stamford and New Haven — which isn’t convenient for a lawyer licensed in Massachusetts or New York. 
And the work itself is hard. Beyond the legal complexities, the emotional toll can be profound, Messali said. 
“The work that my colleagues and I do is very trauma-intensive,” she said. “We work with people who have been persecuted, who have been tortured, who are terrified at the prospect of returning to their home countries. Not everyone wants to work in situations where people are so traumatized and [face] the additional challenges that come with working with individuals who have been through this kind of trauma.”
Despite the emotional toll, Hayre continues to pursue this line of work. Stories like the Guatemalan woman’s keep her going. 
“I do this because of people like her — immigrants who remind me of why this country is so great, because of people who come here seeking a better life, ready to work hard in order to ensure a better future for themselves and their children.”
Brian Galliani, dean of the Quinnipiac School of Law, said Connecticut might consider funding a “right to counsel” program for immigrants, similar to a service the state provides to defendants in eviction cases. 
Galliani pointed to the state of Oregon as an example, where immigrant legal representation is funded by the state through a nonprofit known as the Innovation Law Lab. That organization also partners with law school graduates who can earn a license by completing a certain number of hours of supervised legal service to clients. He said that the same model could work in Connecticut.
Quinnipiac’s Hayre said while having a lawyer is ideal, expanding legal education and courtroom support for immigrants could make a big difference — by helping them navigate the system more effectively, reducing the burden on judges and ensuring fewer families fall through the cracks. 
“It may be just legal knowledge and information so that people can better advocate for themselves and put their stories together on their own,” she said. 
With the immigration court system under so much stress, and with immigration enforcement policy changing rapidly, many immigrants have a difficult choice: remain in the U.S. and face rising uncertainty, or return to a home country and face potentially life-threatening circumstances. 
Messali said she hopes Connecticut residents, many of whom are her clients’ neighbors and coworkers, can resist what she sees as misrepresentations of immigrants. Instead, she hopes they’ll try to understand the pressure many immigrants are under — and their resilience in the face of it.
“The biggest thing I wish people knew is just how wonderful my clients are, just how wonderful the immigrant communities in our state and throughout our country are — how hopeful, decent, hard working, giving and generous they are,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LAWYER-IMM-0314-DE-010-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-29 05:00:50.032714

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Highway 50 is calling.
From home on Constitution Street in Emporia, I am within walking distance of the route Time magazine called the “backbone of America.” Three blocks to the south, the highway eddies and swirls with local traffic, those headed to work or coming back from a grocery run or, after dark, young people cruising the Sonic to show off. The highway doesn’t carry as much traffic as it used to — the interstate on the north end of town is faster if you’re bound for Wichita or Kansas City — but if you’re in no hurry and have a sense of adventure, U.S. Highway 50 is your path.
I’ve followed the highway there and back for most of my life.
It unwinds in my imagination like a rattler dodging grain trucks on a strip of baking asphalt. The highway has been the conduit for every true adventure I’ve had in the West, and when my wheels have been too long in one spot I become restless, thinking of scorching summers on the high plains and Rocky Mountain passes cloaked with snow.
Highway 50 doesn’t have the charisma of Route 66, a bygone road synonymous with American kitsch, but 50 remains the hard-traveled street of truckers, laborers and journeymen poets. Its two lanes stretch about 3,000 miles from Ocean City, Maryland, to Sacramento, California. It takes 12 days to travel all of it, one-way, according to a website by somebody who has done it. I’ve traversed most of 50, except for the first bit in Maryland, but I reckon I’ll get to that eventually. Portions of the highway, especially the lonely stretch out in Nevada, have been traveled by Jack Kerouac and William Least Heat-Moon. I’ve driven that route as well, when Kim and I returned from Sacramento one summer, and I remember watching the fuel gauge and worrying if the Jeep would make it to the next gas station. It did, but barely. Out West, poor planning is punished with inconvenience or worse.
When I was a kid, my dad would plan meticulously for summer vacation, carefully hiding a couple of hundred dollars in cash and traveler’s checks in the trunk of our old Ford and stocking the cooler with bologna. In those days — say, 1970 — average people didn’t have credit cards and most places wouldn’t take plastic anyway. I was reminded of this when I tried to pay for parking at a motel in the Texas panhandle last week and was told I’d have to use an app on my phone, as the establishment had gone cashless. This did not prevent the staff from accepting actual dollars in tips.
In those early trips with my father at the wheel it became a habit to leave Baxter Springs about dawn, pick up Highway 50 around Pratt, and drive with only the most necessary of stops until we reached western Kansas. Then we’d stop for gas someplace near Dodge City and get orange sodas from a big red change-gobbling dispensing machine. By that time it was approaching midday, and if it wasn’t yet 100 degrees in the shade, it soon would be. We didn’t drink orange sodas much at home, but on these westbound odysseys the ice-cold bottles of orange stuff became the thirst quencher of choice, abetted no doubt by the sugar jolt. If we were ahead of schedule, we’d do some tourist thing. I remember a stop at Dodge City and a quick tour of Boot Hill, a stop at the wax museum across the street, and a youthful obsession with gunfighters. Decades later, I would set a novel in Dodge City.
There isn’t the space here to list all of the locations along Highway 50 that have influenced me, but I can cite a few.
In Kansas, they include Holcomb, where the 1959 murder of the Clutter family was the germ for one of the first modern true crime books, “In Cold Blood.” Author Truman Capote, with research help from his friend Nell, rendered the “village” of Holcomb in painful and painstaking detail.
“The land is flat, and the views are awesomely extensive,” Capote writes. “Horses, herds of cattle, and a white cluster of grain elevators rising as gracefully as Greek temples are visible long before a traveler reaches them.”
Now, phalanxes of wind turbines would have to be added to that description.
Highway 50 follows the Arkansas River upstream across the western third of Kansas and into Colorado. At Granada, you can see Camp Amache, a World War II concentration camp for Japanese Americans that is now a National Park Service historic site. Most of those imprisoned were from urban areas in California, and the relocation to the harsh plains of Colorado must have felt like a special punishment.
Between Las Animas and La Junta, the highway comes near Bent’s Old Fort National Historic Site. Located on the Santa Fe Trail, the 1833 fort was built for trade in buffalo robes with trappers and the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho nations. The site is a recreation, but so expertly done it’s the next best thing to time travel. My favorite part? The historically accurate peacocks roaming the courtyard.
At Canon City, the highway swings around the Colorado Territorial Correctional Facility, where the gas chamber was used to kill 32 inmates from 1934 to 1967. It’s a working prison, and some years ago I was briefly detained by grim-faced officers who didn’t like me taking photos of the guard towers from a public street.
Leaving Canon City, the highway threads spectacular gorges as the Arkansas plunges down from the headwaters, a journey I wrote about in my book, “Elevations.” At Salida, 50 leaves the river and proceeds west to Utah and Nevada. At Carson City, the Nevada State Railroad Museum offers an impressive collection of locomotives and rolling stock. Carson City also has close historical ties to Mark Twain, who recounted his arrival from Missouri in “Roughing It.”
“Visibly our new home was a desert, walled in by barren, snow-clad mountains,” Twain wrote. “We were plowing through great deeps of powdery alkali dust that rose in thick clouds and floated across the plain like smoke from a burning house.”
Twain knew the appeal of adventure for the American soul, and he was drawn to the West because of his older brother, Orion, who had been named secretary to the territorial governor.
“I coveted his distinction and his financial splendor,” Twain recalled, “but particularly and especially the long, strange journey he was going to make (to Nevada), and the curious new worlds he was going to explore. He was going to travel! I never had been away from home, and that word ‘travel’ had a seductive charm for me. Pretty soon (Orion) would be hundreds and hundreds of miles away on the great plains and deserts, and among the mountains of the Far West, and would see buffaloes and Indians, and prairie-dogs, and antelopes, and have all kinds of adventures, and maybe get hanged or scalped, and have ever such a fine time, and write home and tell us all about it.”
Twain’s racism aside, he makes a point. It is the ambition of many writers to have adventures and write home about them, I suppose. Most of the tight spots I’ve encountered while adventuring were those of my own making, while hiking or paddling, but the incident with perhaps the greatest potential for violence came on the return leg of one of those summer trips with Dad.
We were crossing western Kansas on Highway 50 at about 1 in the morning, on the way back from our first and only trip to Disneyland, and we were somewhere near Garden City. My father was driving, my mother was sitting beside him, and I was in the back. My parents had been talking about the Clutter murders, as my mother had read “In Cold Blood,” and they were pondering the nature of evil. The Hell’s Angels also scared them, probably because people were still talking about Hunter S. Thompson’s 1967 book. Also, my father — a carpet salesman for Sears and Roebuck — had been briefly kidnapped, at the point of a cheap pistol, a couple of years prior by a hitchhiking young man he gave a ride to on Route 66 between Riverton and Baxter Springs. So the anxiety in our old Ford as it sliced through the western Kansas darkness was thick.
Gradually, a car came up from the darkness behind us with its brights on and followed too closely for several miles. Then it passed recklessly, swerving and honking. I don’t know what kind of car it was, but I remember it being dark and loud. After it passed, my father slowed to allow more distance between us and the dark car.
Years have passed, and my memory of the incident is likely imperfect, but I recall us watching as the dark car swung over to the side of the road, did a U-turn, and came racing back at us. It zoomed by. Then it did another 180, accelerated, and stayed on our bumper for several miles.
My father didn’t know what to do.
Whatever my parents said at the time has been lost in memory. But I do remember my father mentioning the gun.
He had packed a rifle in the trunk.
It was a .22, a semi-automatic with a tubular magazine, the kind of rifle you used for plinking or for small game. My father didn’t own a pistol, having been frightened by them all of his life, but there were a couple of shotguns at the house in Baxter, used mostly for quail hunting. The 12-gauge pump would have been a better self-defense weapon, but the .22 is what he had grabbed, and like most things in our house — guitars, tennis rackets, runs — it was a Sears-exclusive model.
But there was little chance to park, pop the trunk, and dig the .22 from beneath the cooler and luggage and clothes. My father had asked my advice before the trip on whether he should bring the gun. He had this habit of sometimes asking me adult questions, even though I wasn’t yet a teenager. Influenced by my gunfighter worship, I had declared nobody should go anywhere without a gun.
Now his face was illuminated by the glare of the headlights reflecting from the rearview mirror, and I could see that he was disappointed by the decision. What good was a squirrel gun in this situation?
It was one of the first times I remember being ashamed of advice I’d given.
I’ve written briefly about this encounter before, but because that column was about angry drivers, I left out the part about the .22 rifle. I also omitted it because of the conflicted feelings the gun still evokes.
The occupants of the other car — and there was more than the driver, we could see that when they passed — may have been drunk or “doped up” or just plain crazy. But my father didn’t intend to find out what their problem was. The next time they did a U-turn and came back at us, feinting over the center line, my father stomped on the accelerator and the V-8 Ford lurched forward. The distance between us and the interlopers increased. They did another 180 to pursue us, but they had difficulty closing the gap.
The next town was only a few miles ahead.
The darkness whistled by at 100 mph.
It seemed for a moment the dark car would overtake us, and then when we reached the city limits they broke off, turned, and went the other direction. We fairly flew through the Main Street of the deserted town, and my father said he hoped it would attract the attention of any local cops who might be patrolling. There was no calling 911 on your cell.
The police had all turned in for the night. At the other side of town, my father slowed the Ford down, and we made the rest of the journey home without incident. For years, we would talk about that early morning in western Kansas, but we could never make much sense of it. Had it been a real threat? Did my mother’s reading of “In Cold Blood” create an unreasonable fear? And the question I still ask myself: Why had my father asked my advice on the gun?
My parents only lasted as a couple for another few years. After that, they led separate lives but oddly remained married. That complicated things when my mother died of untreated breast cancer another decade on.
I don’t know what that menacing dark car before dawn on a western Kansas highway had to do with any of what happened later. I just know in some way it did. I could feel the gulf between them widen. They avoided each other’s gaze, smoked cigarettes in separate rooms, spoke to one another in whispered sentence fragments or anguished shouts.
Some nights I ponder the incident on that dark highway of so long ago and conclude it was just an example of how inherently dangerous the world can be. At other times, I believe it has to do with the consequences of bad choices, of asking children to behave as adults, of carrying impossible burdens. My parents are both dead now, so I can speak with candor.
But perhaps it’s really a lesson in my conflicted relationship with my parents. Travel doesn’t just mean adventure, it means escape. I remember riding in the back seat of the Ford and thinking that someday my real parents would show up to claim me.
The incident on Highway 50 was so long ago now that it feels like nothing more than a bad dream. I have little insight, other than to say it remains an indigestible chunk in the soup of memory.
It did not make me fear travel. I’ve always been comfortable driving at night. But blinding headlights coming up from behind can still induce sweating, anxiety, and near panic.
When Kim and I were on our way to the Texas panhandle recently, we stopped in Pratt. I found an old-fashioned glass bottle of orange soda at a grocery store, Kim got a bottle of imported cane sugar Coke, and we drank them in the car. We looked each other in the eye, spoke in normal tones, and laughed.
The orange soda tasted sweeter than ever.

Forget plane crashes and fights about who gets the armrest.  If you survive TSA, a middle seat, and boarding group 9, now you have to make it through the flight itself without your body unraveling like cheap luggage on a baggage carousel.


Let’s start with deep vein thrombosis, or what they call the “Deadly Window Seat Special.”  You sit there for five hours without moving (thanks, beverage cart), and your blood turns sluggish, like airport Wi-Fi during a gate change.  Congratulations — you’re now flying DVT Airlines.  The longer the flight, the better your odds of a one-way ticket to the ER.  Solution:  get up every hour or so and walk.  And drink lots of water.
Feeling thirsty?  You should be.  Aircraft cabins at altitude are drier than the pretzels in coach. Humidity in-flight hovers around 10%, meaning your eyeballs are shriveling and your skin is turning into parchment.  Lubricating eye-drops and moisturizer should help.
Speaking of airplane air, did you know the cabin is pressurized only to the altitude of Denver?  That’s great but only if you’re a bighorn sheep (the 787, A350 and A380 jets are an exception).  For the rest of us, the lower oxygen can make you woozy or give your heart a surprise cardio session.  Got COPD or anemia?  Check with your doctor before flying.
Then there’s the inflight ear torture, courtesy of barotrauma.  This is why babies start crying before landing.  As the plane descends, your ears feel clogged as the pressure builds. Pop. Crackle. Pain.  But don’t worry… chewing gum, awkward jaw-stretching exercises or giving babies a bottle will probably help.  Or buy yourself a pair of EarPlane earplugs.
Crossing several time zones? Get ready for jet lag, also known as time-travel-induced dopiness.  Your body thinks it’s 3 a.m. in Hartford, but you’re eating airport sushi in Tokyo.  They say it takes one day of adjustment for each time zone you cross.
And for you frequent fliers: congratulations on your elite status… and cumulative cosmic radiation exposure.  One transatlantic flight gives you about as much radiation as one or two dental x-rays.  Not glowing, but not nothing.  Trans-polar flights leave you the most vulnerable.
Add in poor air circulation, recycled germs, and some guy sneezing in row 13 — and suddenly that N95 mask doesn’t seem so paranoid.  Still feeling like a little nosh?  Too bad.  Your guts are rebelling too. Gas expands at altitude, so avoid the bean salad.
Flying doesn’t just take you places. It slowly breaks down your body in a pressurized metal tube full of crying babies and funky air.  But hey, at least your suitcase made it to Cleveland.
PS:  While train travel is my preferred mode, extended sitting enroute is still a problem.  But at least you can get up at will and stroll to the Café Car for some over-priced AmFood.  Try the cheeseburger.  It’s actually pretty good.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/woman-on-plane-in-mask-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-29 05:00:50.032714

Utah Sen. Mike Lee withdraws a plan that could have auctioned more than a million acres.
The post Western public land sale axed from Senate budget bill appeared first on WyoFile .","Utah Sen. Mike Lee withdrew his land-sale provision from the Senate reconciliation budget bill Saturday evening.
“I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families – not to China, not to Blackrock, and not to any foreign interest,” Lee posted on X. “For that reason, I’ve made the decision to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill.”
The Republican had sought to require the sale of Bureau of Land Management property — owned by all Americans — to help Western communities resolve affordable housing worries. Critics said existing laws allow such sales and that the measure violated a core western value — public access to public land.
“Total faceplant.” Land Tawney
More than one million acres of public land were at stake. The provision required the government to auction the property rapidly and with curtailed public involvement.
Conservationists, hunters and anglers and outdoor recreation businesses erupted in virtual applause after Lee conceded. Opposition across the West stirred thousands to rally in support of continued ownership of and access to their publicly owned property.
“Public lands are the cornerstone of our conservation legacy,” Chris Wood, president and CEO of Trout Unlimited said in a statement heralding the provision’s demise.
Others were less reserved.
“Total faceplant,” wrote Land Tawney, co-chair of American Hunters & Anglers.
“He rewrote his scheme multiple times,” Tawney said of Lee. “And tonight? He yanked his own language from the bill,” Tawney wrote in a statement.
A coalition of outdoor businesses that claims to be part of a $1.2 trillion recreation economy said the budget reconciliation process “was the wrong vehicle for deciding the fate of America’s public lands.
“Selling off public lands in this way was not just out of touch with public sentiment,” the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable coalition said, “it could have impacted businesses, jobs, public health, and the many rural communities that depend on access to outdoor recreation for economic development and quality of life.”

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan are considering a wide-ranging bill that could affect Medicaid, Alaska oil and gas development and the size of the federal debt. (Alaska Beacon file photos)The U.S. Senate is nearing debate on a wide-ranging bill that includes a series of last-minute changes that would uniquely offset or exempt some of its costs for Alaska. 
The changes highlight the importance of the votes of each Republican senator — including those of Alaska Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — to advance the bill, named the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” after its description by President Donald Trump. It includes much of Trump’s agenda, and is advancing under special reconciliation rules.
In the days leading up to any floor votes, Alaska health experts said cuts to Medicaid and food stamps in the bill would devastate Alaska health care providers, patients and the broader state economy connected to health spending. Medicaid is the primary health program for lower-income Americans, and pays for long-term care for a broad swathe of families. More than 231,000 Alaskans were enrolled in May.
Murkowski and Sullivan have expressed support for provisions of the bill that seek to increase oil and gas production in the state, though Murkowski has criticized proposed cuts to health care and nutrition funding. It’s not clear how each would vote on a final bill. 
An updated 940-page version of the bill was released on Friday evening. It includes a variety of changes that would distinctly affect Alaska and, in some cases, Hawaii. 
As reported by States Newsroom and the New York Times, these changes include:

a tax exemption for fishers in Western Alaska;
an increase in amount of expenses like exploding projectiles that whaling captains can deduct, from $10,000 to $50,000; 
an increase in the share of Medicaid costs paid by the federal government by 25% for Alaska and 15% for Hawaii; 
allowing the Alaska and Hawaii state governments to request an exemption from a work requirement for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients; 
a two-year exemption for Alaska and Hawaii from paying a higher share of SNAP expenses; and
an increase in payments to certain providers for services in Alaska and Hawaii through Medicaid, the insurance program for people 65 and older, as reported by the New York Times. 

Alaska providers and advocates had expressed alarm 
Before the latest revision, Alaska health care providers and advocates said they were alarmed by the cuts to Medicaid in the bill.

	Preliminary research by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage estimates that the bill’s Medicaid cuts would cost Alaska 3,000 lost jobs — the fourth-steepest loss among the states — and a $322.1 million decrease in the economy. 
While the bill’s drafters aim for the Medicaid cuts to save money, they will be costly to Alaska, said Emily Nenon, Alaska government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. She spoke at a news conference held by provider and advocacy groups on Wednesday.
“We need people to have access to health care before they need it … because outcomes are better, because we have a healthier workforce,” Nenon said. 
Nenon said the primary way people would lose access to Medicaid is by requiring them to report that they are working. She pointed to research showing that many who work or are eligible for other exemptions will lose access to Medicaid because they don’t meet the reporting requirement. 
“It’s not about whether people are working, most people that are going to be subject to these work reporting requirements are working,” she said. “It’s a matter of having another hoop to jump through.”
Nenon also noted the importance of Medicaid to the economy.
Alaska had 2,900 fewer employed residents in May than it had a decade earlier, in May 2015. Most industries contracted in that time, but health care grew by 7,900 jobs, more than any other industry by a significant margin.
Nenon said Alaska can’t afford the 3,000 lost jobs estimated by ISER, adding that having more people with untreated conditions or delayed treatment will also lead to fewer people being able to work. 
Rachael Miller, chief advocacy officer for the Food Bank of Alaska, expressed concern on Wednesday that shifting costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto the state government would present problems in Alaska, where the state government is already struggling with the state budget and with administering SNAP. She expressed concern about the combined effect of SNAP and Medicaid cuts on families.
“So we know that food is often the most flexible line in a household budget,” she said. “We know that people do sometimes — they can’t afford their prescription, they cut their nutrition budget, because they have to afford their meds, they have to rent and they have to pay their heat.”
Also on Wednesday, Petersburg Medical Center CEO Phil Hofstetter said the Medicaid cuts would require the hospital to focus more on meeting bureaucratic requirements. And he said reduced payments would lead to cuts to services and staffing.
“I just don’t understand the premise of these cuts improving health care when the highest cost of health care comes in through medevacs, ERs, and inpatient stays,” all of which would be increased by requiring people to wait longer for health care by reducing Medicaid, Hofstetter said. “We know that prevention is a much less costly avenue for health care, and it’s better for our patients in general.”
Dr. Casey Gokey, chief medical officer of Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center, noted estimates that up to 27,000 Alaskans could lose access to health care. 
“On paper, these work requirements might sound simple, but in practice they create a maze of paperwork and confusion,” Gokey said. “Many of our patients seasonal jobs, gig jobs, hourly jobs — jobs that don’t fit neatly into eligibility boxes. They miss a deadline, they get caught in red tape and suddenly, they’re uninsured.”
Gokey said she saw a cancer patient this week who delayed care because she couldn’t afford it. She applied for Medicaid months ago, but the application is still being processed, and the patient showed signs that the cancer may have spread, Gokey said. 
“This is not a one-off story,” she said. “This is a reality of what delayed care looks like.”
Fairbanks resident Kristen Lindsay, currently working as a sea kayak guide in Seward, said Medicaid helped her survive cancer. She was otherwise uninsured when she was diagnosed with breast cancer from an MRI she received on her 34th birthday. With Medicaid, she was able to have three surgeries to remove the cancer, radiation treatment and medication.











You don’t want to think about, ‘Can I afford this or should I get something less done because I can afford that?’


– Kristen Lindsay, cancer survivor and Fairbanks resident



	Lindsay then got a part-time job, without health insurance, but still had Medicaid. She’s grateful she didn’t have to spend time proving she was working while she was focused on getting better. 
“You don’t want to think about, ‘Can I afford this or should I get something less done because I can afford that?’” she said. She noted that seasonal work is common in Alaska, and Medicaid helps fill the gaps. 
Attention turns to senators
Health care providers and patient advocates haven’t been the only ones asking Murkowski and Sullivan to reject Medicaid and SNAP cuts. 
Alaska Senate Majority Leader Sen. Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, wrote a commentary for the New York Times published Friday with the headline “Alaska Cannot Survive the Big Beautiful Bill.”
“We fear that if this bill passes, a village in rural Alaska might lose its one and only grocery store because of a drastic decline in SNAP dollars,” Edgmon and Giessel wrote. “It might also lose its sole health care clinic or hospital because it cannot sustain its services with decreased Medicaid reimbursements. The reconciliation bill does not take into account the uniqueness of Alaskan lifestyles and geographic remoteness.”
While the Medicaid and SNAP provisions were the focus of attention for some, the state’s governor focused on other aspects of how the bill would affect Alaska. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy highlighted those aspects on social media on Friday. He noted that the bill would direct 90% of Cook Inlet oil gas lease bonuses, rents and royalties to the state starting in 2035; require four federal oil lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain; direct 50% of ANWR receipts to the state until 2034, and 90% from 2035 on; ease other mineral leasing restrictions and require the Bureau of Land Management to hold quarterly lease sales; and target more than $4 billion for “investments in shore facilities,” including $300 million for the homeporting of a polar icebreaker.
Despite the Medicaid cuts, the bill would raise the national debt by $4.2 trillion, according to the latest estimate by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget — though the official cost is 90% lower, after Senate leaders made accounting for it differently than previous bills. They did that by excluding an extension of $3.8 trillion in tax cuts that Republicans want to make permanent.

Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut and member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, joined Michiganders virtually for a Hands Off Medicaid rally in Lansing. 
While Murphy had originally planned to attend Saturday’s rally in person, the U.S. Senate vote scheduled for Saturday required that Murphy remain in Washington D.C. 
In addressing the crowd, Senator Murphy reiterated how devastating the GOP bill would be to most Americans. 
“We’re talking about 60 million people losing their health care,” Murphy explained, “most of those working Americans, a lot of them really, really vulnerable, very, very sick and disabled Americans. Many of those children. All in order to transfer that money to the very, very wealthy.”

Moreover, Murphy said, the plan has not been well-received by the public. 
“As people find out about this, they hate it,” Murphy noted. “With long-term distractions, in the first five months, we had a hard time breaking through. Well, now we’re breaking through because of what you’re doing today, because of similar protests all around the country like this, and this thing isn’t over until it’s over.”
The bill would extend the 2017 tax cuts approved by a GOP-led Congress during President Donald Trump’s first term, while also pushing through major spending cuts that would drastically downsize the federal government. 
Even if the Senate approves the measure, changes to the bill’s language will require it to return to the House for another vote. At least six congressional Republicans have since walked back their initial support, making it unclear whether the bill could garner enough votes a second time.
While Murphy headlined Saturday’s event in Lansing, Michigan leaders and healthcare advocates also spoke to the dozens who attended Saturday’s rally.

Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Healthcare, explained that this is not a partisan issue: as a doctor from West Michigan, many of his patients voted for Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. Now, many of those same patients stand to lose access to their healthcare. 
As the only physician in the Michigan Legislature, Rep. Matt Longjohn (D-Portage) outlined how the proposed cuts to Medicaid would affect Michigan. 
“What it’ll mean is that there is uncompensated care, that there’s low value care, and that will break the bank for healthcare systems and hospitals and rural health centers alike,” Longjohn said. “It’s not good for patients, it’s not good for providers, it’s not good for systems, [and] it’s not good for communities.”

Longjohn also pointed out that 40% of Michigan’s budget comes from federal funds that are distributed to the state specifically to run programs like Medicaid. As such, he says the impacts of the proposed cuts would be disastrous to the state’s economy. 
“When you throw a boulder as big as this into a pond, you know the ripple effect will affect millions, and for a long time,” Longjohn said.
Beyond policy concerns, Longjohn expressed frustration with those advocating for the bill’s passage. 
“One of the things that frustrates me most is that the people pushing this are cowards,” Longjohn noted. “They will not answer voicemail, they will not answer letters, they will not show up to meetings with constituents.”
While Longjohn declined to name these legislators, others at the rally directly identified two by name: Reps. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) and John James (R-Shelby Township).

Nearly six months into their two-year terms, Barrett and James have largely avoided town halls. Since taking office in January, Barrett has held only two town halls– both of which were conducted virtually. James has yet to hold any constituent events and has not given any indication that he intends to do so. 
The Senate Budget Committee revealed the finalized language of the bill late Friday night. The first round of votes was anticipated to begin Saturday afternoon, but ongoing negotiations postponed the start of formal discussion. 
Murphy told the crowd that each day that final passage is delayed, the bill becomes less likely to pass. 
“Because right now, this country is waking up to the cataclysm that will occur if this thing passes,” Murphy said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
‘Big Beautiful Bill’ dings states that offer health care to some immigrants here legally

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.












Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance




Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Republicans from all corners of Montana convened in Helena during the weekend for the paryt’s annual convention and to elect new party leadership 
Delegates elected Art Wittich to serve for a two-year term as party chair. 
“Folks, I think our purpose is conservative government, and we’re going to do some things that haven’t been tried in the past,” Wittich said after his election. “… I want to keep winning elections, but I also want us to dedicate ourselves to things that are higher than winning elections, and that’s things like truth.”
Four party members threw their hats in the ring for leadership of the state GOP — Wittich, Stacy Zinn, Tanner Smith, and Troy Miller. 
Wittich was elected on the second ballot. Smith and Miller were eliminated after the first round of voting. 
He is an attorney and former state legislator who represented a portion of Gallatin County from 2011 to 2016, and served as Senate Majority Leader during the 2013 session.
Following the announcement of his election, Wittich told the gathered Republicans that they should all seek to be a “happy warrior,” and look forward to bright days for the party ahead. 
“We’re a red state. We could become a bright red state,” he said. “And we can do it without dividing and subtracting. We can grow.”

However the GOP convention on Saturday took a detour toward division when, during the credentialing of delegates able to vote for party leaders, state Sen. Barry Usher of Billings made a motion to remove nine fellow senators from the list. 
The nine state senators were censured by the GOP executive committee during the legislature over a series of votes taken in conjunction with Democrats to establish Senate rules and move forward large pieces of legislation including the state’s budget. 
A roll call vote among 241 gathered delegates saw more than two-thirds vote to remove the nine from their delegate roles. 
Among the nine Republican senators who appeared at the convention in person were Sens. Jason Ellsworth, of Hamilton; Denley Loge of St. Regis; Wendy McKamey of Great Falls, and Russ Tempel of Chester. 
Ellsworth told the Daily Montanan he was disappointed that the actions taken against the nine elected officials went against a message of unity that had been delivered during the first day of the convention. 
“It just cements division,” said Ellsworth, a former Senate president who was censured by the entire state Senate this year. “Republicans are strong, and should continue to be strong, but also recognize that, you know, it is a big tent, and it does take more than one philosophy.”
Loge told the Daily Montanan that he felt justified that his votes were in line with his constituents, who voted him in, as opposed to the executive board or state central committee. 
“The reason I’m the only Senator that’s Republican in part of Missoula County, and it’s because the constituents recognize I vote for them,” he said. 
With a total of 235 certified delegates voting for the party chair, Wittich earned 140 final votes and Zinn received 94, with one ballot excluded. 
Wittich replaces party chair Don “K” Kaltschmidt who served in the role for six years and oversaw a red wave through the state including Republicans winning all statewide elected offices, including the governorship, as well as all of Montana’s Congressional seats — for the first time in 100 years.
Kaltschmidt previously told the Daily Montanan that he was proud of his work turning Montana into a true red state, and that the next chairman would be tasked with leading the new era of GOP dominance. 
“It’s really up to the next chairman to take it to the next level, which would be learning how to be a red state,” he told the Daily Montanan.

Delegates elected members of the executive board including Zinn for vice chair, and Lola Galloway as secretary. 
Wittich’s tenure will last through 2027, a term which will span a legislative cycle election and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines’ reelection campaign. 
“I’m not tired of winning. I don’t think any of us are tired of winning,” he said. “I think when we embrace a positive vision for Montanans. They’re going to join us. They’re going to vote for us. They’re going to give us their time and their treasure, and we’re just going to keep getting bigger and better.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_6314-1024x734.jpg,,,2025-06-28 17:04:13.685468
,DC,2025-06-28 20:47:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate votes to advance Republican mega-bill in tense late-night session,"Ashley Murray, Shauneen Miranda, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-votes-advance-republican-mega-bill-tense-late-night-session,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted mostly along party lines late Saturday night to move forward with Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump wants on his desk in less than a week, after a dramatic three-hour pause when several GOP senators withheld their votes.Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina  and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against moving forward with the sweeping tax break and spending cuts package that contains many of the GOP’s campaign promises. All Democrats were opposed. Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol in case a tie-breaking vote was required, but in the end was not needed.Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026, had told reporters earlier that he would vote “no” on what is called a motion to proceed and on final passage. He said in a statement the legislation would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina and force the state to make “painful decisions” about Medicaid. Trump in a post on social media later threatened to find primary candidates to challenge Tillis.The 51-49 vote doesn’t guarantee the bill will make it through a final passage vote but does make it significantly more likely, even with Republicans’ narrow 53-47 majority.The procedural vote kicked off a maximum of 20 hours of floor debate on the bill, with half of that time controlled by Democrats and the other half by Republicans — though Democrats after the motion to proceed vote forced a reading of the giant bill expected to take as long as 15 hours. That would mean floor debate would not begin until sometime Sunday.Unlike regular bills, budget reconciliation packages are not subject to the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, so as long as at least 50 Republicans support the package, and Vance casts the tie-breaking vote if needed, the measure will go back to the House.

The vote on the motion to proceed that began at about 7:30 p.m. Eastern was held open for more than three hours, with the votes of four senators in suspense — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Rick Scott of Florida. All four eventually voted aye and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson switched his vote to aye after earlier voting against the measure.Lee, however, just before the vote was over, announced he had pulled from the bill an extremely controversial proposal to sell some public lands that was opposed by other lawmakers from the West. He said because of the process being used for the bill, he was unable to obtain enforceable safeguards to ensure the land would be sold to American families and not China or foreign interests.The latest version of the measure had set up the Interior Department to sell at least 600,000 acres of public land and up to 1.2 million acres of public land within 10 years, advocates said.Critics, including hunters, anglers and other Western state constituents, have ripped the measure as a “land grab,” as put by Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.A summary of the provisions by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said the Bureau of Land Management “must sell a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.50% of their estate for housing and associated community needs. This will increase the supply of housing and decrease housing costs for millions of American families.”Golfing with TrumpSenate GOP leaders released new bill text just before midnight Friday that satisfied rural state lawmakers’ worries about financial threats to rural hospitals posed by cuts in Medicaid. The bill also addresses concerns by Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska about access to food assistance for their constituents despite new restrictions on a USDA program for low-income people.As talks continued on Capitol Hill Saturday afternoon, a handful of Senate Republicans, including Missouri’s Eric Schmitt and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were on the golf course with Trump, according to the White House. Graham said on social media that Kentucky’s Paul also played.Senate Democrats said a fresh financial analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the preliminary Senate text would result in $930 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state low-income health insurance and disability assistance program.The CBO score was not yet publicly available but Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, pointed to it and slammed the Medicaid provisions as “cruel” in a statement Saturday afternoon. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, also cited the preliminary analysis, pointing to the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts.Collins promises amendmentsSenate Republicans planned to take their negotiations to the floor and push for amendments after the procedural vote that triggered official debate on the bill, which in its current public version runs 940 pages.GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voiced concerns throughout negotiations about rural hospitals and health cuts that would harm low-income individuals, said her vote on the motion to proceed “does not predict my vote on final passage.”“I will be filing a number of amendments,” she told reporters as she headed into a closed-door working lunch before the Senate convened at 2 p.m. Eastern.While Sen. Tim Sheehy wrote on social media Saturday afternoon that he was a “no” on the motion to proceed because of a provision to sell off federal public lands, the Montana Republican changed his mind nearly an hour later and declared he would propose an amendment to strip the provision — which was later removed by its sponsor.GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma painted somewhat of a rosier picture of the mood in the Senate, telling reporters “we’re good.”“We won't bring it to the floor if we don't have the votes,” said Mullin, who was the lead negotiator with House Republicans on state and local tax deductions, or SALT — a sticking point for Republicans who represent high-tax blue states like New York and California.The lawmakers settled on a $40,000 deduction through 2029 for taxpayers who earn up to $500,000 annually. The level then reverts to $10,000, the current limit under the 2017 tax law.Medicaid turmoilProposed changes to Medicaid have been strongly resisted by rural medical providers who say they are already financially strapped.Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told reporters Saturday he would be a “yes” on both the motion to proceed vote and the final bill based on the new rural hospital “transformation program” Senate leadership included in the bill overnight. The measure has yet to be finalized.The bill’s new version includes $25 billion in a stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 through 2032. The amount is frontloaded to give more of the funds in the first two years.Critics warn that amount will not fill the financial gaps that rural medical providers will face from losing a sizable portion of federal funding via Medicaid cuts.While Hawley called the fund a “win” for Missouri over the next several years, he said his party needs to do some “soul searching” over the “unhappy episode” of wrangling over Medicaid cuts.“If you want to be a working-class party, you've got to deliver for working-class people. You cannot take away health care for working people,” he said.Senators had not yet agreed on other Medicaid provisions as of Saturday afternoon, including a phase-down of the provider tax rate from 6% to a possible 3.5% that’s become hugely controversial.States use a combination of general revenues, provider tax revenues and in some cases local contributions to fund their Medicaid programs.Advocates warn that it’s not a guarantee states would be able to backfill the lost revenue, and if they can’t, provider rate cuts and losses of benefits for patients could be on the horizon.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House version’s provider tax changes — not as deep as the current Senate proposal — could lead to 400,000 people losing Medicaid benefits.A full and final financial score for the Senate bill is not yet out as the several provisions remain up in the air.Hawley also praised the inclusion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act fund, or RECA, that revives payments for survivors and victims who suffered cancer as a result of U.S. atomic bomb testing and radioactive waste dumps.Clean energy tax creditsIn what clean power advocates dubbed a “midnight dumping,” Senate GOP leadership added language to accelerate the phase out of clean energy tax credits that were enacted under Democrats’ own massive mega-bill in 2022 titled the “Inflation Reduction Act.”The language, which wasn’t yet finalized by Senate GOP tax writers as of 6 p.m. Eastern Saturday, tightened restrictions on foreign components in wind and solar projects — and added a new tax on those that don’t comply.Senators largely targeted wind and solar credits, ending them for projects not plugged into the electricity grid by 2028. Additionally credits for wind turbine manufacturers would terminate in 2028.Other tax credits would be phased out at a faster pace, including those for the production of critical minerals, though a credit for metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, was added in.Clean energy industry manufacturers and small businesses had hoped Senate Republicans would ease up rollbacks in the House version.Kurt Neutgens, president and chief technology officer of Orange EV, told States Newsroom in an interview Friday that any further rollbacks would amount to “cutting our legs out from underneath us.”Neutgens, whose Kansas City, Kansas-based company manufactures heavy duty electric trucks and chargers, was watching for changes to credits to the commercial clean vehicles credit. New Senate GOP text would terminate the credit in September of this year.Jason Grumet, president of the Clean Power Association, said in a statement Saturday that imposing new taxes on the industry “will strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, and undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.”Alaska carve-outsProposed cuts to federal food assistance remained largely unchanged in the new text released Friday night except for a few carve-outs for Alaska.If the bill were enacted as written, Alaska’s state government could request a waiver for its citizens from stricter work reporting requirements that critics say will result in some SNAP recipients losing their food benefits.GOP lawmakers also slightly shifted the timeline for when states will have to begin shouldering SNAP costs — the first time states will be on the hook for the federal food assistance outside of administrative costs.States would be required to pick up a portion of the costs depending on their “payment error rate” — meaning how accurate states are at determining who needs SNAP, including both overpayments and underpayments.States that have error rates at 6% or above would responsible for up to 15% of the food program’s cost. According to SNAP error rate data for 2023, the latest available, only seven states had an error rate below 6%.The new text delays the cost-sharing for states until 2028 and allows states to choose the lesser of their two error rates in either 2025 or 2026.Starting in 2029, states will be required to use their error rate from three years prior to the current year.The new text includes the option for Alaska and Hawaii to waive their cost share burden for up to two years if their governments implement an improvement plan. In 2023, Alaska had the highest payment error rate of all states, reaching just above 60%. Advocates for low-income families worry the cost, which will amount to billions for most state governments, will incentivize states to tighten eligibility requirements for the program, or even drop SNAP altogether.The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the cuts will affect up to 40 million people who receive basic SNAP assistance, including 16 million children and 8 million seniors.The Senate bill would also increase a state’s share of administrative costs for the program to 75%, up from the previous 50% cost-sharing responsibility with the federal government.Despite inaccurate public statements from Republicans as recently as in a bill summary released overnight, the bill does nothing to limit food assistance to immigrants without documentation because SNAP was never available to them.SNAP benefits will remain available to legal permanent residents, and Republicans loosened some language to allow certain immigrants from Cuba or Haiti to access the program.But if the bill passes, federal food assistance will not be available to refugees and asylees who are already in the U.S. — for example, people from Afghanistan, Ukraine and other war-torn places.Education revisionsRepublicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions revised or scrapped several measures that the parliamentarian deemed to not comply with the “Byrd Bath,” a Senate process named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd, according to a summary and new bill text out Friday.Under the revised text, for any loans made starting July 1, 2026, borrowers will have only two repayment plan options: a standard repayment plan and an income-driven repayment plan. The original proposal would have applied these restrictions to existing borrowers, but the parliamentarian struck that down.Republicans also nixed a proposal that opened up the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college — to institutions that are not accredited.The new plan also scraps a restriction that barred payments made by students enrolled in a medical or dental internship or residency program from counting toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.‘Even worse than any draft’Senate Democrats remain united in opposition to the bill and are expected to slow down final passage by introducing numerous amendments on the floor during what is called the vote-a-rama.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continued to rally against the package during remarks on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon, saying it’s “hard to believe this bill is worse — even worse — than any draft we've seen this far.”The New York Democrat said “it’s worse on health care, it's worse on SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), it’s worse on the deficit.”Schumer added that “if Republicans proceed, Senate Democrats will hold them to account.”“We'll gear up for another night of vote-a-rama very soon. We'll expose this bill piece by piece. We will show how it cuts health care, raises costs, rewards the ultra rich.”The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities condemned the cuts to safety net programs as “all in service to tax cuts that are heavily skewed toward the wealthy and corporations.”“None of this harm has anything to do with fiscal responsibility: our deficits and debts would soar under this bill,” said Sharon Parrott, the think tank’s president, in a statement Saturday.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog, released a new analysis Saturday finding the Senate version will add roughly $4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.“If you thought the House bill borrowed too much — and it did — the Senate manages to make things even worse,” CRFB’s president Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.House actionSenate Republicans have spent more than a month rewriting the bills that make up the measure in order to meet the strict rules for moving a budget reconciliation package and to earn support from enough Republicans to actually pass the legislation.The lawmakers have been struggling to maintain spending cuts passed by House Republicans that will pay for the nearly $4 trillion price tag for extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts.The House voted 215-214 to approve its 11-bill version of the package in May. Many of that chamber’s GOP lawmakers hoped the Senate wouldn’t change much, though that hasn’t been the case.The Senate has modified numerous proposals, including those addressing tax law; Medicaid; and SNAP. The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.The revisions have led to concerns among both centrist House GOP lawmakers and far-right members of the party, muddying the waters around whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can cobble together the votes needed to clear the package for Trump’s signature.Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House, so leaders there can only lose four members if all of the chamber’s lawmakers are present and voting.Trump has encouraged Congress to approve the legislation before the Fourth of July, but with time running short and some tempers rising over how the legislation will impact the country’s deficits, that might not be possible.“The Great Republicans in the U.S. Senate are working all weekend to finish our ‘ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” Trump posted on social media Friday.“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he added. “It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country, which is right now, ‘The Hottest Country anywhere in the World’ — And to think, just last year, we were a laughingstock. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-06-28 23:58:58.843021

The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.The revisions have led to concerns among both centrist House GOP lawmakers and far-right members of the party, muddying the waters around whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can cobble together the votes needed to clear the package for Trump’s signature.Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House, so leaders there can only lose four members if all of the chamber’s lawmakers are present and voting.Trump has encouraged Congress to approve the legislation before the Fourth of July, but with time running short and some tempers rising over how the legislation will impact the country’s deficits, that might not be possible.“The Great Republicans in the U.S. Senate are working all weekend to finish our ‘ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” Trump posted on social media Friday.“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he added. “It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country, which is right now, ‘The Hottest Country anywhere in the World’ — And to think, just last year, we were a laughingstock.

Photo by Alex Kormann/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photoSpeaker Emerita Melissa Hortman’s life embodied the American dream. She was raised in a family that owned a junkyard, became a lawyer but declined a life of comfortable wealth for public service, emerging as among the most influential legislators in Minnesota history.
Now she’s an emblem of the American nightmare, another victim — along with husband Mark Hortman and their golden retriever Gilbert — of the political violence that’s consumed America in the past decade, adding Brooklyn Park to Buffalo, El Paso and other grim signposts of a damaged democracy.
The Hortmans were remembered at their funeral Mass at The Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis Saturday as kind, generous and driven by a common set of values to make the world just a little bit better.
The funeral was mostly light on politics, despite the hundreds of politicos in attendance. Father Daniel Griffith in his homily, however, highlighted the injustices that Melissa Hortman tried to ameliorate.
“In Minnesota we have been the ground zero place, sadly, for racial injustice — the killing of George Floyd just miles from our church,” Griffith said. “And now we are the ground zero place for political violence and extremism. Both of these must be decried in the strongest terms, as they are, respectively, a threat to human dignity and indeed our democracy.”

Tim Walz stand behind the caskets of Melissa and Mark Hortman during funeral services for Mark and Melissa Hortman at The Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis, Minn., on Saturday, June 28, 2025.

Gov. Tim Walz, who was both friend and governing partner to Hortman, was visibly shaken while serving as a pallbearer alongside the Hortman children. The packed Basilica was filled with Hortman’s family, friends and vast political network that Melissa Hortman built over decades by way of her effectiveness at the Legislature and down-to-earth charm. Former President Joe Biden — who hosted the Hortmans at the White House — Vice President Kamala Harris, former Gov. Mark Dayton, Democratic and Republican lawmakers and state commissioners also memorialized the lives of Hortmans.
Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota Legislature for two decades. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator was beloved around the Capitol and is known for scoring major legislative victories including free school lunch for K-12 students, a new paid leave program and a mandate that Minnesota utilities use 100% carbon-free energy sources by 2040.
The Hortmans were killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home in a politically motivated assassination. Their deaths have roiled Minnesota politics.
Hortman was a Catholic Sunday school teacher whose politics were shaped by Catholic social teaching. She was a devotee of the Golden Rule, from Matthew, “Do unto others what you would have them do unto you.” So she would have endorsed the choice of Gospel reading Saturday, Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, which is a fundamental text of Christianity.
“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God,” Griffith said. “Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness.”
In his sermon, Griffith highlighted Melissa and Mark Hortman’s service and community, which he called, “the antidote to our present afflictions” and a stark contrast to the “idol of autonomy” that has ravaged America’s political landscape.
Melissa and Mark Hortman met in Washington D.C. when they were both mentoring a student. Colin and Sophie Hortman, their adult children, released a statement in the days after their killings, calling for people to honor their parents’ legacy by standing up “for what you believe in, especially if that thing is justice and peace.”
Walz during his five-minute eulogy encouraged Minnesotans to find common humanity and “build a state equal to (the Hortmans’) aspirations and a politics worthy of their example.”
“Melissa was an extraordinary legislator, and Mark was her proudest supporter,” Walz said. “It’s easy sometimes to forget, for all of its significance, politics is just people. That’s all. It is just a bunch of human beings trying to do their best. Melissa understood that better than anybody.”
Robin Ann Williams, a close friend of Melissa and Mark, eulogized them at the request of the children. She remembered the Hortmans as anything but a stereotypical political family, just as focused on their children and dog and card nights and monthly dinners for law school friends as on the latest political flareup.
Williams also captured the dynamic between Melissa and her supportive husband.
“I always saw her as a balloon bouncing around, but still tethered to the earth by Mark,” Williams said.
Williams remembered the many dinners she shared with the Hortmans, including their last together on June 6 at an Italian restaurant in Robbinsdale. Walz had just called for a one-day special session, and Melissa was often getting up from the table to take calls from the governor or her DFL caucus members. No one at the table, including Mark Hortman, minded the disruption.

Even though many are grieved by the Hortmans’ deaths, Williams said that the couple would have wanted people to remember them with joy, citing Kahlil Gibran’s “The Prophet:”
“Some of you say joy is greater than sorrow, and others say, nay, sorrow is the greater. But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.”
“We are buried in sorrow right now, but I do believe that we will experience joy again,” Williams said. “Mark and Melissa would not want it any other way. Goodbye, my friends.” 
Colin Hortman ended the service with a prayer of St. Francis, which Melissa Hortman carried in her wallet.
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.
The procession departed in silence, except for the massive bell of The Basilica of St. Mary tolling, tolling.
The caskets were loaded into two hearses.
Walz handed Sophie and Colin Hortman American flags in the traditional 13-fold, for the Hortmans.
When the Hortmans were lying in state at the Capitol Friday, Rep. Michael Howard, DFL-Richfield, wondered aloud what Melissa Hortman — who was famously blunt and unimpressed with grandeur — would have thought about all the pageantry.
“I think she would have said, ‘It’s a bit much.’”

(Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix))TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Seven years after the Florida Legislature approved a memorial recognizing the tragedy of slavery for the grounds of the Florida Capitol, the bronze statue called “Circle of Chains” has been completed and is on display across the street from the building.
Not that anyone is actually aware of that.
“I had no idea!” Miami-Dade County Democratic Rep. Ashley Gantt told the Phoenix when asked about the public unveiling of the memorial earlier this week.
Neither did Miami-Dade County Sen. Shevrin Jones.
“I had no idea the memorial had even been installed – and that says a lot,” Jones told the Phoenix. “A monument honoring the pain and resilience of enslaved Africans deserves more than a quiet placement. After seven years of work, there should have been a moment to honor that history publicly.”
Approved in 2018
The Legislature approved the memorial during the 2018 legislative session. Miami-Dade Democrat Kionne McGhee sponsored the measure in the House, and Tampa Bay-area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson carried it in the Senate. The bill charged the Department of Management Services with developing its design, placement, and cost. It is located at the Black Archives-Union Bank Museum on Apalachee Parkway and was installed on April 28.
“The idea behind the memorial is to recognize the brutality of slavery and the cruelty of slavery towards a people and then to honor the nameless faces of individuals that suffer through slavery,” Rouson said this week.
State lawmakers dedicated $400,000 to erect the memorial, as they did during the 2016 legislative session for a Holocaust Memorial that was installed at the Capitol earlier this year. A public ceremony was held  for that event in March, attended by Gov. DeSantis.
The slavery monument was created by Carmel, California, sculptor Steven Whyte, selected by review committee members who called on artists to recognize “the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the American colonies and to honor the nameless and forgotten men, women, and children who have gone unrecognized for their undeniable and weighty contributions to the United States.”
As the House prepared to vote on the proposal in 2018, Rep. McGhee told lawmakers that slaves in 1845 helped construct the Old Capitol building in Tallahassee, according to WFSU-Radio. PolitiFact reported that although authorities were unable to find conclusive documentation about the construction, African American slaves were part of almost every facet of Florida life in the 19th Century, according to historians. PolitiFact labeled his comment “mostly true.” (McGhee, now a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, did not respond to a request for comment).
Plans for a formal ceremony
Rouson said he was informed by state officials that they wanted to install surveillance cameras on the property before making any formal announcement. “But now that surveillance is in place and there’s some protection in the event of vandalism, I intend to urge the Black Caucus to do more of a formal ceremony when we go back [this fall] for committee weeks,” he said.
Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman said she knew the memorial was being constructed but wasn’t aware it had been finished and is now open to the public.
“I wholeheartedly support Sen. Rouson’s efforts for a formal opening ceremony this fall — the enslaved men, women, and children who built this country deserve to have their experience remembered and their legacy honored,” she said.
Sen. Jones said he also supports Rouson’s call for a “proper ceremony when we return.”
“Our ancestors deserve to be seen and acknowledged,” he said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Joint Finance Committee convened at 10:17 p.m. Friday — over 12 hours after it was originally scheduled — to vote on a fraction of the budget areas it had originally planned and to release part of the literacy funding that is set to expire next week.  
Legislative leaders have been working behind closed doors over the last week to negotiate with Gov. Tony Evers and work out the details of the state budget as the end of the fiscal year approaches next week. 
Areas of the budget still left to take up are at the center of negotiations including the University of Wisconsin system, where Republicans have considered cuts, and the Department of Children and Families, which is responsible for the state’s Child Care Counts program. Evers has said he would veto a budget without funding for the program, which will run out of federal money soon. The committee also still needs to take up the Department of Health Services, the Department of Transportation, the capital budget and more. 
The committee co-chairs did not take questions from reporters ahead of the meeting, but as the meeting started Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said the other agencies “will be taken up at a later date.” He didn’t specify when that would be.
The budget committee did approve the budget for several state agencies including the Department of Natural Resources, part of the Department of Justice, the Higher Education Aids Board, the Department of Administration and the Tourism Department. Each action the committee did take passed along partisan lines.
Portion of $50 million for literacy released
The committee voted unanimously to release $9 million of the nearly $50 million left in funding for literacy initiatives that was first allocated in the 2023-25 state budget. The majority of the money has been withheld by lawmakers since 2023 and is slated to lapse back into the state’s general fund if not released by the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
Lawmakers said action on the other $40 million will be taken soon. 
“This has taken a long time to get here. One of the things that this bill was originally about was to make it so that kids could read. We want to help kids read. We want to give schools the tools to be able to do that,” Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said. “Unfortunately, it’s taken this Legislature a tremendous amount of time to allocate the funds for that, and ultimately, that’s simply not acceptable.” 
Born said he is glad lawmakers were releasing part of the money Friday and would have further motions on it in the future. He also said the delay on the funding was Evers’ fault. Lawmakers were holding the funding back due to a partial veto Evers exercised on a bill related to the literacy funding. The Wisconsin Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Wednesday that partial veto was  unconstitutional and restored the original language of the law.
“We’re glad that justice has been done, and we’re here now with the proper accounts and able to do these two separate motions here in the next couple of days in the committee to get this program that was a bipartisan program moving along,” Born said. 
Certain projects funded in DNR budget, Knowles-Nelson not 
Noticeably missing from the Republicans’ Department of Natural Resource motion was funding for the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Grant program, which allows the agency to fund the purchase of public land and upkeep of recreational areas.
Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) said lawmakers were missing an opportunity by not funding the program in the budget. 
“There’s a lot of individual pet projects in here that seem to be of interest to individual legislators, but there aren’t a lot of park projects that are of interest to Wisconsinites, particularly Knowles-Nelson,” Andraca said.
The committee approved funding in the budget for an array of projects including $42 million to help with modernization of the Rothschild Dam, $500,000 to go towards the repair of a retaining wall for the Wisconsin Rapids Riverbank project, $2.2 million environmental remediation and redevelopment of Lake Vista Park in Oak Creek, $70,000 for a dredging project in Manitowoc River in the Town of Brillion, $1.75 million for dredging the Deerskin River and $100,000 for assistance with highway flooding in the Town of Norway in Racine County. 
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc), who is the author of a bill to keep the program going, said lawmakers are working to ensure it handles the program in the best way, which is part of why the funding is not in the budget as of now. 
“We actually have until 30th of June of 2026 to work on this. It’s something that Sen. [Patrick] Testin and I have been working on along with our staff over the last six months. It’s something that is a bipartisan effort. We’ve met with so many different stakeholders, so many different groups, so many fellow legislators on getting this done,” Kurtz said. “We are committed to get it done.” 
Kurtz said that the hearing on the bill was “good” and there will be “a lot more coming up in the future” when it comes to Knowles-Nelson. 
The committee also approved raising nonresident vehicle admission sticker fees, nonresident campsite fees and campsite electricity fees. 
Office of School Safety, VOCA grants get state funding
The Department of Justice’s Office of School Safety will get 13 permanent staff positions and $1.57 million to continue its work. That’s about $700,000 less than what the agency had requested, but is about what Evers had proposed for the office. 
The office serves as a resource for K-12 schools — helping them improve security measures by providing training on crisis prevention and response, grants for safety enhancements, threat assessment training and mental health training. It also operates the Speak Up, Speak Out tipline where students can anonymously report safety concerns.
The Wisconsin DOJ will also get help filling funding gaps for Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grants left by federal funding cuts. 
Wisconsin’s federal allocation for VOCA grants has been cut from $40 million to $13 million. Domestic violence shelters and victim services organizations along with the state DOJ have been navigating the limited funding for over a year. The organizations that receive VOCA grants help people who are the victims of a crime by assisting them with finding housing, providing transportation to and from court appearances and navigating the criminal justice system.
The Republican-approved motion will provide $20 million to cover the federal funding loss. It will also provide $163,500 for two staff positions, which will expire in July 2027. The Wisconsin DOJ had requested an additional $66 million in the budget to make up for the funding gap. 
McGuire noted the funding would be significantly less than what the state agency had requested and would essentially create a two-year program rather than an ongoing one.
“[This] maintains the Legislature’s level of input, but it doesn’t actually maintain the same level of service because of the declining revenues as a result of the federal government,” McGuire said. “While we can’t fix all the things that are the result of what the federal government is doing wrong … this is something that will have an impact on communities across the state. It’s going to have an impact on people who’ve had the worst day and the worst week in the worst month of their life. It’s gonna have an impact on people who have been harmed by violence who have been in toxic, abusive relationships. It’s going to have an impact on people who desperately need services through no fault of their own. These are really vulnerable people and they should receive our support.  
Wisconsin Grants to get slight infusion, UW budget postponed 
The committee did not take up the budget for the University of Wisconsin system. It’s been one of the key issues for debate as Republican lawmakers have considered cuts, while Evers and UW leaders have said the university system needs $855 million in additional funding. Evers has said that in negotiations he and lawmakers were discussing a “positive number.”
The committee did take up the Higher Educational Aids Board, which is the agency responsible for overseeing Wisconsin’s student financial aid system, investing in the Wisconsin Grant Program. The program provides grants to undergraduate Wisconsin residents enrolled at least half-time in degree or certificate programs.
The Wisconsin Grants program would receive an additional $5.6 million in 2025-26 and $11.9 million in 2026-27 under the proposal approved Friday. The UW system, private nonprofit colleges and Wisconsin Technical College System would receive equal dollar increases. It also includes a $75,000 increase for tribal college students.
Evers had proposed 20% increases for the Wisconsin Grants for the state’s public universities, private nonprofit colleges and technical colleges — a total $57.7 million investment.
The Wisconsin Technical Colleges System had requested $10.8 million in each year of the biennium, saying there has been a waitlist for the grants for the first time in 10 years and that list is projected to grow.
The committee also approved $3.5 million in 2026-27 in a supplemental appropriation for emergency medical services training costs to reimburse training and materials costs. 
“Recruiting volunteer EMS personnel is a challenge all over the state of Wisconsin — certainly is in my Senate district,” Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said. “We believe that this will remove one barrier to recruitment of volunteers in our EMS units all across the state.” 
Other portions of the budget approved Friday evening include: 

$30 million to the Tourism Department for general marketing, and an additional $1 million in the second year of the budget, as well as about $113,000 for state arts organizations and two staff positions and funding for the Office of Outdoor Recreation. The motion includes $5 million for Taliesin Preservation Inc. for restoration projects at Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin home located in Spring Green supporting private fundraising for an education center, the restoration of visitor amenities and the stabilization of some buildings.
$193,700 to the Wisconsin Elections Commission with over $150,000 of that going toward information technology costs and the remaining going towards costs for the Electronic Registration Information Center.
$20.9 million and 147 positions for 12 months of personnel related costs for a Milwaukee Type 1 facility, which is meant to serve as a portion of the replacement of youth prisons Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake, which the state had been working to close for years. The 32-bed facility in Milwaukee has a planned completion date in October 2026.
The WisconsinEye endowment received $10 million to continue video coverage of the Legislature.
The committee also approved $11 million for grants to nine of Wisconsin’s 11 federally-recognized tribes. The committee has been excluding two tribes — the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa — from the grant funding for several years due to disputes over roads. The exclusion “strikes me as inappropriate,” McGuire said. He added that it’s “an insult to those people.”

The worker’s attorneys believe their client was the first of the detained Glenn Valley employees to be released on a bond pending further legal proceedings. Other bond hearings are expected over the next days and weeks, they and other attorneys working with the group said.

The next step for the released foreign-born worker is to build a case for eligibility to remain in the country, said Bassel El-Kasaby, who said attorney Lauren Schmoke in the Kasaby Schmoke law firm represented the person in immigration court proceedings. El-Kasaby said final resolution of such cases can take years, given the court’s backlog.
El-Kasaby said the firm’s client was not charged with a criminal act. He said the client is accused of a civil offense, entering and working in the U.S. without authorization, which can lead to penalties such as deportation. The law firm declined to provide more detail without the client’s consent. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says the June 10 operation stemmed from a federal criminal search warrant looking for more than 100 individuals who ICE alleges stole U.S. identities.
According to available federal court records, it appears that so far three of the detained workers have been criminally charged — one for allegedly using a Social Security number of a U.S. citizen. The other two: a Honduran man accused of brandishing a box cutter and resisting arrest; a Mexican man facing charges for re-entering the country after being previously departed.
An ICE spokeswoman said the investigation continues.
Another four people face criminal charges related to protests during the raid.
Anne Wurth, senior attorney at Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, said her nonprofit is handling several of the worker cases. She said the bulk will have hearings over the next couple of weeks in immigration court to set a potential bond and future court dates for civil offenses.
“The majority of these people are not facing criminal charges at this time,” she said.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.


“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)I may be best-known for my battles with pipeline companies, both Summit Carbon’s proposed carbon dioxide pipeline and the Dakota Access oil pipeline. I had the distinction of being named first in the landowners’ lawsuit against Summit’s efforts to force their way onto our land, which wound its way to the state Supreme Court, where we prevailed last year. 
It’s well-established that many South Dakotans do not care for the carbon dioxide pipeline, but the U.S. House’s budget reconciliation bill fails to repeal a massive handout to carbon companies with 45Q tax credits. This corporate welfare is why companies like Summit persist in pushing projects we don’t want. Our lone representative, Congressman Dusty Johnson, voted yes on the bill. It’s now under consideration in the Senate. 
He touted all the reasons this “big, beautiful bill” will be good for South Dakota, but good for whom, exactly? He doesn’t mention billions of dollars in 45Q tax credits at all, but cheerfully explains reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid. He seems quite proud of the cuts and work requirements that will leave more South Dakotans hungry and lacking in health care. Not to mention the negative impacts on our grocery stores and small health care facilities. 
Trump urges voters to press for US Senate GOP mega-bill after setback on Medicaid cuts

As a pipeline fighter, folks may be surprised at my concern over cuts to food assistance and health care access, but I taught for over 30 years in our public schools, so I understand how budgets affect people’s lives. I also have direct experience with helping disabled people acquire that designation, and let me tell you, that is a difficult and lengthy process. It may take years for people who are not able to work to be recognized as disabled by the government. These cuts will be devastating for them. 
So when I hear that these budget cuts will help reduce waste and fraud, I call foul. Currently over 75,000 South Dakotans utilize SNAP, so these cuts will be felt everywhere. The work requirements may sound like common sense until you dig in. The cut-off age for a dependent child is 7 years; what this means is that if you are a parent on SNAP, you must work 20 hours per week if your youngest child is 7 or older, whether or not you have child care or how far you have to drive to get to that job. Or even if there is a job to be had.
We all know people’s budgets are tight, and this is reflected by Feeding South Dakota, which has reported a 15% increase in usage over last year. They are already struggling to meet people’s needs, so what will happen if these cuts are implemented? Hunger is what will happen. 
Next, let’s consider our state budget, which had to be trimmed this past legislative session. The U.S. House version of the budget reconciliation bill would make South Dakota absorb a reported $9 million to $18 million in costs shifted to the states as early as 2028 in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP. Can we tighten our belts that much? 
If all this weren’t enough, let’s look at how health care would be hurt by the Medicaid cuts. Nearly 150,000 South Dakotans are enrolled in Medicaid, and many of these folks are senior citizens and people with disabilities. If fewer people can be covered, our health care facilities will feel the pinch immediately because even though people may not have coverage, they still get sick and injured. 
As for how this will impact hospitals and clinics, this quote from Shelley Ten Napel in South Dakota Searchlight on May 29 says it best: “The proposed cuts will be especially harmful to rural South Dakota. When coverage rates fall, rural health centers lose critical funding – putting access to primary care, maternal care, dental services and behavioral health at risk for everyone in those communities.” 
Thousands of South Dakotans already travel considerable distances for a doctor’s visit, and these cuts will make a bad situation worse if closures start. Plus, those are jobs lost from communities, another blow. 
I don’t think this bill is as beautiful as Rep. Johnson makes it out to be. The pipeline companies got a rosy deal, but it looks pretty ugly for the rest of us.

(Getty Images)As voters prepare to decide who the state’s next governor should be, nearly half of respondents to a new Rutgers-Eagleton Poll say the state is headed in the wrong direction.
The poll found that 48% of residents say New Jersey is on the wrong track compared to 39% who say it is headed in the right direction. Fourteen percent are unsure. 
Results differed widely depending on the respondent’s political party. Sixty-three percent of Democrats said the state is headed in the right direction versus 77% of Republicans saying it’s on the wrong track. Unaffiliated voters are on the pessimistic side, with 48% saying the state is on the wrong track and 32% saying it’s moving in the right direction. 
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is stepping down in January after two terms as governor. Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, are competing in November to succeed him. 
Ashley Koning, assistant research professor and director of Rutgers’ Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, said the right track/wrong track gap is the widest it’s been since March 2022. A poll from that month found 48% of New Jerseyans saying the state was going in the right direction and 45% saying it had gone off track.
“We’ve kind of seen this very middle-of-the-road kind of malaise of an outlook from New Jerseyans for quite a prolonged period of time now, really dipping down since the pandemic,” Koning told the New Jersey Monitor. 
Predictably, economic issues topped respondents’ concerns when asked about the most important problem facing New Jersey. Thirty-six percent cited taxes and 22% said affordability and the cost of living, while housing affordability and the economy were cited by 8% each. 
The last time New Jersey voters had a governor’s race with no incumbent seeking reelection was 2017, when Murphy was running to succeed Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican wrapping up two terms as governor. A Rutgers-Eagleton poll from August 2017 revealed deep dissatisfaction among New Jersey voters, with 74% saying the state was on the wrong track versus 16% who said it was going in the right direction.
Though Sherrill’s campaign has criticized Ciattarelli for being too friendly to President Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, and Ciattarelli has griped about overdevelopment of the state’s suburbs, economic issues widely eclipsed both as the most important problem facing New Jersey, the new poll shows. Trump, the federal government, and MAGA ideology were cited by just 3%, with 1% citing overdevelopment.
“Even when we see these critical social issues pop up and become more salient, they’re still, at the end of the day, perhaps not the most important or the biggest driving factor,” Koning said. “That’s how Ciattarelli ended up closing his gap in 2021 as well, by focusing on economic issues, and why the gubernatorial was so close.”
Ciattarelli ran for governor in 2021 and came within three points of unseating Murphy.
Results are from a statewide poll of 621 adults selected randomly and surved between June 13 and June 16.

The Legislature plans to approve a final fiscal year 2026 state budget on Monday, the day before the new spending cycle starts, after House and Senate Democrats announced they reached an accord.
The post Agreement reached on state budget appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE LEGISLATURE PLANS to approve a final fiscal year 2026 state budget on Monday, the day before the new spending cycle starts, after House and Senate Democrats announced they reached an accord.
Rep. Aaron Michlewitz and Sen. Michael Rodrigues, the budget chiefs for each chamber, said in a statement just after 1 p.m. Friday they completed a deal on the annual spending plan. They did not release any details about its contents or even a bottom line spending figure.
Each branch this spring approved a more than $61.4 billion budget, representing a roughly 6 percent increase in state spending over the version Gov. Maura Healey signed last summer.
While the bottom lines were roughly similar, the House and Senate budgets differed on how much money to provide to the MBTA, other education and transportation initiatives funded by a surtax on wealthy households, the use of one-time revenues to support spending, and transfers to the health safety net program.
“With this compromise agreement, the House and Senate are doubling down on our shared commitment to addressing the underlying budget challenges that we are collectively confronting in the face of ongoing uncertainty and federal funding impacts,” Michlewitz and Rodrigues said in a joint statement. “Currently, our teams are working hard to complete the work necessary to file the conference committee report this weekend, to ensure that the Legislature is prepared to act on Monday to send a balanced and fiscally responsible budget to the Governor and her team before the beginning of the new fiscal year.”
Lawmakers also packed the bills with policy riders, and the weekend filing will reveal how they landed on whether to pause admissions reforms at vocational and technical schools, whether to give up some state control over alcohol licenses, and whether regulators can cap prices for some prescription medications.
The House and Senate are largely pressing ahead with spending plans crafted before the extent of changes at the federal level became more apparent.
Final approval of the state budget is now likely to occur before Congress completes its work on a massive spending, tax and policy bill. That legislation remains pending in the US Senate.
If Republicans in Washington, DC, follow through on their goals of cutting spending on Medicaid and other programs, it could force Gov. Maura Healey to make significant changes to the state budget down the line.
Fiscal year 2026 begins Tuesday, July 1. Massachusetts has not had a new state budget signed into law before the start of the fiscal year in a decade and a half.
Michlewitz and Rodrigues’s announcement tees up legislative approval of a new budget on fiscal new year’s eve, though the state is almost certain not to have a spending plan officially in place by the time FY 2026 begins because Healey gets 10 days to review any bill sent to her desk.
Healey on Monday filed a $7.5 billion interim budget designed to keep state government funded, and avoid any lapses in paychecks, programs or services, for about another month in the absence of an annual spending plan. The Legislature broke for a long weekend without taking up that stopgap measure.
Spokespeople for both House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka said Friday their branches will approve the interim budget Monday.
If the Legislature enacts the fiscal 2026 budget Monday as planned, it would be the earliest in the calendar lawmakers sent an annual budget to the governor since 2016, when they also voted on June 30.
House and Senate Democrats for years have extended budget talks into the new fiscal year and kept government funded with holdover budgets, at times producing some of the latest annual budgets in the nation.
The last time a governor signed an annual state budget into law before the start of the fiscal year was in 2010.
The difference in spending between the House and Senate budgets is $70.3 million or about 0.11 percent, the Mass. Taxpayers Foundation said before cautioning that there is also nearly $1 billion in unique spending across the two bills especially in areas like health care, education, support services and economic development.
“The House budget includes $437 million in spending not reflected in the Senate budget, while the Senate budget includes $522 million in spending not adopted by the House,” MTF said in a report last week.
MTF said that the six-person conference committee, should it attempt to fund every dollar called for in the House and Senate budgets, could find itself as much as $769 million short if budget-writers have only MTF’s minimum estimate for budget revenues available to them.
“At a high-level, the House and Senate budgets share many similarities that would ordinarily suggest swift conference resolution: both bills exclude the tax policy proposals put forward by the administration, spend less than the Governor by at least $500 million, and reflect a limited number of substantive policy proposals,” the report said. “However, despite these shared elements, budget conferees are still tasked with reconciling nearly $1 billion in unique spending priorities, a resource gap that could exceed $750 million, and notable policy differences related to pharmaceutical cost controls and admissions policies at vocational technical high schools.”
The budget deal is the first piece of legislation subject to newly reformed joint rules the House and Senate adopted Thursday. One provision in the new package requires a gap of at least 24 hours between the filing of a conference report and acceptance of it in the House and Senate, which would require the budget deal to be submitted to the House clerk’s office by about Sunday afternoon for action to take place Monday.
Under the new rules, if a report is filed later than 8 p.m. though, it cannot be considered the following day.

My first encounter with Montana Congressman Pat Williams was at a political event I was covering in Pocatello, Idaho in the early 1980s.
Williams, who died this week in Missoula, Montana at age 87, was speaking at that event. He delivered the best political stump speech I had ever heard.
I haven’t heard a better one since. It was an unabashed defense of enduring democratic values – respect for the Constitution, defense of a liberal education, support for working women and men and organized labor, an affirmation that good people in government can and must do good works.
It is said that Montana, a state I love for its beauty, its people and (until recently) its determinedly independent political nature, is really a small town with a very long Main Street. If you spend some time under the Big Sky you come to believe that virtually everyone in the fourth largest (by square mile) state in the Union knows everyone else. And it’s almost true.
Driving 200 miles to have dinner with friends or to watch a football game is pretty routine in Montana. Voters (until recently) knew their governor, U.S. senators and congressmen on a first name basis because those Montanans showed up to knock on doors, eat chicken dinners, hold town hall meetings and give local reporters interviews.
That has changed. A lot.
Pat Williams’ passing reminds me of just how much things have changed, and damn it is not for the better in any way.
Pat Williams was among the very last of a breed of Montana congressional figures who knew more about their state than they knew about Georgetown, and by that I mean the neighborhood in the District of Columbia and not the spot on the map of Deer Lodge County.
Mike Mansfield, the best Senate majority leader in history, was just “Mike” to his Montana constituents. Mansfield campaigned in coffee shops and held office hours in the Oxford in Missoula.
“Lee” was the champion of the Wilderness Act and presided over the Senate during the filibuster that tried, unsuccessfully, to defeat the Civil Rights Act in 1964. Senator Metcalf, appropriately, has a Wilderness area that carries his name.
“Max” was the guy who chaired the Senate Finance Committee and served in the Senate longer than any other Montanan. For decades Senator Baucus shaped fiscal and health care policy and then, like Mansfield, had a second act as a U.S. ambassador to Asia.
There are many others: B.K. Wheeler, a Montanan who lead the fight to prevent the Supreme Court from becoming Franklin Roosevelt’s court; Tom Walsh, the investigator of Teapot Dome from Helena; Jeannette Rankin, an advocate for women and peace who hailed from Missoula, and Jim Murray, a millionaire New Deal liberal from Butte whose political devotion was to Montana’s miners and farmers.
Until partisan polarization poisoned Montana’s politics just as it has poisoned the country, Big Sandy farmer Jon Tester, as authentic and decent as any of those just noted, was the last best Montana federal office holder in this long and now gone tradition.
  Now let us praise Pat Williams 

Pat once told me he caught more political grief for advocating changing the name of the Custer Battlefield than anything he did in Congress, but he did it. Pat, a student of history and hyper sensitive to injustice, didn’t think the racist loser in that celebrated battle deserved the honor. Now we call it the Little Bighorn.
We take it for granted now, but the Family and Medical Leave Act likely would not have happened without Pat Williams shifting the legislative gears.
He advocated for the arts and humanities when Newt Gingrich – echos of today – came after the national endowments, arguing that art and ideas could exist without democracy but democracy was imperiled when creativity and critical thinking where ignored. Pat saw the effort to eliminate the endowments for just what it was, and what it is again – censorship.
Interviewed by The Washington Post, Pat characterized the struggle to pass compromise legislation to save federal funding for the arts in the 1990s as “the most nasty, difficult and thoroughly enjoyable of my life.”
Pat said of that fight:

        Art reflects the diversity and pluralism of our society, which is free. And freedom is our bulwark against tyranny. You can burn a generation’s imagination by teaching them that art is something to fear.    
As Democrats wander in the political wilderness trying to figure out how to “appeal” to distracted, disinterested voters, they might go to school on the politics of Pat Williams. He listened. He showed up. He cared. He knew what he believed.
“He was always his authentic self,” pollster Celinda Lake said. “He told me, ‘I want you to know my goals. I’m engaged in a 20-year conversation with the people of Montana about the benefits of good public education and the dangers of hard-rock mining.’ And I’ll never forget that.”
Like so many politicians who have tasted the bitter fruit of what our politics have become, Williams knew that big money and poll tested positions are a huge problem. In a 1996 interview with the New York Times he put his finger squarely on our dangerous national dilemma.

“People have come to believe their elected officials and their candidates are not the real McCoy. They’re not authentic, they’re scripted, talking according to the polls, voting according to next November … It’s cancerous to our system.”
 

Williams wasn’t bashful about advocating for the public’s lands and cleaner environment. 
He knew from experience as a teacher and elected official that education was still the best and surest path to a better life. He wrote well, really well. Pat’s sense of humor – he was from Butte and had to have a sense of humor – was legendary. He was the best political story teller I’ve ever shared a dinner and a drink with.
When my much better half was working on her doctorate – her subject was women and leadership – Pat enthusiastically supported her research, and every single time I called him or shared a handshake and a hug he would say, “And, how is Dr. Johnson?”
Years ago the journalist turned U.S. Sen. Richard Neuberger wrote an essay about a now long forgotten politician who gained power and fame and then couldn’t remember where he came from. As Neuberger told the story he got off a train, the City of Portland, to stretch his legs and asked the ticket agent how he could locate a former politician he’d once known.
“Heck mister,” the man said, “he don’t live here any more. Those guys never come back to Pocatello.”
But Pat did come back – to Montana. He taught and the University of Montana, and researched, and mentored and spoke out about issues big and small. He never caught the fever associated with the Potomac, instead preferring the Clark Fork. He loved and cared about Montana, all of it.
About the only truly bad thing I can say about Pat Williams is that he was a fan of the New York Yankees, admittedly a small blemish on a thoroughly distinguished resume.
There is a lot to be said for decency and authenticity in public life. A lot to be said for knowing what you stand for and then having the guts to explain why to the people who vote.
These increasingly rare qualities defined the gentleman from Montana. Finding another like him under the Big Sky seems now all but impossible, but I suspect Pat, with the optimism of a guy from Butte, would say: Keep the faith, do the work, show up and care.
God, I will miss him. I will never forget Pat Williams and all he did. We are very lucky that he made us all better.

,California,2025-06-28 13:10:00+00:00,CalMatters,Marines are now stationed on the California border. Newsom’s office calls it ‘mission creep’,Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/06/marines-border-patrol/,"As the Trump administration cracks down on undocumented immigrants deep in the country, it's sending Marines and soldiers to patrol the border.","In summary
As the Trump administration cracks down on undocumented immigrants deep in the country, it’s sending Marines and soldiers to patrol the border. 


Dozens of Marines are now stationed at a Border Patrol station in eastern San Diego County, a new development that points to the Trump administration’s military buildup on the southern border.
Some Marines there told CalMatters on Wednesday that they are out in Campo patrolling the border twice a day.  
That’s a change from how Marines have operated in Southern California since President Trump took office. Until now, Marines have been limited to a supporting role, adhering to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which keeps the armed forces away from civilian law enforcement. 
But Trump has long hinted at using the armed forces in unprecedented ways at the border to deal with what he describes as “an invasion.” 
And recently, the Trump administration shifted immigration enforcement northward toward the interior of California. Border Patrol agents have been seen chasing farmworkers through strawberry fields in Oxnard and swarming workers in unmarked cars at bus stops in inner-city Los Angeles.  
The Marines have not disclosed detaining anyone in California. Active-duty Army soldiers patrolling the border in New Mexico earlier this month reported turning people over to immigration authorities, a change that illustrated escalating immigration enforcement by military service members. 
A spokesperson for the Joint Task Force Southern Border, in charge of the operation, did not return a request for comment. Border Patrol Agent Gerardo Gutierrez said the Marines “are just staging there for their assistance along the border,” and gave no further details. 
California officials and immigration experts do not have details on what the Marines are doing at the border.  
“It’s not clear to me what instructions the Marines are being given with respect to engagement with people who are attempting to cross the border,” said Kevin Johnson, a UC Davis School of Law professor whose work focuses on immigration and civil rights. 
In April, Trump declared a 60-foot-wide strip of federal land that runs the length of the entire border as a “military installation,” a status meant to allow troops to patrol the region in the same way they protect military bases.

On a recent trip to the Border Patrol site in Campo, CalMatters reporters observed Marines’ olive-colored tents pitched atop hot asphalt with nearby water tanks for brushing teeth and washing. They have a pile of MREs, or “meals-ready-to-eat,” for food. 
Their camp is a couple of hundred yards from the start of the Pacific Coast Trail — a stone’s throw from the U.S.-Mexico border. The area is very remote.
Newsom sued to stop LA deployments
Earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom clashed with Trump over the federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles and deployment of U.S. Marines to subdue protesters, calling it “an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.” Newsom sued the administration, but a panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the president had followed the law and the case is unfolding at a lower court. 
A spokesperson for Newsom in a written statement to CalMatters connected the Marines at Campo to the Trump administration sending Border Patrol agents hundreds of miles inland.
“We believe in strong border security, but this campaign is not about security—it’s about fear,” said Diana Crofts-Pelayo of Newsom’s office. 
“Now it appears Marines are being forced to backfill those border slots,” she continued. “This is not just mission creep—it’s putting law enforcement, our soldiers, and the community in danger.”
The military presence in Campo, previously unreported, follows an earlier deployment of roughly 500 Marines from Camp Pendleton, who had been positioned in the small coastal town of Imperial Beach and in an inland border area near Brown Field Airport in Otay Mesa. According to the Department of Defense, those troops are tasked with “detection, monitoring, logistics, and transportation support along the border.” 
Over the last three decades, the border has become one of the most militarized regions in the world, with stronger, more formidable, and taller border barriers and increased surveillance. Migrant deaths have increased as people sought more dangerous routes in the U.S., the Mexican government reported last month.
How Trump’s border mission differs from others
When he took office, Trump issued a series of executive orders, including a national emergency declaration, to achieve what he described as “full operational control” of the southern border. The orders directed the Department of Defense, through U.S. Northern Command, to bolster border enforcement through increased military involvement. 
Some legal experts say turning land along the border into a “military installation” may sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act, which typically bars federal armed forces from conducting domestic law enforcement.

“There’s a concern that armed troops may use deadly force in situations and that people may be injured,” said Johnson, adding that military forces don’t have experience dealing with vulnerable migrants, and it’s not clear what training they’ve received. 
“It’s like a ticking time bomb,” he added. “I hate to say it this way, but it’s only a matter of time until we see something bad happen.” 
This isn’t the first time U.S. troops have been sent to the border. The Department of Defense has deployed troops to the border under both Republican and Democratic administrations for construction and surveillance.  But until now, their role has been limited to conducting surveillance, repairing vehicles, and fortifying barriers.

YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, WYO. – Sitting in an old-growth spruce fir forest, Doug Smith says he can see first-hand the impact of reintroducing wolves on the larger ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park.

Long before Yellowstone became the world’s first national park in 1872, wolves thrived in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
But early Yellowstone rangers killed off the last of the park’s wolves by 1926. By the late 1930s, the federal government had basically eradicated all the wolves in the American West.
That fundamentally changed the ecosystem, as far as Smith is concerned.
“To me it was just pretty scenery because it wasn’t ecologically vibrant,” Smith said.
Then, in 1995, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Idaho and Yellowstone using wolves captured in Canada.
Smith helped bring them back to the park and was in charge of Yellowstone’s wolf project for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022.
“Yellowstone is a very different place, with and without wolves,” Smith said.
“Wolves definitely have changed this landscape with the help of other predators,” he added. “It’s very different.”
Many of the changes have to do with the wolves’ status as an apex predator, at the top of the food chain. With the loss of wolves and the decline of other predators like cougar and grizzly bears, elk populations surged, Smith said.

Without the threat of wolves throughout much of the 20th century, the elk devoured woody vegetation in Yellowstone, like willows and stands of white bark Aspen trees.
When wolves were reintroduced, they preyed on elk, which reduced the number of elk and put pressure on the remaining animals to keep moving and not graze as long or as heavily in one place.
“I go to willow stands and aspen stands now that I was in 30 years ago, and literally, every single stem was eaten by an elk, and it was at the level of your knee,” Smith said. “And now I go in those stands, and you can lose your partner in them in regrowth of vegetation within 10 feet.”
Scientists debate an effect called the trophic cascade, which deals with how ecosystems are constructed and describes the cascading impact a predator has on its prey further down the food chain.
“Why it’s interesting is when European settlers moved across North America, they killed all the predators,” Smith said. “So you’ve really disrupted this process of a trophic cascade.”
Smith said the debate over the effects of the trophic cascade gets complicated – quickly. He himself falls somewhere in the middle when it comes to buying into the impact and intensity of the effect. But as Smith backpacked near Cache Creek in the northern section of Yellowstone, he said the impact of wolves and other predators is easy to spot.
“You guys don’t have to be ecologists to see all these Aspen are young,” Smith said. “Within a few years – and, man, give them 20 or 30 (years) – you’re going to have a forest here, and we’re going to be standing in the shade. Totally different ballgame, and I think that’s restoring balance to the ecosystem.”
When vegetation grows back, as the aspen and willows grow tall, that impacts things like beaver populations, which Smith has documented, and even songbirds.
The big picture for Smith? Wolves restored balance that was missing from Yellowstone’s ecosystem when the predators were absent.
“It’s a nice story, too,” Smith said. “We ruined Yellowstone. We’re fixing it by bringing back the top carnivores, most notably wolves.”
Truth be told, most Yellowstone visitors have likely never heard of the trophic cascade or deeply  considered the wolves’ impact on the food chain and the larger ecosystem.
But like the ecosystem, wolves have a powerful effect on many people, too.
Reintroducing wolves also attracted a new crop of tourists hoping to see a wolf in the wild. And that has had a cascading effect on the local economy.
Wolf-watching tourism has an estimated $80 million total economic impact on the communities surrounding Yellowstone National Park.
Any visitor to the wolves’ stronghold in the park, the Lamar Valley, can see the impact in the many tourists dotting hillsides looking through binoculars and spotting scopes hoping to spot canis lupus in the wild.
And one wolf, in particular, fascinated wolf watchers for longer than almost any other.
 907: the one-eyed queen of Yellowstone wolves

Even from a great distance, the old wolf’s large size and limp gave her identity away.
Gray, with a black nose, white legs, a cream-colored belly and a black spot near the base of her tail, wolf 907F stood out from the pack.
907’s physical scars told the silent story of the struggles wolves endure fighting for control of the rugged Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park.
Aside from a limp in her front paw, 907 was missing her left eye, the result of an injury park officials first noticed in 2017.

“Whatever tragedy, setback or loss she has, she just keeps on moving forward,” said Rick McIntyre, a retired Yellowstone National Park ranger and author who has studied 907’s pack since it formed.

“Nothing (stops her) – not health problems, getting beat up by a rival, the loss of her mother, the loss of her father, loss of pups,” McIntyre said.
Nobody in the world has seen more wolves in the wild than McIntyre.
He started working at Yellowstone in 1994 as an interpretive wolf ranger and documented his 100,000th wolf sighting in 2019.
Because he has 30 years of experience documenting wolves on a nearly daily basis, it takes a lot for a wolf to stand out to McIntyre.

But 907 accomplished something rare.
She was able to rise to the rank of alpha female four separate times and control one of the largest wolf packs ever documented in Yellowstone. And while she was at it, 907  gave birth to more litters of pups than any wolf ever studied in Yellowstone and outlasted her rivals long enough to grow old in the wild.
In 2024, 907 turned 11 years old and continued to lead hunts for bison and elk as the oldest wolf in the national park.
By comparison, the average wolf lives for about three or four years in Yellowstone, McIntyre said. Even pet dogs that sleep indoors, receive veterinary care and have a bowl of food waiting for them twice a day don’t always make it to 11.
Because of her longevity and the fact that researchers put a radio collar on her when she was a pup, Yellowstone biologists and wolf watchers were able to study 907 so closely for so long that there are detailed numbers and statistics documenting much of her life.
For her to reach the age of 11, 907 had to defend her territory from rival wolves and endure 10 snowy, freezing Wyoming winters. She had to fight for most of her meals – sometimes getting kicked in the head by 2,000-pound bison and sent flying through the air.
Her stats are a snapshot of the turbulent life wild wolves face. Throughout her life, Yellowstone National Park staff watched 907 participate in 566 hunts.
Most of the time she chased bison (281 hunts) or elk (239 times).
She was successful 33 times, or in about 6% of the hunts that park officials documented.
Yellowstone officials once watched 907 and the Junction Butte Pack endure 12 days without finding anything to eat – only for the pack to triumphantly bring down a bull elk on empty stomachs.
When it comes to numbers, the biggest impact 907 may have had was building up the bloodline of Yellowstone wolves.
In 2024, at the age of 11, she produced her 10th litter of pups.
That is the most for any wolf in 30 years of wolf research at Yellowstone National Park.
“With her being 11 years old and having new pups that would be somewhat similar to a woman in her mid 80s having kids,” McIntyre said.
Numbers even tell the story of how 907 got her name.
When Yellowstone officials captured 907 and placed a radio collar around her neck in 2013, she got collar No. 907.
Each collar has a unique number to help identify and tell the wolves apart. Biologists use the “F” in 907F to designate her as female, but many people simply called her 907.
The collar allowed park officials to keep close tabs on 907 for more than a decade.
Many of the numbers and statistics about 907 can be found online in the 2024 Yellowstone Wolf, Cougar and Elk Project annual report, as well as previous yearly wolf reports.
 The chance to observe a wolf queen’s long reign attracts tourists to Yellowstone National Park

Wolf 907 and the Junction Butte Pack’s territory spanned mountains, valleys and creeks within an area called the Lamar Valley, which is in the northern part of Yellowstone National Park on the Wyoming-Montana border. It’s one of the centers of wildlife activity in the park.
For years, 907 dug her den into a hillside covered by a mix of sagebrush and conifer trees overlooking Slough Creek, where 907 and her pack hunted bison and elk.



On a chilly July morning in 2024, the creek meandered through a giant meadow below the den, where bison wallowed as the morning sun crested the nearby mountain peaks.
The den was a mile or more from the closest road, near the top of a diagonal section of forest.
Toward the left side of the forest, barely visible to the naked eye from more than a mile away, stood four small clusters of conifer trees.
At the base of one of the trees, near a patch of light colored dirt, 907 wrestled with two pups, one gray and one black
Unbeknownst to 907, she was often the object of attention from afar.
And on that morning in July a handful of people with high-powered scopes were watching her every move.
One of the wolf watchers was Laurie Lyman, a schoolteacher originally from California.

Lyman became interested in wolves after realizing that third and fourth graders became more interested in learning about continents if Lyman described the animals that lived there.
One year, Lyman received a copy of Jim Dutcher’s 1997 Emmy Award-winning documentary “Wolves at Our Door,” which Lyman and her students promptly fell in love with.
Something about wolves – how they live in packs that function like a family, where all of the wolves help raise the pups, contribute to hunting and share food – made an immediate impression on Lyman.
Within wolf packs, including 907’s own Junction Butte Pack, biologists have even documented one wolf raising another wolf’s pups. One spring, 907 had a litter of eight pups. Other female members of the Junction Butte Pack who lost their own litters helped 907 raise her large litter  – even taking turns nursing the pups.
Before reintroduction, Lyman was fascinated by the ways the members of wolf packs worked together to take care of each other.
But wolves had been absent from the landscape in the U.S. Rocky Mountains for her entire life, and Lyman assumed she would never see a wolf in the wild.
That’s how wolf reintroduction changed Lyman’s life.
After wolves were reintroduced in 1995, Lyman started hearing about people seeing wild wolves again and she made a trip to see what it was all about.
“When they released them into Yellowstone, when they started to see them, it was incredible, and that was the changing point in my life,” Lyman said.
Lyman retired from teaching in 2005 and bought a house in Montana just outside of Yellowstone’s Northeast Entrance to be closer to wolves.
She became friends with then-Yellowstone Ranger Rick McIntyre and purchased a spotting scope. And for the past 20 years, Lyman has been watching wolves and documenting her sightings online at www.yellowstonereports.com.
Now, she thinks of wolves and wolf packs a lot like students and classrooms.
“It’s very similar to actually teaching my kids, watching the wolves out,” Lyman said. “It’s like watching a recess. Because you have the adults sleeping. And you have the yearlings playing.  And you have the pups and it’s very much like kids in a sandbox, kids playing soccer. And then the older kids sitting in the lunch center talking.”
“My thing is getting to know them on an individual basis, so that I can easily recognize them,” Lyman added.
 If you come at the queen, you best not miss

Thanks to their notes and years of daily field observations, McIntyre and Lyman have major details of 907’s life documented.
Even as a pup, 907 didn’t have it easy.
She was born in 2013, the second year of the Junction Butte Pack’s existence. Before the year was over, 907’s mother died or disappeared, McIntyre said. About that same time, 907’s father, wolf 911, took off, returning to the original wolf pack that he had been born into.
“In human terms, you could say that she was orphaned,” McIntyre said. “However, she was raised by the pack, raised by the family.”
After she became an adult, 907 fought with her twin sister, wolf 969, for control of the Junction Butte Pack.
The two sisters regularly pinned each other to the ground and bit at each other, Lyman said.
“And they went back and forth several times on who had the alpha female position,” McIntyre said. “907 would have it for a while, the sister would take it away from her and then 907 would get it back.”
In 2017, 907 had a litter of pups and made her den in a remote location away from the rest of the Junction Butte Pack.
Park officials and wolf watchers noticed that the other adults in the pack stayed away from the den and didn’t appear to bring food to 907 or her pups.
In May, 907 returned to the pack, but her pups had died.
“And to make it worse, while she was desperately trying to save her pups, her sister at the time, 969, took advantage of that situation to seize the alpha position,” McIntyre said. “And when 907 rejoined the pack after losing all of her pups, she was beaten up by her sister and relegated to a very lowly position in the pack.”
“Everything that year was against her,” McIntyre said.
Even though she was relegated to a subordinate role, 907 didn’t leave the pack.
“She just has this ability to keep on moving forward, rather than dwelling on the past, dwelling on how unfair life has been,” McIntyre said.
During the 2019-20 winter, the Junction Butte Pack experienced a bloody leadership shakeup.
The female wolves aggressively drove 969 – 907’s sister and rival – out of the pack.
Wolf 969 survived her initial expulsion, but park officials noticed she appeared to be in poor physical condition.
A few weeks after her exile, 969 encountered the Junction Butte Pack again one January night, leading to a fight.
“The next morning 969F was seen with injuries and she died later that day,” officials wrote in the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s 2020 annual report. “Her injuries were caused by other wolves and she weighed only 33 kilograms (73 pounds).”
Even after her sister and closest rival was killed, 907 continued to face challenges from rival female wolves.
First, it was her sister’s daughter, wolf 1382, who became a problem for 907.
Then wolf 1262 took over as the pack’s alpha female.
Finally it was wolf 1276.
But after 1276 was last seen alive in October 2023, 907 again took her crown as the Junction Butte Pack’s alpha female.
“And this is her fourth term as alpha female, meaning that she lost it three times,” McIntyre said. “And in those cases, it was either to a sister or a niece. So she’s had a lot of hard times in her life, and she’s always been able to fight back and prevail.”
From 2016 to 2024, 907 claimed the rank of alpha female four separate times.
And she gave birth to pups every spring from 2015 to 2024.

For those reasons, Lyman views 907 as the stabilizing force in the Junction Butte Pack and one of her favorite wolves of all time.
“She would just put her head down and walk into the wind no matter what adversity came to her,” Lyman said.
 Ambushed in the dark, a queen makes her last stand in Yellowstone

Despite her long rivalry with her sister, it turns out 907’s greatest threat came from outside her own pack.
It was just before Christmas 2024 when 907 made her last stand.
During the final few weeks of 2024, the Junction Butte Pack left the invisible, unfenced boundary of Yellowstone National Park and entered Montana, where hunting season was underway.
From Dec. 17 through Dec. 19, hunters legally killed two other adult members of the Junction Butte Pack outside of the park, Yellowstone officials wrote.
After the shootings, 907 and some of the surviving members of the Junction Butte Pack returned to their home territory in the Lamar Valley inside of Yellowstone.

But the Junction Butte Pack’s numbers were reduced. Lyman said there were only six other wolves with 907 when the final battle went down – and one or two of them may have been pups.

A much larger force of 19 wolves from a different wolf pack, the Rescue Creek Pack, ambushed 907 and the Junction Butte Pack on Dec. 22 after wolf watchers spotted the diminished Junction Butte Pack feeding on an animal carcass.
The attack occurred at night.
Lyman wasn’t there, but she received a phone call from a friend who was.
“She was filming and her camera lights things up so she could see things pretty well,” Lyman said. “She called me and she said, ‘You know, it’s over. They got her.’”
The radio collar 907 was wearing was designed to enter mortality mode and emit a unique signal after several hours passed without any movement from the wolf. Officials didn’t detect a mortality signal from 907 until about three days after the attack, Lyman said.

Lyman was heartbroken thinking about 907 suffering at the end.
It may be impossible to know exactly what went down in the dark woods after the Rescue Creek Pack advanced on 907 and the Junction Butte Pack.
But this much seems certain.
907 went out fighting.
She died fighting a larger, rival wolf pack that had attacked her and the Junction Butte Pack – the family she lived with her entire life with.
No other members of the Junction Butte Pack died in the attack from the Rescue Creek wolves.
That means 907’s pack, including some of her pups and nieces, lived on without her.
Strange as it sounds, Lyman takes comfort in that.
Despite the sadness, people like Lyman were happy that 907 lived and died naturally, as wolves did before humans became a factor.
At least 907 wasn’t shot by hunters, like 15 other members of the Junction Butte Pack who were killed when they strayed outside of the park’s boundaries, Lyman said.
The same week 907 died, her counterpart, the alpha male of the Junction Butte Pack, was killed by a poacher. The alpha male, who did not have a number or a radio collar, was killed Dec. 24, while the wolf was outside of Yellowstone National Park, in Montana.
After living to be the fifth-oldest wolf ever recorded in Yellowstone and having more litters of pups than any Yellowstone wolf since the species was reintroduced 30 years ago, 907 went out fighting.
“This is a wolf in the wild, and this is what wolves do,” Lyman said. “They’re wired to rise to the top to survive, and this is what they have to do to do it.”
“She just did what she had to do to make sure that her pack survived,” Lyman said. “So to me, she is a key to the Junctions surviving until now. And her legacy is in those three females that are left there in the pack.”
That’s one of the gifts of a wolf, Lyman said.
“Just like a regular family does, you pass down what you know and help them learn to survive. And she really did that.”

Poll findings released this week from Glengarrif Group showed that eight in 10 voters – from a sample size of 800 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.5% – felt that the upcoming election to select the three top heads of state; governor, attorney general and secretary of state, would be equally secure and fair. 
The results of the poll, which was conducted during the first week of June, were released in conjunction with an event on Thursday at the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids. The panel featured members of the Democracy Defense Project, including two former Michigan governors, a former congressman and others.
Glengarrif Group noted that nearly 76% of Michigan voters said the November 2024 election was fair, and that 88% of voters said they trusted their local elections, which is a 10-percentage point increase from those who answered a related poll in October 2024.
That said, nearly 57% of voters who engaged with the poll said they were at least somewhat concerned about noncitizens voting in state elections, with nearly 36% also saying they were very concerned about that issue.
Only 21% of respondents, however, said voters should show an ID to vote, which is already required by Michigan law, and a slim 7.7% said voters should show proof of citizenship.
That polling on some voters’ feelings on citizenship as a prerequisite to vote serves as a counterpoint to Michigan Republican efforts to get a constitutional amendment requiring proof of citizenship in order to cast a ballot.
The lead sponsor of that movement is state Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford), who told Michigan Advance in late May that he believed 85% of the state’s population agreed that only U.S. citizens should vote in statewide and national elections.
That said, Posthumus’ aim was to put that question before the voters in 2026, giving the voting populace a chance to say whether they believed only U.S. citizens should vote in Michigan’s elections. It is still an open question if a large enough group of Michigan voters want to make that a constitutional requirement.
At Thursday’s forum to announce the poll findings, former Democratic Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard said the state’s residents should be proud of the professionalism of local election workers, regardless of the political outcome.
“As with any election, people will have strong feelings about the outcome and the winners,” Blanchard said. “One thing our poll clearly shows is that despite those feelings, Michigan voters are confident in our election system, especially the work of our local and county-level officials and the many hardworking volunteers who provide support at precincts in communities across Michigan.”
Former Republican Michigan Gov. John Engler also said that the state’s voters appear overwhelmingly satisfied with existing election processes. Engler went on to say that more education was needed to bring them up to speed on what measures are already in place to ensure secure and safe elections.
“In the past few years, we have seen clerks from both parties actively engaging voters from all backgrounds in their communities – Republicans, Democrats and independents,” Engler said. “At the same time, local media outlets have covered these events and supported civic public education that benefits all of us, and we encourage them to build on these efforts.”
Engler’s comments come at a time when some Republican state lawmakers remain committed to pushing the falsehood that the 2020 and 2022 elections were unfair and are working to relitigate the outcome of those elections despite recent polls like the Glengarrif offering and other assurances through the years.
Former Lt. Gov. John Cherry, a Democrat, said the Glengarrif poll was striking because it was the first time polling has been done where a majority of voters from all backgrounds said they were satisfied with the 2024 results and looked confidently ahead to 2026 – all while acknowledging that existing safeguards were working.
“Where voters say they want to see changes, that list is very narrow,” Cherry said. “We believe that by working together, in a bipartisan way, Michigan policymakers can find reasonable, commonsense and cost-effective ways to address voters’ concerns.” 
Former Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Bishop of Rochester said the poll was evidence that voters of all political leanings wanted to be in the driver’s seat for local, state and national elections, and not politicians in Lansing.
That said, Bishop did say he believed that the proof of citizenship responses in an open-ended portion of the poll shows there is an appetite to move that measure across the finish line.
​​“Voters also have a real desire to ensure only U.S. citizens vote in our elections, and we encourage policymakers to explore solutions that keep our elections secure without putting up barriers that may prevent any eligible voter from exercising their right to vote,” Bishop said. 
Board members of the Democracy Defense Project proposed a solution to that conundrum: expand and support voter access to Michigan Enhanced IDs and driver’s licenses. Both forms of enhanced identification indicate if someone is a U.S. citizen and are compliant with new federal requirements for REAL ID, which allow access to federal buildings, boarding planes and traveling domestically by air and other activities. 
In late May, the Michigan Department of State said it had issued 200,000 REAL IDs in the last few months.
A REAL ID differs from Enhanced ID in that it does not indicate U.S. citizenship, so a pathway to getting the latter could ease citizenship and voting concerns.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Democracy-vote-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

Mike Dunleavy discusses proposed education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy has vetoed a bill that would have limited high interest rates and fees for payday loans of $25,000 or less, which advocates said would have protected against predatory lending. 
The legislation, Senate Bill 39, passed both the Alaska House and Senate this session, and would have removed payday lenders from a state exemption in lending laws, and placed a cap on interest rates and fees at an annual percentage rate of 36% for customers paying back these loans. Payday loans are short-term, high-cost loans often for small amounts that are meant to be repaid on the borrower’s next payday.
In a short memo issued with the veto on Wednesday, Dunleavy cited access to credit and compliance requirements, issues argued by opponents of the measure.
“These changes would reduce short-term credit options – particularly for those without access to traditional banking services – while creating enforcement challenges for the state,” Dunleavy wrote. 
The veto was condemned by a sponsor of the bill.
“I’m very disappointed in the veto. This was a bipartisan bill,” said Rep. Ted Eischeid, D-Anchorage, who introduced the bill in the House, in a phone interview on Friday. He pointed to the fact that payday loans are highly convenient and accessible online, leaving borrowers with high-interest loans that they struggle to repay. 
“It’s easy to get these payday lending loans. But the problem is, people get the loans. They have two weeks to pay them off. They’re charged fees plus interest rates, and oftentimes they can’t pay those,” he said. “They create debt traps.”
Interest rates and fees in Alaska can range from 194% to 521%, according to research by the Alaska Public Interest Research Group. Eischeid noted 18 other states have enacted a cap on interest rates and fees at 36% annual percentage rate, and other banks lending institutions provide emergency loans. “Those states, red and blue, have not had credit crises,” he said.
In 2023, there were 7,085 Alaskans that took out payday loans totaling $17.4 million, according to the state’s Division of Banking and Securities, with loans averaging $440 and each borrower taking out an average of 5.5 loans. 
Eischeid said Alaskans are also targeted by lenders, who can garnish their Permanent Fund dividend checks. “And so when Alaskans can’t pay these debt trap loans, the payday lenders simply go to small claims court and garnish their PFDs,” he said. “It’s a cash cow for payday lenders.”
From 2017 to 2023, payday lenders garnished over $3.7 million from Alaskan’s PFDs, according to court data compiled by Eischeid’s office. 
He said he wished Dunleavy had identified enforcement concerns earlier, as his office worked with the Division of Banking and Securities in drafting the bill to identify any potential issues. “Because we asked, ‘What kind of heartburn is this going to cause the state in terms of enforcement and regulation?’ And they said none,” he said. “I’m confused by that.” 
The Online Lenders Alliance, a national trade organization for financial technology groups that offer online banking services, applauded Dunleavy’s veto. “Governor Dunleavy made the right choice for Alaska consumers by vetoing this flawed legislation,” said the group’s CEO Andrew Duke in an emailed statement. “The ability to access credit is the cornerstone of financial independence and stability.  Unfortunately, SB 39 would have taken away credit options and financial choices for Alaskan consumers and small businesses.” 
The Alaska Public Interest Research Group criticized the veto, saying it’s a failure to protect Alaskans from predatory lending. “This bill is a commonsense, multipartisan effort to end a debt trap that has harmed our communities for over 20 years,” said Claire Estelle Lubke, AKPIRG economic justice lead, in an email. “Instead of siding with Alaskans, the Governor chose to protect an industry that profits from financial insecurity. Payday loans are not an acceptable form of credit for our communities.”
The group is calling for the Legislature to vote to override veto next January and limit what they call a predatory loan industry. 
Eischeid said it’s a possibility. “​​Those discussions have to happen yet. But it’s a good bill, it was a good bill. It works in states where they’ve gotten rid of the special treatment payday lenders get. And I would like to see this effort be successful.”

(Photo courtesy Maryland Municipal League/CGI)Pocomoke City Mayor Todd Nock wants to take the Maryland Municipal League “back to the future.”
Nock, who took over presidency of the league this week, made the comments after being handed the gavel by Frederick Mayor Michael O’Connor, the outgoing president. In his first speech as president, Nock reminisced about his younger self and about the people who nurtured him, before challenging his fellow mayors and city leaders to work to develop the next generation of leaders.
“This year, Maryland Municipal League is going back to the future. Back to our communities. Back to building the next generation of leaders,” Nock said, according to text of his speech provided by the league. “We’re going to be present. We’re going to show up.
Because here’s the reality—we won’t be elected forever. Our job is to prepare, teach, and nurture not just our youth but also support our elders and entire communities,” he said. “It is time to go back home and be who the people elected us to be.”
Nock went on to tell the municipal officials assembled in Ocean City for the league’s annual summer conference that he did not want to be in their communities just “when you polish statues and cut ribbons. I want to be there when you’re hosting community events, when you’re connecting with residents, and when you’re doing the hard work that truly matters.”
Nock will serve a one-year term as president. While he was elevated to the presidency Tuesday, Bladensburg Mayor Takisha James was elected to replace his as president-elect, and will serve once Nock’s term ends.
Dashboard data targets gun violence
The Maryland Department of Health launched new data on gun violence statistics that health officials say will help track trends in gun violence and find solutions to reduce those numbers.
“As someone who has served as a surgeon in emergency departments in Maryland, I have personally seen how Maryland families and communities suffer from the impact of gun violence and its resulting trauma,” Health Secretary Meena Seshamani told reporters Thursday. “Our ultimate goal with these resources is to develop … data-driven solutions that will save the next life, that will protect the next family and that will heal our communities,” she said.

	The dashboard includes a decade of fatal and nonfatal shooting statistics, updated monthly to have “almost a real-time assessment of what gun violence looks like at the state, county and ZIP code level,” Seshamani said. It also includes the number of homicides and suicides related to firearm use.
From Jan. 1 through April, there had been 187 deaths due to firearms, according to the dashboard. About 54% of those deaths were suicides.
In addition to the dashboard, the department released a preliminary state plan to develop a public health approach to lower gun violence. Besides incorporating dashboard data, the plan calls for increased education efforts for effective gun violence prevention strategies and improved coordination between state agencies and local jurisdictions to bring down gun violence.
“It’s always important for us to remember that these statistics — they’re not just numbers,” Seshamani said, “They are real people. They are real victims of a public health crisis.”
You can’t be in the minority if you’re the only one…
Months after frustration of being in the minority drove Del. Christopher Bouchat (R-Frederick and Carroll) to say he would not run for reelection, the freshman Republican has modified that statement a little.
He will not seek election to a seat in the House of Delegates. He will seek election to an office on the second floor of the State House — the governor’s office.
Bouchat has not yet formally filed for the office, but confirmed his intention to run for governor, first reported by last week by the Baltimore Sun. While he has not filed the paperwork, Bouchat said he intends to start running ads thiis weekend on Fox45 in Baltimore, not actually pitching his candidacy but urging people to visit  Maryland’s many historic sites. It’s a version of the short video on his delegate site, quickly rebranded to a “Bouchat for Governor” page.

Bouchat said he decided to walk away from the House after one term because of the “super minority status” of Republicans in Maryland, who hold just 28% of seats in both the House and Senate,.
“It’s pretty much hopeless to be a Republican in the Maryland General Assembly,” Bouchat said. “Maryland has been under a legislative dictatorship by the Democratic Party for 105 years.”
He blames that on gerrymandering of legislative districts. Which got him to thinking about the goveror’s race.
“On a governor level, it’s not gerrymandered — it’s statewide,” Bouchat said.
His biggest goal, if elected, is to create a solution to gerrymandering
“What I’m offering is historical,” Bouchat said. “This is going to be one of the greatest political science accomplishments in the history of the world.”
If he files, Bouchat would not be the first Republican to throw his hat in the ring for the governorship: John Myrick and Brenda Thiam are already filed for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Political observers are waiting to see if two-term GOP Gov. Larry Hogan will run for his old seat. And the Republican nominee will likely have to take on Gov. Wes Moore (D), a fundraising juggernaut in a deeply blue state.
While he has not officially filed, Bouchat has until February to sign up.
“I’m in no great hurry,” Bouchat said. “It’s a bit of a strategy to watch it all unfold.
Burd steps up at state retirement system
Robert “Bob” Burd, the deputy chief investment officer for the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System, will step up next week to serve as acting CIO, the system’s board of trustees announced.
Burd will take over as interim chief on July 1, with the retrirement of current Chief Investment Officer Andrew Palmer, who has served in that role since 2015. The interim appointment of Burd was announced at the trustees June 17 meeting.
Burd has served as deputy chief investment officer since 2011, helping shape “asset allocation strategy, managing investment risk and overseeing manager selection across the $70 billion portfolio,” according to a news release from the system.
“Bob brings a deep understanding of our portfolio and a steady, principled approach to leadership,” said Executive Director Martin Noven. “He has earned the trust of the Board and I’m confident in his ability to lead the division with focus and integrity during this transitional period.”
Burd served as acting CIO once before, and system officials said his appointment now ensures uninterrupted leadership.
“Bob has worked side-by-side with our team to deliver long-term value for our members,” said State Treasurer Dereck E. Davis, Chair of the SRPS Board of Trustees. “We are fully confident in his ability to guide Maryland’s investment program during this interim period.”
The board said that under Palmer’s tenure, the system “achieved consistent outperformance, expanded internal asset management capabilities, and implemented strategic reforms across public and private markets. Burd has been instrumental in advancing these efforts and will provide continuity and stability during the leadership transition.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/54613600036_900624f396_o-1024x981.jpg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

(Photo by Travis Bell/SIDELINE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)In conjunction with other southern states, Florida is developing a new university accrediting commission in response to existing agencies the governor says require schools to “bend the knee” to get accredited.
During a Thursday news conference at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced, alongside State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues and university leaders from Texas and South Carolina, that the states are developing a Commission for Public Higher Education.
DeSantis has focused heavily on “woke” ideologies by pushing legislation to ban state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and remaking state higher education institutions to be more conservative.
In the way of his higher education initiatives, he has said, are accrediting agencies that may require a commitment to those values or other expectations for a university to be recognized.
In order to “shape institutions in a positive way,” DeSantis said, “You gotta go two or three levels down sometimes. And we’ve identified this accreditation cartel as an issue for a long time.”
Florida is establishing the commission with the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina system, University of South Carolina, the University of Tennessee system, and the Texas A&M University system, which DeSantis said will “upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels.”
The layers, for example, can be shown by a 2023 law, SB 266, which outlawed state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion, but allowed for DEI initiatives to continue if required to maintain accreditation.
DeSantis, who used to own an LSAT prep company, said during the “woke era” “institutions really became corrupted by ideology, and they were putting ideology ahead of the pursuit of truth during COVID.”



Why is USC involved?
Thad Westbrook, board president for the University of South Carolina, joined Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, as well as leaders of state schools in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, at this week’s news conference announcing the initiative to form a new accreditation agency.
Referring to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which accredits schools across the Southeast, DeSantis blasted what he called the “woke accreditation cartel,” which has been “hijacked by radical ideology.”
But Westbrook sidestepped such rhetoric in explaining what drew USC to this new partnership. 
Rather than criticize the accrediting agency for anything specific, he described accreditation and re-accreditation, which colleges must go through every five years, as “a very burdensome process.”
He told the SC Daily Gazette that USC could benefit from an accreditation agency tailored to large state college systems, “more peer-to-peer instead of a one-size-fits all” organization that covers the entire region. By joining this partnership, South Carolina’s largest university will have a seat on the governing board as it creates its standards for accreditation.
Westbrook said he wants to see standards focused on student outcomes. In particular, he wants to see increases in the number of students who graduate college within four years or less, progressing through as quickly as possible and entering the workforce.
He said he thinks some accreditation agencies stray from what’s required under the federal Higher Education Act. He said the new agency will still have rigorous standards but won’t go beyond what the law demands.
Westbrook said the costs of applying to become an accrediting agency will be borne by the state of Florida. If the accrediting agency gets federal approval, USC will only pay a membership fee if its governing board votes to leave SACS and apply for accreditation through the new organization.
For USC faculty, the impact of the arrangement is less clear. 
Faculty Senate President Wayne Outten, who teaches biochemistry, said professors and researchers are typically less concerned about which accrediting agency a college uses. When deciding whether to apply for a job, they usually weigh a college’s reputation, salaries and resources for research.
But with so few details available on the new agency, possible effects are unknown at this time.

 Timeline

DeSantis did not lay out a timeline for when the commission would be up and running, acknowledging that it has to meet federal requirements before the U.S. Department of Education can approve it.
“We’re establishing it. You kind of got to go and actually do it for, you know, some period of time,” DeSantis said, adding, “I think U.S. DOE wants to be quick on this.”
DeSantis said he nudged Rodrigues shortly after Trump won the presidency.
“We didn’t really have the prospects of launching anything like this successfully during the Biden years, but it’s a new day, and I think this is going to make a big, big difference,” DeSantis said, adding that if it gets established during the Trump presidency, “then it’s almost impossible for a future federal administration to try to upend the apple cart.”
As recently as 2020, the year after DeSantis took office, the State University System of Florida created a workgroup that, in its final report, concluded that the universities’ “Board of Governors is making a clear and steadfast commitment to prioritize and support diversity, racial and gender equity, and inclusion.”
In 2022, Florida lawmakers approved and DeSantis signed SB 7044 to provoke institutions to seek accreditation from accreditors approved by the State Board of Education or Board of Governors.
 Expecting favorability

“I think almost all the states in our region are going to be favorable to this,” DeSantis said.
“All those states have done good stuff in higher ed anyways but, you know, it’s been more difficult when you have this accreditation cartel nipping at you all the time,” he said. “You know, now I think it’s going to be really, really smooth sailing.”
Florida’s and other southern state institutions are members of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. DeSantis and Rodrigues made jabs at SACSCOC, saying Florida institutions have problems with the accrediting organization and that its member schools’ performance has not been impressive.
“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens. These reforms will benefit our faculty, our students, and the hardworking taxpayers who fund our public systems,” Rodrigues said.
In an emailed statement to the Phoenix, SACSCOC said, “We welcome any new accreditor as they go through a rigorous approval process. Accreditation is central to quality education; thus accreditors are held to high standards and must themselves be reviewed.”
“As for SACSCOC, we know we currently accredit institutions that serve the largest number of students in the country (approximately 5M),” the organization said. “As such, we will work with our partnering institutions to ensure and strengthen a high standard of accreditation that reflects the needs of students, our institutions, and the workforce.”
DeSantis complained that Florida law schools “should not be captive to having to bend the knee to get accreditation from” the American Bar Association, which he said “mandates explicit DEI compliance as a condition of accreditation” and “has now become a far left activist group.” The association has suspended its DEI standard until at least 2026.
The commission “will create a first-of-its-kind accreditation model for public higher education institutions that will offer high-quality, efficient services prioritizing academic excellence, student outcomes, and achievement,” according to the State University System.
“​​Together, we are leaving behind the legacy systems and failed institutions of the past, while charting a new course in higher education, that puts student success at the forefront of everything that we do,” said Florida Atlantic University President Adam Hasner, who was recently named to that position following outcry from students who feared he would politicize the position.
 Union backlash

The Florida Education Association and United Faculty of Florida released a joint statement following DeSantis’ announcement, saying they “strongly oppose” the move as “directly threatens the independence, integrity, and academic credibility of the state’s higher education system.”
“Accreditation matters because it’s the backbone of academic freedom, shared governance, and public trust in the quality of our institutions,” UFF President Teresa M. Hodge said in a news release.
“This proposed state accreditor appears designed to align more with political priorities rather than academic independence. It seems to be the state’s latest attempt to exert top-down control over what faculty can teach and what students are allowed to learn.”
Andrew Spar, president of the FEA, said he is concerned about how a new accreditor might affect teacher preparation programs.
“Students learn best when they’re free to learn and educators are free to teach — not when curriculum decisions are dictated by politics,” Spar said.



The commission’s announced core principles:

It is appropriate and necessary to introduce competition, aligned with state and institutional needs, into the existing marketplace of university accreditation.
It is in the best interests of all interested parties, including students, to launch an accrediting body comprised of true peer institutions focused on public colleges and universities and their governing university systems.
It is imperative to reduce bureaucracy through a more efficient and focused accreditation process, which will result in lower costs and significant time savings for member institutions, and which will translate into lower tuition prices for students and families.
It is critical to ensure that this new accrediting body is accountable to the states of the member institutions.
It is necessary for the new accrediting body to become and remain recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for the purposes of Title IV participation by its accredited institutions.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Last spring Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo posted a photo of his daughter Vera wearing a baby blue mermaid-style dress with puffy sleeves and a train. She had designed it on her own so, certainly, as a fashion designer who didn’t hesitate to make a gown for a loved one, he made her vision come true. 
On Friday, Vera wore that gown again while singing for hundreds during the celebration of life Ah Loo’s friends and family organized after he was tragically wounded during the “No Kings” rally June 14. Many joined Vera in donning the tributes to the renowned designer’s style, wearing geometrical prints, flowers, formal wraparound skirts known as ie faitaga, sleek hairstyles, and so, so many of Ah Loo’s gowns.  
Laura Ah Loo, his wife, wore a flowy, green dress adorned with a yellow lei. It was one of the best dresses of the night, Telesia Afeaki Tonga, the event’s emcee said, because she was one of his main sources of inspiration. Laura’s voice cracked as she thanked family, friends and fellow protesters for all the love they had received in the last weeks.

“Losing Afa feels like losing the sun, our light, our warmth and our comfort,” Laura Ah Loo said. “It is more devastating than I can ever put into words, because no amount of words can encompass who he was as a person and who he was to me and our babies.”
Ah Loo’s big community gathered at the Salt Palace Convention Center’s grand ballroom, a room as big as the presence he had in the Pacific Islander communities in Utah and beyond.
“Of course it had to be in a grand ballroom, like only he would have. Absolutely extra,” Tonga said.

Ah Loo’s participation on “Project Runway” in 2019 expanded his presence in the fashion industry. However, being the first Samoan to participate in the show, among many other feats, made him a point of reference in Polynesian communities. After moving to Utah, he continued weaving his legacy, mentoring anyone with a creative pursuit and supporting the state’s Pacific Islander community though a nonprofit he co-founded, Creative Pacific.
While his job took him to other cities and countries, his greatest joy wasn’t on a runway, but at home with his family, his wife said. And sometimes, at McDonald’s with a large Coke. 
“I will miss taking sips of his drinks because I never wanted to order my own, his constant eye rolls at my antics and hearing him speak Samoan, his beautiful singing voice,” Laura Ah Loo said. “And, as he called it, his hyena laugh. But to me, it was the best sound in the world.” 
Beloved Utah fashion designer’s friends remember his life and his last moments

After her loss, Laura Ah Loo has been planning to continue her husband’s work and legacy, a task that now seems impossible to equally replicate. But, she still sees parts of him every day, in their kids’ brown eyes, creativity, “healing hugs,” and “larger than life” personalities, all attributes they share with Ah Loo. Also in the remaining fingerprints he left behind and his voice in all the videos saved in their phones. 
Just like Ah Loo did after his fashion shows, Laura Ah Loo walked along a runway, holding Vera’s and her son Isaac’s hands while friends and family gave a standing ovation. 
June 14 remains a painful day for his family. But Laura Ah Loo still finds inspiration in the sign he held that day, which read “The world is watching.”
“They were watching then, and they’re watching, certainly watching now. The world is watching how we carry his light, how we treat each other, how each keep choosing love in the face of unthinkable loss, how we raise our children, how we fight for joy in spite of hard times,” she said. “He will not be forgotten.”
Others also took the stage to perform a musical number or a dance, often included in Polynesian funerals, or to tell stories of Ah Loo’s life as a beloved mentor, friend and brother, distinguished by his sense of humor, sarcasm and kindness.

“I see all your posts about him. I see all your tributes about him, and how I’ve sat down several times to write something about him, but I can’t,” his sister Ofeira Asuao said. “There’s just no words for me to explain the impact that he’s had.”
While Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson never met Ah Loo, she said in her remarks that she has come to know his spirit through the love and admiration shown by the community he helped shape. 
“I personally am inspired to continue the work he cared about, advocating for equality, embracing creativity and fostering a stronger and more compassionate community for his Pacific Islander friends and beyond,” Wilson said. “Afa, may your light continue to shine and may others be inspired by your fearless advocacy, your life’s mission, love of friends and family and your creative spirit.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Afa-Celebration_SH_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 09:03:29.599741

Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.
Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.

Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through COVID, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.

Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

Michigan’s top election official is locked in a clamorous legal battle with Republican lawmakers over access to election training materials, a conflict that likely has less to do with policy than politics — and the coming race for governor.
And if the battle continues at its current volume, voter trust in Michigan’s elections could take a beating.
On one side is Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who won her 2022 re-election race by nearly 14 percentage points and is now a leading Democratic candidate for governor. Since 2019, she has been a key part of the Democratic power structure in the executive branch and the face of election oversight in a swing state that became a target of heavy scrutiny and conspiracy theories after Donald Trump’s 2020 loss.
On the other side is the Michigan state House, back under Republican control since January, which has subpoenaed her, sued her, and even made moves to impeach her.
Leading the charge there is Rep. Rachelle Smit, a Republican and former township clerk from Martin who took over in January as chair of the House Committee on Election Integrity. For several months, she has been seeking access to the Department of State’s election training portal to check for “flawed guidance.” Benson and her office have been pushing back.
With each day, the confrontation over election manuals looks more and more like a mobilization for next year’s political campaigns, where Republicans hope to retake the governor’s mansion after eight years of being shut out of statewide office. Benson is one of the people who stand in the way.
Smit hasn’t identified specific concerns about the content of the training manuals, but has instead cited what she calls a “concerning track record” of illegal guidance from Benson, based on the fact that Benson’s office has faced many election-related lawsuits, and has lost some of them.
“The Michigan House Committee on Election Integrity has a duty to provide oversight,” Smit told Votebeat. “We seek to review the training materials to ensure MDOS is properly training clerks on the law.”
Benson’s office has not provided access to all the documents upon request, citing concerns over information security. That has prompted an escalating series of steps by the Republicans to challenge Benson for the access, and countermoves by Benson to defend her office’s response.
Their dispute is now before the Michigan Court of Claims, which has set deadlines for filing legal briefs, though an actual resolution could be weeks away. Meanwhile, both sides are using the fight as fodder for fund-raising appeals.
 Conflict heats up after power shift in the House

The conflict has simmered for months, but escalated after Republicans reclaimed the House in November’s election. That’s when Smit requested access to the state’s election training portal, which provides manuals and tools for local officials.
Smit said the Department of State initially couldn’t fulfill her request. She then filed a public-records request and was told it would require 140 hours and nearly $9,000 to fulfill — a cost she called “ridiculous.”
Shortly after, Smit was named the chair of the House election committee, newly renamed the Committee on Election Integrity. She then sent another request for the information, which the Department of State said it would fulfill in part. But the requested documents never came. At Smit’s request, the House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena for the documents.
Republicans say the subpoena was necessary to ensure the balance of power in Michigan government. Smit’s office did not respond to Votebeat questions on what specific concerns prompted the inquiry.
Benson, whose office also handles motor vehicle services, has faced numerous challenges to her guidance and conduct of elections — more election lawsuits than her last four predecessors combined. But her record is better than that of past secretaries from both parties. A review by the Michigan Information & Research Service found that while Benson has lost some election-related lawsuits, she has won significantly more cases than her predecessors.
Several cases have had mixed rulings, like a lawsuit from the Republican National Committee over voter signatures on absentee ballots, where part of Benson’s guidance was struck down while other pieces were allowed to remain in place. Out of 69 total cases since 2019, Benson’s office had five “losses,” according to the MIRS analysis.
Department of State spokesperson Angela Benander said the cost estimate the department gave Smit after the November request followed state Freedom of Information Act requirements, including producing the records and redacting sensitive sections. “We are now well above that,” she said, noting that more than 20 staff members have worked on it over recent weeks.
The Department of State said it made multiple offers to provide the requested materials securely with redactions, but the Oversight Committee rejected them. The subpoena sought information that could jeopardize election security, Benander told Votebeat in April, by risking the chain of custody of ballots and revealing specific locations for trainings for election officials, among other concerns. Election workers across the state have faced threats of violence in recent years.
The department then went public, posting information about the documents it had already shared with lawmakers. Benson reiterated the department’s position that releasing sensitive information could jeopardize election security.
“This is true even if those seeking the information are well-intentioned,” she said in May. “Each time sensitive information is released, its risk of misuse increases.”
Since then, she has issued regular updates, sharing more documents, doubling down on security concerns, and preparing for a legal showdown.
Republicans have also escalated: On May 22, the House voted along party lines to hold Benson and the entire Department of State in contempt. On June 3, Rep. Jim DeSana, a Republican from Carleton, introduced articles of impeachment against her in a House resolution, alleging that she abused her authority, mishandled records, and intimidated local officials in the way she oversaw the state’s elections.
Then, earlier this month, the House Oversight Committee sued Benson and her department, alleging they were refusing to provide the training documents “in their irrational and even conspiratorial objections to the House Subpoenas.”
Benson said in a statement that she welcomed the suit as a chance to resolve the matter in court.
 What will voters make of the Benson vs. GOP fight?

While the battle has been useful for driving fund-raising campaigns — for both Benson and the Republicans — it’s unlikely to swing any votes so far out from an actual election, David Dulio, a political science professor at Oakland University, told Votebeat.
The House GOP effort might be intended to damage Benson’s campaign, he said, “but the people who they would want to persuade aren’t paying attention. They have other stuff to worry about.”
Jeffrey Bernstein, a political science professor at Eastern Michigan University, agreed. Those who are most tuned in to politics probably have already formed their opinions on how Michigan’s elections are run, he said.
“People are going to start paying attention soon enough,” he said, “but there will be other things happening then to occupy their attention.”
Marjorie Sarbaugh-Thompson, a political science professor at Wayne State University, worries, though, that such a pitched conflict in Lansing could have a lasting effect for people who aren’t so tuned into politics by casting a “vague and hazy” cloud over elections.
Even this far out from an election, she told Votebeat, “when you start casting doubt on integrity, public trust suffers.”
The best case scenario, Sarbaugh-Thompson said, is a quick ruling from the courts to quiet the entire issue. But she doesn’t expect quiet anytime soon.

Dorie Ladner was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. She and her sister, Joyce, became involved early with the civil rights movement, working with Medgar Evers, Vernon Dahmer, Clyde Kennard and others. 
She and her sister were kicked out of Jackson State University for their support of the Tougaloo Nine, who integrated the all-white library in downtown Jackson. They became even more active at Tougaloo College. They worked with the Freedom Riders, joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and helped with the 1963 March on Washington. 
Dorie escorted Fannie Lou Hamer to register to vote. Joyce pursued graduate school, earning a doctorate in sociology, becoming the first female president of Howard University. Dorie continued her civil rights work, participating in every major civil rights march through 1968. In Washington, D.C., she earned her master’s in social work, counseling emergency room patients, visiting schools and working with the Rape Crisis Center. 
The sisters were honored at the Kennedy Center, and Dorie received the Fannie Lou Hamer National Institute on Citizenship and Democracy Humanitarian Award. A decade before her death in 2024, she received an honorary doctorate from Tougaloo.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland households will have to wait just a little bit longer for a promised rebate on their energy bills amid the summer heat.
While legislative leaders had said they expected the first payments in July, the Maryland Public Service Commission said Friday that the first round of rebates to all residential energy customers is expected in August or September. A second round is anticipated in either January or February.
Total payments are expected to average about $80 per household for the year.
PSC Chair Fred Hoover said the commission spoke with utilities — which will actually dole out the rebates to customers — as well as ratepayer advocates and its own staff, to come up with the best plan for handing out the money.
The commission “has selected a plan that will allow for the most equitable, efficient and timely distribution of refunds to provide relief to customers, particularly those most affected by bill increases this past winter,” Hoover wrote.
The refund payments will show up as credits on ratepayers’ bills and will be based on a customer’s usage over a year, with those who use more energy getting a larger rebate. But the PSC also directed utilities to disburse 25% of the money evenly across all ratepayers, to ensure all customers get a baseline amount.
The PSC also advised utilities to advertise ways for customers to donate their rebate to others if they choose, including to the Fuel Fund of Maryland or SMECO’s Members Helping Members program. For the winter rebate, utilities were told to explore ways that customers could refuse the rebate and send it instead to other customers who receive bill assistance from the state.

The rebates were authorized by legislators as part of the Next Generation Energy Act, a wide-ranging bill that also included a regulatory fast-track for new power plants and other energy infrastructure in the state.
Lawmakers tapped $200 million to pay the rebates from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which utilities if they do not purchase a specified amount of renewable energy for their portfolios. The fund has ballooned in recent years.
During a news conference Wednesday, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) referenced this week’s high temperatures, which flirted with 100, and their impact on already soaring bills.
“I have an HVAC repair person coming tomorrow,” Ferguson said. “So we are personally dealing with the challenges of what I know a number of Maryland families are, which is unbelievably hot weather, and then the resultant impact on people’s bills, which feels like a double hit. I am as frustrated as anyone.”
High utility bills were a major topic of conversation for the 2025 legislature, following high costs during a cold winter, thanks in large part to higher natural gas distribution rates. But now, electricity rates are poised to increase as well for the delivery year that began in June.
The increases will hit different customers at different times: June 1 for SMECO customers, August for Pepco and Delmarva Power customers, and October for Potomac Edison. BGE, which will have the highest increases, was ordered by the PSC to spread them over three months this fall and again next spring, in order to dull the impact in the high-use summer and winter periods.
Moore signed the Next Generation bill and one other energy bill, but vetoed the Energy Resource Planning Act, which would have set up an in-house energy planning office for state government. He recently critiqued the Next Generation law, saying it did not go far enough to attract power generators to build in Maryland.
“We introduced legislation this year that would have allowed more nuclear into the state, that would have allowed nuclear to be seen as a clean energy source, which it is,” Moore said. “I’m proud of the work we did in partnership with the legislature, but I want to be crystal clear: It did not go far enough.”
Ferguson pushed back this week.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I don’t know what the governor was talking about when he said that. I genuinely have no idea what he was referencing,” Ferguson said during his news conference. “I think that we did incredibly important work to make it easier for all sorts of cleaner energy, from natural gas to wind to solar to geothermal to batteries.”
He said Moore’s nuclear bill would have increased costs for ratepayers, which “was not something that we were going to tolerate. So, what we did was incorporate components of the governor’s bill into the Next Generation Act.”
The bill directs state agencies to pursue nuclear cost-sharing agreements with neighboring states and agreements with federal agencies about nuclear siting, including for small modular reactors.
The fiscal note for Moore’s bill said that “in the short term, the bill appears likely to increase electricity rates,” because it increased the amount utilities would have to pay the state to comply with a solar energy goal. It also established a nuclear energy procurement mechanism that would be funded by ratepayers.
But legislative analysts said the governor’s bill had “the potential to provide other benefits to the broader energy market and eventually reduce associated electricity rates paid by customers in the State.”
Ferguson was also quick to note that increasing power generation in the state isn’t a cure-all. Maryland is part of a 13-state region whose electrical grid is controlled by PJM Interconnection, which has been criticized for policies that make it difficult for new power sources — particularly renewable — to come online at a time of surging demand.
“Generation is a problem within the PJM territory, for all 13 states, and even in states that are net exporters, that generally are sending their energy to other states,” Ferguson said. “This, sadly, is not a problem that we can fix in a day, a week or a month.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/transmission-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 08:04:05.007854

Growing demands, arrivals at all hours and a rare disease are just some of the challenges Vermont’s prisons have faced while working with federal immigration authorities. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Internal communications reveal Vermont prisons’ frustrations working with ICE.","Greg Hale didn’t understand why border patrol officers from Maine were showing up at the prison he oversees in St. Albans town. He was used to federal immigration authorities bringing detainees in from Vermont’s northern border. But this signaled a shift. 
The superintendent of Northwest State Correctional Facility, Hale had previously informed his contacts at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that Vermont didn’t want to become the feds’ hub in the Northeast.
“Apparently they are disregarding that,” he noted in a memo to his higher-ups at the Vermont Department of Corrections in early March.  
The emails reveal mounting frustration within Vermont’s corrections system as ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection have increasingly relied on the state’s prisons to warehouse detained immigrants. New demands, arrivals at all hours and a rare disease are just some of the challenges Vermont’s prisons have faced while working with federal immigration authorities.

Internal communications since the start of President Donald Trump’s second administration, obtained through a public records request, offer a window into how the Vermont Department of Corrections has cooperated with — and pushed back against — federal immigration police as the number of detententions increased. Leaders have navigated the growing strain on the state’s prison system while also encountering the unique health and language difficulties posed by housing immigrant detainees.
Nationwide, ICE is detaining about 59,000 people, a possible record. Deportations have also ramped up, according to the New York Times, while border apprehensions have fallen. 
Regionally, in addition to Vermont’s prisons, the federal government uses facilities in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts to hold immigrants, many of whom have not been charged with crimes. 
Vermont’s memorandum of understanding with U.S. immigration authorities gives them access to the state’s six prisons in exchange for $180 per-detained person, per-day. That deal expires in August.
This year, the Legislature passed a law removing a provision in state statute that allowed collaboration between local and state law enforcement and federal immigration authorities during declared states of emergency. 
In Vermont, the St. Albans prison serves as ICE’s primary jail for male detainees, and Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington holds female immigration detainees. The average number of immigrants detained for federal officials in Vermont’s prisons fluctuates, hovering in the teens to the 20s on any given day.

Federal officials have also shuffled detainees from other states into and out of Vermont, and used commercial flights out of the Burlington airport to facilitate deportations. 
Those jailed in Vermont’s prisons include people with established lives in the state, like farmworkers. Vermont’s prisons have also held people from other New England states, like a Russian scientist working at Harvard University.
VTDigger’s reporting previously revealed the challenges facing jailed immigrants. Several people in prison reported that ICE detainees were struggling to access phone calls, lawyers and medical attention, often due to a lack of translation services. The department of corrections has invested increased resources to address language access concerns, documents show. 
Following the high-profile arrests of Columbia University student and Palestinian rights activist Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University grad student Rümeysa Öztürk, Vermont’s work with ICE drew increased scrutiny. 
The Vermont Department of Corrections declined interview requests for this story, instead answering questions over email. Asked about workers’ complaints with the feds, Haley Sommer, a department spokesperson, wrote “DOC is committed to maintaining a collaborative working relationship with our federal partners.”
‘Not a fan of ICE’
As federal authorities increased their use of Vermont’s prisons, leadership at the St. Albans prison grew frustrated, records indicate. 
ICE agents’ demands stacked up. They requested detainees’ medical information, which they said was “required for the flights,” in addition to bagged meals and clothing. Sometimes, they arrived in the middle of the night. 
In late February, St. Albans’ assistant superintendent informed his higher-up that during a recent interaction with ICE, agents were “very very lax in their security procedures around their keys and they were rude when confronted about it.”
“Let’s get a report and then we can yell at them,” Hale, the superintendent, responded.  
The next month, ICE transferred 19 people out of the prison at 4 a.m, requesting medical summaries, two meals, and closed-toed shoes for each. The day after, federal agents brought in 16 new detainees, according to communications records. 
“Mostly I am concerned about the traffic, my booking is not built for 31 ICE movements in 24 hours, this is on top of normal movements,” Hale wrote to his corrections colleagues. “Booking is swamped and we are going to miss something critical.”
He made his exasperation clear to department leadership.
“I continue to push back on them, but they are technically operating within the agreement I think, it is just overwhelming us,” he wrote of ICE. “This break-neck pace with them is going to be the cause of bigger issues.”
Hale attached security camera photos of the crowded areas, though the department declined to provide them in the records request, citing security concerns. 
“What a mess and by all accounts not a safe situation for our staff to be in,” Al Cormier, DOC’s chief of operations, responded to Hale.  
The superintendent was taken by surprise when the news arrived in March that border patrol agents from Maine were bringing detainees to St. Albans. One of his colleagues questioned ICE on the decision, writing, “It was my understanding that we don’t accept individuals that cross the border from other states … Is this a new practice that we have started?”
Elsewhere, Hale noted ICE provides little information to state staff — and he was skeptical of the information the feds do provide. 
“It’s unusual for them to share much of anything honestly and what is shared I don’t trust,” he wrote.

Around the same time Hale was raising concern about the feds’ increased presence, his counterpart at the South Burlington prison, Superintendent Theresa Messier, also noted an uptick. In an email to the department’s health equity program director, she asked for additional support for the women’s prison’s work with detained immigrants.
“I think it would be a good idea for you to come to talk with staff regarding ICE detainees. There has been an increase with them recently and there have been issues,” Messier wrote.
But though corrections staff expressed annoyance at ICE’s strain on the system, the working relationship appeared solid from the feds’ perspective.
After an inspection of the women’s prison this spring, ICE’s detention oversight branch reported they were “highly impressed with all of the operations” and identified no deficiencies.  
In April, Nick Deml, the corrections department’s commissioner, convened a meeting with the South Burlington and St. Albans superintendents to discuss their experience working with the feds. 
In an email to many of the department’s central office staff on the day of the scheduled meeting, Hale offered his thoughts on the state’s continued cooperation with immigration authorities. While he described himself as “not a fan of ICE,” he didn’t think ending the state’s contract would impact the feds’ operations, and he feared financial retaliation from the Trump administration.
“That said, I do think working toward restructuring the contract to better reflect the amount of work, time, and other resources it takes to house their detainees not to mention meeting our own operational (requirements), would be worthwhile if that is a supported direction at some point,” he wrote to department leadership. 
Inroads for a deadly disease
With detainees arriving at Vermont’s prisons after leaving countries around the world, staff communication shows the emergence of a unique health challenge: tuberculosis. 
In late April, an infection control coordinator with the department’s health services contractor, Wellpath, outlined concern about detained immigrants carrying and spreading the dangerous disease — a bacterial illness most often impacting the lungs that is rare in the United States. While treatable, tuberculosis kills more than a million people per year worldwide. 
Later, Travis Denton, DOC’s facilities division director, summarized the issue as described by Wellpath. Procedures at the time allowed ICE detainees to enter the general population before the results of their tuberculosis tests came back, he wrote. 
“Recent incidents have involved patients who were later confirmed TB-positive after already entering GP, posing serious exposure risks,” Denton told colleagues in a memo. 
Last year, there were more than 10,000 tuberculosis cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because immigration detainees may have arrived in the U.S. from countries where tuberculosis is more prevalent, some of those cases are found in prisons. 
Last fall in Louisiana, an ICE detainee tested positive for a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis, but it’s unclear how prevalent the disease is across all facilities. According to a 2004 memo written by an ICE official, there were between 100-150 tuberculosis cases a year in detainees at that time. Academic studies have shown immigrants detained in the U.S. are far more likely to have the disease than the country’s population as a whole.
Language barriers and unreliable self reporting made it challenging to identify people’s tuberculosis history, Denton wrote, and the disease’s symptoms overlap with drug detox and Covid-19 — health concerns staff are more accustomed to.

The medical contractor proposed a system to account for the concerns. Detainees would receive a tuberculosis test during intake and spend the first two to three days in restrictive housing or another separated space until the test results arrived. Anyone who tested positive would receive a chest X-ray and potentially be moved to the hospital. 
“I want to just flag that the distance between this proposal, and successful implementation, is not quick or short,” Denton wrote in the memo.
He described the proposal as a big undertaking reminiscent of procedural changes during the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is further complicated by the focus on ICE detainees, which is a chaotic process that we have very little control over, and must be handled strategically due to the high-profile nature of topic,” he wrote. 
Later, as Denton informed the department’s leadership of the proposal, his skepticism grew. “While the intent behind Wellpath’s proposed protocol is understandable, it doesn’t appear to fully account for the significant operational impact it would create,” he wrote, questioning whether there was any input from the prison’s security staff.
Hale, the St. Albans prison leader, echoed Denton’s concerns, saying Northwest lacked the cell space for such a procedure: “I get the concern but I don’t see how this will work.”
Asked this week whether the department had ultimately decided to change procedures, Sommer, the spokesperson, wrote that Wellpath had “enhanced patient monitoring practices.”
“Since the implementation of the new policy, there have not been any active confirmed TB cases,” she told VTDigger.
While ICE will likely continue to work with Vermont’s prisons, what that work looks like could change. 
Gov. Phil Scott holds sole authority in the state to partner with federal immigration authorities. Asked in June about whether the state would renew or alter the existing agreement, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, signaled the deal would continue in some form. 
“The Governor has been clear that he believes there should be a state contract with ICE because canceling or allowing the contract to expire won’t stop detainments, it will simply mean detainees will be sent someplace else,” she wrote. “We’re not going to get out ahead of contract negotiations, but we are reviewing the (contract) and considering changes.” 
Vermont’s current agreement with federal authorities expires on Aug. 21.

Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
5 million adults
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through Covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.

Arkansas, Georgia
Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
More than 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it. 


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.










We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that. 


– Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey


Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

Two wins and two sellouts marked this year’s women’s exhibition matches as a permanent team is in the works.

Busy Anderson is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
BURLINGTON — A year’s worth of anticipation hailed down on Vermont Green’s Sophie Reale as she blew past two defenders and harvested the first goal of the women’s exhibition matches last week. 
Five thousand fans brought Virtue Field to capacity and spilled onto the nearby hillside for the games against semipro teams Flower City Union and A.S. Blainville. World Cup winner Sam Mewis returned as head coach this year, but young fans were no farther from the field’s railings as she took the pitch. 
“Playing for the national team, playing in the NWSL, the fans have this hungriness for more: for more access, for more autographs, for pictures,” said Mewis, who moved to Colchester after retiring from the U.S. team. “It is honestly really familiar from playing at the level that I played at before.”
A hum about Vermont Green’s expansion into the women’s game underscored the two sellouts and two wins: 4–0 over Flower City, 2–1 over Blainville. This year, nurturing a lush landscape for soccer in Vermont is top of mind.

Players convened June 9 for the first of three practices before their Flower City matchup, many learning each other’s names for the first time. In their two games, Green would entertain and improve, Mewis said that day.   
“Every time you get the ball is an opportunity to express yourself,” coach Brad Cole added during drills. 
Last season, Vermont Green announced a permanent women’s squad is a matter of when, not if. Exhibition games will continue until a full season is secured, with Mewis and University of Vermont women’s soccer head coach Kristi Huizenga guiding the launch.

Olivia Borgen, Sophia Lowenberg and Violet Rademacher claimed a goal each for the Green in Wednesday’s second half, conceding none. The 4–0 outcome was much more comfortable than the Green’s 5–4, penalty kick win over FC Laval in 2024. The difference was in the roster, and particularly the personnel on the sidelines, said goalkeeping coach Erin Murphy. 
“It’s not just, we took the male coaches and had them go female,” she said. “I think Sam has really embraced her role a lot this year.” 
Joining Mewis was former Portland Thorns player Mo Fitzgerald, with Murphy stepping up as a coach after her own career with UVM and the Green. 
“You also have to develop coaches, more women coaches, more referees.  You need more administrators. You have to have talent in the front office,” sports journalist Meg Linehan said on “The Women’s Game,” a podcast run by Mewis.
At the top of both matches, the Green and their opponents walked out with girls from Nordic SC, Monarchs SC and the Mad River Valley Soccer Association. All-female referees supervised the field and ball girls fueled the fast pace. During Saturday’s contest, Democratic U.S. Rep. Becca Balint announced that the Vermont Community Foundation would send $10,000 to the Burlington School District to buy cleats and other gear.
The National Women’s Soccer League has seen a 163% increase in attendance since its 2013 start and will add the nearby Boston Legacy to its ranks in 2026. The Massachusetts club’s swan logo was scattered in the Virtue Field stands at the Green’s exhibition matches less than a week after the crest was unveiled.

Joining the surge is the professional women’s United Soccer League Super League, home to eight clubs founded in August 2024. Tampa Bay won the inaugural championship in front of a sold out crowd Saturday night, and seven new teams are set to debut next season. 
“I’ve played soccer in the mid-’70s in Venezuela where it was a very hot sport, and just to see the degree of athleticism that these women have, how far the sport has come in terms of how soccer is played with women, is amazing,” said fan Alicia Daniel from Burlington.
The Green has a solid foundation on which to rest ambitions for a second team. Vermont led the nation in youth sports participation in the most recent measure by the federally funded and directed National Survey of Children’s Health: 69% of kids ages 6-17 played on a sports team or took lessons in 2022, well above the national average of 54%. 
Vermont families have 46 competitive clubs and 51 recreational programs to choose from under the Vermont Soccer Association, the state’s arm of U.S. Youth Soccer. When Andrew Minnis joined the state org as executive director last December, he looked to collaborate with the Green’s founders right away. 
“A big push of mine since I came in has been really trying to bridge the gap of southern Vermont,” Minnis said. 
Clubs under the association are more abundant in and around Chittenden County, with less access to youth soccer south of Montpelier, he said. 
The association’s partnership with U.S. Youth Soccer’s Europe branch, announced last month, holds promise for an exchange of knowledge overseas that could help coaches add teams to Vermont’s inventory, Minnis said.  
At the moment, when teens surpass the challenge of local clubs, their paths upward become more sparse. Players can be selected for Vermont’s Olympic Development Program with the chance to represent their state, region or country but have few options outside those rosters.

In high school, the Green’s Liv White commuted three hours from her hometown of Pittsford to play with New England Mutiny, a Massachusetts club, she said on “The Women’s Game.” When coaching local clubs, White’s teammate Lauren DeGroot sees that routes to elite teams lead kids out of Vermont. 
“These girls are super talented, and we’re able to see that from such a young age, and it’s unfortunate that you see those girls and you feel like you’re doing them a disservice cause there aren’t those opportunities,” she said. “You think, ‘Can we send them down to Massachusetts, Jersey, so they can get that? Cause they aren’t getting it here.’” 
Female footballers of the Green’s caliber are still looking elsewhere for off-season training.
“I have to drive an hour and 15 minutes to Quebec to play soccer over the summer,” said Sydney Remington, a UVM player, of her training without the Green. 
Green forward Erin Flurey closed shop that night, poking in a loose ball to slash Blainville’s 1–0 lead and chipping the keeper in a bold signoff for a 2–1 win. The women’s exhibition team concluded year two undefeated. 
Best friends Marie Coyne and Veda Pfeifer walked out to centerfield hand in hand with Green and Blainville players before kick off. The girls are 10 years old and don’t doubt they can compete on Virtue someday. They just need some support. 
“Like cheering for you and saying, ‘You got this,’” said Pfeifer. 
Convinced the Green is here to stay, fans imagine the club playing at home fields all around Vermont, not just at Virtue, and even a new stadium open to local teams when Green isn’t in town. But a simpler goal played on repeat all week: 
“I would like to see a women’s team. Period,” said fan Annette Seidenglanz.

A Utah State University study finds Airbnb-style rentals are reshaping life for Bear Lake residents.
The post Beloved summer vacation spot bordering western Wyoming is losing its charm, residents say appeared first on WyoFile .","This story is being reprinted with permission from the Salt Lake Tribune, a Utah nonprofit newsroom.
Bear Lake—Residents of a tourist destination straddling the Utah-Idaho state line say the communities here have long been close-knit, but new research shows that sense of neighborly connection may be disappearing.
Utah State University’s Community and Natural Resources Institute recently released results from a survey that show growing concerns among Bear Lake residents over the rising number of short-term rentals, such as Airbnb properties, in the area.
Alex Theophilus, a sociology PhD student and lead author of the report, said these properties may be contributing to the weakening of community ties. He spent months in 2024 interviewing residents of Garden City and Laketown in Utah, and Montpelier, Bennington, Paris, Fish Haven and Saint Charles in Idaho, about their experiences. The lake is about a 45-minute drive away for Wyomingites who live in Cokeville and Kemmerer.
“There’s not that same connection built season over season that people felt existed in the Bear Lake area,” Theophilus said. “They think short-term rentals are posing a threat to that.”
The rise of platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo throughout the 2010s, combined with a surge in tourism during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, spurred rapid growth in short-term rentals around Bear Lake, Theophilus said. This was made worse by the limited availability of hotels.

Research shifted focus
In the spring and summer of 2024, Theophilus and his research team conducted interviews with both full-time and seasonal residents of Bear Lake to understand how changes in the environment and community were affecting quality of life. While short-term rentals were not the original focus, the properties came up in nearly every conversation, Theophilus said.
One issue brought up by residents, he said, is housing affordability and availability. Many vacation rental owners don’t live nearby and treat these homes as investments to rent out during peak tourist season and earn some extra cash. This often means homes that could be used by year-round or seasonal residents are instead being taken off the market or built specifically for visitors.
Some residents surveyed worry that neighborhoods with many of these properties lose the stability and relationships that come from long-term neighbors, Theophilus said.
“People talked about how if too many of the houses in their neighborhoods are short-term rentals, then their kids don’t have neighborhood kids to play with,” he said, “because there’s this revolving door of people coming in and out of the community for that short-term rental, rather than building relationships with their neighbors in the longer term.”
There are also concerns about trash, parking disputes and noise complaints tied to disrespectful renters, he added.
More than 1,000 Airbnb listings are spread across Rich County, Utah, and Bear Lake County, Idaho — areas with fewer than 10,000 permanent residents combined, Theophilus said. And Airbnb is just one of several short-term rental services in the area.
“There were lots of folks we talked to who were concerned that the community is developing in a way that caters to wealthier tourists or wealthier newcomers,” Theophilus said, “and that the values and considerations of longtime community members aren’t necessarily being taken into account as frequently as some folks wish they would.”

Existing regulations
Mitch Poulsen, executive director of the Bear Lake Regional Commission, said regulations for short-term rentals also vary sharply between the Utah and Idaho sides of the lake. While its residents still report concerns, Rich County, Utah, has had a permitting process for these properties for about seven years, with some basic rules, he said.
But Bear Lake County, Idaho, has almost no regulations, leading to overcrowded properties, camping in yards and overloaded septic systems, Poulsen said. In some cases, he added, old farmhouses with just one or two bedrooms are packed well beyond their capacity with large groups.
“I would like to see them regulated,” Poulsen said. “The attitude right now is let the market dictate, and I just don’t know that’s a good idea. When you’ve got houses that have 60 and 80 people in them, it’s not really a residence anymore.”
He feels Utah’s requirements, which call for a license and limits on guests and parking, are not particularly burdensome.
“It’s just unfortunate,” he said, “that Idaho can’t see that.”
Regulation on the Idaho side would have to come from the state Legislature. Some homeowner associations here have taken matters into their own hands. Kevin McLeod, president of the Bear Lake West HOA, said his community bans short-term rentals to protect amenities like pools and water usage.
“When these large groups rent these homes, it impacts your amenities,” McLeod said. “It impacts everything.”
Bear Lake West’s ban on short-term rentals was written into its governing documents before the Idaho Legislature passed a law limiting new HOA restrictions on them. That change prevents newly formed HOAs from outright banning short-term rentals — but communities like Bear Lake West that had preexisting restrictions are allowed to maintain them.
Since then, McLeod said the HOA has continued to survey its members on whether short-term rentals should be allowed.
“Far and away the majority has been ‘no,’” he said, “so we’ve not moved that direction.”

President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

She slept by his hospital bedside for weeks when he was extremely sick from untreated HIV.(Amy Maxmen/KFF Health News)GREENVILLE, Miss. — Cedric Sturdevant woke up with “a bit of depression” but made it to church, as he does every Sunday. In a few days, he would drive from Mississippi to Washington, D.C., to join HIV advocates at an April rally against the Trump administration’s actions.
It had clawed back more than $11 billion in federal public health grants to states and abruptly terminated millions of dollars in funds for HIV work in the United States. Testing and outreach for HIV faltered in the South, a region that accounts for more than half of all HIV diagnoses.
Dangerous changes loomed: To compensate for tax cuts for the wealthy, Trump’s “big, beautiful” bill and budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 threaten to curtail Medicaid, which provides health coverage for people with low incomes and disabilities. About 40% of adults with HIV rely on it for their lifesaving treatments.
Further, the budget proposes to eliminate all HIV prevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This alone could lead to an additional 14,600 HIV-related deaths within the next five years, according to one analysis.
Trump’s budget proposal also would cancel a major grant that provides housing assistance for people with HIV. And it would end a strategic initiative to expand HIV services in minority communities, and another to support the mental health of people of color with HIV or at risk of infection.
“President Trump is committed to eliminating radical gender and racial ideologies that poison the minds of Americans,” a White House addendum to the budget says. Letters terminating HIV grants used similar language, targeting “diversity,” “equity,” and “gender minorities,” words that focus resources where they are needed most. Black and Latino people account for about 70% of new HIV infections in the U.S.
The cuts affect Sturdevant personally. He is a gay, Black man living with HIV and the co-founder of a grassroots group that combats health disparities in the Mississippi Delta, one of the poorest regions of the country.
 
That morning at church, a close friend, pastor Jerry Shelton of Anointed Oasis of Love Ministry, asked Sturdevant to help him deliver a sermon about resisting the urge to give up when life is hard. “The storm may come, but I shall not be moved!” Shelton preached, directing the congregation to approach adversity with confidence in themselves and in God. “Walk boldly!” he shouted.
After the service, Sturdevant resolved to bring the same energy to Washington. He’d tell his colleagues that they are survivors, he said. He’d tell them, “Let’s get together and make a plan.”
In the past few months, HIV advocates have begun to organize and strategize ways to limit the damage as federal funds are slashed and inflammatory rhetoric rises.
“It is a very scary time to be Black, queer, and living with HIV,” said Marnina Miller, co-executive director of the Positive Women’s Network, a nationwide group for women living with HIV. “But I am grateful that I am part of a community that will not bow down.”
“People are not giving up,” said June Gipson, the CEO of a health care nonprofit, My Brother’s Keeper, in Mississippi. Then she referenced the 1980s cartoon where heroes combine forces to create a super robot to defend the universe:
“We’ve got to form Voltron.”

The weight of stigma
Sturdevant often reminds his colleagues of all the HIV movement has overcome. In the 1980s, the government refused to acknowledge HIV as gay men died young. Once powerful treatments were available in the 1990s and early 2000s, the public health establishment largely neglected Black people with HIV, especially in the South. In that period, the demographics of the epidemic shifted away from white, upper- and middle-class gay populations in liberal states. Half of new diagnoses today are in the South and a third are among people with low incomes.
When Sturdevant first tested positive for HIV in 2005, he didn’t seek treatment. He kept his diagnosis hidden from friends and family because he knew how people talked about HIV. They considered it a death sentence, a punishment for irresponsible behavior, or a disease that could infect them through a touch or a shared toilet seat — which it cannot.
“I thought my family was going to disown me,” he said.
A year later, his weight plummeted because he couldn’t hold down food or water. Gaunt and feverish, he went to the hospital and learned he had AIDS. His mother slept at his hospital bedside for two weeks: “She said, ‘God got you.’”
Once he regained his health, Sturdevant resolved to care for others in his position. Scientists had developed powerful HIV drugs that, if taken daily, transform it from a death sentence into a manageable chronic disease in which a person’s virus levels are so suppressed that they cannot spread HIV to others. And policymakers ensured that almost everyone in the U.S. with HIV could get treated regardless of their ability to pay, largely because of Medicaid and the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.
But HIV experts had failed to overcome a key problem: Roughly a third of people living with HIV in the U.S. don’t get treated or don’t take the drugs regularly enough to be virally suppressed. Viral suppression rates are better in many African countries than in America.

To seek treatment and stick with it, Sturdevant understood, people had to have basic needs like food and housing met and, as importantly, a sense of belonging and empowerment. At his first job at an HIV organization in Jackson, Mississippi, Sturdevant regularly checked in with clients who didn’t have family members to support them. He hosted gatherings at his apartment and even offered it up as a place to stay. He has taken on the role of dad or uncle to many. “We called ourselves the family of love,” he said.
He saw how care bolstered lives, but the federal government needed data to drive its approach to HIV.
In 2012, the CDC expanded its in-depth surveys to learn more about the lives of people at risk of HIV and of those with HIV who weren’t virally suppressed. The surveys revealed what Sturdevant knew: A disproportionate number of them grappled with unstable housing, food insecurity, depression, and anxiety. Many participants agreed to prompts like, “Having HIV makes me feel that I’m a bad person,” or “Most people think that a person with HIV is disgusting,” or “Most people with HIV are rejected.”
The data showed policymakers that to curb the epidemic, they needed to address underlying problems that people with HIV faced. Federal funds began to flow to grassroots groups embedded in marginalized communities.
Public health researchers folded Black churches into the effort, recognizing them as hubs of volunteerism and as leaders of social movements. Although churches in the U.S. had historically fueled stigma against sexually transmitted diseases, Amy Nunn, a public health researcher at Brown University, said every pastor she talked with was eager to help. It paid off. In Kansas City, for example, researchers found that congregants who went to Black churches involved in HIV education and outreach were more than twice as likely to be tested.
Community-based interventions worked: New HIV infections dropped by 12% from 2018 to 2022.
Now the grassroots groups that have been so effective are in jeopardy and the in-depth surveys have halted as the Trump administration cuts funds and lays off CDC staff. Some health departments have issued stop-work orders to community-based groups that test people for HIV and connect them to treatment because federal HIV grants are unusually delayed. And as the Department of Health and Human Services continues to cancel HIV grants, the directors of grassroots groups anticipate more cuts.
“A lot of them are new and don’t have the resources to survive a year without funding,” said Masen Davis, executive director of Funders Concerned About AIDS.
One such group is Sturdevant’s.

‘Trust the process?’
In 2017, Sturdevant returned home to the Mississippi Delta to launch a nonprofit, Community Health PIER, in one of the poorest and most medically underserved parts of the country. The average life expectancy in the Delta is 68, a decade shorter than the national average. The disenfranchisement of its majority-Black population stems from the region’s history, in which policies concentrated wealth and power among the minority-white population during the era of cotton sharecropping, Jim Crow laws and segregation, and, recently, due to gerrymandering.
 
Sturdevant set up shop in Greenville, near a Black church that served as a headquarters for civil rights activists in the 1960s. In a small office, his team organizes health events, tests people for HIV, and connects those who test positive with treatment and housing assistance, funded through federal programs like Ryan White.
“Whites have been getting Ryan White and other programs for years and living healthy,” said Ashley Richardson, administrative assistant of Sturdevant’s group. “Around here, Black people are just now getting to the point where we know there are resources to help.”
Lately the team fields calls from people with HIV who are terrified they will lose their lifesaving drugs and housing if government programs no longer help with the cost.
Sturdevant worries about keeping his staff employed and his community safe. On the drive home from the April event in Washington, he drearily recounted conversations with Republicans in Congress: “They basically all said trust the process.”
The heads of national HIV organizations have stepped up their advocacy, asking Congress to oppose cuts in President Donald Trump’s budget request, said Gregorio Millett, director of public policy at the Foundation for AIDS Research, a nonprofit known as amfAR.
Emily Hilliard, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, responded to queries from KFF Health News by writing, “Critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue under the Administration for a Healthy America.” Yet the administration’s proposed budget for HIV prevention represents a 78% reduction compared with fiscal year 2025, according to a KFF analysis.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fostered skepticism  about scientific facts concerning HIV, without citing evidence. “Any questioning of the orthodoxy that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS remains an unforgivable-even dangerous-heresy among our reigning medical cartel,” he wrote in a 2021 book.
Not bowing to barriers
Researchers and HIV advocates are hashing out strategies to fill in the vacuum in HIV care that the government is poised to leave. For decades, it has driven priorities, coordinated a constellation of HIV groups, and tracked the epidemic. Leisha McKinley-Beach, CEO of a training institute, Black Public Health Academy, in Atlanta, said people must remember that wasn’t always the case.
“This massive industry we have today was created by committed individuals at the grassroots level, who were going to help people live with HIV or die with dignity, by any means necessary,” she said.
One idea is to have larger, established HIV organizations partner with nascent groups in underserved regions. The bigger ones stand a better chance of garnering significant private donations. And by taking on the fiscal management of grants, large groups could enable small ones to devote time to service rather than fundraising, McKinley-Beach said.
Another strategy, said Kathy Garner, executive director of Mississippi’s AIDS Services Coalition, is to fill gaps by coordinating with churches and nonprofits dedicated to food assistance, housing, or mental health.
“One of the solutions is going to be civil society stepping up,” Garner said. “That’s an old term for people taking care of each other, outside of the government.”
 
“We’re going to need to ramp up our services in all kinds of ways, and health and HIV will be a part of that,” said Bishop Ronnie Crudup of New Horizon Church International in Jackson, and a member of Mississippi Faith in Action, a coalition of African American churches involved in HIV.
“I have real concerns with what the Trump administration is doing, and how it will play out for the health of people in a poor state,” he said.
National groups, such as AIDS United, have been speaking with corporate funders and philanthropies about building a pooled fund to help sustain HIV organizations across the U.S.
Philanthropy for HIV has never come close to matching federal dollars, however. Non-governmental funders put $284 million toward HIV in the U.S. in 2023, compared with about $16 billion in annual federal funds for HIV in recent years.
“The truth is there is no way for philanthropy to make up for the cuts from the federal government,” Davis said. “I suspect we will see new infections rise within 18 months, which is heartbreaking.”
Sturdevant focuses on survival, not forecasts. “This isn’t going to be easy,” he said, “but we need to keep fighting for those who don’t have the fight in them.”

Retail fireworks sales started Tuesday ahead of Independence Day (July 4), with sales able to continue through July 5 on a July license, according to state law. The same law required such seasonal retail license applications — now $100 per stand, instead of $25 — to be received no later than June 9.

  State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, who led the proposed fee increases through Legislative Bill 434 this year at the request of the State Fire Marshal’s Office, said this spring that the fees were a “critical need that has been overlooked for far too long.”
Wordekemper said, for instance, that some of the fire marshal’s state fees had not been changed since the 1980s or 1990s. The increases, he said, still wouldn’t keep up with the actual costs of such services.
“These fee increases are not taken lightly, but they are necessary to ensure the continued operation of vital safety services that protect our communities, schools, hospitals and businesses,” Wordekemper said in April.
State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha, vice chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, gave Wordekemper’s bill a boost on the floor saying that the alternative would be more funds from the state’s main pocketbook, fueled by sales and income taxes. She said the fee increases would not touch family homes.
Armendariz noted there is some “sticker shock” to some of the increases, but she and Wordekemper said that might not have been the case if the fees were more regularly updated.

In the process, however, they also waded into a latent dispute between local leaders in the capital city and the state’s rural northwestern hills, as well as two rival companies competing for rights to haul the trash produced by thousands of Connecticut residents.
The ramifications of that action — which passed with little note or fanfare at the time — have played out over the past week in a boardroom a few miles away from the ornate state Capitol Building.
In early June, as part of their latest two-year budget package, lawmakers voted to formally transfer ownership of the former Materials Innovation Recycling Authority, or MIRA, plant in Hartford’s South Meadows neighborhood to the Capital Region Development Authority, a quasi-public state agency that has overseen the redevelopment of other downtown projects and the management of two sports facilities, the XL Center and Rentschler Field.
During its final few decades as a waste-to-energy plant, the MIRA facility burned upwards of 700,000 tons of trash a year from residents in the Greater Hartford area and beyond. Before that it burned petroleum — and earlier, coal — to produce power.
As of now, neither the city nor the state have firm plans for the site, which exists on 80 acres along the Connecticut River. Officials, however, say their options include a mix of industrial, commercial or, if enough money is made available, residential uses.
“What is pretty clear is it’s not going to be a power plant,” said Michael Freimuth, the executive director of CRDA. “From there it’s pretty open.”
As part of the transfer, CRDA will inherit up to $47 million in reserves from the plant’s current owner, the MIRA Dissolution Authority, that was established in 2023 to wind down operations at South Meadows and other facilities operated by its predecessor. 
Those funds will be held in a separate account controlled by CRDA and used exclusively for the maintenance, cleanup and potential demolition of the power plant site, according to the legislation. Two full-time engineers currently employed at the site will also be hired CRDA as part of the move.
The MIRA Dissolution Authority itself will cease to exist as of midnight on July 1. As a result, its board has been involved in flurry of meetings at its office in the South Meadows regarding the remaining funds along with services at its two regional transfer stations.
“This site has for over a century, been a sort of dumping ground for the broader region,” said Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam. “Even in kind of industrial times, in the 19th Century, ships, commercial ships, would dump stuff in on that site.”
The result of that history, the mayor said, is a level environmental contamination that is sure to complicate any efforts to redevelop the property. For generations, children who grew up adjacent to the plant’s fuming smokestacks have reported higher rates of asthma.
“Now that it’s been shut down, we’re going to be left trying to figure out what will happen next,” Arulampalam said.
‘Immaculate Amendment’
Apart from the former waste-to-energy facility in Hartford, the MIRA Dissolution Authority also owns and operates a transfer station in Torrington as well as buildings and equipment at the town of Essex’s transfer station.
Determining the future of those two those stations — which collectively serve 23 mostly-smaller towns, and handle roughly 63,000 tons of trash annually — has been part of the authority’s work for the past two years. For Essex, a relatively straightforward plan was approved this week to transfer the remainder of MIRA’s property to the town, which will operate the plant under an existing contract with CWPM Waste Management.
In Torrington, however, dueling proposals to either sell the transfer station or keep it operating as a public facility have split local leaders in Hartford and the state’s Northwest Corner.
Under a so-called “private option,” the transfer station would be leased or sold to an Enfield company, USA Waste and Recycling, for $3.25 million. That money, in turn, would have been added to the reserves available to remediate the site of MIRA’s shuttered waste-to-energy plant in Hartford.
But several towns in that area have expressed concerns about rising tipping fees and USA Waste’s growing presence in the local trash-hauling industry. That’s led some local leaders to propose creating their own regional waste authority to take over the transfer station — the alternative “public option.”
During meeting in May, several members of the MIRA Dissolution Authority said that while they support the desire for the public option, getting such a regional authority up and running would have required an estimated $4.4 million in subsidies from MIRA’s remaining reserves.
As a result, the board voted to support selling the transfer station, pending a final round of negotiations with USA Waste and Recycling.
Then, a few weeks later amid the frenetic rush to wrap-up this year’s legislative session, an amendment was added to the state’s sprawling budget bill that transferred the Torrington station’s operating permit to the towns’ newly-created Northwest Resource Recovery Authority — throwing a wrench into MIRA Dissolution Authority’s plan to sell the facility.
In addition to the Torrington transfer station, the amendment also added language directing the commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to issue a temporary operating permit to the owner of a transfer station in Wallingford. 
Multiple lawmakers — including leaders of all four legislative caucuses — told the Connecticut Mirror this week they were unaware of the exact origins of the permit language, which will go into effect when once Gov. Ned Lamont signs the budget into law as expected.
“I call it the immaculate amendment,” said Bert Hunter, the chair of MIRA Dissolution Authority’s board of directors.
On Friday, however, the provenance of that amendment became clearer when Joseph Mazzarella, a lawyer and partner at McCarter & English, said he wrote letters seeking its inclusion to Courtney Cullinan and Franklin Perry, the chiefs of staff, respectively, for the Senate and House Democratic majorities.
Mazzarella said he was acting on behalf of a client, Richard Antonucci Jr. of waste services operator Country Holdings LLC., who he said has been fighting to establish a presence in the region’s trash disposal and recycling business in competition with USA Waste and its affiliates. Mazzarella acknowleged that the language was intended to block the sale of the Torrington transfer station to his client’s rival, which he said would have resulted in the further consolidation of the trash business.
“How can that be good?” Mazzarella said.
McCarter & English also employs the Senate Democrats former chief of staff, Vincent Mauro, as a government affairs adviser. He referred questions to Mazzarella.
Prior to speaking to Mazzarella, CT Mirror asked Senate Democrats’ chief of staff Cullinan about the language that was inserted into the budget. “I heard about it, but I am not necessarily familiar with it,” she said, and promised to look into the matter.
Later, CT Mirror reached out again to Cullinan again to ask about the letters Mazzarella said he sent her. Cullinan responded in a text offering to share a copy of the letter, but did not say whether she took any action in response to it.
Perry, the House Democrats’ chief of staff, did not respond to a request for comment.
In addition to its interest in the Torrington facility, Mazzarella said Country Holdings purchased a site in Wallingford that once housed a trash incinerator — and later, a transfer station — which had accumulated waste under the control of a previous operator, drawing a notice of violation by DEEP. 
The language inserted in the budget restored the Wallingford facility’s operating permit to Country Holdings — further easing the company’s attempts to establish a regional presence in recycling and waste disposal.
Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, a long-serving lawmaker and environmentalist, said Friday she was uncertain if the end result of the maneuver ultimately would be deemed good public policy. “Too soon to tell. I put a call into DEEP to see what they think as regulators,” Mushinsky said.
But she had no qualms in criticizing the method employed.
“They snuck it in. We only get a couple of hours” to review the final budget document, she said. “Sometimes people sneak things in at the last minute, and that’s what happened here.”
In a statement Friday evening, DEEP spokesman James Fowler said the agency neither negotiated nor reviewed the language prior to its inclusion in the budget. He added that the agency is working with the Department of Administrative Services to “facilitate the continued operation” of the Torrington facility, while reviewing the language involving the Wallingford facility with the offices of the governor and the attorney general.
The move also frustrated officials in Hartford, including Arulampalam, who said it in effect took away the $3.25 million the sale would have generated for cleanup efforts in the city’s South Meadows neighborhood.
Hunter, meanwhile, said the MIRA Dissolution Authority board had examined a number of pathways to move forward with either the public or private option following the legislature’s action. But due to the legal complexities and sudden costs involved, the board on Thursday decided to take no action on either proposal.
As a result, the Torrington transfer station will automatically revert to the state’s Department of Administrative Services on July 1. Its continued operations will be left up to the agency, leaving the door open for Country Holdings to bid for any future contracts.
“We didn’t take a vote. We just had a sense that we just couldn’t, we couldn’t get there,” Hunter said. “There was just not it wasn’t enough support [for either proposal]”
The shift is not expected to impact trash-hauling operations for the time being, Hunter said. A spokesman for DAS said Friday that the state’s “commitment is to ensure secure and efficient continuity of all operations, including the Torrington transfer station, in accordance with all statutes and regulations. We continue to work closely with DEEP and other partners and contractors to meet that commitment.” 
The chief executive of USA Waste and Recycling did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. But the company’s attorney, Ed Spinella, ripped into lawmakers’ “rat amendment” during a meeting of the MIRA Dissolution Authority’s board on June 18.
“We were going to buy the [Torrington] facility regardless of whether or not it had a permit,” Spinella said, promising to hold the board to its earlier vote supporting the private option. “It’s an enforceable vote, and I guarantee you I’m going to make in enforceable.”
Neither the leader of the Northwest Hills Council of Governments, Robert Phillips, or Torrington Mayor Elinor Carbone responded to requests for comment on Friday.
Cleaning up
The MIRA plant was originally built in the 1920s to provide power to the growing city of Hartford. Later, in the 1980s, it was reconfigured to offer a solution to another one of the state’s vexing problems: trash piling up in stinking, unsightly landfills. By the late 2010s, however, the age of the facility and competition with cheaper power sources made it uneconomical to run. Operations at the plant finally ceased on July 19, 2022.
Since then, the MIRA Dissolution Authority has worked with DEEP to remediate the property to an industrial or commercial standard, according to Hunter. Contaminants on the site include asbestos, lead paint and chemicals known as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.
Any future development plans that involve tearing down the hulking former power plant, or digging up contaminated soils to build the foundation for new buildings, are expected to drive up the cost of that remediation, officials say. 
Freimuth, the director of CRDA, compared the task to one undertaken by the authority’s predecessor in the mid-2000s to redevelop a section of Hartford now known as Adriaen’s Landing, home to a hotel, convention center and the Connecticut Science Center.
“This area that I’m sitting in right now [was] very similar in characteristics to what the South Meadows looks like: an energy area, tank farms, coal slurry, you know, all kinds of stuff,” Freimuth said. “The logic was: this is very similar to the tasks and the process, so let’s use the agency that did it once before.”
In March, the MIRA Dissolution Authority released a 1,535-page report on the potential for future development at the South Meadows site. That report estimated that demolition and cleanup of the site would cost between $48 million and $334 million, with the highest estimates associated with plans that included multifamily housing.
Due to those likely costs, some local leaders have said plans should instead focus on industrial and commercial uses that have long found a home in the South Meadows.
“It’s probably too expensive to be residential,” said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford. “It’s probably going to be a long haul.” 
Mayor Arulampalam, however said he wanted planners to look at creative solutions — such as capping the most polluted sections of the property with parking lots, while leaving others open to more expansive development — which could keep costs down.
“Are there open-space uses for parts of the property?” Arulampalam said. “Is there some mixture of commercial and residential that could kind of work in tandem, and based on the physical design features, maybe help mitigate some of the larger costs of remediation?”
Adding to the complexity of redeveloping the site is its location adjacent to the Hartford-Brainard Airport, which mostly serves smaller, civil aircraft. The legislation transferring ownership of the plant to CRDA prohibits the authority from taking any action that would conflict with federal laws or regulations concerning the airport.
“Realistically, you’ve got height restrictions and things of that nature, that you have to accommodate for,” Freimuth said, adding that it would likely be another three to five years before actual development could begin on the property. 
While Arulampalam said he was disappointed by lawmakers’ decision to block the sale of the Torrington property, he said he was supportive of the broader decision to endow CRDA with a $47 million to move forward with the long-awaited cleanup of the MIRA plant.
“In many ways, in a small snapshot, you could focus on the $3.25 million that city lost out on, and it feels frustrating to me as mayor to have had that happen,” Arulampalam said. 
But, he added, “This story has played out in numerous places like Hartford across the country, and typically there isn’t any effort to remedy the wrongs of the past.
“I think this is a real win for environmental justice. I think it’s a real win for some form of repairing this massive environmental contaminant that the city of Hartford has had to bear the brunt of for the region for far too long. It’s not a full victory, but it is more of a victory than cities like us usually get,” Arulampalam said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MIRA-DISSOLUTION-0630-DE-108-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 06:58:41.726367

A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon attend an event for the Make America Healthy Again Commission report in the East Room of the White House on May 22, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Our nation’s founders embraced equality as a guiding principle in the Declaration of Independence with these words: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights.”
Abraham Lincoln gave meaning to the founders’ words while on the campaign trail in 1857; he countered the infamous Dred Scott decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court declared that persons imported from Africa, whether free or enslaved, were not American citizens.
Lincoln responded that the nation’s founders saw equality as an aspiration of American democracy:
“They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society … constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere.”
Critical steps in removing barriers to equality would be taken through constitutional change only after a bitterly fought Civil War. Three post-war amendments sought to make people of color in the US more equal, specifically:

The 13th Amendment (1865) abolishing slavery;
the 14th Amendment (1868) providing that all persons born or naturalized in the US, including formerly enslaved persons, are citizens and are guaranteed equal protection under the law; and
the 15th Amendment (1870) specifying that US citizens shall not be denied the right to vote on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.

Major steps toward advancing equality were taken in the 20th century through Social Security (1935), Medicare (1965) and Medicaid (1965).
The Social Security Act equalizes access to income support for seniors, the unemployed, families with dependent children and people with disabilities. Seventy-million Americans rely on Social Security benefits each month, and nearly 590,000 Kansans receive monthly benefits through social security.
Medicare equalizes access to health care primarily for seniors and disabled persons, and Medicaid equalizes access to health care for poor and disabled persons. Seventy-million Americans are now enrolled in Medicare, and 70 million Americans are covered by Medicaid. More than 570,000 Kansans are enrolled in Medicare, and more than 350,000 Kansans are covered by Medicaid.
The nation has made historic commitments to equalize access to civil rights, specifically through:

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which guarantees access to public accommodations, education and employment for those discriminated against as a result of race, color, religion, sex or national origin;
The Voting Rights Act of 1965, which assures access to the ballot box for those denied access as a result of race or color; and
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which provides access to employment, public accommodations, transportation and telecommunications for persons with disabilities.

President Donald Trump has declared war on equality as an aspiration for American democracy. He has twisted civil rights protections inside out: from safeguards intended to uphold the rights of people of color, women, and disabled persons to a protection for white men.
Trump has ordered that:

Initiatives in diversity, equity, and inclusion are illegal and immoral and should be terminated both within and outside of government;
Evidence of inequalities in the form of “disparate impact” be banned from use in determining discrimination against minority groups and people of color;
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission stop assisting state and local civil rights offices from investigating discrimination based on disparate impact; and
The Department of Justice “modify, rescind, or move to conclude” consent decrees or agreements designed to eliminate racial discrimination in local police departments and as a result such measures were subsequently abandoned.

Trump appointees have turned civil rights offices in departments of Justice, Education, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission away from addressing claims of discrimination by people of color and women toward complaints against measures that advance diversity, equity, and inclusion for such groups. They have also used federal grants and contracts as leverage to force schools, colleges and universities to abandon initiatives related to diversity, equity and inclusion, whether federally funded or not, and terminate grants or contracts concerned with equity.
In Trump’s world, even the celebration of achievement of those from marginalized groups is viewed as diminishing white people.
Our nation’s drive for equality over two and a half centuries now permeates our government and institutions throughout society. Trump acts out of ignorance against our determination and may temporarily disrupt progress. I remain confident, however, that he can never bend the arc of history away from our aspiration for equality.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trumprfkmcmahon-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-28 05:00:27.822190

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Budget panels in both chambers of the Legislature in late-night votes Friday approved an annual spending bill that Senate Democrats have said will cost $58.8 billion.
Legislators’ proposal spends more than the plan Gov. Phil Murphy unveiled in late February, leaves the state with a surplus too small to meet a statutory requirement for a new tax relief program, and expands New Jersey’s deficit to $1.5 billion (Murphy proposed $1.2 billion).
If the budget stands at $58.8 billion, it would amount to the highest level in state history. The full Legislature is expected to give the plan a final vote on Monday. The next fiscal year begins Tuesday.
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) on Friday read aloud a statement from an absent Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate’s budget chair.
“This is a budget that will help move New Jersey forward in the face of difficult fiscal conditions and severe economic uncertainty. We are making the best use of resources to address the priority needs of the state’s residents in a fiscally responsible way,” the statement read. 
On net, lawmakers’ changes to Murphy’s proposed budget add $728 million in spending beyond what the governor sought, and while the total effect of their revenue raisers was not immediately clear, the state appears poised to take in less money from recurring revenue than under the governor’s proposal.
Republican officials, in what has become a yearly rejoinder, criticized the late-night budget votes, which were held before bill text was available to the public. Members of the press received copies of the spending bill at 8:37 p.m. Friday, but the bills were not posted online Friday.
“It’s the complete opposite of what good government looks like,” said Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris). “Their rushed, opaque budget charade is exactly why New Jersey is in the fiscal mess we’ve found ourselves in. There’s no accountability, no planning, and absolutely no transparency, just last-minute deals and political favors pushed through in the dead of night when no one is looking.”
 Sen. Anthony Bucco criticized legislative leaders for delaying a vote on the annual budget until late Friday. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Friday’s vote by the Senate’s budget committee capped an unusual process that began when the panel met on Thursday but ended its meeting without a vote on the budget. Instead of adjourning, the committee took a 24-hour-long recess that allowed members who would not be present Friday, like Sarlo, to record their votes early on a budget bill that did not yet exist.
Witnesses and lawmakers praised the budget’s full $7.2 billion pension payment, and the more than $12 billion it sets aside for formulaic school aid. However, some expressed concern that the state would still spend more than it brings in.
“I appreciate the responsible side of this budget where it’s full pension payment, it’s a full school aid payment, a healthier surplus than we’re used to, but there’s no signs of the structural reforms we truly need to give our next governor a healthier budget,” said Chris Emigholz, chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), her chamber’s budget chair, said the state’s next governor, who will take office in January, would need to determine whether some programs should be jettisoned. Murphy is barred from seeking a third term in November.
“Whoever comes in, I think that there’s going to be some decisions that are going to have to be made. I think whether it’s a Republican or a Democrat, they’re going to have to take a look at especially some of the senior proposals just to see what we can do,” she said.
Much of the new spending comes from legislative add-ons — variably called district spending, Christmas tree items, or simply “pork.”
Those items are numerous and varied, and their costs total in the hundreds of millions. They include millions in capital funding to individual school districts, like the $21 million Newark schools will receive, or for local infrastructure projects, like $8 million set aside for roadway improvements in Camden.
Other changes would undo cuts to college financial assistance for students and reverse a $20 million cut Murphy proposed to community colleges’ operating aid. Those cuts had rankled lawmakers and spurred alarm from university leaders.
The budget would pull an additional $70 million from the state’s clean energy fund to pay for salaries at NJ Transit, plus an additional $50 million to underwrite more general state spending. NJ Transit was already set to receive a separate $70.1 million from the fund as part of an annual diversion.
The bill assumes the state will find $100 million in savings on state employees’ health care benefits in the first six months of 2026, though it provides no suggestion for how officials realize such savings. Instead, it asks state and public employee representatives to each submit their own plans.
The boosted spending would take the state’s surplus to $6.7 billion, according to budget documents that had not undergone technical review by the Office of Legislative Services.
Lawmakers augmented reserves by increasing a diversion from a debt defeasance fund — which is meant to reduce debt payments by immediately paying debt down or avoiding it altogether — to $555 million, from $250 million.
The proposed level of surplus should trigger a statutory provision to pause payments from Stay NJ, a nascent property tax relief program that promises to cut seniors’ property tax bills in half. The provision is intended to halt the program if the state doesn’t have enough money to pay for it, but lawmakers have previously overwritten it.
The budget includes a range of new or increased taxes, including a hike to rates paid on cigarettes, electronic cigarette fluid, high-dollar property sales, and casinos’ online wagering wins.
Lawmakers followed Murphy’s lead on nicotine taxes, exactly matching proposals he made in his budget message, but approved lower tax rates for casinos’ online wagering wins than the governor had sought. Those rates rise to 19.75% in lawmakers’ budget plan, rather than the 25% Murphy pitched.
Legislators made broader changes to a surcharge on realty transfers of more than $1 million.
Rather than doubling that tax rate to 2% and imposing a 3% rate on property sales worth more than $2 million, legislators voted to raise rates to 2% for sales worth between $2 million and $2.5 million and increase them by an additional half percentage point for every $500,000 in additional value, to a cap of 3.5% at $3.5 million.
Their proposal also calls for property sellers, rather than buyers, to pay the fee, a change that would decrease upfront costs for those buying buildings worth at least $1 million and reduce the profits from such property sales.
Legislators eschewed some taxes sought by Murphy. They skipped a proposed 10% hike to the state’s alcoholic beverage tax that was forecast to boost collections by $18.5 million. They also declined to enact a per-truck warehousing fee estimated to generate $20 million in revenue.
A degree of uncertainty remains around the budget. GOP lawmakers in Washington, D.C., are exploring broad changes to federal programs that could pull billions in federal Medicaid funding, among other things, from New Jersey.
“In many ways, this budget may be a hypothetical document,” said Peter Chen, senior policy analyst at progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. “When those cuts start coming, we’ll have to come up with the revenue somewhere. Otherwise, we will face devastating cuts to many of the programs that we all hold dear.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/0JS11345_1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-28 02:59:59.733848

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A Friday ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, coupled with an executive order by President Donald Trump, has created doubt about the future of American citizenship for Alaskans who are the children of immigrants.
In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled that U.S. District Court judges cannot issue nationwide preliminary injunctions.
In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring that the federal government would end birthright citizenship — the awarding of American citizenship to every person born in the United States — for the children of non-citizen immigrants. 
The new Supreme Court decision has significant implications for Alaska in particular, because it is not among the states that have legal challenges against Trump’s executive order.
Since 1898, the Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted by courts as offering birthright citizenship to the children of all American residents, regardless of immigration status. 
Trump’s order would change the federal government’s interpretation. It declares that citizenship would be limited to the children of citizens and lawful permanent residents, which would exclude refugees, and other people in the United States temporarily, as well as undocumented immigrants.
That change has been blocked nationwide since January by numerous district court judges.
Friday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court means that those judges can no longer block the order nationwide; they can only block it in states whose district courts are considering lawsuits that challenge the Trump order.
As of Friday, 22 states have legal challenges against the Trump order. 
Twenty-eight states, including Alaska, have not. In those states, the Trump administration can start, in 30 days, to begin implementing the executive order, the court said.
The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the Trump administration’s executive order, which could be overturned at a later date.
Neither the office of Gov. Mike Dunleavy nor Attorney General Treg Taylor answered emailed questions asking whether they intend to file a lawsuit in order to protect newborn Alaskans’ citizenship.
Mara Kimmel, the executive director of the Alaska chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said by email that her organization “anticipates this decision could have devastating impacts in Alaska and we are monitoring this very closely as we determine a path forward to protect Alaskan families.”
Meghan Barker, communications and engagement director for the ACLU of Alaska, said that the ACLU nationally has already filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to represent people nationwide, including Alaskans.
“We’re closely following the situation and litigation to ensure that no Alaskans lose their citizenship,” she said.

MCSO is currently exploring an agreement with Biometrica, a data company that provides facial recognition technology to local police departments. 
“Facial recognition technology has been proven to disproportionately affect communities of color and young women,” said Sup. Juan Miguel Martinez. “The more facial recognition technology, the more people are able to criminalize people executing their First Amendment rights. I feel this is an issue not left or right.” Miguel Martinez also expressed concerns about the use of facial recognition technology to aid immigration enforcement or to surveil protests. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Privacy concerns have been heightened during the Trump administration’s surge in immigration enforcement and crackdowns on dissent. In Milwaukee, several people were arrested by federal agents after attending regular hearings at the county courthouse. In April, Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and accused of obstructing federal agents after she directed a man sought by immigration officers out a side door in her courtroom that led into a public hallway. 
MCSO leaders said they aim to use the technology to identify people after violent crime incidents. 
Nevertheless, members of the public and some elected officials raised concerns about the technology.  The resolution contains language stating  that facial recognition technology can be inaccurate and could negatively affect certain groups including people of color, LGBTQ people, activists, immigrants and people seeking reproductive health care. 
The resolution states that the county board supports pausing any future acquisition of facial recognition until regulatory policies can be developed. It also calls on the county’s Information Management Services Division, Corporation Council and MCSO to collaborate with “relevant stakeholders” including privacy and free speech advocates, in developing that policy framework. Out of this collaborative effort will eventually emerge recommendations to the county board as to whether facial recognition technology:

Should be prohibited or strictly limited without the informed knowledge and consent of the individual being scanned, except under narrowly defined circumstances, such as during active criminal investigations, 
Whether the types of data collected by the technology should be defined and limited, as well as strict retention periods for data, 
Prohibit facial recognition data from being shared with third parties, unless authorized through a rigorous, transparent approval process which itself would be subject to oversight, 
And whether departments using facial recognition should be required to submit annual reports detailing its use, including metrics of deployment, effectiveness, and analysis on the impact on communities of color, immigrants and other vulnerable groups.  

The resolution passed by the county board calls for a final recommendation to be established no later than May 2026. By December 2025 the county board expects a status update, according to the resolution.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon appears poised to leave Congress in early 2027. 
One House Republican strategist who works on campaigns across the country said Bacon was not running for reelection and that he had already telegraphed what he was going to do. He spoke to the Examiner Friday on the condition that he not be named publicly, because he was not authorized to share the decision. 
“Don’t get me wrong,” the consultant said. “This seat is tougher without Bacon, but he’s not special. It can be done.” 
Five other local Republican sources familiar with Bacon’s choice confirmed that he had decided to skip the 2026 race. They echoed Friday evening reports from Washington, D.C., including from Punchbowl News. 
No immediate comment
Bacon’s campaign had no immediate comment on the reports. But people who know politics in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd District had been buzzing for days about the possibility of Bacon making a decision as soon as next week. Bacon had planned to meet with local reporters early next week. 
Part of the buzz came from a group of Nebraska Republicans waiting on Bacon’s decision, a list that local conservatives have said includes former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom and Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding, and might also include Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei. 
Bacon, in recent interviews with the Nebraska Examiner and other publications, had been hinting that he might step away, with the retired Air Force brigadier saying that he had to speak with his family and decide. Bacon’s decision would cause national political shockwaves, as Bacon represents one of a handful of true swing districts left nationally, one that is Nebraska’s most political divided and diverse. 
Diverse swing district
The 2nd District includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and a significant slice of western suburban and rural Sarpy County. The district includes the state’s largest concentration of Democrats and was redistricted to include a larger swath of Republican-leaning rural voters in Wahoo and surrounding areas. 
Neither the Nebraska Republican Party nor the National Republican Congressional Committee had any immediate comment.
“The writing has been on the wall for months,” said Madison Andrus, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of congressional Democrats. 
Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, tweeted after Punchbowl News’ Jake Sherman tweeted the news that local Democrats have been ready.
“Don Bacon and all the Republicans who give Trump cover see the writing on the wall–voters actually want politicians to focus on issues that impact our pocket books not made up culture wars,” she said. 
Candidates lining up
She touted the Democrats who have already announced, including political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell and State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha. Before word of Bacon’s future broke on Friday, a third major Democrat confirmed she is considering a bid, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades.
Powell, in a statement, thanks Bacon for his service in the military and in Congress and said it “takes courage to recognize when a fresh perspective is warranted.”
“This district is clearly ready for — and deserves — change,” Powell said.
Cavanaugh, in a statement, thanked Bacon “for his decades of service to his country” and wished him well. 
“The people of Nebraska’s 2nd District know it’s time for a change,” Cavanaugh said.
Rhoades, in a statement, said Bacon had “finally realized what has been obvious to all of us: Republicans can’t defend their record this year.” 
“Costs are going up, they’re cutting healthcare, but they’re giving tax breaks to billionaires,” Rhoades said.
Bacon has been able to fend off multiple Democratic challengers in recent years, thanks in part to the district’s slight GOP tilt. Now, it could be a mad dash for both parties toward an open seat. 
National attention
The retired Air Force brigadier general gained national attention for being one of the few Republicans to criticize President Donald Trump, though, despite Bacon’s criticism, he often ended up siding with his party as a reliable GOP vote. He survived pointed criticism from Trump and multiple attempts to recruit a GOP challenger from the president and his political team. 
Bacon most recently defeated former State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha in back-to-back elections. Before that, he defeated Omaha progressive Kara Eastman in two successive contests. And he won election in 2016 by defeating the last Democrat to hold the “blue dot” seat, the late-U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, D-Neb.
Besides the two highest-profile Democratic candidates in the race, Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis have confirmed they are running. 
Whoever emerges from the 2026 Democratic primary will have to tangle with a former gubernatorial candidate in Lindstrom, a longtime City Council member in Harding or perhaps a state officeholder on the Republican side.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report just shifted the Omaha-based House to lean Democrat from lean Republican.

Ian T. Masters, R-Berkeley, was not recently using an Instagram account responsible for an antisemitic comment. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan issued a statement Friday saying he had “definitive proof” that Del. Ian T. Masters, R-Berkeley, was not recently using an Instagram account responsible for an antisemitic comment last week. 
McGeehan did not respond to an emailed request to provide that evidence and could not be reached by phone Friday.
In his statement, McGeehan said Masters provided him with a screenshot of the account that showed “irregular activity.” That screenshot was not included in the release and he did not explain specifically what it showed.
McGeehan also claimed that the person who did make the comment from the profile @NoQuarterMasters — which bore Masters’ full name, a link to an organization he ran for about 10 years and a profile picture with a letter addressed to “Ian” surrounded by symbols associated with neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideals — has been identified. 
The responsible person, according to McGeehan, was “someone with no current relation to [Masters] and his district, or anyone else in the WV Republican Party.” He offered no other details.
In his comments Friday, McGeehan called out Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin and Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia — the only two Jewish members of the state Legislature — by name, saying they were “not interested in the truth” about who really left the antisemitic comment.
“They make these deceptive accusations because they desire power and social status at the expense of others,” McGeehan wrote. 
Earlier this week, Pushkin called on Gov. Patrick Morrisey to “show moral leadership” and ask for Masters’ resignation unless evidence could be provided showing definitively that he did not make the comment. The state Democratic Party also urged House Speaker Roger Hanshaw in a letter to “take swift action” against Masters and fully investigate the incident.
On Friday, Pushkin released another statement that questioned why McGeehan did not release the proof. 
“If the responsible party has been ‘identified,’ why has no name been released and no explanation given as to how that determination was made?” Pushkin asked. “Until that happens — and unless that evidence is presented clearly and publicly — McGeehan’s statements amount to little more than a dog whistle meant to distract from serious concerns about antisemitism and white supremacy by a member of the House of Delegates.”
The Instagram account @NoQuarterMasters left the antisemitic comment on a months-old Instagram post about Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy on June 21. The comment said “[Portnoy is] not white. He’s a Jew. We never claimed them. That’s why he’s short tiny and weak.”
  A screenshot taken Monday of the comment left by @NoQuarterMasters three days ago in response to another user’s 10-weeks-old comment on a video about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports. Del. Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, denies leaving the comment.
West Virginia Watch first reported the comment and the links between Masters and the profile that left it on Tuesday. In an interview that day, Masters said he did not have “any active Instagram account” and was not responsible for the comment.
House Speaker Roger Hanshaw told MetroNews Talkline on Wednesday that Masters told him he was “previously affiliated” with the @NoQuarterMasters account but wasn’t anymore and denied “having connection” to the antisemitic comment. 
“He was surprised to see it,” Hanshaw said. “When [Masters] and I spoke earlier [Wednesday], he indicated that he could not actually log into the account when he tried to do so because, apparently, the password had been changed and he had to seek technical assistance to even be able to reset a password.”
The last two digits of the phone number used for password recovery on the account were the same as on Masters’ personal cell phone on Tuesday.
During his interview with West Virginia Watch, Masters did not acknowledge any familiarity with the account’s handle or any previous affiliation with it. 
In 2023, multiple Instagram posts from the West Virginia Citizens Defense League — where Masters served as president from 2015 to 2025 — showed captions signed off by “Ian T. Masters, Esq.” and @NoQuarterMasters tagged in photos alongside accounts with the same names of other officers for the organization.
Several photos on his wife’s public Instagram from 2021-23 show photos of Masters tagged as @NoQuarterMasters. 
  Del. Ian T. Masters was tagged in photos as @noquartermasters on his wife’s Instagram account.
Before speaking to West Virginia Watch on Tuesday, the name on the account — separate from the handle — read “Ian T. Masters” and a link to the Citizens Defense League’s website was included in the bio. After the interview but before the story was published that day, the account’s name changed to “I. Masters” and the link was removed. By Tuesday night, the name was changed back to “Ian T. Masters.”
On Tuesday morning, the @NoQuarterMasters profile, which is private, was shown to have 1,498 posts and 367 followers. By 11:30 p.m. Tuesday, the number of posts had dropped to 1,368 — meaning more than 100 posts were deleted — and the follower count dropped to 276. As of Friday afternoon, the account only showed 39 followers.
  Between Tuesday and Friday, Masters’ number of photos decreased by about 100, and his follower count went from 367 to 39.
On Wednesday, the state Democratic Party called on Hanshaw to conduct a “legitimate investigation” into the comment and Masters’ links to the account — including the profile picture that shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in Chester, West Virginia. Per reporting by West Virginia Public Broadcasting, Masters’ LinkedIn says he worked in Chester from 2016-19. 
The letter is partially covered up by runes burnt into wooden pendants hanging from strings. The runes include several symbols listed by the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy organization dedicated to stopping anti-semitism across the world, as antisemitic symbols used by groups and individuals espousing white supremacist, neo-Nazi and antisemitic ideals. 
  A screenshot of the profile picture used on the @NoQuarterMasters Instagram account shows a letter addressed to “Ian” in West Virginia and several runes described by the Anti-Defamation League as being associated antisemitic views and groups.
“Keep in mind that Delegate Masters’ Instagram account didn’t just post an antisemitic statement. It also has white supremacist, neo-Nazi, and antisemitic symbols,” Hansen said in a statement Friday.  “Legislative leadership should condemn these actions. And they should perform a full investigation with findings released to the public, rather than trying to turn this into a partisan issue.”
Pushkin earlier this week outlined specific steps that state Democrats say Hanshaw should take to clear Masters’ name, including: performing a “full forensic investigation” of Masters’ devices, social media accounts and email; seeking an explanation of the account’s profile picture and the symbols within it as well as how the name and bio on the account were changed after his interview with West Virginia Watch.
“[G]iven the gravity of what’s alleged, an investigation cannot simply mean asking the Delegate, ‘Did you do it?’ and taking ‘No’ for an answer. We need to get to the truth,” Pushkin said. “West Virginians deserve to know whether an individual chosen to serve in the House of Delegates has used his platform to promote hate, bigotry, and extremism.”
McGeehan on Friday called Pushkin a “professional victim” who was trying to “manipulate” the situation as state Democrats are currently in litigation regarding Masters’ House seat.
Masters was appointed to the House by Gov. Patrick Morrisey in January after delegate-elect Joseph de Soto was accused of threatening to harm and kill lawmakers. Spokespeople for Morrisey have yet to respond to requests for comment regarding the allegations against Masters.
De Soto won the November 2024 election as a Republican but switched his party affiliation to Democratic shortly before being arrested for making terroristic threats. 
House Republicans in January voted to vacate the seat instead of expelling de Soto, saying it was the correct way to deal with the seat since de Soto was on house arrest and never sworn in. The vacate move prompted a legal challenge from the state Democratic Party, who argued that the seat should have gone to Democrats due to de Soto’s party switch.
The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled against state Democrats in one of their challenges over the seat, however other challenges are still pending.

Anthony said renewable power, coupled with battery storage, will “play an important part in power generation in the near future.” (Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)In a letter to Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation, Gov. Josh Shapiro warned there could be consequences to eliminating clean energy tax credits.
“Over $3 billion in direct investment in Pennsylvania energy projects would be undermined by H.R. 1’s tax increases,” Shapiro wrote. “That includes potential impacts to over 70 facilities that have been announced across the commonwealth, directly threatening more than 26,000 jobs by 2030 due to the effective tax hikes.”
H.R. 1, the budget bill containing many of the Trump administration’s domestic policy priorities, would eliminate a number of tax credits for renewable energy projects, many of which were created by the Democratic-led Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro warned the hardest impact would fall on those slated to open soon. In the House version, most of the clean energy tax credits would end abruptly, instead of in 2032, when they were initially set to expire.
The Senate version is slightly more lenient. Tax credits for wind and solar projects would instead be phased out, with decreasing credits for projects that break ground in 2026 and 2027.
The Senate also moved to keep certain tax credits for nuclear, hydropower, battery and geothermal projects until 2034. Shapiro applauded this change.
Still, he specifically addressed several that have already been announced, which he said could suffer under the changes. That includes two projects in Clearfield County that he noted are collectively anticipated to create more than 900 jobs.
Shapiro said the bill could also effectively end state programs designed to help community institutions lower their energy bills. He said the Solar for Schools program, for example, could potentially lose over $30 million.
The proposed budget also eliminates consumer-focused tax credits for new and used electric vehicle purchases as well as home energy efficiency and clean energy conversion projects.

Bob Ferguson vetoed its funding and the state abruptly canceled its contract. 
And a group of GOP lawmakers is urging Ferguson to find a way to keep the Kent facility operating.
For decades, the Pediatric Interim Care Center has tended to babies born to mothers with substance use disorder. Just under half of its annual $1.7 million budget has usually come from the state, said Development Director Elaine Purchase. Fundraising makes up the rest.
But this year, lawmakers slashed that funding to $100,000 in the face of a steep budget shortfall. The facility, known as PICC, was ready to make do with the deep cut and dip into its reserves, with the hope of making up for it when the Legislature returns next year. 
Then last month, Ferguson vetoed even that $100,000, as part of a slew of small items he removed to save money in the $78 billion two-year spending plan. 
And soon after, Purchase was “blindsided” when the state Department of Children, Youth and Families cut its contract with the nursery, meaning no more babies would be referred there starting July 1.
“Which basically destroys our program,” Purchase said. “Why would they abandon it for $100,000?”
In a statement, the Department of Children, Youth and Families argued the center’s state funding was “not cost-effective.” Secretary Tana Senn said the center received money for its 13 beds regardless of how many babies it was serving, and didn’t meet requirements to get Medicaid funding.
“We also want to clarify that DCYF is not shutting down the Kent PICC,” said Senn, a former state lawmaker. “They can still accept referrals from hospitals and have informed DCYF on multiple occasions that they have sufficient charitable funding to continue serving children.”
On Friday, state House Republican leadership, including Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, of Auburn, took issue with the rationale and urged the state agency and Ferguson to reverse course.
“Governor Ferguson, throughout your first legislative session as governor, you said that you just wanted to do things that are ‘common sense,’” the half-dozen lawmakers wrote. “What is more common sense than using the power you hold to save the lives of innocent newborn babies?”
The facility, open for 35 years, was caring for just one newborn Friday, said Purchase. It has been underused as the focus has shifted to keeping babies with their parents. 
Research has indicated parental involvement is integral in an infant’s development. 
“New evidence-based models demonstrate better outcomes for babies when they ‘room in’ at hospitals under the care of a physician or are in transitional care homes that allow the mother and baby to stay together,” Senn said.
“While hospitals, of course, may choose to continue to refer children to the Kent PICC, they have been doing so much less frequently as demonstrated by the current empty beds at the Kent PICC,” the agency secretary continued. “Instead, hospitals more often refer infants to other facilities that use the current standard of care.”
In 2021, the Legislature passed a measure known as the Keeping Families Together Act to help relatives take care of children who can’t stay with their parents and to reduce racial disparities in the child welfare system. Critics blame the bipartisan law for a reported increase in child deaths, including from drug exposure.
The average stay for babies at the Kent pediatric care center is 30 to 40 days. Most are exposed to fentanyl or methamphetamine. Since opening in 1990, the facility says it has cared for over 3,500 babies.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Utah News Dispatch claimed 12 awards, including four first-place wins, in this year’s Utah Headliners statewide journalism contest, which recognizes top journalism in writing and reporting, TV, radio and online news.
The highly competitive local journalism contest drew more than 1,200 entries, said Emma Penrod, president of the Utah Headliners, the state’s professional chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. 
Entries featured work published in 2024, Utah News Dispatch’s first year reporting since launching Jan. 9, 2024. The Dispatch’s four-person team competed in the large newsroom division, squaring off with the largest and longest-running news outlets in the state.
The Utah News Dispatch voter guide won the contest’s inaugural “News you can use” category, with judges saying: “An interactive, stellar example of service journalism, this piece excels in delivering practical, timely information that empowers readers to engage in the democratic process.”
Reporter Kyle Dunphey won this year’s continuing coverage award for his dogged reporting on the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which since 1990 had compensated eligible residents in Western states who were made sick by radiation from U.S. weapons testing and development in the ’50s and ’60s but lapsed last summer when Congress failed to take action to continue it.
The judges said: “While a smaller media site, the Utah News Dispatch did an exemplary job of explaining why RECA is so important and how the legislation’s future could affect so many. It was consequential and well-executed, making politics in DC a meat-and-potatoes issue for so many Utahns. Well done!”
Senior Reporter Katie McKellar claimed two first-place wins. Her profile of innovative homeless service provider Switchpoint and its accountability-focused model won the Homelessness and Housing category, and she led the Longform Storytelling entries with her heartfelt report on a Utah man’s horseback ride across the country to spotlight the crisis facing wild mustangs.
McKellar was also recognized with an honorable mention in the prestigious Best News Reporter category.

Gov. Phil Scott signed a package of changes to Vermont’s election procedures into law this week, among them an expansion of who has to file campaign finance disclosure forms and a restriction on candidates running in a general election who’ve lost a preceding primary election.
The changes are part of a bill, H.474, that nearly did not make it over the finish line this year. The House and Senate approved the bill on the final day of this year’s legislative session, June 16. Before that, though, the legislation appeared all but dead after Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, tied its political fate to an unrelated charter change proposal he was backing that sought to ban guns from bars in Burlington. 
With the charter change languishing in a key House committee, Baruth told the chair of a key Senate committee, which was reviewing the election bill, to pump the brakes — months after the election bill had already cleared the House. Two weeks later, though, following legislators’ partial recess in early June, Senate leaders brought the bill onto the floor for a vote — a decision one House leader credited, at least in part, to VTDigger’s reporting on the political dealing behind the scenes.
Senators cut a number of measures from the bill as it passed in the House, including a study of using ranked-choice voting in Vermont for future presidential primaries. The slimmed-down bill included all the “must-have” provisions identified by the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, a key backer of the legislation, according to Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, who chaired the Senate panel that reviewed the bill. 
Here are the key measures that did make it into the 30-page law, which also sets out a new reporting requirement for certain write-in candidates and updates rules on who must report on donations to campaigns, among a number of other changes.
Campaign finance disclosures
The law eliminates a measure currently on the books stating that only candidates who raise or spend $500 or more have to file campaign finance disclosure forms with the Secretary of State’s Office. Those forms allow the public to review how much candidates have raised and from whom, and how much they’ve spent and on what.
Now, anyone running for office will have to file a disclosure form — regardless of how much they raise or spend. If that amount is less than $500, they’ll have to formally attest to the state that they haven’t surpassed that ceiling. If they raise or spend more than that, the state’s existing rules requiring more detailed disclosure filings would kick in. 
Deputy Secretary of State Lauren Hibbert said her office regularly fields complaints from the public about candidates who, the complainants allege, have raised or spent more than $500 but haven’t disclosed any such information to the state. She said the office has little ability to track down potential scofflaws now, and hopes the new changes will create more accountability.
‘One bite’ candidacy
More controversial, though, was a portion of the law that now prevents a candidate who loses a primary election under the banner of one political party from running again in the general election under a different party label — or as an independent candidate.
The Secretary of State’s Office did not stake out a position for or against that change to restrict what’s often called “getting a second bite at the apple,” according to Hibbert. But while backers of the measure said it would make elections more fair, opponents said the changes were wrongly limiting the options voters could choose from on the ballot. 
On the House floor earlier this month, independent and Progressive members spoke against the change, and it drew the most debate, by far, of any section of the bill. The measure does not do away with so-called “fusion” candidates, however, which are those who get an endorsement from multiple parties on the general election ballot. 
Some senators were opposed to the “one bite” change, too. 
“I don’t think it harms anyone to allow this,” said Washington County Sen. Andrew Perchlik, who’s a Democrat/Progressive, during debate about the bill on that chamber’s floor earlier this month, before it was passed. For prospective independent candidates, specifically, “I think it’s an anti-democratic change,” he added. 
Write-in candidates
The new law also creates a requirement that write-in candidates for state and federal office in Vermont formally declare their candidacy with local or state officials. The change is designed to reduce the workload election officials have to take on, Hibbert said, especially when they’re tasked with tallying write-in votes that include what seem to be protest or joke votes for national figures or fictional characters. 
In other cases, ballots will come in with numerous different spellings of a candidate’s name, she said. Hilary Francis, the Brattleboro town clerk, told legislators earlier this year about a case where it wasn’t completely clear what member of a family local write-in votes were referring to. 
Under the new law, state and federal write-in candidates must tell either local clerks or the secretary of state about their intent to run by 5 p.m. on the Thursday before an election. When tallying up results, officials will then only count votes for candidates who met the deadline — with some exceptions, including for races in which a write-in candidate gets more votes than anyone whose name is listed on the ballot.
The goal is that officials will only have to count names of people who actually have a technical chance of getting elected to a given office, according to Hibbert. 
The bill also includes several smaller changes to how local clerks operate elections, including allowing for additional time to address issues with a person’s ballot, a process known as “curing.” 
‘Independent’ fundraisers
Another measure in the new law is meant to clarify that certain campaign finance rules apply to individuals who raise and spend money on behalf of a candidate, but who aren’t directly affiliated with that candidate. It wasn’t entirely clear in state law, according to Hibbert, that certain individual fundraisers had to follow as strict of filing guidelines as, for instance, larger political action committees, which are commonly called PACs.
Specifically, the law revises the definition of the term “independent expenditure-only political committee” to clarify that such a “committee” could include as little as one person.
Hibbert said the Secretary of State’s Office asked legislators to clarify the law after seeing Elon Musk, the billionaire and now-spurned adviser to President Donald Trump, hand out $1 million checks to Wisconsin voters in the leadup to an election for a seat on that state’s Supreme Court earlier this year. Musk was attempting to help elect a conservative judge to the court, though the candidate ultimately lost the race. 
The law also lowered, from $1,000 to $500, the threshold at which these “independent expenditure-only” committees will have to report their activities to the state. The same lowered threshold will also apply to political parties and PACs operating in the state.
Hibbert said she thinks that threshold is still high enough to avoid sweeping in people who advocate, on a very small scale, for and against issues in their communities, such as a school budget. But larger local efforts, she said, warrant greater transparency.
“The goals here were just more consistency across the board,” Hibbert said. 
Auditing voter rolls
Earlier this year, the House voted to affirm the victory of Rep. Jonathan Cooper, D-Pownal, in last fall’s contentious election in the Bennington-1 district, which includes the towns of Readsboro, Searsburg, Stamford, Woodford and a part of Pownal.
Roughly 50 people in the district received the wrong ballot in the election, and the race between Cooper and Republican Bruce Busa was decided by fewer than 30 votes, calling into question if the error influenced the result and how that should be handled.
In response to that election, legislators also added a measure into the election bill that requires local officials in places where House or Senate districts split municipal boundaries, such as in Bennington-1, to audit their voter rolls this year.
Local clerks will have to submit summaries of those audits to the Secretary of State’s Office by Nov. 15 — and the office itself must then develop a report on all those findings.
Open meeting law
Another measure in the legislation revises existing state law to “clarify,” according to Hibbert, that annual town meetings are not subject to the slate of requirements laid out in Vermont’s Open Meeting Law. While town meetings are open to all “legal voters” of a given place, Hibbert said, they aren’t — from a legal standpoint — open to the general public, which is where the distinction comes in. 
She said the clarification stemmed from some concern over towns having to provide remote access to town meeting proceedings, including remote voting options. She said that if people had concerns about public access to a town meeting, they could take them to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office or the state’s Human Rights Commission.

Free.,Democratic resolution to block military action in Iran fails to advance in US Senate,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-resolution-block-military-action-iran-fails-advance-us-senate,,"The U.S. Senate rejected Friday, 47-53, a resolution authored by Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine to block American forces from hostility against Iran.Though a shaky ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel has held this week, somewhat diminishing the urgency of the vote, proponents of the resolution made two major arguments during floor debate Friday: Congress should reassert its constitutional role as the only branch of government that can declare war and U.S. policy toward Iran should tilt more toward diplomacy.“We all agree that Iran must not obtain a nuclear weapon,” Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen said. “But bombing is not the best, most sustainable way of achieving that goal. And nothing, nothing I heard yesterday at the (classified) intelligence briefing changes that assessment. The bombing attack was also a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution, which reserves to the Congress the power to declare war.”The vote was nearly party-line, with Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman the only Democrat to vote against the measure and Rand Paul of Kentucky the only Republican in favor.Supporters argue for congressional roleU.S. forces dropped bombs on three Iranian nuclear enrichment sites June 21 amid that country’s war with Israel.President Donald Trump claimed an unqualified victory, though news reporting of intelligence assessments has shown the result was inconclusive and could have set Iran’s nuclear program back only a matter of months.Military and intelligence officers provided the classified briefing to members of Congress Thursday.Kaine, who has consistently called for presidents to win congressional authorization before taking offensive military action, said the framers of the Constitution deliberately gave the power to Congress.“War is too big an issue to leave in the hands of even a completely careful and deliberative individual,” Kaine said. “The framers didn't want to leave war in the hands of George Washington, for God's sake. They thought Congress should be involved.”Following the vote, Kaine said in a written statement he was upset with the senators who voted no.“I am disappointed that many of my colleagues are not willing to stand up and say Congress needs to be part of a decision as important as whether or not the U.S. should send our nation’s sons and daughters to fight against Iran,” he said.Paul, who has often clashed with his party on executive authority and other issues, made a constitutional argument and criticized the foreign policy that leads to active military engagement.“The American people are sick and tired of sending their children to fight and die in war zones on the other side of the world with no tangible U.S. interest at stake,” he said. “Abdicating our constitutional responsibility by allowing the executive branch to unilaterally introduce U.S. troops into wars is an affront to the Constitution and to the American people.”535 commanders in chiefOpponents of the resolution argued it would needlessly tie the president’s hands in matters of war.The process required of going through Congress to approve military action would be too long to be practical, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham said.“Just think (of) the chaos that would ensue in this country if there were not one commander-in-chief, but 535, and we had to sit down and talk among ourselves and debate as to whether or not we should go forward with the military operation in question,” he said. “That would paralyze this country.”Tennessee Republican Bill Hagerty said the operation was a success and the decision to order it was entirely within Trump’s constitutional power as commander-in-chief. Iran had been hostile to the U.S. and its ally Israel for decades, he said.“President Trump's actions last weekend did not start a war,” Haggerty said. “His actions ended a war, and not a single American life was lost. We should not be here debating how to constrain effective residential leadership, but rather discussing how to recognize effective leadership and supporting it.”Constraining a president’s power undermines the ability to use the element of surprise that is crucial to modern warfare, Hagerty added.The resolution “elevates process over common sense, policy and political optics over operational necessity,” he said.",,,,2025-06-27 20:02:04.565167

Montana’s Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen was cited this week in Belgrade for driving under the influence of alcohol.
Hedalen, serving in her first term as head of the Office of Public Instruction, has not yet appeared in Belgrade Municipal Court to enter a plea.
Lee Enterprises first reported the citation, a misdemeanor.
In a statement Friday, Hedalen, a Republican, apologized for her poor judgment.
“I apologize and take full responsibility for my lapse in judgement that led to this incident,” Hedalen said in a statement emailed from her chief of staff.
“I want to thank the Belgrade Police for their professionalism and commitment to public safety. As I move forward from this personal issue, it will in no way impact my service to the people of Montana.”
Hedalen was released from the Gallatin County Detention Center on an $885 bond on June 22, the same day she received the citation, according to the court.
A patrol officer outlined the incident that led to her arrest in an affidavit of probable cause.
Late Saturday night, Hedalen was traveling 50 mph in a 35 mph zone, “almost cut off several vehicles” in a turn, and was “slow to react” to the officer’s emergency lights, said the court record.
She had “a dazed expression,” “very slow movements,” and bloodshot eyes, the affidavit said.
“I could smell the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle,” the officer said.
Hedalen told the officer she had had “one glass of wine,” said the court record. The affidavit said Hedalen failed both a field sobriety test and a preliminary breath sample.
The legal blood alcohol content limit in Montana is 0.08 percent.
Hedalen subsequently declined to provide an Intoxilyzer breath sample and was transported to the hospital for a blood sample, according to the court record.
Results of the blood test are not yet available, according to the Belgrade Police Department.
However, the Belgrade City Attorney’s Office said results of the test would be considered part of “confidential criminal justice information” until the case concludes.
Hedalen must make an initial appearance in court within 10 days, on or before July 8, according to municipal court.
Former Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen previously pleaded guilty to a traffic violation for “following too closely,” a 2023 incident she described as a “bump with the bumper,” and no contest for illegally passing a school bus in 2022.
Arntzen led OPI for two terms, the last eight years. Hedalen won the office in November 2024 and took her oath in January 2025.
Court records in Hedalen’s case said she had no prior convictions for driving under the influence.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A group of Republican lawmakers, who have opposed carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa, penned a letter to U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst this week asking her to remove a tax credit incentivizing carbon sequestration from the budget reconciliation bill. 
“Repeal 45Q now!” the letter read, naming the section of tax code. 
The budget reconciliation bill, known as the “one big beautiful bill,” has removed or substantially altered a number of clean energy credits for things like wind power or solar projects, but it has retained the 45Q tax credit, which was initiated in 2008 and expanded under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. 
The Senate has not finalized its version of the bill yet, but is aiming for a Fourth of July deadline.

Iowa lawmakers from both the House and the Senate have been opposed to 45Q credits and to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project, which plans to lay nearly 1,000 miles of pipeline in Iowa alone to transport carbon dioxide captured at ethanol facilities to underground storage in North Dakota. 
Six GOP lawmakers from North Dakota also signed on the letter. A similar letter that circulated earlier this month was headed by lawmakers in South Dakota. 
The opponents in the Iowa-led letter said the federal tax credit “bankrolls private corporations” to “bulldoze our land, intimidate our communities, endanger lives, and bury opportunity.” 
Carbon sequestration pipelines have brought about arguments surrounding private property rights. Summit was granted the right of eminent domain by the Iowa Utilities Commission last year. The Iowa House passed a bill to ban carbon sequestration pipelines operators from using eminent domain, and the state Legislature passed a bill significantly limiting a CO2 pipeline’s ability to operate. 
The bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds June 11, and House lawmakers have submitted a petition to return for a special session to override the veto, but the effort will likely not be picked up by the Senate. 
“For four years, we have fought a grueling legislative battle to defend the constitutional property rights, safety, and economic vitality of our constituents—80–90% of whom reject the 45Q,” the letter read, referencing a survey from the fall conducted by a group opposed to the pipeline. 
In addition to opposing the use of eminent domain, opponents of the CO2 pipeline worry about potential safety issues associated with the project and damage to cropland. 
“Why would we bulldoze our way through some of the best farmland in the world to bury CO2 into formations with unknown consequences and deprive the Corn Belt of adding value and purpose to one third of each bushel of corn in the form of methanol and other fuels?” the letter read. 
Summit has said it will restore cropland impacted by the pipeline to its original condition and holds that it is “going above and beyond” federal standards to ensure safety. 
According to its website, the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline would have the capacity to put more than 18 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually into storage. 45Q credits carbon sequestration projects of this kind at $85 per metric ton of CO2, meaning Summit could receive around $1.5 billion in the tax credits annually. 
The letter said federal lawmakers have “dismissed” the pipeline and 45Q issue as a state matter. 
“This is no state issue —it’s a federal travesty, with 45Q’s unlimited borrowed billions fueling corporate aggression,” the letter read. 
A 2023 report on the tax credit from the Congressional Budget Office estimated by the 2030s the expanded use of carbon sequestration and companies claiming the credits could result in federal revenue loss between $30 billion and “well over” $100 billion. 
The letter from lawmakers said the cost was “staggering.” 
Carbon capture and sequestration would allow the Iowa biofuels industry to enter the ultra-low carbon fuel market, which it says would be hugely beneficial to struggling farmers and the state.
The CBO report also projected that if all of the projected carbon capture and sequestration projects across the country were brought online, it could remove close to 3% of the nation’s annual CO2 emissions.
The letter argues if the industry attempts to reach “net zero” emissions, the cost of these tax credits to the federal government, and taxpayers, would be even higher. 
“Repealing 45Q in (the budget reconciliation bill) would halt this federally funded nightmare, save trillions of additional debt, and empower our farmers and ethanol plants to lead a new renewable fuels revolution,” the letter said. “Our constituents demand it, our farmland deserves it, and our future depends on it.”
Ernst’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.
A draft of the bill from a Senate committee shows some changes to the 45Q tax credit, like standardizing the credit across project types and prohibiting foreign entities from claiming the credit.

Dan Newhouse (R-WA), seen during a July 2019 hearing on Capitol Hill, in Washington, D.C., was reelected in the 2024 election to a sixth term in the U.S. House.Washington U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse says he won’t back the sweeping tax cut and spending bill his fellow Republicans are trying to push through Congress if it includes controversial provisions to sell off federal public land.
Newhouse and four other Republicans in the U.S. House stated their opposition to the potential land sales in a Thursday letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson.
“If a provision to sell public lands is in the bill that reaches the House floor, we will be forced to vote no,” says the letter, which was also signed by Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Oregon, and Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif.
Republicans hold a narrow 220-212 majority in the House, and their “One Big Beautiful Bill” squeaked through that chamber by just a single vote in May.
Before it did, Republicans scrapped a proposal to make 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah available for sale.
The sweeping budget legislation is now under consideration in the Senate, where Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced a scaled-up version of the land sale proposal earlier this month. It would’ve made millions of acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management property in Washington and other states eligible for sale.
Earlier this week, the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian ruled the language of Lee’s original proposition was out of order. However, Lee has said he wants to press ahead with a narrower version of the plan that would still put thousands of acres of Bureau of Land Management property up for sale in 11 Western states, including Washington. 
Newhouse and the four other Republicans said in their letter to Johnson that they “generally accept changes to the bill that may be made by the Senate.” But they added: “We cannot accept the sale of federal lands that Senator Lee seeks.”
They said efforts by Lee to add a land sale proposal into the bill “would be a grave mistake, unforced error, and poison pill that will cause the bill to fail should it come to the House floor.”
A spokesman for Newhouse’s office said Friday the congressman did not have any comment on the issue beyond what was said in the letter.

With the devastating Los Angeles blazes still fresh in memory, cities across the Bay Area region are developing plans to lower the climate-heating emissions that are fanning the flames.
But a dangerous new bill now threatens this progress. AB 306, while purporting to address the fallout from this year’s fires, could actually increase the risk of future fires and pause local progress to address other climate disasters.
This week the provisions of AB 306 were put on the fast track for approval as state leaders shifted the contents of the bill into a budget trailer bill — a process that will make it eligible for approval by midnight Monday. 
While some narrow exceptions were added, the measure would still ban most local governments from adopting stronger building codes that promote energy efficiency until 2031. This severely limits improvements for six years — even as climate disasters intensify and technology advances — and circumvents local control and the normal legislative process in the state Senate.
We know firsthand how much of a mistake this would be. In San Jose and Palo Alto, we proved that smart building codes are one of our state’s best tools for increasing climate resilience, cutting pollution, lowering energy bills and protecting public health.
In 2019 the San Jose and Palo Alto city councils approved codes that cut development costs by going all-in on electrification, while cutting back on expensive and often unnecessary gas hookups. This — combined with additional incentives for solar panels and electric vehicle chargers in San Jose and for home appliances in Palo Alto — is creating cleaner air and reducing emissions, all without breaking the bank. 
Thousands of Palo Alto and San Jose residents now enjoy lower energy costs and healthier air quality, thanks to their all-electric homes.
Across the state, cities have followed the lead of San Jose and Palo Alto, by crafting building codes that are tailored to each community’s needs. Local challenges, such as sea level rise, housing shortages, or wildfire risks are often best addressed with locally-crafted solutions.
The proposed measure in the budget trailer bill puts this progress at risk. 
Proponents claim it will help fire victims rebuild affordably. The evidence says otherwise. Multiple studies have confirmed that there is “no clear correlation between energy code updates and rising housing prices.”
If anything, pausing code updates would worsen California’s affordability crisis. New energy standards have saved Californians more than $100 billion in utility costs over the past 50 years, and the next update is expected to save another $4.8 billion. 
Cities we represent and others across California deserve to benefit from these proven savings, but now they risk getting stuck with outdated, energy-wasting appliances. 
Energy-efficient homes aren’t just cheaper to live in — they are also cheaper to build. As we saw from our successes in our cities, building with efficient electric appliances can save up to $10,000 per unit by eliminating the need for gas line infrastructure.
The building code pause would also pause this commonsense progress, taking control away from local cities without making housing any more affordable.
Here’s the cruel irony:  this “wildfire recovery” option could make future fires worse. By blocking local clean energy policies that reduce climate-warming pollution and stripping communities of the flexibility to update codes based on advances in technology, the proposed change leaves us more vulnerable to the next disaster. 
Lawmakers should be empowering communities to be agile in response to new technologies and to explore localized solutions that promote efficiency and affordability. Cutting pollution and facilitating housing construction can co-exist.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/020624_No-Place-Like-Home_CC_CM_39.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 19:03:32.698157

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Immigrant advocates said Friday’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling on birthright citizenship is creating alarm for an already fearful immigrant community.
“It’s going to be more chaotic than it is right now, for sure,” said Assemblywoman Ellen Park (D-Bergen). “Every time I think, ‘Oh, this is the worst it’s going to be,’ it just gets even worse. And I think people really need to wake up to what’s happening right under their nose.” 
The high court’s 6-3 decision is a major win for President Donald Trump and his push to detain and deport millions of immigrants. The decision reins in nationwide injunctions from lower courts that had blocked Trump’s order restricting birthright citizenship, saying universal injunctions likely exceed federal courts’ authority. The court declined to rule on the constitutionality of Trump’s order, which would deny citizenship to babies born to people in the United States on short-term visas or without legal status.
The cases now return to the lower courts that had issued those injunctions, with instructions to ensure that their new orders comport with the high court’s ruling. Twenty-two states, including New Jersey, challenged Trump’s birthright citizenship order.
Officials in New Jersey, where roughly 1 in 4 residents are immigrants, rebuked the Supreme Court decision.
Democratic members of the Legislative Latino Caucus said it “opened the door for a harmful policy that threatens a basic promise” of birthright citizenship. Attorney General Matt Platkin, a Democrat, said people “have a right to be concerned,” but added he is confident attorneys general across the nation will successfully challenge Trump’s order.
“Birthright citizenship is part of the fabric of this nation. We’re going to win on that,” Platkin told reporters Friday. “The Supreme Court very clearly did not say otherwise today, and ultimately, when this is resolved, their rights will be vindicated.” 
In a statement, Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said he has “no doubt that the Trump Administration will see today’s decision as an invitation to continue disregarding the Constitution,” but believes the lower courts will conclude Trump’s order is “blatantly illegal.”
Friday’s ruling left room for relief through the filing of class action lawsuits, and at least two have been filed by immigrant rights groups since the decision was released.
Steven Sacco, an attorney with immigrant rights group American Friends Service Committee, said that until the fight over birthright citizenship is resolved, “it’ll be chaos, and just a great deal of terror and disruption to everyone’s lives.”
“It puts us all in danger,” he added. “It seems the Trump administration is so eager to deport people that the deportation law is the hole through which democracy is draining out of the United States.”










Every time I think, ‘Oh, this is the worst it’s going to be,’ it just gets even worse.


– Assemblywoman Ellen Park


Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, compared Friday’s decision to the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning the federal right to an abortion, known as Dobbs. 
“It caused so much confusion, people were willing to uproot and displace themselves to be able to find sanctuary in those states that had affirmatively passed protections, and New Jersey was quick to act in enshrining some of those protections in our laws,” she said.
Torres added that Friday’s ruling similarly “ripped away” a right that people saw as a fully cemented civil liberty — but the reaction from New Jersey lawmakers has been different.
“I think we’re not seeing the same swiftness toward providing privacy protections for immigrants in the same way,” she said.
While New Jersey can’t outright provide birthright citizenship, she said, lawmakers can pass the Immigrant Trust Act to enshrine protections for people who could be targets of federal immigration authorities. That bill, sponsored by Park, would codify a 2018 state directive barring local law enforcement from assisting in civil immigration enforcement. It would also prohibit officials in public places like hospitals, schools, and libraries from collecting information on residents’ immigration status.
The bill was introduced in October but has yet to receive a legislative hearing, a key step toward passage. Top lawmakers have suggested it would leave the state open to new lawsuits.
Without the bill, Torres noted, hospitals and health care centers can collect immigration status and potentially disclose it to federal agents, particularly if there is no guidance from the state. 
Sacco said the bill would “protect citizens under this regime just as it does non-citizens.”
“The Immigrant Trust Act will prevent state law enforcement from cooperating with ICE in a way that will protect, in this case, citizens from deportation,” he said.

Park, who is an immigrant from South Korea, said she’s “flabbergasted” by Friday’s ruling but has hopes birthright citizenship as it has been defined for 157 years will remain.
She agreed the Immigrant Trust Act would offer more protections for New Jersey families and called for its passage. But she noted the federal government is creating its own rule book — like going after students writing critical opinion pieces in college newspapers and undocumented people without criminal records who have been here for decades.
“Are they then going to take it up a notch? Basically not just wait outside — but maybe even enter homes and enter churches and other places?” she said. “This is going to get crazy.”

Ten years and one day after that ruling, the Flippins, born and raised Denverites, got married at the Denver Elections Division after being together for 14 years. 
“We’ve considered each other wives for quite a long time, so it seemed like an appropriate time to actually sign that certificate,” Melissa said.

The Denver Clerk and Recorder’s office held its first ever Pride Marriage Marathon Friday, allowing couples to get a marriage license and have a ceremony officiated on the same day to kick off Denver Pride weekend. Couples picked up their marriage licenses at Wellington E. Webb Municipal Building and walked over to the elections division office for their ceremonies.
The clerk’s office has consistently held a Marriage Marathon on Valentine’s Day, and Denver Clerk and Recorder Paul López said his office was overdue to host a Pride rendition. 
“It’s a celebration, and for me, I take it seriously as much as it’s a celebration, because I know what’s at stake,” López said. “I know what’s at stake in the environment that we’re facing right now, and in a little bit of uncertainty, it’s that much more of a powerful thing to do.”

López said his office initially planned a Pride Marriage Marathon in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic stopped it from starting that summer. He said the day was filled with tears, joy, excitement and giddiness. 
“I feel joyful. It’s an honor to do this, especially for folks in our community,” López said. “We want to honor folks, especially today, honor love, and remind mind folks that love is love. I think there’s probably no other words more powerful than that.”
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, he and Republican leaders in Congress have rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the federal government and have targeted access to gender-affirming care for transgender people. The Supreme Court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority, and concern that the court could reverse the Obergefell decision has grown since it overturned the Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion.
Colorado voters in November approved an amendment to remove language — though it was inoperable because of the Obergefell decision — from the Colorado Constitution that banned same-sex marriage. The Colorado Legislature passed a law this year that would remove similar language from state statute.

López got to officiate the wedding for a relative of a friend he went to school with. That was for Sade Kiel and Emily Panyachitch, who had their ceremony under a rainbow balloon arch in the center of the Elections Division. The room went silent as over a dozen of their family members gathered to watch them share wedding vows. 
“We are very fortunate, because a lot of people don’t have this amount of support,” Kiel said about their family. “So I can’t explain in words how I feel. It’s just a beautiful thing. I’m just so happy. I’m ecstatic. I’m just blessed, to be honest.”

Kiel said she was overwhelmed with “all the good emotions that you should have at the end of a wedding ceremony.” The couple, who have been together 12 years, took four days to plan a small reception to celebrate their marriage. 
“We’ve been talking about having a wedding for so very long, but of course, the important thing for us was buying a home,” Kiel said. “So we purchased our first home versus having a wedding, and so seeing this opportunity arise … I was like, would you like to do this? And she was like let’s do it.” 
Panyachitch said she looks forward to celebrating Pride in Denver with Kiel as newlyweds this year. 
“Say it out loud. Don’t be afraid to come out. Don’t be afraid to be yourself,” Panyachitch said. “There will always be an entourage out there for you who is cheering for you.”

James Murphy and Alex Albarenga got engaged in August 2024 and were planning a larger wedding, but they managed to plan a reception for about 50 people to celebrate their marriage after deciding to go to the Pride Marriage Marathon two weeks ago.
“We are ready to get married today. We’ve been together for three and a half years, and we just felt like this is a really good time, especially with things going on today in the world,” Murphy said. “We just want to make sure we can seal our deal and make sure we have our special moment, before it could be ripped away from us.” 
The couple was surrounded by friends during their ceremony, one of whom video called another friend to watch Murphy and Albarenga exchange vows. They planned to celebrate at a rooftop terrace and bar with live music, and will close out their wedding day with a party bus.

Murphy said it “means the world” that he got to marry his best friend the day after the 10-year anniversary of the Obergefell decision and on the first day of Denver Pride weekend.
Cat Pace and Wynona Redman moved to Colorado from Texas a month ago and decided to kick off their time in their new home with a wedding. 
“That kind of sealed the whole deal,” Redman said. Pace added, “House, car, puppies, our daughters are here, our grandbabies are here, it’s exciting.”

Pace said a friend sent her the link about the Pride Marriage Marathon, and the couple thought “why the heck not?” In 2020, Redman’s daughters threw a surprise commitment ceremony for the couple in Denver, so signing their marriage licence in the city felt “full circle.” 
While Pace joked that Colorado is colder than Texas, Redman said “it just feels more like home here.” 
“This is my first pride, to be honest.  I’ve always had to kind of keep it quiet,” Pace said. “So this is pretty cool, just to be able to soak it all in, to see all the friendliness, the cultural support. It’s fantastic.”

Attorneys for Kappa Kappa Gamma are asking for a final ruling to put a two-plus-year legal battle to rest. 
The post Wyoming sorority asks court to dismiss lawsuit over transgender inclusion, again appeared first on WyoFile .","Attorneys for Kappa Kappa Gamma are asking a federal court to end the long-running legal battle over the University of Wyoming sorority’s inclusion of a transgender member. 
“Much has changed in the more than two years since this case was initially filed,” the plaintiffs wrote in a motion to dismiss filed Friday. 
Six members sued the sorority in early 2023 for allegedly breaking its bylaws, breaching housing contracts and misleading sisters when it admitted Artemis Langford, a transgender woman, by a vote of its members.
U.S. District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson dismissed the case in August 2023, ruling that the government cannot interfere with how a private, voluntary organization determines its members. Months later, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver also dismissed the case. 
That left the sorority sisters — Jaylyn Westenbroek, Hannah Holtmeier, Allison Coghan, Grace Choate, Madeline Ramar and Megan Kosar — two choices. They could amend the complaint or ask the lower court for a final judgement. 
Almost a year later, facing a filing deadline, they filed an amended complaint earlier this month that no longer named Langford as a defendant and included a new set of plaintiffs. 
“The matter has bounced between this court and the Tenth Circuit,” Friday’s filing states. “Four of the six named plaintiffs have left the case and a new one has joined. Each of the current and former plaintiffs and the former student defendant who attended the University of Wyoming have graduated.”
And yet, attorneys for the sorority argue, “this remains a case where plaintiffs seek to have a federal court dictate to a private organization how inclusive it can be in defining its own membership.” (Emphasis from the filing.)
In Johnson’s 2023 dismissal of the case, he applied the landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale. 
In 2000, the high court ruled that the scouting organization was exempt from New Jersey state law that bars anti-gay discrimination. The private organization had fired James Dale, an assistant scout master, when it found out he was gay. Overturning a lower court’s decision, the Supreme Court ruled that requiring the Boy Scouts to readmit Dale would violate the private organization’s First Amendment right of expressive association.
“Dale controls today, interestingly with the shoe on the other foot,” Johnson wrote. “Whether excluding gay scoutmasters in Dale or including transgender women in Kappa, this Judge may not invade Kappa’s sacrosanct, associational right to engage in protected speech.”
Attorneys for the sorority pointed back to this in their Friday filings. 
“As was the case when defendants moved to dismiss this case two years ago, plaintiffs have no legal right to have their sorority’s leadership adopt their personal definition of who is and is not a ‘woman,’” the filing states. “And it is not the role of the courts to police the membership decisions of private organizations.” 
The legal defects of the amended complaint extend beyond that, the defendants also argue, pointing to a failure of the plaintiffs to properly identify wrongdoing. Kappa’s attorneys also allege that the sorority sisters failed to serve or attempt to serve all defendants. 
Johnson’s 2023 dismissal was “without prejudice,” meaning it was not a final decision, and effectively left the sorority sisters the option to amend their complaint. 
Kappa’s attorneys are asking the court for a final ruling. 
“Defendants respectfully submit that the time has come for the court to put an end to plaintiffs’ attempts to use this court to advance their preferred social agenda within a private organization of more than 210,000 members,” the filing states. 
The plaintiffs will now have an opportunity to respond before the court makes a decision. 
Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced earlier this month it’s investigating the University of Wyoming for alleged Title IX violations stemming from the sorority’s inclusion of a transgender member.

(Phot courtesy of U.S. Forest Service) Residents of Pine Valley, where the Forsyth Fire swept through last week destroying homes, were able to return to their community on Friday — but the 10,000-plus acre fire continues to burn, and officials say locals should be prepared to evacuate again. 
Meanwhile, fire danger continues to rise across Utah, prompting statewide restrictions and a call from Gov. Spencer Cox to pray for rain. 
This summer is off to a fiery start, with 380 blazes across the state, 275 of them human-caused. The majority of Utah is currently in either severe or moderate drought and an estimated 43,000 acres have burned. 
That includes the 10,600 acres burned by the Forsyth Fire, which as of Friday has destroyed at least 14 structures, most of them homes, in the small Pine Valley community located north of St. George. Although residents were allowed to return home on Friday, the community remains in a “Set” level evacuation order, meaning they should prepare to evacuate again if the situation worsens.

Crews have made progress fighting the lightning-caused fire, which is now about 8% contained. But officials with the U.S. Forest Service say rising temperatures and strong winds continue to pose a threat to the area. 
To that end, the governor, as he has done in past years, called for a day of prayer and fasting for rain on Sunday, June 29. 
“Utah is facing a tough season, and we need both divine help and practical action,” Cox said in a statement on Friday. “I invite every Utahn, whatever your faith or belief system, to join me this Sunday in a unified fast and prayer for rain. And while we look heavenward, let’s do our part here at home — fix leaks, water lawns less and use every drop wisely. Small actions, taken together, can make a big difference for our state.”
The largest fire in the state is the France Canyon Fire, burning in Dixie National Forest outside of Bryce Canyon National Park. As of Friday, the fire was at 32,053 acres and about 15% containment. 
Officials also announced statewide fire restrictions on both state and federal land — that means no fires in spaces outside of approved campgrounds or homesites with running water; no fireworks, shooting exploding targets or metalwork; no operating machinery or equipment (including motorcycles, chainsaws, ATVs, or other small internal combustion engines) without a spark arrestor; and no smoking near vegetation. 
Those restrictions apply to the following regions: 

All state owned land (including state parks, trust lands and wildlife management areas)
All unincorporated private land 
Six Bureau of Land Management districts — the Arizona Strip, Color Country, Canyon Country, Green River, Paria River and West Desert districts
Three U.S. Forest Service regions — Dixie, Fishlake and Manti-La Sal national forests
Eight national parks, monuments and recreation areas — Arches, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands national parks; Cedar Breaks, Hovenweep and Natural Bridges national monuments; and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area 

“Our forests and rangelands at all elevations are drying out quickly, making it easier for wildfires to ignite and spread — especially on windy days,” said Brett Ostler, the state fire management officer with the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands.

In strongly worded dissenting opinions, two of the Iowa justices called the majority’s decision in the case on Friday “frightening” and “profoundly wrong,” warning that it could remove any disincentive for state officials to willfully hold prisoners well beyond their scheduled release dates.
Justice David May, joined by Chief Justice Susan Christensen and Justices Thomas Waterman and Edward Mansfield, upheld a district court judge’s decision to dismiss Eugene Sikora’s claim for damages for being held in prison past his proper release date.
Justice Christopher McDonald, joined by Justices Dana Oxley and Matthew McDermott, filed a dissenting opinion. In addition, Oxley filed a dissenting opinion of her own, in which she was joined by McDonald and McDermott, and McDermott authored a dissenting opinion of his own, in which he was joined by McDonald and Oxley.
In his lawsuit, Sikora had claimed the state had released him from prison five months late due to a mathematical miscalculation. Three years after he was released, Sikora sued the state and the director of the Iowa Department of Corrections for wrongful imprisonment, seeking monetary damages.
A district court judge dismissed the lawsuit, citing the doctrine of sovereign immunity in which the state and its employees are generally considered immune from state-law tort claims for monetary damages arising from wrongful imprisonment.
In upholding that district court decision, Justice May, writing for the majority, stated that no exceptions to the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied to the case and concluded Sikora’s suit could not proceed.
“The district court properly rejected Sikora’s state law claims for money damages,” May wrote. “But this does not mean that our courts are unable to help persons who are wrongfully detained in Iowa prisons. If Sikora had asked our courts for non-monetary relief — like an order to release him from prison — sovereign immunity would not have foreclosed his request.”
May noted there are “pathways for wrongfully convicted prisoners to obtain money damages in state court. One element of Iowa law, he noted, waives sovereign immunity to permit money damages claims by people who are imprisoned because of wrongful convictions – but that law doesn’t apply to Sikora’s case, May wrote, because he pleaded guilty to his crimes.
McDonald says majority is ‘profoundly wrong’

In his dissenting opinion, Justice McDonald noted that America’s foundational principles and common law enabled people injured by government officials to sue those same government officials for monetary damages and other relief.
“This common law regime of rights was codified as fundamental law in the structure and text of the federal and state constitutions, including the Iowa Constitution,” McDonald wrote. “The state now claims that its officials can violate this fundamental law and imprison people with impunity … Not even King George III asserted such power for his officials, and our forefathers attempted to make sure none could assert it here. They understood that tyranny authorized by statute is still tyranny.”
McDonald wrote that the law extending the state’s immunity in cases such as Sikora’s “is illegal and void because the extension of sovereign immunity to these government officials contravenes the structure and text of the state constitution.”
McDonald also characterized the majority’s decision as “profoundly wrong” and an example of “willful ignorance” with regard to its refusal to acknowledge past court decisions. The “special status” the majority conferred upon state officials, McDonald wrote, “does not make sense. What logical distinction would provide state officials immunity superior to federal and local officials?”
Even if the state had “some legitimate interest in limiting the liability of its employees” for their conduct, McDonald added, “its chosen means in this case — the total elimination of any right of recovery for wrongfully imprisoned people — is unduly oppressive and thus constitutionally forbidden.”
McDonald said the state’s claim of sovereign immunity was “nothing more than an assertion that the government and its officials have the unilateral right to alter the state constitution through normal legislation and wrongly imprison people without being held to account. That assertion is odious and repugnant to republican constitutional order.”

Noting that the Iowa state flag says, “Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain,” McDonald opined that the court’s majority was rejecting “the very core of liberty at the heart of our state constitutional order” by asserting that wrongful imprisonment at the hands of state officials is lawful. “It should not be celebrated here,” he wrote. “It is absolutism, pure, simple, and naked.”
In his separate dissenting opinion, Justice McDermott called the majority’s decision “both frightening and, as a legal matter, wrong.”
McDermott said “the evidence is overwhelming that during Iowa’s founding era, people could pursue lawsuits for money damages against government officials in both Iowa and federal courts. The majority’s claim to the contrary — that sovereign immunity protects state officials from private causes of action — is fundamentally incompatible with the historical evidence.”
McDermott added that the majority’s dismissal of Sikora’s claim left Sikora “without a remedy despite his having allegedly suffered five months of unlawful confinement. And after today, it is hard to see what disincentive any state prison official would have to unlawfully hold an inmate well beyond his release date.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Iowa-Supreme-Court.jpg,,,2025-06-27 19:03:32.698157

As ECFiber and the company that currently runs its operations continue to spar in court, the communication union district announced that its new service provider has hired its first chief executive officer.  
Gopi Sundaram, a longtime investor in broadband projects, is taking the helm of the Vermont ISP Operating company, or VISPO, a nonprofit created by members of ECFiber’s board. The organization plans to take over ECFiber’s operations next year.
Sundaram currently serves as a managing partner at Radius Capital Partners, a private equity firm that specializes in telecommunications investments. Previously, he was the managing director of the Tetrad McCourt consortium, an investment group that helped oversee the deployment of Ireland’s National Broadband Plan. 
“We were very happy to have Gopi join the VISPO board initially, and thrilled when he told us he’d be willing to become our CEO,” said VISPO board chair Alessandro Iuppa in a Thursday press release. “His expertise and deep experience gives VISPO the requisite leadership to manage and operate ECFiber.”

ECFiber is Vermont’s oldest communications union district — a type of municipal entity created by lawmakers in 2015 to support the rollout of high speed internet access in underserved parts of the state. (Founded in 2008 as an alliance of towns, ECFiber preceded, and served as a model for, other communications union districts in the state.) The district serves slightly fewer than 10,000 customers across 31 Vermont member towns and owns roughly 1,750 miles of fiber optic cable lines, according to its 2024 annual report. 
Members of ECFiber’s governing board moved to take on VISPO as its new service provider in April as a simmering legal spat between the district and its current operating company, the Maine-based Biddeford Internet Corp (also known as Great Works Internet, or GWI) began to reach a boiling point. 
GWI first took over operations for ECFiber in 2022, after a sequence of scandals led the district’s previous service provider ValleyNet, a nonprofit, to step back and ultimately dissolve in April, according to a business filing with the Vermont Secretary of State. 
GWI also runs operations for two more of Vermont’s nine communications union districts — DVFiber and Northwest Fiberworx.
But in February, ECFiber accused GWI of starting to reorganize its operations in a way that would detract from the service provided to the district. GWI has meanwhile argued that VISPO was created on false pretenses, and that the communications district has violated their contract in attempting to abruptly transition between service providers.
In March, GWI launched a lawsuit against ECFiber’s governing board chair F.X. Flinn, claiming that the creation of VISPO was a maneuver orchestrated by Flinn “to literally poach GWI’s business and its opportunity with ECFiber for himself.”

Flinn, who was initially a founding director of the nonprofit operating company but has since stepped down, has strenuously denied the claims, arguing in court filings and in interviews that the lawsuit is a “SLAPP suit,” or a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, designed to intimidate ECFiber and complicate its transition to VISPO.  
And in a flurry of legal filings made in recent months, the case has begun to escalate as GWI and ECFiber have accused one another of breaching their agreement. 
In an amended complaint filed in mid-May, GWI broadened the scope of its initial lawsuit against Flinn by naming ECFiber itself as a codefendant. It also accused the communication union district of violating its contract, among other allegations. 
ECFiber, meanwhile, has countersued, alleging that GWI has refused to cooperate as the district has attempted to begin shifting its operations to VISPO. 
In May, ECFiber introduced a “transition policy” under which GWI would allow VISPO to gradually learn and take on all operating capabilities, from billing and bookkeeping to marketing and network management. Claiming that GWI has thus far refused to comply with the policy, ECFiber last week asked the court for a preliminary injunction requiring the company to cooperate, saying that the district would otherwise suffer “irreparable harm.”
In a written statement to VTDigger, however, GWI CEO Karem Durdag said that the contract between the two entities “does not allow ECFiber to unilaterally impose such obligations” on GWI and that the company would say as much in court.
“ECFiber is attempting to force GWI to train, equip, and effectively subsidize a start-up competitor, without our consent, without compensation, and on an unrealistic timeline,” Durdag said. “That demand is not only unjust and unprecedented, it is deeply irresponsible. It would require pulling skilled GWI employees from other Vermont CUDs and would compromise the very viability of our operations.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)The permitting and approval process to build new homes and apartment units in Idaho is too time consuming, which contributes to a lack of affordable housing, a legislative committee studying housing issues in the Gem State heard Friday. 
New Idaho legislative committee aims to identify barriers – and solutions – to housing issues

The delays affect the availability of housing and ultimately add to the housing costs the eventual owners or renters will pay, homebuilders and other speakers told the Idaho Legislature’s Land Use and Housing Study Committee.
The committee, which includes state legislators, building officials, architects, planners and city and county elected officials, is studying the barriers and solutions to Idaho’s affordable housing challenges. Friday was its second meeting, which was held at the College of Eastern Idaho in Idaho Falls.
During Friday’s meeting, Valley County Commissioner Sherry Maupin said the so-called “not in my backyard,” or “NIMBY” opposition to housing and development also adds to the state’s inability to build more homes. 
“This has been going on since the ‘60s, and that is why that there has been a decrease in building. (It’s) because people are coming in in droves and saying, ‘not in my backyard,’” Maupin said. “So that is driving a lot more litigation. We’ve had an increase in litigation in Valley County, where there’s a lot of appeals that we’ve never had appeals of before. So it is slowing down the process.”

Sen. Ali Rabe, D-Boise, pushed for the formation of an interim committee to study housing barriers and solutions during the recent 2025 legislative session. Rabe modeled Idaho’s committee after a Montana committee, and she hopes it will come up with bipartisan solutions for housing availability and affordability.
The committee will be able to make recommendations to the Idaho Legislature during the 2026 legislative session. 
The Idaho Legislature’s Land Use and Housing Study Committee has two other meetings scheduled. The interim committee plans to meet Aug. 14 in Sandpoint and Sept. 26 in Boise. 
Friday’s meeting was streamed live online through the Idaho in Session service, which is a partnership between Idaho Public Television, the Idaho Legislature and the Idaho Legislative Services Office.

(Getty Images)Parties on both sides of a federal lawsuit over Arkansas’ ban on gender-affirming health care for transgender youth must file supplemental briefs in light of last week’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld Tennessee’s similar ban, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Friday.
A federal judge blocked Arkansas’ Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act of 2021 before it could go into effect, in response to a lawsuit filed by four families of transgender minors represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas. The judge permanently enjoined the law on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds in June 2023, and the state appealed the ruling.

U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on gender affirming care for minors


The appeals court heard oral arguments in the case last year and has yet to issue a ruling. On Friday, the court ordered the plaintiffs and defendants to file briefs “addressing only the equal protection claim in light of United States v. Skrmetti,” the Tennessee case.
The SAFE Act “prohibits medical care on the basis of sex,” in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, U.S. District Judge James Moody wrote in his June 2023 ruling. The law prohibited physicians from providing “gender transition” treatments like hormones, puberty blockers and surgeries to those under age 18.
Tennessee’s similar law was blocked in federal district court but overturned by an appeals court and upheld 6-3 by the U.S. Supreme Court, a decision that did not lift the injunction on Arkansas’ law. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that Tennessee’s law does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.
Roberts wrote that the court would leave policy decisions about transgender health care up to “the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.” State officials in both Tennessee and Arkansas have claimed transgender health care for minors is rooted in activism and experimentation rather than evidence-based science.
However, “the State’s experts offered no evidence-based treatment alternatives” to prescribing hormones and puberty blockers for transgender youth, Moody wrote in his ruling. Without evidence to support the state’s claims, the law also violated the right to due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the parents of transgender children, he wrote.
Arkansas families describe living where lawmakers are hostile to their transgender children

The appeals court gave the parties in the lawsuit until July 11 to file their briefs.
Three of the four transgender minor plaintiffs — Dylan Brandt of Greenwood, Sabrina Jennen of Fayetteville and Parker Saxton of Vilonia — are now at least 18 years old. The fourth, Brooke Dennis of Bentonville, is 13 years old.
One parent of each child shared their experiences with their children’s gender transitions during the case’s eight-day trial in 2022, the nation’s first trial over a law like the SAFE Act. Brandt, then 17, was the only minor to take the witness stand.
The other two plaintiffs were Dr. Michele Hutchison and Dr. Kathryn Stambough, physicians who have treated transgender minors in Arkansas.
The defendants are Attorney General Tim Griffin and the Arkansas State Medical Board.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Montgomery County parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

As he drove down the street, they called his name and begged him to play football. His daughter, Reena, was the weight on her father’s ankles when he did sit-ups. They watched “Popeye” together. 
“He would go to a record player and put on a 33 with Chubby Checker, and he would twist the night away,” Reena Evers-Everette recalled.
Those were just a few of the details shared at the Daddys’ Daughters Panel on Thursday night, an event where daughters of men killed while at tthe center of the civil rights movement shared intimate stories about life with their fathers.
Panelists included Reena Evers-Everette, daughter of Mississippi NAACP Field Secretary Medgar Evers, Bettie Dahmer, daughter of Vernon Dahmer, and Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
Joy Reid, political commentator and former MSNBC national correspondent, moderated the panel, one of a series of events honoring the legacy of Medgar Evers.
Reid also joined writer and professor W. Ralph Eubanks on Friday to discuss ‘The Power of the Word.’” Moderated by Ebony Lamumba, the panel explored the role of storytelling in the fight for racial justice.
All the “daughters” panelists shared memories about their fathers.

Vernon Dahmer, who was murdered after offering to pay poll taxes for African Americans in Forrest County so they could vote, played make believe with her with her tea set and taught her how to drive a standard shift truck, Bettie Dahmer said. 
His house was a refuge for the local community. He hosted Fourth of July picnics and allowed Boy Scout troops to camp on his land.
“It was safe,” Bettie Dahmer said. “We had other places where kids could come and be safe.”
That was until Jan. 10, 1966, when Klansmen attacked their home near Hattiesburg while the family slept, firing guns into the home. Vernon Dahmer grabbed his shotgun and fired back, enabling his family to escape out a back window, but flames from the blaze seared his lungs. He died a day later. 
Evers-Everette, whose father was shot in the back in the driveway of their Jackson home on June 12, 1962, says she was her father’s “princess.”

“Love is what resonates throughout my life, because that’s what I grew up with and that’s what my father instilled in us,” she said.
The panelists spent time honoring their mothers. Years after her father was murdered for fighting for voting rights, Bettie Dahmer’s mother Ellie would serve as an election commissioner. 
Evers-Everette credits her mother, Myrlie Evers, with the phrase “You can kill a man, but you can’t kill an idea.” 
Myrlie Evers later served as chairman of the NAACP.

Kerry Kennedy said her father, who as U.S. attorney general enforced civil rights legislation and as a senator advocated for voting rights and against discrimination, ran towards fires started during a civil rights protest instead of watching them on TV. He was assassinated after winning the California Democratic primary for president in 1968. Kerry Kennedy argued that Americans should adopt the stance her father had about taking action.
“We need our country today to run into the flames,” said Kerry Kennedy. “Because our country is on fire.”
The daughters talked about how to continue the legacies of their fathers and mothers.
“I hope each and every one of you understands the importance of the vote. It’s not just going and doing a checkmark. It’s a checkmark for your life,” Evers-Everette said. 
She hoped attendees would “remember that.”
“If you honor them, and you honor our fathers and our mothers — do something about it,” she said.

At the Panel of the Word, Reid, who wrote a biography of Medgar and Myrlie Evers, also spoke on the Pentagon’s proposal to’ rename the Navy cargo ship USNS Medgar Evers and the renaming of the oiler USNS Harvey Milk as the USNS Oscar Peterson.
Reid described history as “a series of stories of people who, through their resilience, survived enslavement, survived Jim Crow, survived hate, survived fear, and survived the abandonment of the federal government of our communities, and their stories collectively are what make history.” 
“And so, when you don’t know the impact of those stories, it’s easy to do a thing like strip Harvey Milk’s name off of a Navy battleship…threaten to do the same to USNS Medgar Evers,” she said.

Ralph Eubanks, author and visiting professor at the University of Mississippi
Referring to scholar Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s concept of “the single story,” Eubanks warned about anti-Diversity, Equity and Inclusion backlash in classrooms. “What is being imposed on us is — trying to impose on us — is a single story, and there is a real danger in that,” he said.
“I mean, think about what is happening with the DEI legislation in this state…Oxford, Mississippi, has 45 working writers, and…probably half of their work, including my own, could be banned,” he said.
Eubanks referred to the state’s new anti-DEI law, which prohibits public schools and state colleges and universities from a variety of practices related to DEI. This includes engaging in “divisive concepts.”  The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi and several other civil rights groups filed a federal lawsuit challenging the law. A federal judge is considering issuing a restraining order to block the law from going into effect.
Answering an audience member’s question, Reid and Eubanks both spoke on how Mississippi and the South are precursors to current national policies.
“So what’s happened is these Southern states have developed a version of what we’re now facing nationally, and so the shock is north of the Mason-Dixon line,” said Reid.
“We’re all living in Mississippi now,” said Eubanks. “Everybody in this county has at least one foot in Mississippi whether they want to admit it or not.”

A former employee is suing The Greenwood School in Putney for allegedly permitting sexual harassment and discrimination and breaching an implied contract. 
The trial date has been set for March 1, 2026.
A former administrative assistant for The Greenwood School alleged that the school’s administration failed to adequately address recurrent sexual harassment that she experienced from a student, according to the complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court of Vermont by attorney Theodore Kramer in June 2024. 
The employee resigned from her post at The Greenwood School — a specialized boarding and day school, serving neurodivergent students from grades 6 to 12 — in January 2024 due to the “sexually hostile environment.”
The complaint describes a student repeatedly “inappropriately touching” the former employee as well as making comments, facial expressions and engaging in “other acts of a sexual nature” directed at the former employee between May and November 2023. 
When the former employee reported the first incident, in which the student pulled her toward him and touched her buttocks, the dean of students said that the student had “‘mommy issues’ and was looking for a connection,” the complaint states. 
The complaint goes on to describe several times when the student touched her breasts, buttocks and other parts of her body despite the former employee asking the student to stop, and after she reported the instances to the administration. 
The former assistant “specifically recalls the head of school telling her to ‘get over it’ and ‘nothing is ever solved by worrying about what has already happened’” after she wrote a letter to the administration about her concerns in November 2023, according to the complaint. 
The administration and faculty at the Greenwood School were allegedly aware that the student had a pattern of “inappropriately touching faculty members, students and parents of students,” according to the complaint.
The student was barred from the administrative building by the head of the middle school in September 2023 after the student engaged in “continued sexual assaults and harassment,” the complaint states. 
The former employee continued to bring her concerns to administrators after harassment occurred, but the school “took no action to investigate or correct the hostile work environment,” the complaint states. 
The lawsuit argues that the alleged hostile work environment interfered with the former employee’s ability to execute her work duties, negatively impacted her mental and physical wellbeing and led to her resignation. 
The complaint also asserts the school breached an implied contract established in the school handbook by “failing to uphold policies and procedures” and not safeguarding the former administrative assistant from the “many examples of harassment” that occured during her employment. 
The former employee is seeking redress in the form of monetary compensation and attorneys fees as well as any “further relief the Court deems proper” during the trial scheduled for next year. The Greenwood School Head of School did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The attorney for the former employee declined to comment while the case is pending in court.

(Mugshot from the Indiana Department of Correction)The Indiana Attorney General’s Office requested an execution date on Friday for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward, the Spencer County man convicted in 2007 for the rape and murder of 15‑year‑old Stacy Payne. 
A date has not yet been set. A decision on the state’s motion is up to the Indiana Supreme Court.
“We are stunned that they have moved for a date given the very public statements of the governor that the cost is something that should be explored and that this is something the governor wanted the legislature to look at,” defense counsel Larry Komp said in a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle. 
“Given the budget shortfalls, citizens deserve an explanation as to why Indiana spent over a million dollars for controlled substances, from some undisclosed source that is reaping a huge financial windfall at the expense of Indiana citizens,” he continued. “This is especially true given the public descriptions that the drugs did not work how they should have in Mr. Ritchie’s execution.”
Ward, now 52, was originally convicted and sentenced to death in 2002, but the state’s high court justices overturned the verdict due to “prejudicial pre-trial publicity,” according to legal documents. 
Story continues below.
Verified Motion to Set Execution Date (1)
 
The case was sent back to the lower court, where Ward later pleaded guilty and a second jury again sentenced him to death in 2007. 
The Indiana Supreme Court previously set Ward’s execution for December 11, 2012, but that date was automatically stayed due to ongoing federal appeals. No new execution date was set while those legal challenges remained unresolved in the courts.
Ward has since exhausted all state and federal appeals.
Court records indicate Ward attacked Payne after she answered the door of her Dale, Indiana, home shortly after noon on July 11, 2001. Her younger sister heard screams and called 911. Police arrived within minutes and found Ward standing in the doorway of the home, holding a knife. He was arrested at the scene. 
Payne later died from severe injuries, including stab wounds and disembowelment.
Payne was an honor roll student who worked at Jenk’s Pizza, according to her obituary. She was a cheerleader and won awards for public speaking.
Ward’s execution, if approved, would be the third in Indiana since December 2024, following a 15‑year hiatus. Joseph Corcoran was executed by lethal injection in December under former Gov. Eric Holcomb, and Benjamin Ritchie followed in May 2025 under new Gov. Mike Braun. Both executions used a single‐drug protocol of pentobarbital.
Since executions resumed, debates have increased over the high cost and uncertain supply of the drug. 
Braun clarifies Indiana acquisition of execution drugs; reveals more than $1M spent

Reporting by the Capital Chronicle revealed this week the state spending has so far exceeded $1 million for four doses of pentobarbital: half were used and the other half expired. 
The drugs were purchased in two transactions — one under Holcomb and one under Braun.
In total, $1.175 million was spent, Braun said. But two doses — worth $600,000 — expired without use because “they had been on the shelf too long.” Braun said earlier this month that the drug has a 90-day shelf life.
Braun emphasized earlier this week that neither of the doses used by the Indiana Department of Correction in December and May were expired when administered to inmates.
It’s not clear when exactly the state acquired the doses or from where they were purchased. Indiana Code protects the identity of the seller from public scrutiny. State officials had previously declined to provide details about how much pentobarbital was purchased, and refused to provide information on expiration dates, storage or other details.
Braun, a Republican in his first year as governor, has repeatedly said the question of whether Indiana should continue to carry out executions is one that lawmakers should weigh in the months ahead. 
“There are legislators that wonder if it’s still relevant,” he said earlier this month. “I’m going to listen to them, the courts, and the broader discussion in general.”
The governor’s office did not immediately reply to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment about the execution date request for Ward.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Iowans prepare to celebrate the 4th of July, a new state law going into effect Tuesday will loosen restrictions on setting off fireworks on July 3 and 4 in some communities.
Senate File 303 was signed into law by Gov. Kim Reynolds in May. The law, which takes effect July 1, prevents county boards of supervisors and city councils from banning and limiting the use of consumer fireworks on July 3, 4 and Dec. 31 that are more restrictive than state regulations.
Iowa local governments have the ability to set regulations on fireworks in their jurisdictions. Iowa communities like Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Iowa City and Dubuque ban the use of consumer fireworks within city limits. Others, like Waterloo, Ankeny and Davenport, have restrictions on fireworks being set off outside of certain dates — typically for Fourth of July and New Year’s Eve celebrations.
The Des Moines City Council — as well as several other local government bodies — have made changes, or are in the process of aligning their local ordinances with the new state law, which requires all local jurisdictions to suspend limits on consumer fireworks for celebrations on these three days. However, it still allows local governments to keep in place bans and limits on fireworks for other times of the year, in addition to requiring Iowans to still follow other regulations on fireworks use existing in state code.
Iowa law limits the legal use of all fireworks to be between June 1 through July 8 and Dec. 10 through Jan. 3 of each year. During these timeframes, consumer fireworks can only be set off between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. each day. Fireworks are allowed to be set off until 11 p.m. on July 4 and the weekends before and after the Fourth of July, and can be set off from 9 a.m. Dec. 31 until 12:30 a.m. Jan. 1.
State code also contains other regulations on fireworks, including a ban on the sale of fireworks to people under age 18 and a prohibition on individuals and organizations setting off “display” fireworks — bigger fireworks often used in professional shows — without permission from their local government. Setting off fireworks in a public park or other city property is also still banned without local approval, as state law bans the use of consumer fireworks outside of a person’s own property or that of someone who has consented to fireworks being used at their property.
The city of Des Moines issued a news release Wednesday warning Iowans that while the state law has changed, fireworks can still not be set off at Des Moines parks or on streets and sidewalks. The news release said in 2024, a third of the city’s 77 parks reported damage or needed cleanup because of unlawful fireworks use, with some parks needing to be shut down to address damages.
“We ask that our residents use fireworks during the permitted times and in the permitted locations respectfully this year,” Des Moines Mayor Connie Boesen said in the release. “That means keeping fireworks to private property and especially out of our Parks to preserve those spaces for our community to use.”
When the law was moving through the Iowa Legislature earlier this year, Democrats speaking on behalf of local governments and law enforcement criticized the measure, saying the areas that had banned consumer fireworks because of the public safety hazards caused by fireworks. But Republicans, including Rep. Bill Gustoff, R-Des Moines, floor manager for the measure in the House, said the change was needed to allow Iowans to fully celebrate the Fourth of July without fear of breaking local laws.
Gustoff said allowing these celebrations was especially important this year in light of President Donald Trump’s plan to launch celebrations in Iowa leading up to the nation’s 250th anniversary July 4, 2026.

Those who live by the proposed site “will be directly impacted by its noise and air pollutants, and will suffer traffic safety impacts and congestion impacts,” said Jim Dumont, a Bristol-based attorney representing Essex residents.

ESSEX JUNCTION — The town’s Development Review Board has asked Amazon to provide traffic assessments of three comparable sites after residents took issue Thursday with the traffic study filed for a proposal to build a 107,000-square-foot distribution facility in Essex’s verdant Saxon Hill.
The site plan, dubbed Project Moose by developers, calls for building the facility and 482 parking spaces at 637 Kimo Drive in an area zoned Preservation District-Industrial (RPD-I), and seeks a waiver for the required 50-foot buffer between the property and the street. If the plan passes, it would be the first Amazon facility in Vermont.
The board on Thursday discussed a traffic impact study submitted by Langan Engineering and a peer review of it by Stantec commissioned by the town.
“Through our conversations, we find that one of the most important and vital pieces to us is really the greater detail about the traffic studies,” board chair Ian Carroll said at 10:07 p.m., after a two-hour private session in the middle of the 6:30 p.m. public hearing on the project proposed by Scannell Properties.

The commercial real estate development company headquartered in Indianapolis has spearheaded warehouse and distribution facilities for Amazon in several states.
“We’d like some post-monitoring assessments of three identified comparable sites, both comparable in size to the current proposal as well as to population,” Carroll said.
Jonathan Greeley, economic development lead for Amazon in New England, pushed back on the request. He said they have “more than accurately overestimated what our traffic impact is going to be” for the proposed project, and that it wasn’t just a study “taken off a shelf.”
“It’s in light of our own self interest that if we’re putting forth traffic counts and putting forth projections, and if we know we’re going to be monitored, that we’re accurately doing so, and so I just want to make sure the board understands we didn’t just make some stuff up,” he said.
Daniel Clarey, senior traffic engineer at Langan Engineering and Environmental Services, further clarified that the overall traffic study was approved by the town, the Vermont Agency of Transportation and the town-appointed consultant Stantec.
Slated as a distribution site, the project would bring “even traffic” with vehicles dropping off packages, loading and leaving quickly, he said.
Besides daytime van trips by workers, the proposal estimates one or two tractor trailers per hour between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., arriving possibly from Massachusetts and Connecticut. Workers at the proposed facility would sort and load packages into Amazon-branded vans to be delivered to homes and businesses within roughly 70 miles.
While Amazon responded Wednesday to the Stantec review of the traffic study, the town has not yet had a chance to examine the letter, said Carroll, who called for a continuance before a decision is made.

Earlier in the evening, resident Duane Millar Barlow said he had contacted several engineering firms to conduct a review he was willing to pay for but found they were reluctant to challenge a peer company’s work.
He submitted a letter disputing the town-commissioned Stantec assessment. 
“Though written in a diplomatic tone, it is a thorough discrediting of the Langan statement’s central conclusion: that the project’s traffic impacts are acceptable and that no further study is warranted.”
Others took issue with a study looking at potential scenarios and said Amazon needs to come back with a study that looks at the actual traffic impacts at similar facilities.
Linda and Tom Merchant, truck drivers and neighbors near Sand Hill Road, said the plan isn’t realistic, especially when accounting for the weather, traffic, accidents and inspections.
Process “unfair”
The third continued hearing drew resident criticism of the plan to clear almost 23 acres of woodland and add construction and truck traffic in an area that is currently forested and near a residential neighborhood.

More than 70 attended the meeting Thursday night with an additional 58 joining remotely, according to town officials.
Emotions ran high from the start of the four-hour long meeting as the chair of the volunteer seven-member board administered an oath calling for civility and limited comments to two minutes.
Speakers cited health and environmental concerns and highlighted Amazon’s record of hazardous and low-paying working conditions in continued opposition to the proposed project.
Those who live by the proposed site “will be directly impacted by its noise and air pollutants, and will suffer traffic safety impacts and congestion impacts,” said Jim Dumont, a Bristol-based attorney representing 23 Essex residents and a newly formed nonprofit called ACRES, an acronym for Alliance of Concerned Residents Envisioning Solutions.
Residents also pointed to the fire department’s March recommendation that the project be required to complete the road connecting the end of Kimo Drive to Thomson Drive. Without it traffic will be forced to one choke point, causing “substantial risk for crashes in winter”  and increased traffic on Saxon Hill Road.
Residents were particularly upset when the board cut short public comment around 8 p.m. to go into a private deliberative session — but not an executive session — that ran two hours.
“It’s a kangaroo court,” Dumont called out as members left the room.

“I’ve seen enough stuff here that undermines my confidence in this town’s governance, in particular over Saxon Hill,” said Bruce Post, a former selectboard member.
As residents and the consultants waited late into the evening for the board to resume, the owners of Phoenix Books, which has stores in Essex and Burlington, provided pizza and seltzer.
Many said they were upset they haven’t been given the same courtesy of time and information as the developers. 
The applicants had known about the meeting since June 10, but the town didn’t post the agenda until one hour after the window for submitting written testimony had passed last Friday, Barlow said.
“The process has been unfair,” he said. “So by the time we knew that this meeting was happening, we couldn’t even submit a letter.”
The public has until 9 a.m. the Friday before a scheduled meeting to provide any written comment, according to Katherine Sonnick, the town’s community development director. The agenda and packet are published around midday Friday, after which no new information can be provided to the board.
The continued public hearing — possibly July 17 — will be confirmed by Monday, Sonnick wrote in an email Friday.

Although the area was rezoned industrial 50 years ago, the 22.94-acre lot off Thompson Drive eyed for the project in Saxon Hill is largely undeveloped, consisting mostly of woodlands and meadows where Vermonters bike and hike, and has historically been mined for sand and used as a tree farm, Scanell’s memo, dated Jan. 30, states.
The lot was established in March after the Development Review Board approved a five-lot subdivision as Phase 2 of the Saxon Hill Industrial Park.
As public opposition to the Amazon facility gathers steam in Essex, Ken Signorello, the chair of the town’s conservation and trails committee, has written a protest song. “With buffers cleared, paradise gets lost to make a parking lot for Amazon town,” he sings, strumming a guitar in the woods of Saxon Hills.

(Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)The ACLU of Idaho on Thursday sued Idaho government officials over a new state law that will prevent unauthorized immigrants from accessing publicly funded assistance.
The new law, approved by the Idaho Legislature this year through House Bill 135, takes effect on Tuesday. It will cut the few publicly funded services that unauthorized immigrants can receive in the state. 
ACLU’s lawsuit in federal court seeks to stop Idaho from applying the expanded immigration status check requirement for HIV treatment, alleging the new state law is unconstitutional by violating equal protection, conflicts with federal laws and even denies federal funds to people eligible under federal law.
The lawsuit requests temporary judicial blocks — saying without the care, patients could die.
“Nobody benefits from barring access to life-saving HIV medication,” Dr. Abby Davids, an Idaho doctor who is part of the lawsuit and works at Full Circle Health, said in a statement. “Both for individual patients and for the health of our community as a whole, all people living with HIV need to be able to access consistent care and treatment. Infections like HIV do not infect people based on their immigration status, and treatment should not be limited by legal status, either.”

 Lawsuit filed against Idaho Health and Welfare, attorney general, other officials

Joined by the National Immigration Law Center, and the private law firms Nixon Peabody LLP and Ramirez-Smith Law, ACLU is representing five immigrants and a doctor in Idaho. The lawsuit seeks class-action status to protect all people who are and could receive treatment through the federally funded programs.
ACLU’s lawsuit is against Idaho health officials, including Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Alex Adams, along with Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador.
“We are still reviewing the lawsuit and will respond in court after we have had a chance to fully review the complaint and other documents filed,” Idaho Attorney General Office spokesperson Damon Sidur told the Idaho Capital Sun on Friday.
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter declined to comment, saying the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
In a news conference Friday, ACLU of Idaho Legal Director Paul Carlos Southwick called the lawsuit a start. But he said the group learned about, and plans to sue over, another program that Health and Welfare plans to apply the new immigration check law to — the food assistance program for Women, Infants and Children, called WIC.
“We’ve essentially been having to pull this info from (the health department)” and service providers, Southwick said.
 Idaho health department hasn’t said what immigration statuses will be approved, lawsuit alleges

For people who apply for public assistance benefits in Idaho, state agencies are largely required to verify lawful presence. 
But the new law will remove some exceptions for certain services, requiring state agencies to verify someone’s immigration status for access to health assistance for immunizations, communicable disease testing and treatment, prenatal and postnatal care, and food assistance for dependent children. 
Emergency services will remain exempt from the immigration status verification requirement under the new law.

The lawsuit alleges the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare has not responded to the suing doctor’s questions about what immigration statuses would be considered “lawfully present.”
One of the immigrants suing Idaho officials, identified only as K.P. in the lawsuit, fears that her employment authorization document and pending asylum application “are not sufficient to satisfy the immigration status verification requirements” under the bill. 
Because of treatment through Full Circle Health, her HIV is undetectable — and she won’t transit the virus to people who don’t have it, the lawsuit says. When she was pregnant, her medication prevented her from transmitting HIV to her daughter, the lawsuit says. 
Her next refill is scheduled for July 8 — a week after the bill takes effect. 
Southwick, with ACLU of Idaho, said in a statement the new law is the second unconstitutional Idaho bill the group has sued over this year. A federal judge swiftly blocked an Idaho immigration enforcement law soon after it took effect — in response to an ACLU of Idaho lawsuit. 
The public benefits bill “is designed to dehumanize our immigrant neighbors by denying them the basic necessities of life — medicine, food, and shelter. It subverts constitutional rights and interferes with federal regulation of immigration,” Southwick said. “… It is part of the state’s campaign to displace immigrant residents, which will separate families and inflict lasting trauma. The state’s actions are legally indefensible and morally wrong.”

“On behalf of my children and myself, I want to express our deepest sympathies to the Hortman and Hoffman families. Our condolences are with all who are grieving during this unimaginably difficult time, and we are praying daily for them,” Jenny Boelter wrote.
Authorities found lists written by Vance Boelter with the names and addresses of Democratic public officials, suggesting the attack was politically motivated. Boelter is alleged to have impersonated a police officer, visiting the homes of Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope and Rep. Kristin Bahner in Maple Grove in addition to the Hortmans and Hoffmans. Rest and Bahner were not harmed.
Vance Boelter texted his wife and other family members in the early hours of June 14, writing that he “went to war last night” and that “there’s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don’t want you guys around.”
Jenny Boelter wrote that she and her family were “absolutely shocked, heartbroken and completely blindsided” by the attack and that it was “a betrayal of everything we hold true as tenets of our Christian faith.”
The statement says that Jenny Boelter received a call from law enforcement on June 14 and met with agents at a gas station. She said she answered questions, provided requested items and cooperated with searches.
“From the moment we were first contacted by law enforcement, we have fully cooperated with investigators and responded to their every request…We thank law enforcement for apprehending Vance and protecting others from further harm,” the statement said.
Vance Boelter was arrested the day after the assassination and has been charged with murder by both Hennepin County and federal prosecutors.
Jenny Boelter has retained legal representation from Halberg Criminal Defense, according to the statement. The law firm’s website says that it has taken on “many of the ‘high-profile’ cases in Minnesota.”

Joni Ernst uses Monopoly-themed props to advocate for legislation selling federal properties. (Screenshot from Sen. Ernst's YouTube channel) Iowans in Congress applauded the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision Friday to limit the power of federal courts to curb executive orders.
Also this week, Iowa Democrats also criticized tax credit cuts during “worst” agricultural trade deficit, Sen. Joni Ernst played “Washington-opoly” with “underutilized” federal properties, and Iowa’s delegation introduced many new bills.
The Supreme Court voted 6-3 Friday to narrow the scope of three universal injunctions passed by federal courts in Massachusetts, Washington and Maryland. These three courts passed injunctions halting the enforcement of Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S.
The decision does not address the constitutionality of ending birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants or children of parents with a temporary visa. The opinion also determined that Trump’s executive order can’t be put into effect for at least 30 days from Friday, providing time for legal challenges.
Here’s how Iowa lawmakers responded:
“Today’s decision is a significant step towards addressing the bipartisan problem of universal injunctions. I’m heartened to hear a supermajority of the Supreme Court echo what I’ve said repeatedly: judges’ constitutional authority is limited to deciding cases and controversies,” Sen. Chuck Grassley stated in a press release.  
“It’s a bad day to be an activist judge, but a great day for the American people,” said Rep. Ashley Hinson on X. “The Supreme Court correctly ruled that activist judges should not be able to unilaterally dictate national policy and stand in the way of the Trump agenda that over 70 million people voted for, including ending birthright citizenship. The days of illegal immigrants abusing birthright citizenship are numbered thanks to President Trump’s leadership.”
“I applaud the Supreme Court’s ruling to curb nationwide injunctions,” said Rep. Randy Feenstra in a post on X. “This decision will rein in the power of district court judges and restore the voice of the people. Americans elected President Trump and want to see his America First policies implemented and upheld.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissenting opinion stating that: “The majority ignores entirely whether the President’s executive order is constitutional, instead focusing only on the question whether federal courts have the equitable authority to issue universal injunctions. Yet the order’s patent unlawfulness reveals the gravity of the majority’s error and underscores why equity supports universal injunctions as appropriate remedies in this kind of case.”
Iowa Democrats criticize tax credit cuts during ‘worst’ agricultural trade deficit
The Iowa Democratic Party, in a press release Wednesday, criticized the clean energy tax cuts outlined in the “big, beautiful” budget bill. Without clean energy tax credits, Iowa’s economy will take an additional hit at a vulnerable time, the party argues.
The release cites a study by Farm Bureau indicating U.S. agricultural trade debt for January to April 2025 clocked in at $19.7 billion, “the largest ever recorded for the first four months of a year.” Currently, $238 million in economic activity is “under threat” by clean energy tax credit cuts outlined in the Republican budget bill, according to the study. 
The release includes a survey from Wallethub,  which ranked Iowa’s state economy in last place for 2025. “This news could not have come at a worse time,” the Democrats’ release states.
“It’s time for Iowa’s representatives in Congress to stand up to Donald Trump, end his disastrous trade policies, and get to work on a new farm bill,” Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in the release. “Our farmers deserve leadership that will end this nonsense and let them make a living doing what they do best — feeding the world.” 
Ernst calls for selling ‘underutilized’ federal property
Sen. Joni Ernst introduced the FOR SALE act Wednesday to sell six vacant or “underutilized” federal properties in Washington D.C. In a press release, Ernst claimed selling the properties would generate $400 million in revenue and cancel over $2.9 billion in “overdue maintenance.”
Three of the six properties for sale are currently headquarters to cabinet agencies:
The James V. Forrestal Building, headquarters for the U.S. Department of Energy, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Hubert H. Humphrey Jr. building and the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, home to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
“The nonpartisan Public Buildings Reform Board says Washington’s ‘wasteful real estate practices would not endure for so long in a private sector company,” Ernst said on the Senate floor Thursday. “But when playing Washington-opoly, Uncle Sam doesn’t pay the costs for his wasteful decisions, you do!”
Nunn-led act to reduce regulations for small and mid-sized businesses unanimously passes House
Rep. Zach Nunn’s bipartisan ELEVATE act seeks to “reduce bureaucratic red-tape” for small and mid-sized businesses trying to raise capital investment. This bill will allow “emerging growth companies” to submit two years of audited financials instead of three when and seeks to reduce the cost and time burden of capital investment. The legislation was unanimously passed by House members Monday.
“When investment capital gets trapped on the coasts by large firms and D.C. regulators, it’s Iowa’s small businesses that suffer,” Nunn said in a press release. “The ELEVATE Act is a commonsense fix that would level the playing field for Iowa entrepreneurs looking to grow.”
Miller-Meeks reintroduces legislation to shield manufacturers from wildfire-related lawsuits 
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks reintroduced a bill to make manufacturers of critical infrastructure immune to wildfire-related lawsuits, “unless there is clear evidence of willful misconduct.” The bill was initially introduced by Miller-Meeks in 2024, but did not pass the House.
“No manufacturer should be driven out of business for building the components that power our homes, hospitals, and national defense,” said Miller-Meeks in a press release. “This bill protects the men and women who make the grid work, from transformers to transmission lines, and ensures they’re not punished for natural disasters beyond their control.”
Hinson reintroduces legislation to improve flood and drought mitigation
The Flood Resiliency and Land Stewardship Act reintroduced by Hinson seeks to bolster flood and drought mitigation programs through existing U.S. Department of Agriculture conservation programs. This bill would amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to include flood prevention and mitigation measures through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program.
“At the federal level, we must pursue proactive solutions that prioritize commonsense mitigation and flood prevention efforts to help save lives and livelihoods in the event of severe weather. While we can’t predict the weather, we can ensure we are prepared,” said Hinson in a press release. “I will continue working across the aisle to deliver certainty and protect our communities, businesses, and agriculture.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screen-Shot-2025-06-27-at-4.01.23-PM-1024x554.png,,,2025-06-27 18:07:21.093856

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) Legislative Education Study Committee staff members Friday outlined their role in supporting the Public Education Department’s work in developing a plan for improving educational opportunities for at-risk New Mexico students.
LESC Director John Sena provided lawmakers with an update to the ongoing landmark Yazzie/Martinez educational equity case this week as they met in Roswell for the latest interim committee meeting. The remedial plan marks the latest court development in the lawsuit, which found in 2018 that the state was failing to provide low-income students, Native American students, English language learners and students with disabilities equitable education and services.
First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson ordered the PED to develop the plan after parties returned to court in April to discuss the plaintiffs motion of non-compliance, filed in September 2024. Plaintiffs pointed to ongoing poor student performance and high turnover within the PED and proposed the LESC take the lead in developing an action plan. These specific markers were identified in a recent Legislative Finance Committee report shared with lawmakers this month.

Wilson agreed that a plan was needed, but decided that the PED would lead the development as the LESC is not a party in the case and the court does not have jurisdiction over the agency. However, the LESC was invited to assist the education department.
Sena shared a memo with lawmakers that the LESC sent to PED Secretary Mariana Padilla earlier this month that stated that agency staff would assist in an “advisory and technical role” by providing “nonpartisan research and fiscal analysis.” 
The memo also outlined several areas staff members will focus on, including participating in stakeholder meetings; providing relevant studies, original staff analysis and research concerning the at-risk student populations; identifying sections of state law that might need to be addressed; providing cost analysis for plan components; helping to identify characteristics of a suitable external consultant; and providing legislative context to the PED and consultant. 
“What we wanted to do for you all, as well as for clarity in terms of our partnership with the department, is say explicitly the kinds of things that we could do as staff to support that process so that there’s no muddiness around who’s doing what and who’s responsible for things. This is what we can lend our support to do,” Sena said during the meeting. 
The memo also noted that regular “coordination meetings” between the PED, LESC and external consultants would be beneficial.
The first deadline Wilson identified is July 1, by which PED is expected to identify an external consultant to develop the remedial plan. According to the LESC’s June newsletter, the PED issued a request for interest for a consultant and asked applicants to “describe their proposed approach to stakeholder engagement and how they would work with PED’s cabinet and legal counsel to develop a plan.”
PED spokesperson Janelle Garcia told Source NM that Padilla is in the process of communicating with applicants, but said a formal announcement of the chosen consultant will likely not be made until July 1.
Sena told lawmakers Friday that the PED received 10 to 14 applications and that the applicant pool was diverse, including national and New Mexico-based organizations. Once identified, the consultant will schedule meetings with stakeholders to help inform aspects of the plan.
“We have a really passionate group of what I like to call the usual suspects in education. These are folks who are really invested and we see them at our meetings, we see them at a lot of other stakeholder engagement opportunities.  Their voices are very powerful and important,” Sena said. “But I think it’s also important that we make sure we’re hearing from community members and a diverse group of folks that maybe we don’t always hear from, and so we’ll be putting that feedback forward for the [PED] to consider.”
The next deadline is Oct. 1, when the PED is expected to provide the court with a draft remedial plan. The department then has another month to finalize the plan. Plaintiffs then have until Dec. 1 to file objections to the plan with the court.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Yazzie-and-Travis-Mckenzie-embrace-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 18:07:21.093856

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)In the nearly 50 years since Alaskans overwhelmingly voted to create the Alaska Permanent Fund,  it has become a globally recognized sovereign wealth fund and a household name for every  Alaskan. It symbolizes the conservative nature and strength of character of our forebears, who  saved a portion of their generation’s money earned from Alaska’s natural resources to provide  financial benefits for all generations to come. The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation and our  dedicated team are tasked with and committed to protecting and growing the Permanent Fund for the benefit of every Alaskan. 
Alaska’s Permanent Fund has been an incredible success in achieving the shift from one-time resource revenue to a source of investment-driven renewable revenue. The first annual deposit of oil royalty revenue into the Permanent Fund was $734,000 in 1977. In the years since then, nearly $20 billion of state resource revenues have been saved and are part of the constitutionally protected principal of the Permanent Fund. An impressive achievement for our state, but dwarfed when compared to the investment performance during the same time frame that generated earnings totaling over $105 billion from our resource revenue savings.  
Fund earnings have been appropriated to pay the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, grow and inflation proof the Permanent Fund’s principal, and provide for state services. The permanently  protected principal has grown to $58.8 billion through royalty deposits, inflation proofing, and special appropriations. $47.5 billion has been paid out to support dividends and funding for  state services, and the balance of earnings has yet to be used.  











If you only fish for king salmon, you have a higher probability of a bad run and doing without than if you  also target sockeye, coho, dog, and pink salmon.



	The Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation’s investment strategies and tactics are designed to make  sure that Alaskans consistently benefit from their fund in as broad a swath of economic times as  possible. At the heart of APFC’s strategy is an investment tactic referred to as diversification, or the practice of having a variety of investments that react differently from one another.  
Diversification is a means of stabilizing returns and mitigating risk. Many aspects of Alaskan life are great examples of this strategy. Take fishing, for example. If your goal today is to catch  enough salmon to feed your family through winter, you will better your chances by going after more than one species to reduce the potential risks of poor returns for any one species. If you only fish for king salmon, you have a higher probability of a bad run and doing without than if you  also target sockeye, coho, dog, and pink salmon. The diversification of the salmon species, habitat, foods, and run seasons creates greater assurance of catching than any single species can.  Diversification in investing is achieved by spreading investments across different types of assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, infrastructure and private companies. As a result, if one part of  the market hits a rough patch, the entire fund isn’t dragged down with it. 
The board of trustees reviewed the fund’s overall investment mix at their most recent quarterly meeting. After thoughtful discussion and input from APFC staff and external advisors, the board maintained the current targets across the fund’s eight asset classes. This decision reflects our commitment to managing the fund for long-term performance to generate risk-aware returns while recognizing the importance of the annual 5% draw supporting state services and dividends.  While the board sets the allowed investments, it is the APFC team that brings the strategy to life. Our staff works every day to navigate changing markets and make careful decisions within the guardrails set by policy. This flexibility allows us to respond to economic shifts while staying  focused on the long-term goal: protecting and growing the fund for generations of Alaskans.  
Since the creation of the Alaska Permanent Fund, Alaskans have demanded a conservative  approach to investing that provides long-term security and the ability to better withstand  inflationary and global economic swings. This approach means we aren’t putting all our assets in one type of investment but rather a diversified group of investments designed to have the highest chance of providing regular recurring funding for all of us today and for future generations of Alaskans.

Gavin Newsom for his signature, but it won’t take effect unless the Legislature makes changes to housing and infrastructure development rules that he has demanded.","In summary
A state budget is headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom for his signature, but it won’t take effect unless the Legislature makes changes to housing and infrastructure development rules that he has demanded.


After days of confusion in which a deal with Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to unravel over his demand to include new housing and infrastructure regulations, the California Legislature passed an updated state budget on Friday.
With the start of a new fiscal year looming on July 1, budget negotiations — already challenged by a $12 billion and growing deficit — dragged on this week as Newsom and legislative leaders struggled to reach an agreement on waiving state environmental reviews for priority projects.
The details of that proposal were only made public Friday morning, hours before the budget vote, despite a poison pill that would invalidate the entire $321 billion spending plan if the Legislature does not also approve the infrastructure proposal, Senate Bill 131. Lawmakers are expected to take it up on Monday, alongside the housing measure Newsom sought, Assembly Bill 130, which was unveiled and then amended this week following fierce blowback from organized labor.
Officials involved in those negotiations have been loath to explain why the budget process staggered to such an odd and protracted conclusion this year, even as California is now set to adopt sweeping changes to how it builds without much public notice. Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas refused to speak with reporters after the vote.
“I’m not going to comment on the process or any of that,” state Sen. Scott Wiener, the San Francisco Democrat who leads the Senate budget committee and was a driving force behind the infrastructure proposal, told CalMatters on Friday. “The people of California, I don’t think they care much about the timing. They just want us to deliver on making their lives more affordable.”
The Legislature, which already passed its own version of the budget earlier this month to meet a constitutional deadline, voted along largely partisan lines to approve the deal with Newsom. It will freeze enrollment of undocumented immigrants in California’s health care program for the poor, but relies on reserves and internal borrowing to avoid many other cuts to services that Democratic legislators opposed.
Republicans criticized the secretive deliberations and last-minute changes, noting that even some Democrats publicly complained this week about being sidelined from discussions with hugely consequential policy implications.
“I have been involved in more than a dozen public-sector budgets,” state Sen. Roger Niello, a Roseville Republican, said on the Senate floor. “I have to say, this is the worst experience that I’ve had relative to navigating frustrations of the lack of transparency.”
But Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, an Encino Democrat who leads the Assembly budget committee, laughed off the drawn-out dealmaking, which he compared to one of his pregnant staffers.
“She was actually due to give birth five days ago, and so we’ve been having a debate in our office about which would come first: budget or baby,” Gabriel said on the Assembly floor. “Right now it looks like budget is going to win.”
California’s landmark environmental law at stake
The high-stakes showdown began last month, when Newsom endorsed two contentious pro-development bills by Bay Area Democrats and announced that he would fold them into the budget. Both make changes to the California Environmental Quality Act, which requires governments to study the environmental impacts of new housing and infrastructure projects they approve.
The five-decade-old law is sacrosanct to environmentalists, but critics argue that it has driven up the cost of building in California because studies and subsequent legal challenges, sometimes brought by construction unions or other groups that want concessions from developers, can take years to resolve. Newsom has framed his approach as a crucial reform to fix the state’s housing affordability crisis.
While the leadership of the Assembly got on board, the proposals were met with more skepticism in the Senate, where there is a growing rift among Democrats over whether simplifying project approvals without setting terms for affordable housing and labor standards is a giveaway to developers.

That prolonged the budget negotiations, even as Newsom and legislative leaders reached a difficult compromise on spending cuts.
When the budget bill eventually went into print on Tuesday, so that legislators would have enough time to pass it before July 1, officials were still haggling over the details of the infrastructure proposal. To ensure discussions would continue, Newsom demanded the inclusion of an unusual line stating that the budget “shall be inoperative and repealed” if SB 131 is not signed into law by June 30 at 11:59 p.m., though the measure was empty at that point.
The version that finally landed on Friday reduces the number of documents that projects must provide for their environmental reviews. It also eliminates the reviews entirely when cities rezone neighborhoods to meet their state-mandated housing goals, as well as for building a potpourri of other projects: farmworker housing, sewer systems in disadvantaged communities, broadband internet, public parks and trails, rural health clinics, food banks, advanced manufacturing facilities, day care centers and stations for the high-speed rail project.
‘Critical’ housing reforms
The related housing measure, intended as a grand political bargain to speed up construction in cities, threw another late wrench into the budget process.
It would exempt most new apartment buildings in already developed urban areas from environmental reviews, provided they meet local zoning rules. To secure support from organized labor, the bill originally created new wage floors for projects taking advantage of the law.
But powerful unions representing construction workers revolted after the proposal was introduced this week Their members crowded into hearings at the Capitol, casting it as a betrayal that would undercut higher “prevailing wage” standards that have long existed for publicly funded projects. Many Democratic lawmakers, who are closely allied with organized labor, eviscerated the measure.
Newsom and legislative leaders scrambled to contain the fallout. Amendments to the bill late Thursday stripped out the wage provisions while requiring projects taller than 85 feet or those that have 100% affordable units to offer prevailing wages if they want to access the expedited approval process. But that means many small apartment projects could sidestep environmental reviews without having to pay higher wages of any kind.
The bill retains another provision that unions asked for, giving them the right to take contractors to court for workers compensation, insurance and payroll tax violations.
Newsom praised the development proposals on Friday as a “triumph” and “one of the most significant housing reforms in California history” — so important to fixing the state’s shortage of affordable homes that they needed to be pushed through as quickly as possible.
“I did it because it’s critical and it’s essential that it was done,” Newsom told reporters in a virtual press conference. “We’ve got to get out of our own damn way.”

,DC,2025-06-27 21:36:55+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Weekend work on the mega-bill: first vote in US Senate as soon as Saturday,"Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/weekend-work-mega-bill-first-vote-us-senate-soon-saturday,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans appear ready to take an initial vote on their “big, beautiful bill” as soon as Saturday, which would set up final passage within a couple of days — though Majority Leader John Thune called the timeline “aspirational.”GOP senators have been negotiating the sweeping tax and spending cuts package for weeks, trying to ensure the dozens of provisions meet the complex rules for writing a reconciliation bill and can garner the support needed to actually become law.“We are continuing to explore options on all the outstanding issues,” Thune said Friday afternoon. But several Republican senators leaving a closed-door working lunch that lasted more than two hours told reporters they expect to see the final bill text possibly by Friday night before taking their first procedural vote at noon Eastern on Saturday.Republicans were still going back and forth with the Senate parliamentarian throughout the day as they tried to rework numerous policy changes she deemed not compliant with the guardrails for a reconciliation bill.The special legislative process gets Republicans around the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, but means the successful policy provisions need to have an effect on federal revenues, spending or the debt limit.There were still various outstanding disputes among GOP senators about how exactly the bill should be structured. If those are not resolved before amendment debate begins, it could lead to Republicans publicly splitting on issues related to Medicaid, tax policy and several other issues.Public lands, Medicaid provider taxMontana Sen. Steve Daines said he’s still waiting to see whether the parliamentarian accepts a revised proposal from Utah Sen. Mike Lee that would lead to a sell-off of some public lands.Daines didn’t want to comment on whether he’d bring up an amendment to strike the language from the bill, if it makes it into the final version of the package.""He's got to get it in the bill first. So it's a hypothetical at this point,” Daines said. “I think there's some trouble getting it through the parl. So I think that's the most likely scenario.”North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said he believes Republicans have successfully reworked language addressing a change to the maximum percentage that states can set their Medicaid provider tax rate at. An earlier version reducing that rate from 6% to 3.5% over time was blocked by the parliamentarian. ""We think we've got it fixed, yeah. It's just like on a number of these issues. We think we have it fixed. We don't have the final word,” Hoeven said. “That's what we talked about earlier. We think we'll have the final word on this by the end of today, so we can start tomorrow.""The Medicaid provider tax rate would normally be considered in-the-weeds, but has become a central debate within the GOP amid major concerns about how changes would affect rural health care systems.Republicans may have also agreed to a final figure for a rural hospital fund meant to help offset the impact of Medicaid changes in the bill. That number will likely be higher than a previously floated $15 billion, but Hoeven didn’t say what the compromise will be. “The number you all saw is $15 billion. It's going to be bigger than that,” Hoeven said. “But I don't have a specific number yet.”Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins has been pressing for that fund to be at least $100 billion.SALT talksHoeven said that during the lunch, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., advocated for a $40,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, or SALT, for five years. The issue, also somewhat obscure, is crucial to the Senate bill making it back through the House, where GOP lawmakers from higher-tax states have been adamant the bill must help their constituents.Hoeven said the goal is to reach final agreement among Republicans and clear those changes with the parliamentarian, so the Senate can take its procedural vote on the bill Saturday around noon.Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin said he thinks both chambers are getting close to reaching a final deal on the state and local tax deduction.“We still have some talking to do in the Senate, but I think we're getting close,” Mullin said, declining to get into numbers. Senators, he said, are planning to take the procedural vote around noon Saturday, setting up an amendment voting session that can last upwards of 12 hours and might begin later that day or Sunday morning.“There's a discussion about starting it earlier in the morning than in the middle of the night,” Mullin said. “So who knows?”The bill clearing the House could come shortly after the Senate passes its version of the package, since that chamber’s 72-hour rule starts winding down once the Senate’s bill text is released, not once the Senate actually passes it.“Putting on my hat from the House side. The 72-hour rule may not even have to be applied here because we're amending the bill that's already been put out,” Mullin said. “But I think what Speaker Johnson wants to do is give adequate time to go through it, which would be kind of a 72-hour rule anyway.”Artificial intelligenceTexas Sen. Ted Cruz also said he expects the chamber will take the procedural vote around noon Saturday.Cruz expressed confidence that a section in his committee’s bill preventing state and local governments from regulating artificial intelligence if they want part of a $500 million fund will survive a possible floor amendment.“The provision is in the bill and I believe it will be in the final bill that passes,” Cruz said, appearing to brush aside weeks of criticism from fellow GOP lawmakers. Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno was optimistic that both chambers will be able to pass the package before the party’s self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.“Look, ultimately, at the end of the day, we'll be in good shape. We're going to get a bill across the finish line,” Moreno said. “The sausage-making can be ugly, but the final product is delicious.”Sen. Ron Johnson was not as upbeat as some of his colleagues, storming up the steps just outside the closed-door lunch after it wrapped up, not wanting to speak to reporters.“Notice I'm not really wanting (to) talk right now,” the Wisconsin Republican said.“Go back downstairs,” he told a large group of reporters.Asked about the timing of the procedural vote this weekend, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley said, ""it's going to be brought up ... there's no question about that.”“The question is, on final passage, will we need the vice president?” Grassley said. “And I'm glad he's a Republican, but we gotta get it passed.”",,,,2025-06-27 18:07:21.093856

(South Dakota Searchlight photos)With just under a year to go before the 2026 primary election, Republican political dominoes have begun to fall in South Dakota.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson said Friday that he’ll make a “political announcement” Monday — widely expected to be a run for governor. 
Earlier Friday, state Attorney General Marty Jackley said he’s “preparing to run” for the seat Johnson will apparently vacate.
Jackley made his announcement to KELOLAND news in a story published Friday morning, saying “the fight is in Washington.”
“From fentanyl and methamphetamine pouring across the southern border to public corruption and wasteful spending in Washington, I want to work with President Trump to find solutions,” Jackley said in a KELO video.
Hours later, Johnson sent a press release saying he’ll make his own announcement at noon Monday at the Canopy by Hilton in Sioux Falls. He did not specify what he will announce.


Let us know what you think...


 

For Johnson, a run for governor would be the culmination of a political journey two decades in the making. The 48-year-old is in the midst of his fourth term in the U.S. House after previously serving as an elected member of South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission from 2004 to 2011. He served as chief of staff to then-Gov. Dennis Daugaard from 2011 to 2014 and then worked in the private sector for Vantage Point Solutions, a telecommunications company in Mitchell, prior to his election to Congress.
Johnson brings a load of campaign cash to the race, with more than $6 million of total money spread among his federal campaign committee and several federal or state political action committees.
Jackley, 54, previously served as U.S. attorney for South Dakota and then as attorney general, but his political career was interrupted by a loss to Kristi Noem in the 2018 Republican gubernatorial primary race. Jackley was again elected attorney general in 2022.
It was Noem’s departure from the governor’s office in January — with two years left in her final term — that triggered the current maneuvering in the South Dakota Republican Party. Noem is now leading the federal Department of Homeland Security.
Noem’s lieutenant governor, Larry Rhoden, took over as governor and is serving the remainder of Noem’s term. He has not announced whether he will seek the party’s nomination for governor in the June 2026 primary.
Two other candidates have already announced their bids for the Republican gubernatorial nomination: state House Speaker Jon Hansen and Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden. Robert Arnold, a 19-year-old college student, has announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination.
Jackley is the first candidate to publicly announce his intention to run for the U.S. House. 
Jackley’s announcement will trigger a race for attorney general. Other major offices up for election next year in South Dakota include the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Mike Rounds, who is expected to seek reelection. Democratic businessman and former state trooper Julian Beaudion is seeking his party’s nomination to challenge Rounds. Brian Bengs, who ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat against U.S. Sen. John Thune in 2022, has said he will run as an independent next year against Rounds.

Vermont schools are slated to receive $17 million in federal Covid-19 funds that were canceled by the Trump administration in March. 
The U.S. Department of Education reversed its decision to cancel the funding after a lawsuit led by 16 states and the District of Columbia, according to a Friday press release from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The decision also reinstates about $2.5 billion in K-12 funding for schools across the nation derived from the American Rescue Plan Act.
“This means that 19 school districts in our state will now receive funding that had been denied so that they can go forward with a wide variety of projects: summer programs, afterschool programs, school renovation,” Sanders said in a video message.

Sanders, who serves as the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said he spoke several times with Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, urging her to reverse the cuts. He also worked with 19 school districts in the state to present 88 appeals to the fund cancellations.
“The (Vermont Agency of Education) is encouraged by this development and is working diligently to confirm allowable project costs and next steps associated with the announced changes in process. We are committed to continuing to partner closely with every impacted district and will be providing more details and next steps to the field through our weekly office hours,” Toren Ballard, director of policy and communications at the Vermont Agency of Education, told VTDigger following the announcement.
The money, originally allocated through a Covid-19 grant — the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds, or ESSER — had to be spent by Sept. 30, 2024, but the Biden administration approved an extension, so schools could continue using the remaining funds during the 2025-26 school year.
“We used the funds for specific purposes including employing targeted staff for instructional interventions and we also used a considerable portion to fund our summer academy program for students as we were placing an emphasis on learning loss as a result of COVID,” Harwood Unified Union School District Superintendent Mike Leichliter wrote in a statement to VTDigger.
Leichliter said the previously allocated funds have already been used, but the school district is waiting to receive the final $502,000 ESSER grant payment. 
“During a time of tremendous financial stress on our education system in Vermont, if the originally promised federal funds were not released, it would have led to increased pressure on our schools,” he wrote.

The state’s new program was slated to start releasing funds to families for private schooling and other non-public school costs on Tuesday. Now, a judge has temporarily blocked the release of any funds.
The post Judge orders Wyoming to temporarily withhold school voucher payments  appeared first on WyoFile .","A Laramie County District Court judge on Friday blocked Wyoming from releasing funds related to its new universal school voucher program until he issues a written order on a lawsuit against the state.  
The Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act was slated to begin sending out money on Tuesday. Since applications opened in May, Wyoming families have submitted nearly 4,000 student applications. The program would give applicants up to $7,000 annually in public funds for private education costs — though money would go directly from the state to providers.   
However, a June 13 lawsuit filed by the Wyoming Education Association and several parents challenged the program’s constitutionality and asked for a preliminary injunction to block it from going into effect. 
Judge Peter Froelicher granted a temporary injunction Friday. His decision essentially means that while the voucher program can continue to vet and accept applications, it cannot begin to disburse scholarship money. 
“I will take the matter under advisement, issue a written decision,” Froelicher said at the end of the Laramie County District Court hearing. “In the interim, I am going to narrowly enjoin the expenditure of any funds. The program may continue otherwise preparing for the expenditure of funds … I don’t see the harm in that at this point.”
Froelicher believes he can issue his written order by “mid-July-ish,” he said. 
The judge also granted a motion to intervene filed by two Wyoming families represented by EdChoice Legal Advocates and the Institute for Justice. Those families sought to join the state to defend the law so their children can access the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act funds. 
The outcome of the case will shape the landscape of school choice in Wyoming and answer a long-asked question about the state’s constitutional right to give public money to families, regardless of need, for private school costs. 
School choice expansion 
The Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act represents a significant expansion of school choice in the state, offering families $7,000 per child annually for K-12 non-public-school costs like tuition or tutoring. The scholarship also offers money for pre-K costs, but only to income-qualified families at or below 250% of the federal poverty level.
It comes as a school-choice movement mounts nationwide, particularly among conservatives.

Rep. Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie, who sponsored and championed the Steamboat Scholarship bill, called the state’s 2024 education savings account program much too narrow. His 2025 bill, in its original form, made the program universal and dropped the preschool component, statewide assessments or similar nationwide tests for students and a requirement that providers be certified by the Department of Education.
The bill ignited one of the hottest debates of the recent session. It sparked a deluge of constituent feedback, according to lawmakers, both from supporters of school choice and critics who called it an unconstitutional measure that will erode the quality of public education inWyoming. 
Lawmakers transformed it before it passed out of the Legislature; they brought 26 amendments, including 11 that passed. The final version reinstated the assessment requirements, the provider certification and the inclusion of pre-K, though families have to show income need to qualify for that portion. 
Legislators repeatedly questioned the constitutionality of the expanded program. Many also urged the body to hold off and allow the existing ESA program to roll out and work out any bugs before changing it so drastically. 
The lawsuit
Nine parents of school-aged children and the Wyoming Education Association, which represents more than 6,000 of the state’s public school employees, filed the lawsuit June 13. Parents reside in counties across the state. Many have children who receive special education services through public school or are queer or non-binary.
The lawsuit argues the voucher program violates the Wyoming Constitution, which makes public education a paramount state commitment. It asks the court to block the voucher program with a preliminary injunction. 
A previous Wyoming Supreme Court ruling on education funding “found that ‘education is a fundamental right’ in Wyoming, that ‘all aspects of the school finance system are subject to strict scrutiny,’ and that ‘any state action interfering with [the right to equal educational opportunity] must be closely examined before it can be said to pass constitutional muster,’” the lawsuit reads.
This voucher program, the lawsuit asserts, does not pass that muster. That’s because “the state cannot circumvent those requirements by funding private education that is not uniform and that meets none of the required state constitutional standards for education.”
In addition, the program is unconstitutional because it violates constitutional language that allows the state to funnel public funds to private entities only for the necessary support of the poor, the lawsuit reads. 
Parents who signed onto the case oppose the voucher plan due to the harmful impact it will have on their children, according to the lawsuit, “because private schools receiving voucher funding can refuse admission to children with disabilities … and are not required to provide special education services or comply with [individualized education programs].” They are also concerned that private schools can refuse to admit and educate children who identify as queer, transgender or non-binary.

The voucher program will also negatively impact funding at public schools that the parents’ children attend, the lawsuit says, because as students leave public schools, they will lose funding under models that rely on enrollment numbers. 
The Wyoming Legislature has established standards and oversight concerning the nature and quality of education that Wyoming students receive in public schools. But there is no mechanism to authorize Wyoming’s Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder to ensure those same standards and quality are furnished through the voucher program, the lawsuit states.
“Despite charging the Superintendent with administering the Program, the statute explicitly deprives her of any authority to ensure students utilizing the program receive a quality education,” the lawsuit reads. “In effect, the Program is a black box: funds will go in, but except in isolated instances the state and the public will have no way to know what is coming out.”
Nothing in the statute, the lawsuit concludes, “prevents instruction from being perfunctory, or worse.”
The lawsuit comes on the heels of a significant court decision that resulted from another Wyoming Education Association lawsuit filed in 2022. That legal challenge argued that the state violated its constitution by failing to adequately fund public schools and withholding appropriate funding at the expense of educational excellence, safety and security. Eight school districts joined the lawsuit as intervenors to challenge the state.
In that case, Judge Froelicher ruled in favor of plaintiffs and ordered the Legislature to fix a funding formula he determined to be impacting Wyoming children’s right to a proper education.
Defense and intervenors
On Friday, the state’s attorney, Mackenzie Williams, argued that the voucher program does not pose imminent or irreparable harm to the plaintiffs’ right to education, and therefore the judge should not approve a preliminary injunction. 
The voucher program is funded by the general fund, not school funds, he said, “and so I would say it’s not part of the school finance system.”

The real question for the court ultimately to decide, Williams said, is whether or not the Legislature is meeting its constitutional duty to provide adequate education in public schools. If it is, the constitution does not prohibit the Legislature from creating other educational programs, he argued.
Thomas Fisher, representing the intervenors, said the two families he’s representing and thousands of others in Wyoming are “ready and in the process of signing their agreements to receive these ESAs.
“That is the status quo that the plaintiffs seek to upend,” he said, adding that only a clear showing of unconstitutionality plus proof of irreparable harm are sufficient to disrupt that status quo while the case plays out further. 
The pause of those funds, he said, will result in “significant financial harm” for the families expecting and planning on the money.
Following the hearing, Wyoming Education Association President Kim Amen celebrated the court’s “careful approach” in temporarily pausing the program. 
“Preserving the status quo allows time for a thorough review of the legal and constitutional issues involved, which are of great importance to Wyoming’s public education system,” Amen said. “We believe it’s critical that public funds remain dedicated to supporting the public schools that serve 93% of Wyoming’s students.”
Americans For Prosperity Wyoming, which lobbied heavily for the universal school voucher program during the legislative session, condemned Amen’s association Friday for hindering educational choice. 
“Today’s injunction is the latest effort by self-absorbed teachers’ union officials to stand in the way of Wyoming families’ ability to secure the best education possible for their children,” Americans For Prosperity Wyoming State Director Tyler Lindholm said in a statement.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach encouraged the Kansas State Board of Education to remove sex discrimination language from the state’s lunch contracts, the latest in his offensive against gender and identity politics.
In a letter to state education commissioner Randy Watson and board chair Cathy Hopkins, Kobach requested the board “comply with federal law and recent court rulings.” He took issue with wording in contracts for child nutrition and wellness programs, which expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include gender identity and sexual orientation.
“The inclusion of such language in school contracts is not only unnecessary but also contrary to federal law and the recent court ruling,” Kobach said Thursday in a news release.
In his first days in office, President Donald Trump signed executive orders that did away with diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, including broader definitions of gender identity and sex discrimination. Kobach said those orders, along with a Biden-era Title IX court case led by Kobach, are enough to warrant modification of school lunch contracts
The letter comes in the same week Kobach requested the U.S. Department of Education investigate four Kansas school districts that have policies allowing teachers to maintain confidentiality with children who are socially transitioning, which refers to the changes a person makes to the way they present themselves to align with their gender identity.
The four school districts in Kansas City, Olathe, Shawnee Mission and Topeka were the subject of a Title IX complaint from the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies, a conservative nonprofit founded by two former Trump administration officials.
The Kansas State Board of Education is scheduled to meet on July 8 and 9. Its agenda indicates the board will discuss Kobach’s letter at the end of its July 8 meeting.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6170169-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-27 18:07:21.093856

This was the first of two major steps in completing the strategic combination of the two Catholic colleges, the next being approval by the U.S. Department of Education. Presidents of both universities came together with university staff and alumni on the Mount Mercy campus in Cedar Rapids Friday to announce the news and sign a pledge of shared commitment to their missions.
St. Ambrose President Amy Novak said approval is set to come through next summer, which is when the schools will fully combine.
“With the conclusion of this first step, St. Ambrose University now serves as the corporate owner of Mount Mercy University,” Novak said. “This action, however, is not a diminishment of one university or another, but rather a bold affirmation that together, we are all stronger.”

After about 18 months of work, Novak and Mount Mercy University President Todd Olson made the agreement in August 2024 for St. Ambrose in Davenport to eventually own Mount Mercy while maintaining its campus, branding and programming.
Twenty “integration teams” made up of staff, faculty, students, alumni and community members at both campuses have been working together on areas from information technology and back-end business to graduate programs, academic affairs, alumni and more — essentially helping the combination process cross the finish line, Novak said.
The groups vote every two weeks on decisions for the combination, like approving curriculum and the academic calendar. Novak said all the efforts being made are with the commitment to “carry forward the legacy and the charisms of both institutions with reverence” and find a place where everyone belongs.
“This is not simply one plus one equaling two,” Novak said. “This is one plus one equaling four or 10 or something even greater, as new synergies emerge and our shared mission and vision deepens.”
Along with celebration came concerns about how the combination could impact student finances or enrollment, to which Novak responded that tuition will remain the same at Mount Mercy and no scholarship awards will be changed “at this juncture.” Enrollment looks strong at both institutions, she added, though final numbers are not yet available.
Olson said he’s heard from students and families that the combination has inspired “renewed confidence” in the university’s future, which is helping to drive enrollment alongside the addition of a college football team.
Responding to a question about actions in Washington, D.C., impacting the combination process, Olson said current practices and future aspirations of the institutions appeal to “a variety of political perspectives,” as both universities operate based on their values and best practices to help students become professionals prepared for the workplace.
“We believe we are already providing a set of outcomes and services and people that are well-regarded across the political spectrum, and it’s certainly our intention to continue doing that,” Olson said.
The combination has drawn support from business and city leaders as well, Novak said, as it will bring new resources and more opportunities for partnership to the table for community development.
While it will bring benefits across the board to both university communities, Olson said the enduring goal behind Mount Mercy and St. Ambrose coming together is to provide the best possible education for their students and to ensure Catholic higher education’s future in eastern Iowa.
“This day represents a bright path forward for Mount Mercy and for St. Ambrose, and as we march down that path from here, we keep our mission at the center, and we keep our students at the center of our mission,” Olson said.

A Florida man who served his prison sentence handed down more than three years ago for his role in the EB-5 fraud that rocked Vermont is now seeking to shorten the length of his court-ordered supervised release.
An attorney for William Kelly filed a motion this week in federal court in Burlington asking Judge Geoffrey Crawford to end Kelly’s three years of supervised release a year earlier. 
“Mr. Kelly has used this experience to become a more responsible and accountable person,” Robert Goldstein, Kelly’s lawyer, wrote in a court filing. “He has demonstrated the stability and commitment to live a law-abiding life and would be grateful for the opportunity to continue doing so without the restrictions of supervised release.”
Neither Goldstein nor the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Vermont, which prosecuted the case, could be reached Friday for comment.

Crawford sentenced Kelly in April 2022 to 18 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to two charges: conspiracy to commit wire fraud and concealment of material information.
The judge also ordered Kelly to serve three years of supervised release following his prison sentence. The terms of Kelly’s supervised release include regular check-ins with his probation officer and travel restrictions.
Kelly, according to court records, was a key adviser to Ariel Quiros, the former owner of Jay Peak ski resort, and an “assistant in executing decisions” who later took the lead in developing what regulators have termed a “Ponzi-like” scheme.
Kelly was indicted by a federal grand jury in Vermont in May 2019 along with Quiros and Bill Stenger, Jay Peak’s former president and CEO, for his role in a failed biomedical research facility planned for Newport.
More than 160 foreign investors seeking green cards in exchange for their investments each put at least $500,000 into the proposed $110 million facility known as AnC Bio Vermont.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later termed the project “nearly a complete fraud,” leaving the investors out of their investment and no way to meet the job creating requirements to secure their U.S. residency through the EB-5 visa program.
Prosecutors termed Kelly the “consummate fixer” who worked at trying to “outwit” regulators.
Stenger was sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in the case and has since been released. Quiros was sentenced to a five-year prison term that he continues to serve. 
Kelly, according to his attorney’s recent filing, in addition to serving out his prison sentence has roughly one year remaining of his three years of supervised release. 
Kelly, now 76, suffers from several medical conditions, including chronic diabetes and heart disease, the filing stated. 
“Since returning to the community, Mr. Kelly has worked diligently to rebuild and contribute positively,” his attorney wrote in the motion. “His family, church, and community have all been vital in his transformation, and he takes pride in trying to give back to his community in meaningful ways.”
Also, Kelly has been making his required monthly payments on the roughly $8.3 million in restitution that was part of his sentence, the filing stated. 
“Mr. Kelly also intends to continue paying restitution going forward; indeed, these payments are deducted from his social security benefits,” the filing stated.
The document does not specifically state how much Kelly pays monthly toward his restitution. However, other court filings show that the minimum payments were to be 10% of his gross earnings.
Crawford has made no ruling on Kelly’s motion for early termination of his supervised release and it’s not clear when that would take place, or if a hearing will be held on the matter.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)A new report issued by legislative analysts on state election spending prompted a rebuttal to lawmakers Thursday from New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver.
Legislative Finance Committee analysts report the Secretary of State’s office spent funding set aside for 2025 on the 2024 primaries, concluding that while the Department of Finance and Administration approved the action, it potentially meant the Legislature would have to provide additional funds for future costs, and likely violated the state Constitution.
The report notes that the cost of New Mexico elections has nearly tripled in recent years, in part due to major reform efforts by the Legislature allowing the state to manage local elections for cities and counties. The state spent approximately $15 million per election in 2024, according to the report.
Consolidating elections at the state level “can lead to greater efficiency and consistency,” the report says, but also opens the state to further risks. The largest costs in the elections included poll worker salaries, the number of polling locations and rising costs for election equipment.
The report notes the state could save $3.2 million by cutting 285 polling sites.
The report concludes the Secretary of State’s office needs to better predict the costs of elections by collecting more data for specific county costs; establishing further reimbursement guidelines; finding savings on election equipment; and potentially cutting state payments for county-determined polling sites and poll workers.
Toulouse Oliver told lawmakers the one finding of concern — that the office violated the state Constitution with election spending from a $15 million fund created by the Legislature in 2024 — came at the direction of the Department of Finance and Administration and LFC Director Charles Sallee.
“I want to be very clear that was not our idea of how to do things, and in fact, I expressed my opinion that it was very, very bad public policy,” she said.
In an interview with Source, Sallee described Toulouse Oliver’s comments as “pretty misleading testimony in my view.”
Sallee characterized the conversation he had with Toulouse Oliver as one that established the New Mexico Department of Finance Authority’s power to reimburse counties for expenses in the new fiscal year, for prior elections when legislation establishing the state’s $15 million Election Fund went into effect.
“It wasn’t like we told them to overspend; they had already overspent,” Sallee told Source.
Toulouse Oliver on Thursday criticized the report for being rushed, saying it provided “incomplete and premature conclusions.” Toulouse Oliver also noted that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had ranked New Mexico elections first in the nation last year for both security and accessibility.
“This is the first evaluation LFC has conducted on elections and it really failed to reflect the nuance, expertise and complexity,” she said.
In a rebuttal letter submitted alongside the report, Toulouse Oliver wrote: “Cutting funding for elections in New Mexico risks undoing all the great progress that has been made to modernize our elections in recent years and could compromise election security and voter accessibility.”
The recommendations to cut polling places, for example, could require voters to travel longer distances to cast a ballot, she said, adding the placement of voting centers should be left up to the counties.
Toulouse Oliver Legislature requested lawmakers provide funding for operations, as well as  projects for cybersecurity, data collection and education for both voters and county staff.
“We did not have enough money to get through this last pay period this year,” Toulouse Oliver said.
Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) asked Toulouse Oliver if the state would save money by conducting elections fully by mail, which occurs in Colorado, Utah, Washington and Oregon.
Toulouse Oliver said her successor — she is term-limited from running again — would be the best person to consider that change, but said it would most likely cut costs, especially when it comes to pollworkers.
“We’d still need a lot of people to help process those ballots but it wouldn’t be the number we’re using now,” Toulouse Oliver said.
Toulouse Oliver concluded by saying her office was aligned with many of the recommendations put forward.
“We think a lot of the recommendations in this report are good, and a lot of them are things we’re already working on,” she said. “We just need your help to get them over the finish line.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

(File photo by Getty Images)Some 290 South Carolinians will lose their jobs as a pair of lumber mills close in the Pee Dee and Lowcountry.
Canfor Corp. announced Friday it would shutdown two of its South Carolina sawmills — one in Darlington and another in rural Hampton County, near the small town of Estill.
“We understand the significant impact this difficult decision will have on our employees,” Canfor Southern Pine President Lee Goodloe said in a statement.
The Darlington plant employs about 120 people, and the Estill plant employs about 170 people. Layoffs will start Aug. 25 and continue over the next six months, according to filings with the S.C. Department of Employment and Workforce.
Canfor attributed the closure to “persistently weak market conditions and sustained financial losses.”
The company, which operates in the southeastern United States, western Canada and Sweden, suffered a $942 million operating loss in 2024 and $29 million of losses in the first three months of 2025, according to earnings statements. Much of that loss came from U.S. operations and low demand for the southern yellow pine common to South Carolina.
“Looking ahead, North American lumber markets are anticipated to experience continued volatility and uncertainty throughout the second quarter of 2025. Ongoing affordability challenges and tariff-related disruptions to traditional trade flows are projected to result in tepid demand in the near term,” the company wrote in its latest financial report.
Canfor had already curtailed one shift at its Darlington facility and reduced operating hours in Estill.
Lumber mill pledges 125 new jobs in rural Allendale County

In Hampton County, the Estill mill was one of just six employers with more than 100 workers, according to the state employment agency.
But with one loss comes a different gain.
The Estill mill sits just across the county line and less than 15 miles away from a new sawmill planned for Allendale County.
Hampton Lumber announced Tuesday that the town of Fairfax would become home to its first East Coast sawmill, employing 125 South Carolinians. Production is scheduled to begin in 2027.
Canfor continues to operate mills in Camden and Conway, as well as a smaller facility in Marion and a corporate office in Myrtle Beach, according to its website.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wood-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

(Screenshot via Attorney General's X video)Two environmental groups filed a lawsuit in a South Florida federal court on Friday over the immigration detention center under construction in the Everglades that has been dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
They later filed a motion for expedited relief, seeking entry of a temporary restraining order by July 1.
Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed the suit in the U.S. District Court Southern District of Florida against federal, state, and local agencies: the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Florida Division of Management, and Miami-Dade County.
The environmental groups complain the plan has not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law, and that the public has not had an opportunity to comment.
“The site is more than 96% wetlands, surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve, and is habitat for the endangered Florida Panther and other iconic species,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “The scheme is not only cruel, it threatens the Everglades ecosystem that state and federal taxpayers have spent billions to protect.”
The plan has developed at lightning speed. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier first announced “Alligator Alcatraz” in a video posted on his X account eight days earlier, on June 19. In that video, he announced that the facility would hold up to 1,000 undocumented migrants (state officials have since revised that total to as many as 5,000 detainees).
The site is at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport on land owned by Miami-Dade County. The Florida Division of Emergency Management reached out last week to Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and offered to purchase the land for $20 million. Levine Cava said that figure was “vastly lower” than the more recent appraisal of the site, “which is at least $190 million.”
Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Division of Emergency Management, responded that his agency would seize the property pursuant to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ powers originally dating from a January 2023 executive order declaring a state of emergency “due to the mass migration of illegal aliens to Florida.”
Groups claim the plan threatens the restoration of the Everglades 
The two groups claim in the lawsuit that the division holds no independent authority to construct and manage a correctional facility and attempting to do so exceeds the scope of authority granted by Florida law.
They also contend that “the installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services system, industrial high-intensity lighting infrastructure, diesel power generators, substantial fill material altering the natural terrain, and provision of transportation logistics (including apparent planned use of the runway to receive and deport detainees) poses clear environmental impacts” to listed species, wetlands, and surface waters.
Friends of the Everglades is requesting that the court declare that the project violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and stop the state from authorizing or permitting further development or use of the site for purposes of a detention center.
“This plan has had none of the environmental review that’s required by federal law,” said Tania Galloni, managing attorney for the Florida office of Earthjustice, which represents Friends of the Everglades in the lawsuit. “Cruelty aside, it defies common sense to put a mass of people, vehicles, and development in one of the most significant wetlands in the world. That’s why we’re going to court.”
Speaking live from the site on Fox and Friends on Friday morning, DeSantis said the facility could be ready to receive detainees by next Tuesday.
The governor has waved away any environmental threat. “I think people are just trying to say that because they just don’t want Florida assisting with the deportations. There’s a lot of people that want to have open borders. I get that. But that’s not the policy of the state. So, we’re going to do it,” he said Thursday.
Democrats question the timing of the plan
Shortly before the lawsuit was filed, a group of Florida Senate Democrats said that the DeSantis administration withheld the plan from public eye until after lawmakers left Tallahassee earlier this month upon the conclusion of their extended session.
“The announcement of the so-called Alligator Alcatraz has been timed intentionally to avoid legislative oversight,” Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith told reporters in a news conference Friday.
“It’s meant to get Trump’s attention and to distract from the Medicaid dollar-laundering scheme that found this attorney general under intense scrutiny and investigation, even from the Republican-led Florida House of Representatives,” Smith said. “It’s an attempt to distract from his contempt of court charges that he has been facing as well.”
Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman said her caucus was not aware of the plan before it was made public and its quick announcement-to-roll-out “leads me to believe that this was on the books for a much longer time period.”
The narrowly post-session announcement “leads me to believe that that was purposeful and that it was an idea that they intended to move forward with, but they didn’t want it to be done when the Legislature was in session,” Berman said.
The senators remarked on the political aspect of the facility, noting that the Republican Party of Florida is fundraising off the alliterative name, selling T-shirts and other merchandise.
“This isn’t about safety, it’s about scoring more political points by targeting immigrants and fueling fear,” Sen. Shevrin Jones said.
Berman sent a letter to Uthmeier and DeSantis Friday morning contending the plan has the potential to “constitute cruel and unusual punishment.”
“We as Democrats are looking at making Florida more affordable and not spending half a billion dollars on a prison camp in the middle of the Everglades,” Berman said.
She questioned whether DeSantis was using emergency orders in the “spirit” of what they are meant for.
Despite “being done under the guise of an emergency order. And yes, the letter of the law has been followed,” Berman acknowledged. “What is the emergency in the state of Florida, that we need to build this facility under this time frame?”
Smith called it a “dangerous escalation” that “clearly has serious environmental and human rights implications.”
“There’s no way that those temporary facilities that are intended to shelter people after a storm will be sufficient during a storm,” he said, adding that the Division of Emergency Management is involved with this operation during hurricane season.
Neither the governor’s nor attorney general’s office responded to Phoenix requests for comment relating to Democrats’ concerns in time for publication of the story.

(Courtesy of the University of Virginia)In a stunning development that’s igniting fierce political backlash, University of Virginia President Jim Ryan resigned Friday under pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice, which alleged the school had failed to fully dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs — a demand tied to a sweeping federal crackdown on higher education.
The New York Times first reported Ryan’s resignation, citing DOJ claims that the institution had merely rebranded its DEI efforts instead of eliminating them. The university’s Board of Visitors accepted his resignation, with Ryan expected to officially step down by Aug. 15 after becoming the president in 2018. He has not commented publicly.
The move has sparked outrage on campus and across Virginia. A protest led by Wahoos4UVA, a group dedicated to defending the university from political influence, is scheduled at the Rotunda on Friday.
“This unprecedented political interference threatens the independence of our University and its fundamental values,” a letter from the chairs of Wahoos4UVA Advisory Council states. “Whatever reason the Department of Justice gives for taking this action is only a pretext thinly masking a partisan agenda. What’s happening is clear: The Trump administration has made UVA the next target in its escalating attack on higher education in America.”
UVA became the first public university in Virginia to dissolve its DEI office on March 8 after President Donald Trump’s executive order warned of t federal funding cuts for noncompliance.
Opponents of DEI argue hiring and promotions should be merit-based rather than consider race or gender. Supporters say DEI efforts are vital to addressing systematic inequities that have long blocked opportunities for women and people of color and women.
The school has also been under scrutiny for its handling of antisemitism complaints. UVA was among 60 colleges flagged in a federal inquiry over whether it adequately protected Jewish students, prompting additional concerns over potential funding losses.
Virginia Senate Democrats condemned what they called federal overreach, urging university boards to “resist any efforts by the Trump Admin to dictate how Virginia runs its own taxpayer-funded schools.”



Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “UVA is the envy of American public universities,” and called Ryan an “incredible leader.” He added: “Trump’s interference in the operation of Virginia’s universities and any cooperation by those sworn to protect them will not be tolerated by the Virginia Senate.”
U.S. Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine also blasted the DOJ’s involvement, underscoring that Virginia’s economy and prosperity depend on the strength and integrity of the state’s higher education system.
“It is outrageous that officials in the Trump Department of Justice demanded the commonwealth’s globally recognized university remove President Ryan — a strong leader who has served UVA honorably and moved the university forward — over ridiculous ‘culture war’ traps,” the senators stated. “Decisions about UVA’s leadership belong solely to its Board of Visitors, in keeping with Virginia’s well-established and respected system of higher education governance. This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future.”
The UVA Board of Visitors last met June 4-6. Its next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 11-12.

The three new lawsuits, each filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, allege that Lee, which owns hundreds of newspapers and specialty publications in Iowa and 24 other states, is guilty of negligence, breach of an implied contract, unjust enrichment and invasion of privacy.
Each of the three lawsuits is seeking class-action status in pursuit of damages on behalf of thousands of current and former Lee employees whose personal information is believed to have been accessed by cybercriminals. The three named plaintiffs in the cases are Nicole Church of Colona, Illinois; Declan Lawson of Missoula, Montana; and Anthony Bangert of Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuits, on June 3, 2025, Lee began sending letters to current and former employees advising of them that the private information of certain employees had been accessed by others without authorization. The lawsuits allege the letters omitted details such as the cause of the data breach, the system vulnerabilities that had been exploited, and any remedial measures undertaken to guard against additional security breaches.
In one of the cases, the plaintiff asserts the “purported disclosure amounts to no real disclosure at all” in that it fails to provide critical facts surrounding the incident, limiting workers’ ability to take steps to mitigate any damages that might result. Lee, the lawsuits claim, could have prevented the data breach by properly securing and encrypting the files and file servers containing the employees’ private information and by training its employees on standard cybersecurity practices.
The data breach, one of the plaintiffs alleges, could have been avoided had Lee “bothered to implement basic monitoring and detection systems, which then would have stopped the data breach or greatly reduced its impact.”
Lee Enterprises has yet to file a response to the lawsuits, and Tracy Rouch, director of communications for Lee, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
However, Lee has stated that it has incurred $2 million in expenses related to restoring data systems in the wake of the February 2025 cyberattack. The company has also indicated the data breach affected the company’s finances by hampering its ability to bill customers and pay vendors.
The Qilin ransomware group has claimed credit for the attack and alleged that it gained access to 350 gigabytes of data. It also shared samples of what it claimed was data stolen from the company, including contracts, financial spreadsheets, non-disclosure agreements and other confidential files.
In SEC filings and in a filing with the attorney general of Maine, Lee indicated the data breach involved documents containing personally identifiable information related to 39,779 individuals. The documents may include a mix of names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license data, financial account numbers, medical information and health insurance data, according to the Maine attorney general.
The plaintiffs Lawson and Bangert are each represented by the law firm of Shindler, Anderson, Goplerud & Weese of West Des Moines. Church is represented by Josh Christensen of RSH Legal in Cedar Rapids.
 Lee agrees to $9.5 million payout in subscriber case

It’s not the first time data systems at Lee have been hacked. In 2020, Iranian cybercriminals allegedly gained access to the company’s systems as part of a what prosecutors claimed was a campaign to spread disinformation related to the 2020 presidential election. Two Iranian nationals were later charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats. Court records indicate the criminal case remains open and active.
In December 2022, a group of subscribers to Lee newspapers sued the company, alleging it had failed to disclose that their personal identifying information was being captured by various tracking methods embedded in Lee websites and then transferred to the social-media company Facebook where it could be accessed by others.
The lawsuit, which attained class-action status, alleged individuals could use fairly basic web-browsing tools to see the titles of whatever video content had triggered the initial exchange of information between Lee and Facebook, providing an indirect link between named Facebook users and the specific videos those users had watched on Lee websites.
The plaintiffs in that case sought a temporary injunction requiring Lee to immediately remove tracking tools from the company’s websites and to obtain the appropriate consent from subscribers for any information sharing that may take place.
In March 2025, the parties in that case reached a proposed settlement which they presented to the court for preliminary approval.
According to public court filings, the proposed settlement grew out of an all-day mediation session in November 2024 before Judge Wayne R. Andersen in Fort Myers, Florida. Andersen later provided a mediator’s proposal that recommended the matter be resolved by Lee or its insurer paying $9.5 million to settle the case, and the parties agreed.
Court records indicate the proposed settlement involves 1,528,941 paid subscribers to Lee newspapers who accessed video material on a Lee website at any time between December 2020 through March 4, 2025, and who used Facebook during that same period.
In a memorandum supporting court approval of the settlement, the parties state that the “$9,500,000 will yield a significant benefit to each of the participating class members,” while avoiding costly litigation that could drag on for years.
According to the court records, the settlement agreement also requires revisions to Lee’s business practices.
A court hearing on final approval of the settlement agreement is now scheduled for Aug. 7, 2025.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 20:30:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Tong confident on birthright citizenship amid Supreme Court ruling,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/william-tong-supreme-court-birthright-citizenship/,William Tong said he believes the court will declare a ban on birthright citizenship unconstitutional but fears chaos in the near term.,"A U.S Supreme Court decision Friday in a birthright citizenship case joined by Connecticut cast a shadow over the authority of federal judges who repeatedly have frustrated President Donald Trump’s executive orders with nationwide injunctions.
In a 6-3 decision, the court did not resolve the constitutionality of one of Trump’s earliest and most provocative executive orders — a denial of birthright citizenship ensconced in the Constitution and affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Instead, the court faulted district court judges who blocked the order in every state, not just in Connecticut and the other states who challenged it. 
Justice Amy Coney Barrett said, in a majority opinion praised by Trump, that the administration was likely to prevail in its claims that a nationwide or “universal injunction” exceeded the power granted to the judiciary. She acknowledged “some say” it is a check on the Executive Branch.
“But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them. When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too,” Barrett wrote.
William Tong, the attorney general of Connecticut, one of 18 states in a coalition that sued the Trump administration over the birthright order, said he was confident of the court eventually declaring the order to be unconstitutional but feared chaos in the near term.
The court left open the possibility that the ban could take effect after a 30-day period in the dozens of states that did not challenge the order.
“That’s the chaos and the uncertainty that comes from the president’s unlawful executive order,” said Tong. “This entire citizenship regime that we’ve relied on for more than 150 years, it upends it all.”
In a press conference in Hartford and on a separate Zoom call with the attorneys general of California, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Washington, all states that have sued Trump to preserve birthright citizenship, Tong and his colleagues emphasized the limits of the decision.
“The court very clearly did not address the merits of birthright citizenship, and they, in fact, stayed the executive order for another 30 days for everyone. So let’s be clear, birthright citizenship remains the law of the land in states like New Jersey and in every state across the country,” said Matthew Platkin, the attorney general of New Jersey.
Tong, a Chinese-American born in Hartford to immigrant parents, calls the birthright issue personal. There is a uniquely Chinese aspect to the history of birthright citizenship, as established by the 14th Amendment: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”
The full reach of the 14th Amendment was not affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court until 1898, a period of deep anti-Chinese sentiment. Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco, was denied reentry to the U.S. after a trip to China under the Chinese Exclusion Act.
“I’m here this morning, not just because I’m an attorney general and I represent the great state of Connecticut, but because I, too, am Wong Kim Ark. There are millions of Americans who share Wong Kim Ark’s story,” Tong said.
The limited decision was not unexpected, as it resulted from an emergency hearing focused on the reach of the injunctions, not the constitutionality of the president’s executive order. But the attorneys general still expressed disappointment.
“I think the Supreme Court had the opportunity to provide clarity for the entire nation, to reaffirm what has been the law of this land for over 150 years, and missed that opportunity with this order this morning,” said Nick Brown, the attorney general of Washington state. “But what the court did not do was negate any of the substantive arguments that the states made in bringing challenges to this blatantly unconstitutional executive order.”
According to the Congressional Research Service, at least 25 universal injunctions had been issued in response to executive orders issued in the first three months of the second Trump administration, challenging decisions on suspending federal spending, ending diversity programs, firing employees and other actions. 
Every president in recent decades has faced them: The CRS reported 12 nationwide injunctions were issued during the presidency of George W. Bush, 19 during Barack Obama’s presidency, and 55 during the first Trump Administration.
Tong noted that the limit on universal injunctions was doubled-edged. Trump’s allies applauded some previous ones, most notably one that limited the availability of the abortion drug, mifepristone.
“And so I think they have to tread very carefully, because what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. And if they want to go in and open up a can of worms, well, we’re going to open up a can of worms, too,” Tong said.
Tong said the decision had no immediate impact on other injunctions, but he said states that did not participate in challenges that produced universal injunction most likely appreciated them.
“Your federal funding, your NIH funding, birthright citizenship in your states, has not been cut or eliminated because Connecticut acted,” Tong said.
The three liberal justices dissented. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the injunctive authority was a vital check on executive power.
“The power to compel the Executive to follow the law is particularly vital where the relevant law is the Constitution,” she wrote. “But when the Executive violates the Constitution, the only recourse is the courts. Eliminate that check, and our government ceases to be one of ‘limited powers.’”
Trump said the decision takes away power from left-wing judges, though some of the orders had been delivered by Republican appointees.
“I was elected on a historic mandate, but in recent months, we’ve seen a handful of radical left judges effectively try to overrule the rightful powers of the president to stop the American people from getting the policies that they voted for in record numbers. It was a grave threat to democracy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SCOTUS-01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

Minnesotans lined up to pay their final respects to Hortman, who was killed on June 14 in a politically motivated assassination. Mark Hortman was also killed, and Gilbert was injured and had to be euthanized.

Melissa Hortman is the first woman in Minnesota history to lie in state at the Capitol, and the 20th Minnesotan to be awarded the honor. In the Capitol Rotunda, members of the Minnesota National Guard’s honor guard flanked the Hortmans’ wooden caskets. Photos of the couple and their dog were on display among the flowers and greenery.
Gov. Tim Walz and First Lady Gwen Walz were the first to pay their respects when the memorial opened to the public at noon. They were followed by Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, her husband and Senate Majority leader Erin Murphy.
Thousands of Minnesotans followed, many of them part of the Hortmans’ vast network of friends, family and colleagues.

Jennifer O’Rourke, director of government relations for Ramsey County, said her friendship with Melissa Hortman predates Hortman’s first election to the House in 2004.
“She deserves this,” O’Rourke said, gesturing to the line of Minnesotans wrapped around the block. Many brought flowers or letters to add to the memorial outside the House chambers, where extra tables were brought in to accommodate Friday’s contributions from the public. 
Others mourners had no connection to the Hortmans, but came in solidarity at a perilous moment in the history of the republic and its 32nd state.

Carla Peck, 69, took work off to attend the memorial alongside her 2-year-old golden retriever Ollie.
Peck didn’t know much about the Hortmans until they were killed, but she thought it important to attend.
“I wanted to show respect and appreciation for what the Hortmans did for the state of Minnesota. I thought it’s important to bring my golden because goldens are great to share the love. Dogs are very healing,” Peck said.
Dave Woosley, 65, drove over an hour from Hastings to the Capitol to pay his respects. He didn’t know Melissa Hortman, but he had heard of the extensive amount of work she was able to get done in the Legislature.
“I thought it was important for our fellow citizens to see that we can all come together, whether we agree with her or disagree with her. Just have respect for not only Melissa, but this institution,” Woosley said.

Jeff Kolstad, 79, met Hortman in passing while doorknocking and respected her work on the environment. Flowers in hand, he stood in line with his dog Gracie, who “wanted to pay a tribute to Gilbert.” 
A private funeral for the Hortmans will be held at 10:30 a.m. Saturday. It will be livestreamed.

,DC,2025-06-27 20:29:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Congress unlikely to enact ‘absolutely devastating’ Trump proposal to slash Pell Grants,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-unlikely-enact-absolutely-devastating-trump-proposal-slash-pell-grants,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump wants to cut nearly $1,700 from the maximum Pell Grant award as part of his fiscal 2026 budget request — a move that would leave the subsidy for low-income students at its lowest level in more than a decade.The proposal would have a devastating effect on college affordability and drive up costs for states because they’d have to fill in the missing federal dollars, education advocates and experts say.The request — part of the president’s wish list for appropriations in fiscal 2026 — faces steep odds in Congress, where key members of both parties responded to the proposal with alarm.“I don’t want to cut the Pell Grant,” U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican and chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, told States Newsroom.“I’m concerned about that — I’m hoping that we’ll get that resolved,” she said.Opposition from Capito, whose panel writes the annual bill to fund the Education Department, makes Trump’s wish unlikely to make its way into the upcoming legislation.The Pell Grant is a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college and is the foundation of federal student aid in the United States.Catherine Brown, senior policy and advocacy director at the National College Attainment Network, said the cut would be “absolutely devastating,” noting that “college is already out of reach for millions upon millions of low-income students.”Funding gapThe Pell Grant program is seeing a projected budget shortfall of $2.7 billion heading into the next fiscal year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The administration has cited the shortfall as a reason to decrease the maximum award.The request calls for reducing the maximum Pell Grant for the 2026-2027 award year from $7,395 to $5,710. The last time the maximum award stood below this level was during the 2013-2014 award year, at $5,645. Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request includes $12 billion in total cuts to the Education Department as he and his administration seek to dismantle the agency and dramatically reshape the federal role in education.Democrats: Cut would be ‘crazy’Democrats have raised strong opposition, while even the Republican chair of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees Education Department funding was noncommittal about pursuing Pell Grant cuts.“We want to make sure that (Pell Grants are) serving the people they need to,” Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama said when asked about any concerns he has on the proposed cut.Aderholt said he’s hearing “a lot” from his constituents about the proposed reduction, and that it’s “certainly something we’re going to look at.”Meanwhile, the leading Democrats on the House and Senate education spending panels were quick to blast the proposed cut.Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member of the full House Appropriations Committee and the education spending subcommittee, called the nearly $1,700 reduction “crazy.”“People are not going to be able to do it, and that’s the tragedy of what they’re doing here is dismantling all of the constructs that are there to provide people particularly with public education and a pathway to success,” the Connecticut Democrat said.“You take away Federal Work-Study, you lower the Pell Grant, that says to me, you want to destroy public education,” DeLauro said.The budget request proposes slashing $980 million of Federal Work-Study funding and requiring employers to pay 75% of students’ hourly wages, with the government contributing 25%.The program gives part-time employment to students with financial need in order to help cover the cost of college. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, ranking member of the Senate subcommittee, said she “strongly” opposes the proposed reduction.The Wisconsin Democrat said she also recognizes that “there’s a looming shortfall in Pell funding that we need to address.”“I am hopeful that we’ll be able to work together to do that,” Baldwin said.Advocates, experts weigh inHigher education advocates and experts are also sounding the alarm on the proposed reduction, both over the harm to low-income students’ access to higher education and the impact on states and colleges.“This would just much further exacerbate that gap and drive millions of students out of pursuing post-secondary education or set them on a different path,” Brown, with the National College Attainment Network, said.Katharine Meyer, a governance studies fellow at the Brown Center on Education Policy at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, described the proposed decline as “truly unprecedented.”She added that when the Pell Grant is smaller, states have to spend more on higher education, creating a challenge for state officials potentially grappling with other cuts in federal support in the budget reconciliation package Republicans are scrambling to pass.“States don’t necessarily have the flexibility to spend more money when they have budgets that they need to balance, and they’re facing other federal constraints, including potentially having to take on additional health care costs depending on what happens with health care negotiations in budget reconciliation,” she said.Capito also said she thought a reduction to Pell Grants would ripple out to the state level.At the institutional level, Meyer pointed out that if a state has a smaller bucket to allocate for higher education but wants to prioritize financial aid, it would “come at the cost of” the money appropriated to universities.“Then institutions are not going to be able to spend as much on their operating funds,” she said. “They’re not going to be able to do capital improvement campaigns, which are often very necessary.”Ties to reconciliation billHouse Republicans have also proposed major changes to Pell Grant eligibility as part of GOP lawmakers’ separate “big, beautiful bill.” The legislative package would slash billions of dollars in federal programs to offset the cost of other parts of Trump’s agenda, including extending the 2017 tax cuts and boosting border security funding.GOP lawmakers are using the complex reconciliation process to move a package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber and avoid the Senate’s 60-vote threshold that generally requires bipartisanship.The House narrowly passed its version of the reconciliation package in late May. That measure included a provision that would raise the minimum number of credit hours to qualify for the maximum Pell Grant award from 12 per semester to 15. The move would save $7.1 billion in federal spending over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.That new eligibility requirement is not included in the draft proposal for the reconciliation package that Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions released in June.",,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)While the U.S. Senate has taken the front seat on discussing the GOP’s massive tax-and-spending bill, members of Congress’ lower chamber continue to weigh in on specific measures that could make passage through the U.S. House difficult.
Specifically, several U.S. Representatives have drawn a line against any provisions that would sell off federal public lands — a similar coalition that stripped a smaller land sale provision from the One Big Beautiful Bill during its first vetting by the House.
In a letter sent to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, five representatives, led by Montana western Rep. Ryan Zinke, called public land sales a “poison pill,” and if the bill returns to the House with a provision for selling federal land, the legislation will not pass muster.
“We support the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) passed by the House and generally accept changes to the bill that may be made by the Senate,” Thursday’s letter states. “However, we cannot accept the sale of federal lands that Senator Lee seeks. If a provision to sell public lands is in the bill that reaches the House floor, we will be forced to vote no.”
Republicans hold a slim eight-seat margin in the chamber — three Democratic representatives have died this year leaving vacancies — and if all Democrats were to oppose the bill, a five-representative block of Republicans voting against it would sink the reconciliation legislation, which needs a simple majority to pass.
When the bill first passed through the House, Zinke worked to strip out an amendment that proposed the sale of thousands of acres of federal land near urban areas in Nevada and Utah.
But once in the Senate, public land sales have become an even bigger debate after Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee introduced a new provision targeting the mandatory sale of between 2 million and 3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land. While federal land in Montana was exempt from the provision, it drew opposition from myriad outdoor recreation and conservation groups as well as from several Republican senators, including Montana’s Steve Daines and Idaho’s Jim Risch and Mike Crapo.
On Monday, the Senate parliamentarian — the nonpartisan advisor to the Senate who interprets rules — ruled that the public lands sale does not meet the requirements for inclusion in a reconciliation bill.
But within hours, Lee had stated he will work on smaller proposal targeting just BLM land within five miles of a population center, aimed at reducing housing costs in regions across the West, to be included in the legislative package.
In an interview with CNN that Zinke posted to the social media site X, formerly Twitter, he disagreed with the premise that vast swaths of public land should be sold to be used for affordable housing.
“Affordable housing is tens of acres, not millions of acres,” he said in the interview.
The letter sent by Zinke and representatives from Idaho, Oregon, Washington and California, said that there are “deep concerns” about Lee’s push to sell off public lands.
“This would be a grave mistake, unforced error and poison pill that will cause the bill to fail should it come to the House floor,” the letter states.
The elected officials all represent western states with vast tracts of federal land — 52% in Oregon, 46% in California and a whopping 80% in Montana’s western House district.
“We understand and agree with Senator Lee and our House colleagues that the federal government has mismanaged federal lands for decades, however, we do not agree with their solution. We believe advancing the House Republicans legislative agenda on public lands and natural resources, along with using existing law for land disposals, is the correct path forward,” the letter said.
The representatives say they hope the Senate parliamentarian will strip out any additional language about public lands sales from the bill.
Frank Szollosi, executive director of the Montana Wildlife Foundation, said the coalition of conservation groups he works with are continuing to provide a “positive stream of encouragement,” to Montana’s federal delegation urging them to keep up their record of opposition to public land sales.
“A threat to public land anywhere, is a threat to public land everywhere,” Szollosi told the Daily Montanan. “We’re all public land owners regardless of what state they’re in.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_5418-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

The department launched NeverForgotten.ar.gov in 2016 in partnership with the state attorney general’s office. The database will now “automatically capture” a missing person report to the National Crime Information Center by local law enforcement agencies, according to the news release. The report will alert both the Arkansas State Police and the U.S. Marshals Service.
“These enhancements will help law enforcement respond more quickly, particularly in cases involving juveniles who may be at risk of being trafficked,” the news release states.
Real-time updates eliminate the previously existing lag in accurate information caused by weekly updates, according to the Department of Public Safety.
“These enhancements will improve the effectiveness of missing person investigations and public awareness campaigns, increasing the chances of safe recovery — particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and at-risk adults,” ACIC Deputy Director Rick Stallings said in the release.
Arkansas has more than 400 unsolved cases of missing persons between 1 and 91 years old. A case from 30 years ago, the abduction of 6-year-old Morgan Nick of Alma, remained “active and ongoing” as of October, when the Alma Police Department announced it had uncovered new DNA evidence linking Nick to her suspected kidnapper, who died in prison in 1996.
The Morgan Nick Foundation, a missing children’s advocacy group founded by Nick’s mother, is one of the groups that actively supports the Arkansas Department of Public Safety’s efforts to solve missing persons cases, according to Friday’s news release.

Both faced a jury trial in Saginaw County Circuit Court. Following deliberations, the jury convicted Eggleston and Lamar-Silvia on one count of conspiracy to do a legal act in an illegal manner and one count of election law forgery, both five-year felonies. 
Eggleston was additionally convicted of a 93-day misdemeanor for signing a nominating petition as a circulator, even though he was a candidate for office.
Lamar-Silvia was also convicted on one count of signing multiple different names on a nominating petition, a five-year felony, and one count of signing a nominating petition with a name other than her own, a 93-day misdemeanor.
The Michigan Department of Attorney General alleged that Lamar-Silvia fraudulently signed the names of Saginaw voters to help get Eggleston on the ballot in 2024. It was also alleged that Eggleston signed a form falsely saying he was a petition circulator. He then submitted the documents to the Saginaw County Clerk’s office.
“Forging signatures on nominating petitions undermines our democratic process,” Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement. “I am pleased the jury recognized the seriousness of these offenses. These convictions serve as a strong reminder that no one is above the law, and my office remains committed to upholding our election laws to protect the will of voters.”
Eggleston and Lamar-Silvia are to be sentenced in August before Saginaw County Circuit Court Judge Andre Borrello.

(Screenshot)OKLAHOMA CITY — Cuts to Medicaid being considered by Congress will affect access to health care for “all Oklahomans” and harm the state economy, state hospital leaders warned Friday. 
Members of the Oklahoma Hospital Association said the proposed federal cuts to Medicaid could eliminate nearly 15,000 jobs and over the next decade reduce federal reimbursements to Oklahoma hospitals by $8.7 billion. 
“This is happening at such a breakneck speed,” said Denise Webber, president and CEO of Stillwater Medical. “There’s not ample time to plan and create a strategy that can serve Oklahomans and U.S. citizens in a manner that we can plan for.”
Cuts to Medicaid as part of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” are being considered in the U.S. Senate as part of Congress’ budget reconciliation process. The bill passed through the House, but has faced resistance in the Senate due in part to concerns about its expected negative impact on rural hospitals. Also the chamber’s parliamentarian ruled several proposed Medicaid changes can’t proceed. Senate leaders hope to vote on the bill before July 4. 
Webber said the proposed Medicaid cuts are unlike anything she’s seen in modern history. She chairs the Oklahoma Hospital Association board. “Big cuts” will have to be made for hospitals to be able to provide some services, she said. The Oklahoma Hospital Association advocates at state and federal levels on behalf of hospitals and works to promote health policy issues. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIf cuts are made because hospitals can no longer afford staff, it doesn’t only affect Medicaid patients but all Oklahomans seeking care, Webber said. 
“If we don’t have enough nurses and hospital beds and we have to put in (patient) caps, that can mean that you’ll be held kind of in a limbo land, waiting for a hospital bed,” Webber said. “And then what potentially happens, because this is happening statewide and nationwide, is we may not even understand, because I don’t believe we do, how bad that could get.”
The most expensive services, like oncology and neonatal, are likely to be cut first, she said. 
Rich Rasmussen, president and CEO of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said the hospital group has spent time in D.C. advocating directly to Oklahoma’s congressional delegation and their staff, warning them of the potential effects of these cuts. 
If the bill were to pass and immediately affect the existing reimbursement models beginning this summer and fall, hospital boards will need to “wrestle” with the reductions, he said. 
“I think it’s something that nobody looks forward to,” Rasmussen said. “So hopefully our senators will stand in the gap for us and ensure that we aren’t hit with these types of cuts.”
Ten hospitals in Oklahoma have closed since 2005, he said. But more hospital closures, especially in rural Oklahoma, could be looming if the Senate approves the Medicaid cuts. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stilwell Hospital announced its closure this month, raising concerns about rural health care access.
Rural Oklahomans are already faced with worse health care outcomes and provider deserts, but these will be exacerbated by Medicaid cuts, said Trent Bourland, vice president of rural development for SSM Health Oklahoma. 
“The lack of analytical depth in evaluating the full effect on the rural providers represents a serious oversight in responsible governments,” he said. “Our rural communities are the backbone of our nation. They deserve policy decisions guided by solid data, practical foresight and respect for the role in what rural America does for sustaining America’s strength and stability.”
People in rural areas will have to travel further for care, especially OB-GYN care, Bourland said. 
In the 15 most Northwest Oklahoma counties, obstetrics care would most likely be eliminated, he said. This would force people to drive over 40 miles for routine care and up to 80 miles for specialty care, Bourland said, but only if other regional hospitals are still able to provide those services. 
Jay Johnson, president and CEO of DRH Health in Duncan, said the hospital will have to put a hold on its efforts to expand OB-GYN and mental health care and potentially eliminate travel nurse contracts. 
“We’ll often get into these conversations of rural and urban, but there’s not much of a rural and urban in health care anymore because we’re all in this together,” Johnson said. “And that’s what it takes to provide care for our patients throughout our state.”",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-27-at-12.50.43 PM-e1751053587458-1024x791.png,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

Kelly Ayotte signed New Hampshire’s two budget bills — House Bill 1 and House Bill 2 — into law Friday, approving a $15.9 billion two-year package to fund the state government until July 2027.
The governor also signed a third compromise bill, House Bill 282, meant to address her concerns over education funding and changes to the retirement system, and to head off her threats of a veto.
The signatures mark a political victory for the governor, when the outcome was hardly certain. Just one week after House and Senate negotiators made reductions to health care spending, education aid to Manchester school districts, and a proposed fix to police and firefighter retirement benefits championed by Ayotte, the governor had vowed to veto the budget without changes. 
That pledge kicked off days of negotiations that culminated in a last-minute deal Wednesday evening that Ayotte endorsed. But a faction of fiscally conservative House Republicans who objected to spending increases nearly derailed the process, joining with Democrats to briefly defeat HB 1 on Thursday before the vote was reconsidered and the bill was passed.
In the end, after months of sharp disagreements among the Republican governor, the House, and the Senate over how much the state could afford, Ayotte emerged with a budget that kept much of the funding she proposed in February. 
The final package signed Friday restored many of the cuts made to Ayotte’s budget by the House, which took a more conservative approach. Some boards and agencies that had been eliminated by the House, like the Office of the Child Advocate, the Commission for Human Rights, and the Housing Appeals Board, were restored in the budget, albeit with some changes and cuts. The budget also includes some policies championed by Ayotte, such as a “bell-to-bell” cell phone ban in public schools and a new requirement that state agencies turn around housing development applications in 60 days. 
But the final spending package also adds cuts to the University System of New Hampshire not favored by Ayotte, and does not include the high revenue projections as Ayotte’s budget did. And it inserted a series of “back-of-the budget” cuts to agencies, such as a $51 million cut to the Department of Health and Human Services, that will require commissioners to reduce programs and potentially eliminate positions. 
Republicans broadly praised the budget for keeping spending increases within inflation, allowing education freedom accounts to apply to all income levels, and including some policy priorities such as the end of the state vehicle inspections beginning January 2026.
Democrats, meanwhile, decried the budget’s cuts to DHHS spending and its creation of a new premium added to Medicaid plans for participants, and said the budget underfunds efforts to improve housing affordability, child care, and public education.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ayotteinaugural-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-06-27 17:06:02.481726

There will be Michiganders that don’t survive the cuts if Congress passes the plan, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, General Motors employee and United Autos Worker member Jean Duchemin said during the event on the Capitol lawn.
In total, the legislation, which has already been voted through by the U.S. House and now awaits the U.S. Senate’s approval, would cut Medicaid funding by more than $800 billion and cut about $290 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
The GOP bill seeks to extend the 2017 tax cuts made during Trump’s first term, as well as vastly shrink the size of the federal government through major spending reductions.

Duchemin said while Trump’s plan looks to line the pockets of the billionaire class while breaking the middle class, the working class has power too, noting the UAW’s track record of fighting for better wages. In 2023, the UAW led a successful strike against Detroit’s “Big Three” automakers in order to secure better benefits and pay for autoworkers.
“This is class warfare…It always has been class warfare. It’s an attack on the poor, it’s an attack on the middle class, and its attack on the working class. So when you see a protest, when you see a gathering fighting for these rights, join them. If you have a voice, use it,” Duchemin said. “Keep shaking the foundations of these billionaires’ mansions, because they are afraid of us. They are terrified of us.”

Lansing was the latest stop for the “Stop the Billionaire Giveaway” Bus Tour, led by Fair Share America, where for the next few weeks advocates against the spending plan are traveling with a green bus to different states to call for an end to the Republican plan.
The budget bill has made progress to becoming law, but it isn’t too late to fight against it, Executive Director of Fair Share America Kristen Crowell said. And as the Senate makes changes to the bill, she said it will have to go through the House again.
A recent ruling by the Senate parliamentarian has complicated GOP plans to move the legislation to a floor vote. 
Regardless, Crowell said hardworking people often find themselves on the cusp of poverty, and all it takes is one bill to send a family into catastrophe.
“One dental bill sent my family into a downward spiral that felt impossible to recover from. First, my lights were turned off and the electricity was shut. Then they repossessed my car, and ultimately I lost my home to foreclosure,” Crowell said. “The fear that this puts on a family and on children, is unthinkable, but there’s also great shame in not being able to take care of our families and take care of our loved ones.”

There’s a misconception that only certain types of people rely on Medicaid, and if Michiganders are under the impression that no one they know is on Medicaid, they are mistaken, Steve Lawson, executive director for Michigan Families for Fair Care said during the Friday event.
There are about 2.6 million Michiganders who are enrolled in Medicaid, about a quarter of the state’s population, according to the state health department. Meanwhile, about 15% of Michigan’s population, nearly 1.5 million residents, rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, according to the Michigan State Budget Office.
“Michigan is a middle class state. We work hard here. We look out for our neighbors. We’re proud of where we came from. We always think about the people who are doing less well than we are,” Lawson said. “Cutting Medicaid to pay for tax breaks for billionaires are not Michigan values.”

The three new lawsuits, each filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, allege that Lee, which owns hundreds of newspapers and specialty publications in Iowa and 24 other states, is guilty of negligence, breach of an implied contract, unjust enrichment and invasion of privacy.
Lee’s Montana newspapers include The Billings Gazette, Missoulian, the Montana Standard, Helena Independent Record and the Ravalli Republic.
Each of the three lawsuits is seeking class-action status in pursuit of damages on behalf of thousands of current and former Lee employees whose personal information is believed to have been accessed by cybercriminals. The three named plaintiffs in the cases are Nicole Church of Colona, Illinois; Declan Lawson of Missoula, Montana; and Anthony Bangert of Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuits, on June 3, 2025, Lee began sending letters to current and former employees advising of them that the private information of certain employees had been accessed by others without authorization. The lawsuits allege the letters omitted details such as the cause of the data breach, the system vulnerabilities that had been exploited, and any remedial measures undertaken to guard against additional security breaches.
In one of the cases, the plaintiff asserts the “purported disclosure amounts to no real disclosure at all” in that it fails to provide critical facts surrounding the incident, limiting workers’ ability to take steps to mitigate any damages that might result. Lee, the lawsuits claim, could have prevented the data breach by properly securing and encrypting the files and file servers containing the employees’ private information and by training its employees on standard cybersecurity practices.
The data breach, one of the plaintiffs alleges, could have been avoided had Lee “bothered to implement basic monitoring and detection systems, which then would have stopped the data breach or greatly reduced its impact.”
Lee Enterprises has yet to file a response to the lawsuits, and Tracy Rouch, director of communications for Lee, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
However, Lee has stated that it has incurred $2 million in expenses related to restoring data systems in the wake of the February 2025 cyberattack. The company has also indicated the data breach affected the company’s finances by hampering its ability to bill customers and pay vendors.
The Qilin ransomware group has claimed credit for the attack and alleged that it gained access to 350 gigabytes of data. It also shared samples of what it claimed was data stolen from the company, including contracts, financial spreadsheets, non-disclosure agreements and other confidential files.
In SEC filings and in a filing with the attorney general of Maine, Lee indicated the data breach involved documents containing personally identifiable information related to 39,779 individuals. The documents may include a mix of names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license data, financial account numbers, medical information and health insurance data, according to the Maine attorney general.
The plaintiffs Lawson and Bangert are each represented by the law firm of Shindler, Anderson, Goplerud & Weese of West Des Moines. Church is represented by Josh Christensen of RSH Legal in Cedar Rapids.
  Lee agrees to $9.5 million payout in subscriber case 

It’s not the first time data systems at Lee have been hacked. In 2020, Iranian cybercriminals allegedly gained access to the company’s systems as part of a what prosecutors claimed was a campaign to spread disinformation related to the 2020 presidential election. Two Iranian nationals were later charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats. Court records indicate the criminal case remains open and active.
In December 2022, a group of subscribers to Lee newspapers sued the company, alleging it had failed to disclose that their personal identifying information was being captured by various tracking methods embedded in Lee websites and then transferred to the social-media company Facebook where it could be accessed by others.
The lawsuit, which attained class-action status, alleged individuals could use fairly basic web-browsing tools to see the titles of whatever video content had triggered the initial exchange of information between Lee and Facebook, providing an indirect link between named Facebook users and the specific videos those users had watched on Lee websites.
The plaintiffs in that case sought a temporary injunction requiring Lee to immediately remove tracking tools from the company’s websites and to obtain the appropriate consent from subscribers for any information sharing that may take place.
In March 2025, the parties in that case reached a proposed settlement which they presented to the court for preliminary approval.
According to public court filings, the proposed settlement grew out of an all-day mediation session in November 2024 before Judge Wayne R. Andersen in Fort Myers, Florida. Andersen later provided a mediator’s proposal that recommended the matter be resolved by Lee or its insurer paying $9.5 million to settle the case, and the parties agreed.
Court records indicate the proposed settlement involves 1,528,941 paid subscribers to Lee newspapers who accessed video material on a Lee website at any time between December 2020 through March 4, 2025, and who used Facebook during that same period.
In a memorandum supporting court approval of the settlement, the parties state that the “$9,500,000 will yield a significant benefit to each of the participating class members,” while avoiding costly litigation that could drag on for years.
According to the court records, the settlement agreement also requires revisions to Lee’s business practices.
A court hearing on final approval of the settlement agreement is now scheduled for Aug. 7, 2025.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Failed contract negotiations between Brown University Health and UnitedHealthcare mean that thousands of seniors and disabled residents will no longer be covered for non-emergency visits at four Rhode Island hospitals starting July 1.
Fallout from the closed-door dispute has spilled over into public communications, creating uncertainty for United Medicare Advantage plan participants over whether they can keep seeing Brown Health hospital physicians at the same cost even after the contract expires on Monday, June 30.
Brown Health on a webpage dedicated to the contract issue states that its hospitals — Rhode Island Hospital, Hasbro Children’s Hospital, The Miriam Hospital, and Newport Hospital — will be considered “out of network” for United Medicare Advantage patients. This would suggest that affected plan participants will have to pay out of pocket to keep seeing their same doctors, or even lose the chance to continue receiving non-emergency services.
But United on its own webpage calls out Brown Health for “inaccurate information” regarding the timing of loss of coverage. According to the health insurer, Brown Health physicians will remain “in network” for Medicare Advantage patients on, and after July 1.
Jessica Wharton, a spokesperson for Brown Health, clarified in an emailed response Friday that hospital physicians will continue to participate in United’s Medicare Advantage plan through June 2026. However, out-of-pocket costs may rise for patients no longer in the network, depending on their plans, she said. 
Amid confusion and a flood of questions to his office, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha has stepped in with a webpage of his own. 
“Any sudden change in health insurance coverage can cause consumers to panic, and rightfully so,” Neronha said in a statement. “Affordable, accessible health care is foundational to our quality of life, and we hope this resource equips Rhode Islanders with the information they need, should they need it.”
Information on the number of inquiries from affected patients to Neronha’s office was not immediately available.
The AG’s website also addresses the question of whether UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage patients can keep seeing their Brown Health hospital doctors after July 1.
The answer, per the AG’s website: “It depends on your plan and your particular medical needs. You may need to pay more for care at Brown University Health hospitals if a contract is not agreed to, but you may still have some coverage for care provided at these facilities.”
The AG website refers readers to UnitedHealthcare’s website and phone number for more information on what’s covered under their individual insurance plans.

Negotiations break down over payments 
Confusion over when coverage ends for affected participants tracks with the conflicting narratives each side gives. As United tells it, the hospital network made a “good-faith effort,” to agree on new contract terms with Brown Health ahead of the June 30 expiration.
“Unfortunately, Brown University Health refused our proposal to extend our contract through the end of 2025 and is seeking to be paid significantly more than any health system in our Medicare Advantage network in Rhode Island,” the company states on its website. 
United also said it offered to extend the existing Medicare Advantage contract through the end of 2025 as a stopgap until a longer-term agreement was worked out. Brown Health refused, “potentially and unnecessarily disrupting access to care for thousands of people enrolled in our Medicare Advantage plans,” the company states on its website.
Cole Manbeck, a spokesperson for United, did not directly answer questions about the miscommunication or how many plan participants will lose coverage at Brown Health hospitals. 
“While we remain open to discussions with Brown University Health, our focus at this time is providing people access to the care they need through continuity of care or a smooth transition to another provider, as appropriate,” Manbeck said in an emailed statement Friday. 
Brown Health maintains that the decision not to renew the contract was “mutual.” The hospital system said it wanted “fair reimbursement” and “less administrative burden for patients.”
Wharton pointed out that United offers higher reimbursements for the hospital network at its two Massachusetts hospitals than in Rhode Island, echoing the well-documented problem of the Ocean State’s uncompetitive reimbursement rates. The contract dispute does not apply to Brown Health’s Morton Hospital in Taunton or St. Anne’s Hospital in Fall River.
Federally reported data estimates 129,000 Rhode Islanders are enrolled in Medicare Advantage health insurance plans available for people 65 and older, or with disabilities or chronic conditions like end-stage kidney failure or ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.) The commercial alternative to government-run traditional Medicare has grown in popularity nationwide and in Rhode Island with the promise of additional benefits and cost savings to participants. Participation in United’s Medicare Advantage program in Rhode Island grew 10.1% in 2023, according to the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner’s (OHIC) 2025 annual report.
But, private providers have faced increased scrutiny for inflating testing and diagnostics as a means to increase their bottom lines. 
Research by the Center for Advancing Health Policy Through Research at the Brown University School of Public Health suggests Medicare Advantage plans are projected to receive $30 billion in additional payments this year as a result of “differential coding intensity” compared with traditional, government-run Medicare plans.
UnitedHealth Group Inc, the parent company for the insurer’s individual state plans, topped the list of private insurers raking in money through inflated risk assessments, spending an extra $11.6 million across its 6.9 million plan participants nationwide in 2025, according to the analysis, which is based on 2021 Medicare data adjusted to 2025 dollars. In Rhode Island, the insurer is projected to spend an extra $47 million due to higher risk assessments of its 37,000 plan participants this year, or $105 more per patient, on average. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, which covers nearly twice the number of Medicare Advantage patients in the state as United, was projected to spend an extra $1 more per patient compared with traditional Medicare plan spending.
Both private insurers’ Medicare Advantage plans exceeded the state’s 6% cost growth target in 2023, with Blue Cross reporting 7.1% increase in total spending, while United’s total costs rose 14.8%, according to OHIC’s annual report. 
The end to the contract between Brown Health and United does not affect dual Medicare and Medicaid recipients. There are also assurances for continuity of care in certain cases, including patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed cancer, or those in active cancer treatment. United Medicare Advantage plan participants whose insurance is covered through a former employer under a group plan may also continue to receive care at Brown University hospitals.

The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Montgomery County, Maryland, parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)State lawmakers this week emphasized to court officials that New Mexico’s behavioral health overhaul must not result in pulling more people into the criminal legal system.
New Mexico this year enacted two pieces of legislation intended to rebuild the system for delivering mental health treatment in the state after former Gov. Susana Martinez dismantled it more than a decade ago.
The new laws’ intent includes allowing local communities, including governments and non-governmental organizations, to organize into “behavioral health regions;” determine what services and supports they need; and then present those priorities to the newly created Behavioral Health Reform Executive Committee for approval and funding.
At its first meeting on Tuesday, the Executive Committee voted to establish the regions, Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) Director Karl Reifsteck said at the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee meeting on Wednesday.
AOC Behavioral Health Integration and Reform Administrator Esperanza Lucero told the committee that the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center is helping AOC with Sequential Intercept Mapping, which is a commonly used conceptual model that maps out “intercept” points where people with mental health or substance use disorders can receive treatment and support.
When Reifsteck and Lucero presented an example of what the model could look like on Wednesday, lawmakers questioned them about why so much of it is focused on police, courts, jail and prison.
Members of the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee from both political parties on Wednesday told AOC officials they intended the behavioral health treatment reforms to benefit all people with mental health diagnoses, not just people who come into contact with police or the courts.
LHHS Committee Chair Liz Thomson, a Democratic representative from Albuquerque, said concerns have been raised to her about the new system having “a criminal basis, as opposed to just behavioral health.” She asked if AOC has figured out how to implement the new law without relying on the criminal legal system.
Lucero pointed to the first step in the model that calls for a “crisis line,” which generally refers to phone lines that offer free counseling for people dealing with emotional, mental or substance use issues. The state Health Care Authority’s 988 NM Lifeline offers support via phone, text, live chat or video call.
However, Thomson and other lawmakers on the committee said people need access to more than just a helpline when they start seeking help, before police, prosecutors and judges get involved.
“We want treatment before there’s a crisis,” Thomson said. “I’m bringing it out because I’m part of the disability community and it’s a concern, and we really, really don’t want the public to come away with the impression that a behavioral health disorder issue is criminal.”
Sen. Jay Block, a Rio Rancho Republican, said the law’s intent “is not judicial or criminal by any means.”
“We have an epidemic in this country of some behavioral health issues — especially in this state — and the intent of this is to provide empirical data to allow us to understand where we need to focus our resources, where we need to invest more resources or pull back resources to get these people the help that they need,” Block said.
AOC Deputy Director Sarah Jacobs said her agency is working with UNM’s Health Sciences Center on a model that would involve less interaction with the criminal legal system.
Reifsteck said the new law gives the behavioral health regions and local stakeholders the power to determine their local priorities. “It’s not going to be the courts deciding on what the priorities are,” he said.
Thomson asked if the Executive Committee has veto power in the event one of the regions submits a plan “that’s all about hardened criminals, with nothing for families, nothing for infants and children.”
“Is there some sort of oversight saying, ‘Whoa, this isn’t quite what we had in mind’?” she asked.
Reifsteck said yes, because the new law explicitly makes the Executive Committee responsible for reviewing and approving the plans.
“So I would anticipate that if a region came in and set a plan, and it was purely criminal justice focused, the seven members would say, ‘Hold on, why are these the top priorities for your region’?” he said. “Maybe that’s what is possible right now, or something, for that region, but it’s hard to imagine that those are the only ones.”
Lucero said the Executive Committee expects the local regions to submit plans by July 2026.
The Executive Committee’s next meeting is scheduled for Aug. 5, at which time Reifsteck said he hopes to see a rubric or initial thoughts from the Health Care Authority about how the regions should be organized.

(Getty Images)The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously overturned a controversial earlier decision that had sent alarm through the ski industry in Idaho and nationwide, holding instead that a lower court was right to dismiss a lawsuit from the widow of a skier who died after crashing into a snowmaking tower gun at Sun Valley.
Supreme Court case shakes Idaho ski areas by overturning decades of liability precedent

However, the court, with just one justice dissenting, upheld its earlier ruling that departed from decades of precedent in Idaho in how the state’s Ski Area Liability Law should be interpreted with regard to the legal “standard of care.” That potentially opens the door to far more lawsuits over ski injuries in Idaho, rather than reducing ski area liability, as lawmakers who originally sponsored the 1979 law said they intended.
Justice Cynthia Meyer, in her dissent, wrote that the law is clear as written. “Whether it is wise or socially unsound is not for us to decide. But that is the framework the legislature enacted,” she wrote. She added, quoting an earlier Idaho Supreme Court case, “The wisdom, justice, policy, or expediency of a statute are questions for the legislature alone.”
Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, an attorney and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, declined to take up a 2024 bill from Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, to amend the law after the initial decision, saying he preferred to wait until the court’s processes were completed.

“Let the judiciary make the decision, and then we act as necessary, if the law should be changed,” he said in February.
On Wednesday, he told the Idaho Capital Sun, “Now’s the time for our committee to at least look at possible changes, so that the law is more clear, as to what it is intended —  so that it’s easier for the courts and litigants to interpret.”
Idaho’s 2025 legislative session adjourned on April 4; unless they hold a special session, lawmakers are next set to convene in January of 2026.
“Obviously we’re pleased with the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold summary judgment,” said Brad Wilson, general manager of Bogus Basin and former president of the Idaho Ski Areas Association. “ … We won this particular piece of it, and so we’re pleased with that. But I don’t know what the implications of the rest of it is.”
Wilson said he planned to meet with attorneys to further evaluate the new ruling.
Milus v. Sun Valley Co. case stems from 2019 skiing accident
Justice Colleen Zahn, the author of the original 2023 decision, wrote Wednesday’s decision, and stuck with her earlier decision on several key points about the interpretation of the law. But she reversed course on a major issue: Whether the section in the law that places all risk for collisions with clearly visible, marked snowmaking equipment on the skier barred the lawsuit in the first place. The skier was the late Dr. Stewart Milus of Boise.
“We hold that Milus’ claims are barred because the record establishes that Snow Gun 16 was plainly marked,” Zahn wrote, “… and that Mr. Milus assumed the risk of injury caused by that equipment.”
The case, Milus v. Sun Valley Co., involves a November 2019 accident in which Milus hit a bright yellow-padded tower snow gun in the middle of Lower River Run at the resort in 2019, and died from his injuries. His widow, Laura Milus, sued the ski resort for wrongful death.
According to court records, Milus was skiing with “poor control” on the moderately crowded groomed run on that clear Saturday afternoon. He skied across the backs of another skier’s skis and yelled, then fell and crashed head-first into the tower, one of a row of such towers that stretches down the run.
The district court dismissed the lawsuit on summary judgment, based on Idaho’s 1979 Ski Area Liability Act. The widow appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court, which in December of 2023 overturned the lower court’s decision, offered an entirely new interpretation of the decades-old law, and said a jury should weigh whether the ski area was at least partially to blame, regardless of the skier’s actions.
Sun Valley Resort sought reconsideration of the court’s decision, which the justices granted, hearing additional arguments from both sides in February.
Idaho Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling could force some ski areas out of business, operators say
The December 2023 decision from Idaho’s highest court caused great consternation for Idaho’s 19 ski areas, which range from giant Sun Valley to tiny, one-chairlift mom-and-pop ski hills. If the state law doesn’t afford the resorts the liability protections it’s long been thought to provide, they said they expect to see a big increase in lawsuits, along with sharply increasing liability insurance costs. That could drive up the cost of skiing statewide, and force small resorts out of business if they can’t afford the increased costs.
That’s what happened in Vermont, after an infamous Vermont Supreme Court decision in 1978. That ruling, Sunday v. Stratton Corp., prompted most of the 37 U.S. states that have ski areas to pass ski area liability laws, many of them similar to Idaho’s. Idaho’s law has repeatedly been upheld in court since it first passed in 1979; state lawmakers affirmed their intent when they last approved amendments to the law in 2014.
Idaho Supreme Court hears arguments to reconsider ruling on ski area liability law

Idaho’s law says skiers take on the liability for the inherent risks of the sport, including colliding with trees, bare spots, lift towers, clearly visible snowmaking or snowgrooming equipment and the like. It holds ski areas liable for operation of lifts, including maintaining them to national standards, along with a list of nine specific duties such as clearly marking the level of difficulty for designated trails.
Skiers are liable if they don’t comply with their own enumerated duties, including skiing in control and within their ability, heeding all posted warnings, and sticking to designated runs.
Idaho’s law says ski areas can’t be held to “any standard of care” for actions designed to lessen the inherent risks of skiing, meaning they can’t be sued for how well they accomplish them. A long line of decisions from the Idaho Supreme Court and federal courts has held that that applies to all nine of the enumerated duties of ski areas.
There were three points on which the high court’s initial 2023 ruling appeared to depart from the long line of precedent in Idaho, and from the lower court’s ruling:

It applied an “ordinarily prudent person standard of care” for judging how well ski areas carry out their nine enumerated duties under the law, rather than concluding that the law eliminated any standard of care for those duties. That’s the standard that would be applied if there were no ski area liability law.
It ruled that it should be up to a jury to decide how well Sun Valley carried out two of those duties, regarding what constitutes a “warning implement” on snowmaking equipment and whether the resort had adequately posted notice that snowmaking was “in progress” when snowmaking equipment was in place, but no snow was being made. The justices on Wednesday found Milus hadn’t provided sufficient evidence the ski area failed to meet its duties on those points.
It held that the skier’s compliance with his own enumerated duties, including controlling speed and course and heeding all posted warnings, can’t be considered until a jury decides if the resort was negligent with regard to warning implements and signs — and can’t be considered at all if the jury finds the resort failed on those points. That’s the key point that was overturned, leading to dismissal of the lawsuit.

Laura Milus attended the arguments before the court on Feb. 14, as did the general managers of three Idaho ski areas and a host of others.
Milus said after the February arguments that she thought it was “reckless” for Sun Valley to have snow guns “right in the middle of a beginner run, where somebody is going to go out of control.” She also said then that even if she didn’t win, she hoped the case would bring attention to that issue.
In response to the court’s December 2023 decision, in February of 2024, at the urging of the ski industry, Ehardt introduced House Bill 516, adding a clear statement to the existing law that “no standard of care” applies to the enumerated duties of ski areas.
That would put the interpretation of Idaho’s law back to where it has been since the law was first enacted, before the court’s December 2023 ruling. The bill never got a hearing.

(Courtesy of the University of Virginia)In a stunning development that’s igniting fierce political backlash, University of Virginia President Jim Ryan resigned Friday under pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which alleged the school had failed to fully dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs — a demand tied to a sweeping federal crackdown on higher education.
The New York Times first reported Ryan’s resignation, citing DOJ claims that the institution had merely rebranded its DEI efforts instead of eliminating them. The university’s Board of Visitors accepted his resignation, with Ryan expected to officially step down by Aug. 15 after becoming the president in 2018. He has not commented publicly.
The move has sparked outrage on campus and across Virginia. A protest led by Wahoos4UVA, a group dedicated to defending the university from political influence, is scheduled at the Rotunda on Friday.
“This unprecedented political interference threatens the independence of our University and its fundamental values,” a letter from the chairs of Wahoos4UVA Advisory Council states. 
“Whatever reason the Department of Justice gives for taking this action is only a pretext thinly masking a partisan agenda. What’s happening is clear: the Trump administration has made UVA the next target in its escalating attack on higher education in America.”
UVA became the first public university in Virginia to dissolve its DEI office on March 8 after President Donald Trump’s executive order warned of t federal funding cuts for noncompliance.
Opponents of DEI argue hiring and promotions should be merit-based rather than consider race or gender. Supporters say DEI efforts are vital to addressing systematic inequities that have long blocked opportunities for women and people of color and women.
The school has also been under scrutiny for its handling of antisemitism complaints. UVA was among 60 colleges flagged in a federal inquiry over whether it adequately protected Jewish students, prompting additional concerns over potential funding losses.
Virginia Senate Democrats condemned what they called federal overreach, urging university boards to “resist any efforts by the Trump Admin to dictate how Virginia runs its own taxpayer-funded schools.”
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “UVA is the envy of American public universities,” and called Ryan an “incredible leader.” He added: “Trump’s interference in the operation of Virginia’s universities and any cooperation by those sworn to protect them will not be tolerated by the Virginia Senate.”
U.S. Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine also blasted the DOJ’s involvement, underscoring that Virginia’s economy and prosperity depend on the strength and integrity of the state’s higher education system. 
“It is outrageous that officials in the Trump Department of Justice demanded the commonwealth’s globally recognized university remove President Ryan — a strong leader who has served UVA honorably and moved the university forward — over ridiculous ‘culture war’ traps,” the senators stated. 
“Decisions about UVA’s leadership belong solely to its Board of Visitors, in keeping with Virginia’s well-established and respected system of higher education governance. This is a mistake that hurts Virginia’s future.”
The UVA Board of Visitors last met June 4-6. Its next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 11-12.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)With the U.S. Senate poised to vote on a budget reconciliation bill that, among other impacts, will slash health care for thousands of Mainers, advocates are putting pressure on Republican Sen. Susan Collins to buck her caucus and vote against the plan.
GOP leaders have set a deadline of July 4 for passage and the Senate is expected to vote on the bill over the weekend.
For the past two weeks, health care advocates in Maine and beyond have been calling on Collins to reject the bill, which proposes significant cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other programs in order to continue tax cuts passed during President Donald Trump’s first term. 
Almost 400,000 Maine residents — a third of the state’s population — currently rely on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. The nonpartisan budget office estimates as many as 50,000 Mainers could lose health coverage by 2034, either under Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act, while the restrictions in funding will further increase the strain on rural hospitals.
“As the chair of the Appropriations Committee and the seventh most senior U.S. senator, Sen. Susan Collins holds immense power. But she’s not using it to publicly stand against the reconciliation bill,” said Nora Flaherty-Stanford, communications director for the Maine People’s Alliance, which held protests earlier this month outside Collins’ offices in Bangor, Lewiston and Portland. “If this bill moves forward in its current form, it will badly hurt Mainers and people around the country.”
On Thursday, Gov. Janet Mills sent a letter to Maine’s congressional delegation, urging them to vote against the bill. Citing an independent estimate that found Maine could lose $4.5 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade, Mills warned that Maine can’t bear the financial burden the health care and other cuts would impose on the state. 
Both Democratic Reps. Jared Golden and Chellie Pingree voted against the reconciliation bill when the U.S. House of Representatives passed its version last month. If the Senate passes its version, the bill will go back to the House to vote on those changes. 
On Monday, independent Sen. Angus King led a group of former governors in sending a letter to Republican leadership highlighting their concerns with how the proposal will impact state budgets. In a press conference Wednesday, King called the bill “the worst, most regressive and most harmful piece of legislation I have ever seen.” 
Collins has not publicly said how she plans to vote on the reconciliation bill and her office did not respond to requests for comment.
During Senate negotiations, Collins described some of the proposed cuts to Medicaid as “problematic,” but has said she supports adding work requirements to the health program. 
The work requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill. Flaherty-Stanford and other advocates say the paperwork mandates will cause eligible people to lose care.
“Most of the people who will lose their coverage won’t lose it because they aren’t eligible,” Flaherty-Stanford said. “They’ll lose it by getting buried under mountains of red tape and relentless bureaucratic requirements.”

Health professionals argue against Medicaid cuts
Senate Republicans can only lose three of their members and still pass the bill. With such a small margin for success, Trump has been pressuring those who have been critical of the proposal to get on board. “We don’t want to have grandstanders,” Trump said Thursday. “Not good people. They know who I’m talking about.”
During a press conference Friday, State Rep. Anne Graham (D-North Yarmouth) and Protect Our Care Maine Director Toby McGrath acknowledged that pressure coming from the White House but called on Collins to do what is best for Maine.
“I just want Susan Collins to listen to her constituents and stand up for her constituents and not be bullied by the Republican majority or the administration,” said Graham, a retired pediatric nurse practitioner. “One of the things that she’s always been proud of is representing the northern part of Maine, the rural parts of Maine. Those are the people who are going to suffer the most, I believe, if these cuts happen.”
In Maine, 24.1% of people in rural areas or small towns rely on Medicaid, compared with 20% of people in metro areas, according to a study by Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. The state also has the 11th highest rate of Medicaid coverage for adults aged 19 to 64 in rural areas in the country, including people with disabilities, and the 9th highest rate of coverage for seniors.
Dr. Christine Mahoney, a physician from Brunswick, joined more than 4,000 doctors nationwide in signing a letter organized by the Committee to Protect Health Care urging senators to vote against the bill. 
“I see firsthand how access to health care improves health and saves lives, and for many, many Mainers, Medicaid is that lifeline,” Mahoney said during a separate press event earlier this week.
Without Medicaid, prevention and management of chronic conditions and maternal care would be severely threatened, she said. She noted that without coverage, patients often delay medical treatment, leading to late-stage preventable diseases and potentially forcing difficult choices between health care and financial survival.
Mahoney also highlighted broader community impacts, including potential hospital closures and economic disruption, particularly in rural areas. 
If Maine’s members of Congress vote in favor of the bill, “the message it sends to me and a lot of Mainers would be that our senators don’t care. That they don’t care about them, they don’t care about their futures, they don’t care about their health and livelihood,” Mahoney added.
Family planning providers warn about ‘backdoor abortion ban’
Maine’s family planning providers, Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning, echoed the calls for senators to vote against the bill during a press event on Tuesday.
One provision of the bill still being weighed by the Senate parliamentarian, which determines whether the bill adheres to the complex rules of the reconciliation process, would bar Medicaid reimbursements to organizations that provide abortions and receive more than $1 million in federal funds.
Nicole Clegg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, described the budget reconciliation bill as “a backdoor abortion ban.”
“Every single day we are having to navigate a new policy or push from the federal government, something that’s being taken away, all in an attempt to put us out of business, to stop us from providing abortion,” she said. 
In May, Planned Parenthood released a memo pointing to Collins’ long history of supporting the organization. “Throughout her career, Sen. Collins has made it clear that she understands how critical Medicaid is to her constituents and all Americans’ ability to access essential health care,” it read. “She knows that cuts to the program will harm Mainers.”
Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, told the Maine Morning Star that it’s clear the bill will hurt Maine, and “we are counting on our congressional delegation to do everything they can to stop it from getting to President Trump’s desk.”

Connecticut’s Democratic congressional delegation wasn’t so sure.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, for example, claimed Trump was “deliberately misleading the public” when he said Iran’s nuclear program was “completely and totally obliterated.” Murphy believes the attack only set it back “by a handful of months” and not years if Iran still possesses enriched uranium.
“There’s no doubt there was damage done to the program, but the allegations that we have obliterated their program just don’t seem to stand up to reason,” Murphy told reporters Thursday at the U.S. Capitol. “I can’t share any of the details from this briefing, but I just do not think the president was telling the truth when he said this program was obliterated.”
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said it was too early to tell the extent of the damage and believes Iran is still a threat. But he agreed with Murphy to an extent that descriptions appeared “to exaggerate the amount of damage and how long it would take to rebuild.”
Both senators hope for a diplomatic solution but said that depends on the administration’s next steps. 
The two delayed classified briefings at the U.S. Capitol — one before the Senate on Thursday, one before the House today — highlighted the latest tensions between the parties over the strikes in Iran as well as how they view their roles in approving military action.
The Trump administration has strongly defended the strikes. At a briefing from the Pentagon on Thursday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called it a “resounding success.” He lashed out at the press over stories on a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency report that concluded core components of the nuclear component — like some of the centrifuges that enrich uranium — remain intact and the strikes only set it back a few months.
“Because you cheer against Trump so hard, in your DNA and in your blood, cheer against Trump, because you want him not to be successful so bad, you have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes,” Hegseth said at the Pentagon briefing. “You have to hope maybe they weren’t effective.”

Republicans were largely in agreement with Trump’s assessment of obliteration. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said he believed the strikes caused “catastrophic damage.”
As he left the highly secure room where the briefing was held, Blumenthal told reporters he was “hopeful we did as much damage as possible” and called the mission “successful insofar extensively damaged and set back the Iranian arms program.” But he cautioned that he wants to wait and see what final reports indicate.
“We have a lot of spin, a lot of narrative that seems to exaggerate the amount of damage and how long it would take to rebuild, and that’s dangerous because it creates a false sense of security,” Blumenthal said in an interview after Thursday’s briefing. “I came away from that briefing without a lot of comfort that we have completely and finally stopped a nuclear-armed Iran.”
“The point is we don’t know. Anybody who says we know a certain thing is making it up because we have no final battle damage assessment,” he told reporters at another point after the briefing.
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said there has been a lot of recent discussion over “what’s the right adjective” to describe the strikes.
Courtney commended U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, for his questions during Friday’s House briefing, adding it was “helpful to get the discussion off of political messaging and into the meat of the issues.” Himes serves as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and had voiced concerns about not getting advance notice about the strikes, given the role of the committee on intelligence matters.
Courtney said he he got some information but some questions still remain. For the eastern Connecticut congressman, his biggest focus is on the end game and force protection.
But he described Friday’s briefing as well-attended and said lawmakers in both parties were listening: “You could have heard a pin drop.”
“There was no question that both the Air Force and the submarine force executed the mission with great impact,” Courtney said, noting the Ohio-class submarine built in Groton that launched Tomahawk missiles into Iran. “But there’s definitely going to be more meat on the bone in terms of follow-up analysis and also diplomacy.”
The briefings were initially planned for earlier in the week but were postponed, to the frustration of the delegation. Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Dan Caine attended the briefings.
But Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was notably absent. She testified in March that the U.S. intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.” Murphy said he wanted to know why she wasn’t in the room for a classified intelligence briefing.
Democrats and a handful of Republicans were frustrated that the administration didn’t seek approval or input from Congress before the bombings. Republicans and the administration believe Trump had the authority to authorize the strike on his own. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has pointed to presidents in both parties who have relied on Article II of the Constitution as giving them that authority to do so as the commander-in-chief.
In response, Democrats have been pushing for votes on war powers resolutions to reassert their congressional authority on military action. One from U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., is scheduled for a vote later on Friday.
Himes has his own resolution, which he introduced alongside other national security leaders U.S. Reps. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and Adam Smith, D-Wash. It is similar to another war powers resolution in the House but has a key distinction: It directs Trump to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in Iran “other than those elements of the Armed Forces that may be necessary to defend the United States or an ally or partner of the United States from imminent attack provided.”
The Constitution grants the legislative branch the ability to “declare war.” The War Powers Act of 1973 requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of military action if there is no declaration of war.
Johnson has been critical of war powers resolutions, saying that it “is not a time for politics” and has called the War Powers Act “unconstitutional.”
As they await more answers on the strikes and push for additional briefings, Connecticut lawmakers are hoping to see the president engage in a diplomatic agreement to stabilizing the region, particularly as there’s a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. 
“The only path forward is diplomacy,” Murphy said, with a caveat. “I just have not heard a realistic path from this administration about diplomacy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25173450855675-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 16:06:37.190861

Indiana’s law has been in effect but a judge had stayed an ongoing lawsuit until the U.S. Supreme Court made a ruling in the Texas lawsuit. On Friday, the court sided with Texas in a 6-3 vote along ideological lines. 
Attorney general, adult websites clash in age verification lawsuit

“(The Texas law) simply requires proof of age to access content that is obscene to minors, it does not directly regulate adults’ protected speech,” ruled the majority. “… adults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification. Any burden on adults is therefore incidental to regulating activity not protected by the First Amendment.”
The court similarly dismissed arguments from adult content creators urging states to adopt less restrictive requirements, with the justices saying that isn’t required. 
While all agreed that states have an interest in protecting children from explicit material, dissenting justices said that “… adults have a constitutional right to view the very same speech that a State may prohibit for children.” 
Friday’s ruling was a departure from precedent, the dissenting justices argued, pointing to the option for less-restrictive laws. 
“… a State cannot target that expressions, as Texas has here, any more than is necessary to prevent it from reaching children,” the dissent said.
 Indiana background

Indiana’s Senate Enrolled Act 17 passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority that would require the adult pornography sites to verify user ages early in the 2024 session. Prior to the law taking effect in July, a federal judge blocked its enforcement — only for an appeals court to roll back the preliminary injunction in August. 
The plaintiffs include the Free Speech Coalition and 11 adult content companies, including major provider Pornhub. 
Pornhub has blocked access to the site in Indiana since the law went into effect.
Free speech advocates, including those with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, argued that the barrier would make it harder for adult Hoosiers to access the content, which is their protected right under law. 
“The First Amendment doesn’t just protect a speaker, but also those who want to hear what someone is saying,” wrote Chris Daley, the ACLU’s Indiana executive director. “And in the case of constitutional protections, ‘speech’ is interpreted broadly to include video productions, including pornography.” 
Bill author Sen. Mike Bohacek pushed for the bill, saying, “We have children who have seen hardcore content before they have their first kiss.”
The Michiana Shores Republican followed up the bill with another effort to limit social media access for children under the age of 16, but it died in the House after passing the Senate.

Mitch McConnell told his colleagues behind closed doors this week that “failure is not an option” when it comes to passing their bill to deeply cut health, nutrition and education programs to fund tax cuts skewed to the wealthy. “I know a lot of us are hearing from people back home about Medicaid,” he told fellow senators. “But they’ll get over it.”
“Getting over it” will be hard in Kentucky, where the budget reconciliation bill is estimated to take health care from over 200,000 Kentuckians. Crucially, it also puts 35 rural Kentucky hospitals at risk of closure, more than any other state and 10% of the vulnerable hospitals across the entire country. These facilities depend heavily on the payments from Medicaid-covered patients to make emergency and specialty care available to everyone in the community.
Among the Kentucky hospitals that could shutter are five of the seven original Miners’ Memorial Hospitals set up by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) in 1956. Those facilities — in Whitesburg, Middlesboro, Harlan, South Williamson and McDowell — are on the chopping block, along with Eastern Kentucky hospitals in Prestonsburg, Manchester, Louisa, Corbin, Mt. Sterling, Pineville, Irvine, Martin and Barbourville.
Coal mining has always been dangerous, but before the UMWA the work was brutal. Deaths and injuries were frequent, children worked in the mines, and pay was in the form of credit at the company store. It took often-bloody battles for the workers to win their union and a chance at a better life.
The UMWA Welfare and Retirement Fund, created through successful contract victories, built the Miners’ Memorial Hospitals to provide health care in coal communities where it was sorely lacking. But mechanization of coal mining led to deep job losses by the 1960s, and the UMWA was forced to sell the facilities to a nonprofit that eventually became Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH).
ARH and other Eastern Kentucky hospitals continue to provide everything from birthing to cancer care, and offer surgery, cardiology, physical and occupational therapy and family medicine. Rural people already travel much farther than others for health care and driving even longer distances due to shuttered hospitals will mean missed appointments and delayed treatment. That’s the difference between good health and bad, and between life and death.
The Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina reports that 196 rural hospitals have closed or converted since 2005, but Kentucky has been largely spared thanks to the funds provided by Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act. Kentucky lost four rural hospitals over those 20 years, while neighboring Tennessee — which did not expand Medicaid — lost 15.
ARH is the single largest employer in southeastern Kentucky, making potential Medicaid cuts a jobs issue as well. Health care and social assistance is the biggest industry in the Eastern Kentucky workforce area, employing 26,585 people or 25% of all jobs. And many other jobs in the region, like in retail (16,580 jobs) and government (23,192), depend on the spending and taxes of these hospitals’ nurses, therapists, physicians, technicians and more.
The threat to rural hospitals from proposed Medicaid cuts is a major point of contention over the bill. Some are floating the Band-Aid of a “rural hospital fund” that will only address a tiny fraction of the problem and is more a talking point than a solution.
Eastern Kentucky miners fought and died to create a health care system in a region where the market never would have on its own. Now members of Congress threaten to take it away.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A Friday decision by the U.S. Supreme Court set the stage for a law restricting access to online pornography to take effect Tuesday in South Dakota, but the ruling doesn’t shield the state from lawsuits.
In Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the nation’s high court ruled that a Texas law requiring adults to prove their age to access adult-oriented websites is constitutional.
Under the Texas law, websites where one-third or more of the content is pornographic would have to collect information like photo identification or credit card information before allowing access.
The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment industry group, argued the law placed an unconstitutional burden on adults.
Governor signs age verification bill and lab-grown meat funding restrictions

The justices disagreed in their 6-3 decision, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas. The court’s three liberal justices dissented.
“Obscenity is no exception to the widespread practice of requiring proof of age to exercise age-restricted rights,” Thomas wrote, citing laws restricting alcohol use or handgun purchases. 
South Dakota lawmakers passed, and Gov. Larry Rhoden signed, an age verification bill this year, but its language is more broad than that of the Texas law.
For the law set to take effect Tuesday in South Dakota, age verification would be required of any site that hosts adult material “in the regular course of the website’s trade or business.”
Lawmakers were cautioned during the session that such broad verbiage could draw First Amendment challenges regardless of the outcome in the Texas case. Some argued explicitly for an age verification law that mirrored the one in Texas.
South Dakota’s law requires websites to delete proof of age information immediately after an adult provides it. Adult websites that fail to perform age verification would be subject to criminal fines.
Ruling: ‘Incidental’ privacy infringement acceptable
The Supreme Court’s Friday ruling drew lines around any free speech arguments that might be deployed about South Dakota’s law.
At issue in the Texas case was not just the constitutionality of age verification laws, but how courts are meant to review them.
Texas wanted the Supreme Court to give it – and other states, by extension – broad authority to write laws restricting minors’ access to online pornography. The Free Speech Coalition said age verification laws ought to be minimally restrictive because they affect First Amendment rights.
Neither side prevailed on that issue. Instead, the justices said the Texas law stood up to what it called “intermediate scrutiny.” 
The state’s strictures amount to an “incidental” burden on adults’ free speech, but adults can still get the content, the majority ruled. 
A law that only requires age verification for sites on which one-third or more of the content is obscene is narrowly tailored enough to achieve Texas’ goal of targeting pornography, the court ruled.
“It is reasonable for Texas to conclude that websites with a higher proportion of sexual content are more inappropriate for children to visit than those with a lower proportion,” Thomas wrote.
In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said the state of Texas ought to have tailored its law more narrowly “to ensure it is not undervaluing the interest in free expression.”
Restrictions on free speech, she said, should be viewed with the courts’ most critical eye.
“Many reasonable people, after all, view the speech at issue here as ugly and harmful for any audience,” Kagan wrote. “But the First Amendment protects those sexually explicit materials, for every adult. So a state cannot target that expression, as Texas has here, any more than is necessary to prevent it from reaching children.”
Future for South Dakota law
Unlike the Texas version, South Dakota’s age verification law does not apply to sites with a certain proportion of adult content.
It’s more sweeping language applying it to sites that host porn in their “regular course” of business was a cause of concern for some lobbyists and lawmakers, as well as for Attorney General Marty Jackley. 
Lobbyist Doug Abraham told the Senate Judiciary Committee in February that age verification for any site with adult material would be akin to carding anyone who enters a shopping mall because a store in the mall sells alcohol.
Sen. David Wheeler, R-Huron, who’s since been appointed as a circuit court judge, was among the lawmakers who argued on behalf of a bill with a one-third content standard nearly identical to the Texas law. That bill failed.
Jackley told lawmakers that he supports age verification for porn sites, but told them he’d rather defend a law that looks like the one passed by Texas.

Rep. Bethany Soye, R-Sioux Falls, sponsored the version of the bill that’s set to become law on Tuesday.
Soye told her colleagues that the one-third standard was “made up” by the Louisiana lawmakers who were the first to move on age verification.
A cutoff line for adult content creates a loophole, she said. To avoid adherence to the law, sites could make sure that their adult material represents just under one-third of its content.
Soye also said that legal battles sparked by a strong moral stance are worth the investment of the state’s time and treasure.
As of Friday afternoon, the state had not been sued in federal court over the law. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota argued against the bill in Pierre. Andrew Malone, its senior staff attorney, said Friday in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight that the Supreme Court “has departed from decades of settled precedents that ensured that sweeping laws purportedly for the benefit of minors do not limit adults’ access to First Amendment-protected materials.”
“With this decision, the court has carved out an unprincipled pornography exception to the First Amendment. The Constitution should protect adults’ rights to access information about sex online, even if the government thinks it is too inappropriate for children to see,” Malone said. “Efforts to childproof the internet not only hurt everyone’s ability to access information, but also give the government far too much leeway to go after speech it doesn’t like — all while failing to actually protect children.”
The Free Speech Coalition did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the South Dakota law, but Alison Boden, executive director, posted about the Paxton ruling on social media.
“As it has been throughout history, pornography is once again the canary in the coal mine of free expression,” Boden said, in part. “The government should not have the right to demand that we sacrifice our privacy and security to use the internet.”

The three new lawsuits, each filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, allege that Lee, which owns hundreds of newspapers and specialty publications in Iowa and 24 other states, is guilty of negligence, breach of an implied contract, unjust enrichment and invasion of privacy.
Lee’s Iowa newspapers include the Quad-City Times in Davenport, the Sioux City Journal, the Mason City Globe-Gazette the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier and the Muscatine Journal.
Each of the three lawsuits is seeking class-action status in pursuit of damages on behalf of thousands of current and former Lee employees whose personal information is believed to have been accessed by cybercriminals. The three named plaintiffs in the cases are Nicole Church of Colona, Illinois; Declan Lawson of Missoula, Montana; and Anthony Bangert of Wisconsin.
According to the lawsuits, on June 3, 2025, Lee began sending letters to current and former employees advising of them that the private information of certain employees had been accessed by others without authorization. The lawsuits allege the letters omitted details such as the cause of the data breach, the system vulnerabilities that had been exploited, and any remedial measures undertaken to guard against additional security breaches.
In one of the cases, the plaintiff asserts the “purported disclosure amounts to no real disclosure at all” in that it fails to provide critical facts surrounding the incident, limiting workers’ ability to take steps to mitigate any damages that might result. Lee, the lawsuits claim, could have prevented the data breach by properly securing and encrypting the files and file servers containing the employees’ private information and by training its employees on standard cybersecurity practices.
The data breach, one of the plaintiffs alleges, could have been avoided had Lee “bothered to implement basic monitoring and detection systems, which then would have stopped the data breach or greatly reduced its impact.”
Lee Enterprises has yet to file a response to the lawsuits, and Tracy Rouch, director of communications for Lee, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
However, Lee has stated that it has incurred $2 million in expenses related to restoring data systems in the wake of the February 2025 cyberattack. The company has also indicated the data breach affected the company’s finances by hampering its ability to bill customers and pay vendors.
The Qilin ransomware group has claimed credit for the attack and alleged that it gained access to 350 gigabytes of data. It also shared samples of what it claimed was data stolen from the company, including contracts, financial spreadsheets, non-disclosure agreements and other confidential files.
In SEC filings and in a filing with the attorney general of Maine, Lee indicated the data breach involved documents containing personally identifiable information related to 39,779 individuals. The documents may include a mix of names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license data, financial account numbers, medical information and health insurance data, according to the Maine attorney general.
The plaintiffs Lawson and Bangert are each represented by the law firm of Shindler, Anderson, Goplerud & Weese of West Des Moines. Church is represented by Josh Christensen of RSH Legal in Cedar Rapids.
Lee agrees to $9.5 million payout in subscriber case
It’s not the first time data systems at Lee have been hacked. In 2020, Iranian cybercriminals allegedly gained access to the company’s systems as part of a what prosecutors claimed was a campaign to spread disinformation related to the 2020 presidential election. Two Iranian nationals were later charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, intimidate voters, and transmit interstate threats. Court records indicate the criminal case remains open and active.
In December 2022, a group of subscribers to Lee newspapers sued the company, alleging it had failed to disclose that their personal identifying information was being captured by various tracking methods embedded in Lee websites and then transferred to the social-media company Facebook where it could be accessed by others.
The lawsuit, which attained class-action status, alleged individuals could use fairly basic web-browsing tools to see the titles of whatever video content had triggered the initial exchange of information between Lee and Facebook, providing an indirect link between named Facebook users and the specific videos those users had watched on Lee websites.
The plaintiffs in that case sought a temporary injunction requiring Lee to immediately remove tracking tools from the company’s websites and to obtain the appropriate consent from subscribers for any information sharing that may take place.
In March 2025, the parties in that case reached a proposed settlement which they presented to the court for preliminary approval.
According to public court filings, the proposed settlement grew out of an all-day mediation session in November 2024 before Judge Wayne R. Andersen in Fort Myers, Florida. Andersen later provided a mediator’s proposal that recommended the matter be resolved by Lee or its insurer paying $9.5 million to settle the case, and the parties agreed.
Court records indicate the proposed settlement involves 1,528,941 paid subscribers to Lee newspapers who accessed video material on a Lee website at any time between December 2020 through March 4, 2025, and who used Facebook during that same period.
In a memorandum supporting court approval of the settlement, the parties state that the “$9,500,000 will yield a significant benefit to each of the participating class members,” while avoiding costly litigation that could drag on for years.
According to the court records, the settlement agreement also requires revisions to Lee’s business practices.
A court hearing on final approval of the settlement agreement is now scheduled for Aug. 7, 2025.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Two Oklahoma attorneys have sued state leaders, arguing that the state’s newly created business court system is unconstitutional. 
Joe E. White Jr. and Jason Waddell filed suit Thursday against Gov. Kevin Stitt, Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton and House Speaker Kyle Hilbert. White and Waddell are seeking a temporary injunction from the Oklahoma Supreme Court that would block Stitt from appointing judges to the new business courts set to open later this year in Oklahoma City and Tulsa until the court can weigh on the constitutionality of Senate Bill 632. 
The lawsuit contends the legislation, which passed late in session, is unconstitutional in part because of the high $1,565 filing fee and because lawmakers are attempting to bypass the Judicial Nominating Commission, a voter-approved board that helps fills judicial vacancies by screening potential applicants and submitting a list of finalists to the governor to choose from. It also argues that the Legislature did not have the authority to create the courts.
An emergency injunction is necessary because the new law takes effect Sept. 1, and Hilbert is expected to soon submit nominees to the Governor for the first two judges who will preside over the business courts, according to the lawsuit. 
“It would be unfair to ask any applicant for one of the two judicial positions to give up their law practice or judgeship during the pendency of this action,” according to the lawsuit.
State leaders are also expected to begin leasing space in Oklahoma and Tulsa counties this summer and hire staff for the courts.
“This meritless lawsuit is a Hail Mary pass thrown by trial attorneys who profit from maintaining the status quo,” Stitt said. “Our business court law will make Oklahoma the most business friendly state, in part by limiting lawsuit abuse by trial attorneys.” 
Passing legislation creating a court system that specializes in litigating business disputes, commercial lawsuits and other related issues that equal or exceed $500,000 was a top priority for the Republican governor. 
Under the proposed system, the court’s judges would be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. They would be selected from a list of three candidates selected by the Speaker of the House. 
“This legal challenge to business courts was anticipated by members of the Legislature during session,” Hilbert said in a statement. “Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, the House is committed to ensuring an effective court system for all Oklahomans.”
A spokesman for Paxton declined to comment until they had time to review the lawsuit.

The Republican National Committee filed a motion in federal court Thursday asking to intervene in a lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law.  Set to go into effect on Tuesday, the law requires a person to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote.

The po[...]","The Republican National Committee filed a motion in federal court Thursday asking to intervene in a lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s new voter registration law. 
Set to go into effect on Tuesday, the law requires a person to provide proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship when registering to vote. The law will also require someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in Wyoming for at least 30 days. 
Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group, filed a lawsuit in May, alleging the new law will impose an undue burden on the right to vote and is unconstitutionally vague as written. The group has asked the court to prevent the law from going into effect while the case plays out. 
High-profile attorneys — who have fought for and against President Trump on the national stage — have since flocked to both sides of the case. 
Even so, “when a state’s election laws are challenged in federal court, political parties should be granted intervention to protect their unique interests,” the Republican National Committee argued in its motion to intervene. 
If the court grants the request, the RNC would become a defendant in the case alongside Secretary of State Chuck Gray and the state’s 23 county clerks. 
As the primary governing body for the Republican Party in the United States, the group is responsible for organizing the party’s national convention, developing its political platform, coordinating campaign strategies and fundraising. 
When Arizona’s documentary-proof-of-citizenship requirement was challenged “on the same constitutional grounds in federal court, the RNC was granted intervention,” according to the motion. 
Wyoming’s law was a key priority for Gray and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which wields a majority in the Wyoming House of Representatives. 
The secretary and the Freedom Caucus have both claimed Wyoming was “the first in the nation” to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. The RNC’s motion, however, indicates Arizona had already adopted such and seen it challenged in court. 
“The RNC’s involvement has proven essential in that [Arizona] case; it has raised arguments and appealed decisions that the state defendants wouldn’t, and it secured emergency relief from the Supreme Court this past election cycle that each state defendant opposed,” the motion states. 
The RNC also argues that “safeguarding Republican voter confidence in the legitimacy of Wyoming’s electoral process” necessitates the group’s intervention in the case. 
Last November, prior to the election, almost 90% of Wyoming adults said they expected their county’s tally of ballots for president in the 2024 election to be very or somewhat reliable, according to a University of Wyoming survey.
If the court were to rule against the new law, “the RNC would need to divert resources from other mission-critical activities towards get-out-the-vote activities to reinsure Republican voter trust in Wyoming’s electoral system, to independently verify the accuracy of Wyoming’s voter registration rolls, and to educate voters and candidates concerning Wyoming’s changed registration requirements,” the motion argues. 
The RNC also argues that the current defendants — Gray and the state’s county clerks — do not adequately represent the Republican Party’s interests. 
“Defendants are Wyoming state officials, who must necessarily represent ‘the public interest,’” the motion states. “By contrast, the RNC’s interest is inherently ‘partisan.’”
Gray told WyoFile he welcomes “this motion to help support our arguments in defending Wyoming’s common-sense, conservative election integrity law requiring proof of citizenship for registering to vote.” 
“We need all hands on deck to combat radical left-wing DNC attorney Marc Elias’ attacks on any and all conservative election integrity reforms, including Wyoming’s common-sense proof of citizenship requirement,” Gray wrote.
Friday marked the deadline for Gray and his attorneys to respond to the Equality State Policy Center’s request for a temporary restraining order against the law until the case has been resolved. It had not been filed by publishing time.

Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.
Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. “It’s hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,” she said.
In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn’t worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.
Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor’s note. “There’s too much abuse in the system,” she said. She added that she doesn’t worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.
“That’s their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,” she said.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.
Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid “for people who rightly deserve” coverage, “not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.”
Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.
Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.
A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate’s version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.
According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill — about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.
The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. “That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,” he said.
Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.
Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.
“We’re making it easy” for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.
“We’re a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,” Carlton said. “We’re asking folks to engage in their communities. That’s a fundamentally good thing to do that’s part of getting benefits.”
Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months — and potentially as frequently as every month.
“This is not a conversation America should be in,” said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. “Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you’re kicked off.”
The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)
But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.
Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.
The federal government provides what’s called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.
But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled — that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas — do not receive SSI, according to KFF.
“It’s hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough” to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. “Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.”
He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.

She worries that potential Medicaid cuts could cause her to lose her job and cause her grandchild, on Medicaid because of a disability, to lose his coverage. (Phil Galewitz/KFF Health News)
Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.
Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.
Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a “modification” from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state’s job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.
Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.
Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.
Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group’s findings — that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren’t interested in a job — explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.
“Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,” he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. “People struggle with the documentation process.”
Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they’re seeking new jobs.
Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. “It will be messy,” he said.
Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don’t, though he surmises it’s a small portion of the population. “People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.”

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)In the shadow of Three Mile Island’s iconic cooling towers, state Rep. Tom Mehaffie recalled Wednesday how his father, 50 years earlier, built a career and a life around the nuclear power plant.
“When Constellation left and this plant shut down, a lot was missed,” Mehaffie said, noting the fortunes of businesses and the community followed that of the plant in Dauphin County.
Now, state government and energy and tech industry leaders are betting on its rebirth as an example of Pennsylvania’s readiness to power future industries, including electricity-intensive artificial intelligence data centers.
In a $16 billion deal between owner Constellation Energy and Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers, Three Mile Island is set to return to service as the Crane Clean Energy Center.
“Let’s not just open this plant, let’s open business,” Mehaffie told a tent full of Constellation Energy workers gathered to celebrate progress in the plant’s restoration, including an expedited review that cuts about a year off the project’s timeline.
About 10 miles south of Harrisburg near Middletown, Three Mile Island was the site of a 1979 nuclear accident that transfixed the world. But after that partial meltdown in one of the plant’s two reactors, the remaining Unit 1 continued safely producing electricity for another 40 years.
In 2019, Constellation determined the facility was no longer economically viable and put plans in motion to permanently decommission the reactor. With peak energy demand, driven largely by data centers, predicted to grow up to 17% by 2035, the plant’s capacity is now in high demand.
“We made a mistake in shutting down this plant, but we’re not here to dwell on that mistake,” Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said, noting that hiring staff for the recommissioning process is ahead of schedule because many former workers returned.
The plant’s reopening will support at least 650 permanent jobs and hundreds more for building-trade workers during the recommissioning process.
Gov. Josh Shapiro welcomed the returning workers Wednesday, as he highlighted the role of nuclear power in his energy plan.
“We’re going to make sure you never have to leave again,” Shapiro said. “This is going to be one of those places where the jobs get passed down from generation to generation, where fathers talk to their daughters about the work that they did, and their daughters pick up that mantle of energy leadership right here at Crane.”
Shapiro has outlined a plan over the last two years to ensure the commonwealth remains a leader in the competitive energy market, by leveraging the state’s natural gas resources while making it an attractive location for sustainable energy technologies. Part of the plan, now under consideration as a suite of bills before the General Assembly, is a goal to obtain 35% of the state’s energy from renewable sources by 2035.
Shapiro noted his administration intervened to ensure the Crane center would be able to quickly reconnect to the regional power grid that serves Pennsylvania and all or parts of 12 other states.
PJM Interconnect, which operates the grid and ensures adequate energy supplies, has a backlog of projects waiting to be approved for connection. The company created its Reliable Resource Initiative last year to expedite the interconnection of 51 shovel-ready generating resources that include battery storage, nuclear and natural gas facilities, a PJM spokesperson said.
Shapiro, who describes himself as an “all of the above energy governor,” noted the state has four operating nuclear power plants that provide nearly one-third of its energy.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Shapiro said. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy for Microsoft, said the Crane center is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring nuclear energy online with the speed needed to match the growth of artificial intelligence.
“It’s a unique opportunity where we can bring together a supportive community, state and a skilled workforce that is absolutely the best kept secret ingredient,” Hollis said.
Microsoft’s agreement to purchase all of the Crane center’s 835 megawatt output demonstrates the importance of abundant energy for tech industry growth, Shapiro said.
“That is a heck of a signal of the optimism people feel about Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said, noting that Amazon also recently announced a $20 billion investment in a data complex near the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear power plant in Luzerne County.
PJM interconnection president and CEO Manu Asthana said as the state swelters through its first heatwave of the summer, the growth in demand for energy is apparent. PJM this week recorded an all-time peak in electricity production, nine gigawatts larger than last summer’s peak. Asthana said the difference is equal to 11 times the Crane center’s planned output.
“What we’re talking about here is not hypothetical. Our country needs this power. All of our citizens need this power just to keep their lights on, to stay warm, to stay cool,” he said, adding that ensuring power for all that plus AI is a matter of national security.
“I can’t imagine by 2030 what artificial intelligence will enable us to do and strategically, for our country, for our state, for our region, it is critical that we win that race, and the power that you produce here is critical to winning that race.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Seven years after the Florida Legislature approved a memorial recognizing the tragedy of slavery for the grounds of the Florida Capitol, the bronze statue called “Circle of Chains” has been completed and is on display across the street from the building.
Not that anyone is actually aware of that.
“I had no idea!” Miami-Dade County Democratic Rep. Ashley Gantt told the Phoenix when asked about the public unveiling of the memorial earlier this week.
Neither did Miami-Dade County Sen. Shevrin Jones.
“I had no idea the memorial had even been installed – and that says a lot,” Jones told the Phoenix. “A monument honoring the pain and resilience of enslaved Africans deserves more than a quiet placement. After seven years of work, there should have been a moment to honor that history publicly.”
Approved in 2018
The Legislature approved the memorial during the 2018 legislative session. Miami-Dade Democrat Kionne McGhee sponsored the measure in the House, and Tampa Bay-area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson carried it in the Senate. The bill charged the Department of Management Services with developing its design, placement, and cost. It is located at the Black Archives-Union Bank Museum on Apalachee Parkway and was installed on April 28.
“The idea behind the memorial is to recognize the brutality of slavery and the cruelty of slavery towards a people and then to honor the nameless faces of individuals that suffer through slavery,” Rouson said this week
State lawmakers dedicated $400,000 to erect the memorial, as they did during the 2016 legislative session for a Holocaust Memorial that was installed at the Capital earlier this year. A public ceremony was held  for that event in March, attended by Gov. DeSantis.
The monument was created by Carmel, California, sculptor Steven Whyte, selected by review committee members who called on artists to recognize “the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the United States and the American colonies and to honor the nameless and forgotten men, women, and children who have gone unrecognized for their undeniable and weighty contributions to the United States.”
As the House prepared to vote on the proposal in 2018, Rep. McGhee told lawmakers that slaves in 1845 helped construct the Old Capitol building in Tallahassee, according to WFSU-Radio. PolitiFact reported that although authorities were unable to find conclusive documentation about the construction, African American slaves were part of almost every facet of Florida life in the 19th Century, according to historians. PolitiFact labeled his comment “mostly true.” (McGhee, now a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, did not respond to a request for comment).
Plans for a Formal Ceremony
Rouson said he was informed by state officials that they wanted to install surveillance cameras on the property before making any formal announcement. “But now that surveillance is in place and there’s some protection in the event of vandalism, I intend to urge the Black Caucus to do more of a formal ceremony when we go back [this fall] for committee weeks,” he said.
Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman said she knew the memorial was being constructed but wasn’t aware it had been finished and is now open to the public.
“I wholeheartedly support Sen. Rouson’s efforts for a formal opening ceremony this fall — the enslaved men, women, and children who built this country deserve to have their experience remembered and their legacy honored,” she said.
Sen. Jones said he also supports Rouson’s call for a “proper ceremony when we return.”
“Our ancestors deserve to be seen and acknowledged,” he said.

Dick Harpootlian, talk about their legal challenge to a legislative pay raise that inadvertently also halted existing payments outside Harpootlian's Columbia office on Monday, June 9, 2025. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — State legislators will get a pay cut following a state Supreme Court order that halted so-called “in-district compensation” payments.
The Wednesday order came in response to a legal challenge over a $1,500 monthly raise legislators included in the state budget.
The $1,000 legislators have been receiving each month since 1995 under that same budget clause became collateral damage in the pause. If the state’s high court sides with the state senator questioning the constitutionality of the raise, the pay could go away altogether, cutting legislators’ incomes by $12,000 per year.
The change would apply only to the money meant to pay for duties outside the Statehouse. Legislators would still receive their annual salary of $10,400 and stipends for food and lodging during session, which are currently $240 per day.
The order instructed the state treasurer to stop “distributing any funds” under the clause included in the state budget that goes into effect Tuesday.
Because legislators rewrote the existing clause instead of adding a new one with the increased amount, that affected the entire sum they would have received.
“In light of the Court’s order, I want to inform you that, at a minimum, no in-district payments will be made on July 16 or August 16,” Senate President Thomas Alexander wrote in a letter to senators Wednesday. “To be specific, this amount includes both the prior $1,000 as well as the $1,500 increase. Any future payments will depend on further action by the Supreme Court in this matter.”
Representatives received a similar notification from the House clerk, emphasizing that the decision will affect the entire monthly payment, not just the raise.
Even the 44 Republicans in both chambers who turned down the increase will lose out on their normal $1,000 each month.
SC Supreme Court presses pause on legislative pay raise pending final decision

That could be the case for the foreseeable future, said Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, who’s among the Republicans who opted out of the raise.
The court order set a deadline of Sept. 4 for legal filings, though it could take longer for justices to come to a decision.
If the justices decide the raise is unconstitutional, they can’t keep the original payments in play without rewriting a piece of the state budget, a move that would go beyond the court’s authority, the Edgefield Republican said.
Legislators could reinstate the original amount, but getting the votes to do so during an election year for the House, as 2026 will be, is unlikely because of the potential campaign fodder it could give opponents, Massey said.
In that case, legislators would go at least a year and a half with the lowest salary they’ve had in decades.
“I don’t think we can fix it,” Massey said.
That wasn’t the intention, said Sen. Wes Climer, who is challenging the raise in court. He didn’t have a problem with the in-district compensation itself, he added, but rather with legislators increasing it during a non-election year.
“It’s unfortunate,” the Rock Hill Republican said. “It’s not the desired outcome. But the fault for this outcome lies with those who tried to cheat. That outcome is still better than the Legislature appropriating itself the people’s money in real time.”
Climer, represented by former senator and Columbia attorney Dick Harpootlian, has argued in court filings that the raise violates a provision in the state constitution that bars legislators from increasing their own “per diem.”
When the 1890 constitution that still governs the state went into effect, that per diem was the only payment legislators received, so it effectively covered all of their income, Harpootlian has argued in court filings.
Attorneys for the House and Senate have argued the constitutional clause barring legislators from raising their own per diem applies only to the subsistence stipends meant to cover meals and lodging. The in-district compensation qualifies as a reimbursement, even though legislators don’t have to report how they spent the money, attorneys for both chambers have argued in legal filings.
Senators who voted both for and against the raise are frustrated knowing they’re getting at least a temporary pay cut, Massey said.
The last time legislators tried to increase their in-district compensation, in 2014, they did so in a separate budget clause that would have given legislators the option of an extra $1,000 per month. Then-Gov. Nikki Haley vetoed the raise, but because it was a separate part of the budget, legislators’ existing pay remained in place.
Losing a portion of what little legislators make “discourages people who don’t have individual wealth or own their own business from running for office,” said Rep. John King, a longtime supporter of increasing legislators’ pay.
The Rock Hill Democrat used his $1,000 each month to help pay for extra staff at the funeral home he runs so he could spend more time helping constituents, he said. He’ll be able to make up the difference by paying out of pocket, but others may not, he said.
Conversations around increasing pay to encourage more people to run for office are worthwhile, Massey said. Having people from different backgrounds often leads to more points of view on issues and, therefore, better legislation, he said.
“Having a pay decrease certainly doesn’t help that,” Massey said.
But legislators went about getting a raise the wrong way by adding it to the state budget instead of going through a committee process that would have included vetting and public input, he said. His opposition to how the raise was approved is why he turned it down.
Going through the normal committee process probably would have flagged the constitutional question and allowed legislators to write the law in a way that wouldn’t put their current pay in jeopardy, he said.
“There are consequences to doing it this way,” Massey said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4048-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More people in the United States died by gun suicide in 2023 than any year on record — more than by gun homicide, accidental shootings and police shootings combined.
A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention.
The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC’s Wonder database.
Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report.
Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000.

“People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it’s highly lethal and it’s easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That’s really a deadly combination, and it’s really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.”
Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings.
More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon.
This week, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol.
Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer.
Guns kill more US children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds

Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “I​​t’s also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview.
Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older.
For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded.
Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities.
Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023. In contrast, the rate for white youth in the same age group increased more gradually, from 2.6 to 3 per 100,000 people. It was the second consecutive year that Black youth had a higher rate than their white peers.
Gun suicides among Hispanic youth 10 to 19 also nearly doubled from 2014 to 2023, according to the CDC’s data.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Montgomery County parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement sai

Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.
Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,

(Photo by Julia Goldberg/ Source NM)United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced this week that her agency intends to repeal a 24-year-old rule that prohibits road construction and timber harvesting on 91,000 square miles of federal Forest Service land.
Rollins, speaking Monday at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in New Mexico, said the protections President Bill Clinton imposed for “inventoried roadless areas” in 2001 hamper forest management and wildfire prevention. She also noted that repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests.
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests. Under the leadership of President Trump, this administration knows timber production is critical to our nation’s well-being,” Rollins said.
The announcement drew swift condemnation from several environmentalist groups, including the Wilderness Society and the Center for Western Priorities, which described it as a gift to private logging interests that undermines a long-successful conservation policy.

“It’s ridiculous for Secretary Rollins to spin this as a move that will reduce wildfire risk or improve recreation. Commercial logging exacerbates climate change, increasing the intensity of wildfires,” said Rachael Hamby, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, in an emailed statement. “This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us.”
More than 250,000 acres of federal land in North Dakota are categorized Inventoried Roadless Areas. Most of it is in the western part of the state.
Some road construction and reconstruction is already allowed on this land, according to a U.S. Forest Service map.
The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to an email seeking more specific information about how the policy change could affect North Dakota.
The office of U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., called repealing the rule a step in the right direction.
“While road construction is currently permitted, rescission of the 2001 Roadless Rule removes the threat of future restrictions inhibiting access to multiple use activities like grazing and energy production,” the office said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican who attended the Western Governors’ Association meeting, also praised Rollins’ proposal.
“Increasing access to public lands is a win for North Dakota, and rescinding this rule further enables responsible federal lands management, including the continuation of responsible grazing practices,” Armstrong said in a statement.
Shannon Straight, executive director of the Badland Conservation Alliance, said that the proposed repeal of the rule is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers to strip away public land protections.
“We’re losing our wilderness, we’re losing our habitat,” Straight said.
He also said millions of acres of public lands could be sold off under the “big, beautiful bill.” North Dakota isn’t one of them, according to an analysis published last week by the Wilderness Society, though the bill’s text is still being revised.
Straight said that regardless, North Dakotans that care about public lands should still urge the state’s congressional delegation to oppose the sales.
USDA says repealing ‘roadless’ protections will prevent wildfires. A new study disagrees

The roadless rule announcement drew mixed reactions from the western governors on stage at the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said the state has been trying to repeal the rule there for years, saying it has left huge swaths of forest untreated and more-wildfire prone.
“A good forest is like a garden. You actually have to tend it and take care of it. If we do this the right way, we can prevent fires and improve production,” he said.
But New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham took a moment to defend President Clinton’s rule, which he implemented in the final days of his second term in office.
“Climate change is the biggest problem in fueling these damaging fires,” she said, drawing applause.
“Well, we may agree to disagree on that, but that’s a debate for another time,” Rollins said.
“No, it’s a debate right here in this room,” the governor responded. “You’re in New Mexico and we’re very clear about that.”
Lujan Grisham went on to thank Rollins for trying to give states “more independence” when it comes to forest management, and also said Clinton himself would likely appreciate the push for more wildfire mitigation.
Rollins previewed the announcement during a news conference, during which she also discussed the current wildfires in the state, and referred to the U.S. Forest service employees flanking her as “patriots.”
For too long, she said, “western states, especially those with large swaths of land administered by our incredible Forest Service, have been inhibited from innovating because of burdensome regulations imposed by the federal government…This has a huge impact on so many communities, especially when the federal government ties its own hands with burdensome regulations and does not properly manage the land.”

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a victory Friday to Maryland parents who object, for religious reasons, to the Montgomery County school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion says.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent says.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.

,California,2025-06-27 18:38:16+00:00,CalMatters,Gavin Newsom takes Fox News to court over call with Donald Trump,Yue Stella Yu,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/california-newsom-lawsuit-fox-news/,"In his lawsuit, Newsom claims that Fox News “covered up” the president’s false statement regarding the timing of a call between Trump and Newsom.","In summary
In his lawsuit, Newsom claims that Fox News “covered up” the president’s false statement regarding the timing of a call between Trump and Newsom.


Gov. Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News for defamation, claiming that the network lied about the date he last spoke with President Donald Trump on the phone and accused the governor of lying about the call.
“By disregarding basic journalistic ethics in favor of malicious propaganda, Fox continues to play a major role in the further erosion of the bedrock principles of informed representative government,” the lawsuit reads.
The lawsuit, filed Friday by Newsom as an individual, seeks $787 million in damages from the network — roughly the same amount Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems in 2023 to settle a defamation case over the network’s election claims. Newsom promised to drop the suit if Fox News retracts its claim that Newsom lied and issues a formal on-air apology.
To some Democratic strategists, Newsom’s move demonstrates the governor’s willingness to check Trump’s power. It is the latest episode of an on-again-off-again feud between him and Trump, who collaborated over Los Angeles wildfire aid earlier this year but fought over the president’s deployment of troops to quell unrest in the same city despite Newsom’s objection.  
“Democrats across the country are out there yearning for Democrats to take on Trump,” said longtime Democratic consultant Garry South. “Partly through Trump’s own stumbles and his own mistakes, I think that he has inadvertently boosted Newsom into the position of being the chief protagonist against him.”
Fox News said in a statement that it would defend the case “vigorously.” 
“Gov. Newsom’s transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him,” the statement said.
Newsom’s attorneys argued in a letter that the network intentionally misled its audience into believing the governor lied about his last call with Trump earlier this month, before the two clashed over Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles amid protests over immigration enforcement. 
The governor spoke with Trump over the phone for 16 minutes on June 7, the letter said. But Trump told a reporter on June 10 that he’d spoken with Newsom “a day ago” instead, stating that he had called Newsom “to tell him, got to do a better job, he’s doing a bad job.”
Newsom rebuked the president in a statement on X, arguing there was no call or even a voicemail from Trump on that day. “Americans should be alarmed that a President deploying Marines onto our streets doesn’t even know who he’s talking to,” he said.
But Fox News hosts John Roberts and Jesse Watters left out Trump’s comment suggesting the call had taken place June 9 in their coverage, Newsom’s attorneys argued. And Watters claimed on air that Newsom lied, even though he reported that call logs showed the call occurred on June 6.  
“Why would Newsom lie and claim Trump never called him? Why would he do that?” Watters said, with a banner appearing on screen simultaneously that said: “Gavin lied about Trump’s call.”
Newsom’s attorneys argued the coverage shows the network’s effort to “cover up for President Trump’s error.”
But in suing Fox News, Newsom is taking a page from Trump’s own playbook by suing prominent media outlets for their coverage, drawing concern from First Amendment advocates who urged Newsom to drop the case.
“Lawsuits like this risk becoming a form of censorship and send a troubling message to news organizations: that they may face legal retaliation for their work,” said Katherine Jacobsen, program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/10072022-Newsom-Presser-RL-CM-011.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

With more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, our state is harnessing the power of the sun to lower energy bills, create jobs, and strengthen our grid.
But that progress — and the local jobs and savings it brings — is now under serious threat.
At the heart of this issue is the federal residential solar investment tax credit, known as the 25D credit.
For decades, this incentive has helped thousands of South Carolinians afford rooftop solar systems. It’s been a win-win: Homeowners cut their energy bills, and solar companies expand operations, hiring local workers to meet the growing demand.
But the so-called “One Big Beautiful” budget bill — which the president wants on his desk by July 4 — aims to eliminate the 25D credit within months.
This would be a catastrophic blow to South Carolina’s rooftop solar industry — and to our ability to meet future energy demands affordably and reliably.

The timing couldn’t be worse. Rooftop solar is an important energy generation source that can be scaled up quickly.
That speed is critical as our state grapples with rising electricity demand, aging grid infrastructure, and the growing costs of fossil fuels.
And the potential doesn’t stop at homes.
South Carolina is rich in industrial and commercial rooftop space — warehouses, factories, and retail stores with untapped solar potential. Ending the 25D credit would slam the brakes on this opportunity just as momentum is building.
The broader economic impact is no less troubling.
A new analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that gutting these tax credits could cause an immediate drop in solar and storage investments across the U.S.
By 2030, as much as $220 billion in investment could be lost. This doesn’t just impact solar panel installers, but also manufacturers, electricians, engineers, and logistics providers who all contribute to this growing clean energy economy.
And as Republicans in the Senate thrash out the details, the policy uncertainty is already having repercussions. More than $9 billion in investments have already been cancelled or stalled in 2025, according to E2. Republican districts have been hit the hardest.
In South Carolina, we’ve already seen what federal clean energy incentives can do.
Since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, our state has secured over $15 billion in clean energy investment — second only to North Carolina. Projects from companies like Scout Motors and Redwood Materials are bringing thousands of new jobs to the Palmetto State.
Unfortunately, many of the same South Carolina lawmakers whose districts are benefiting from this boom have succumbed to partisan pressure to phase out the very credits spurring the investment. That includes the 25D credit, along with key incentives for solar leases and solar manufacturing.
This isn’t just bad politics — it’s an economic misfire.
Removing the 25D credit means fewer homeowners can afford solar, fewer installers stay in business, and fewer South Carolinians get hired. It also makes our grid more vulnerable and our energy prices more volatile.
Meanwhile, state-level actions like the so-called South Carolina Energy Security Act, which was signed into law in May, are poised to make things worse by allowing utilities to raise rates annually.
Repealing existing federal clean energy tax credits and funding programs would increase average annual household energy costs in South Carolina (including electricity and fuel expenses) by nearly $50 per year in 2030 and nearly $270 per year in 2035 (Energy Innovation Policy & Technology).
The good news? The bill is not yet signed, sealed or delivered to the Oval Office.
Preserving the 25D credit and other clean energy incentives could add $32 billion to South Carolina’s economy over the next decade and support nearly 220,000 full-time jobs, according to a study commissioned by American Clean Power.
This isn’t a red state or blue state issue — it’s a commonsense economic one.
Clean energy tax credits are delivering real results in South Carolina.
Undoing them now would undercut years of progress, threaten jobs, and raise costs for families and businesses.
Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott and their colleagues in the House have long championed South Carolina’s economic growth.
They can now help protect one of the state’s fastest-growing industries, rooftop solar, and the jobs of hardworking South Carolinians who are building our clean energy future — one rooftop at a time.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-at-home-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

SPRINGFIELD — Gov. JB Pritzker began his third campaign for governor on Thursday, but much of the buzz around his 2026 campaign announcement focused on 2028.

Pritzker made four stops around the state to launch his campaign, fielding questions about any future interest in the presidency and what is driving him to run for what would be a historic third term. In his final stop in Springfield on Thursday evening, he was toasting personally branded “JBeers” – his own craft beer product he unveiled at least year’s Democratic National Convention – with a group of about 100 people at a small event venue just outside the Capitol and talking about his motivations.

“Every day I’m going to wake up going forward thinking about what I am going to do that’s going to help the people of Illinois,” Pritzker told reporters in Springfield when asked how many years of a third term he would serve. “So that’s the reason I’m running for reelection, it’s why I announced today, it’s what I’m going to do every day going forward no matter what decision I make.”

The 60-year-old Democrat’s national profile has grown significantly over the last year. He was a finalist to be former Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate last July, and weeks later, introduced himself to the country on the stage of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In the months since President Donald Trump took office, Pritzker has emerged as one of his most vocal critics.

At news conferences throughout the state, Pritzker did not directly commit to serving a full four-year term if he is reelected and sidestepped questions about his rumored White House ambitions.

But while staying tight-lipped about what he thinks about his prospects in the 2028 presidential election, he said any decision he makes about his future would be Illinois-centric.

Speculation shows Pritzker ‘capable and competent’

In the meantime, Pritzker said he believed his inclusion in the national conversation is good for Illinois.

“When I ran for governor in the first place in 2017 and 2018, never, never could I have imagined that anybody would talk about me as the potential vice-presidential nominee or as a candidate for president of the United States,” Pritzker said.

While Republicans have frequently criticized the governor for his tendencies to criticize Trump rather than work with him to Illinois’ benefit, the governor spun his rising national profile as a positive.

“Having the state of Illinois’ leaders viewed as capable and competent and potentially able to run the entire country and being talked about in that way, allows us, I think, to get more for the people of Illinois because there’s an understanding that, you know, maybe in Illinois we’re doing the right things,” he said. “Maybe in Illinois we have leaders that can competently execute on what states really need.”

Pritzker said his experience last summer being vetted for the vice presidency has not played any role in the decisions he has made about his political career.

Should Pritzker decide to run for president, an announcement would likely come at some point in 2027 during what would be the first year of his third term if he’s reelected.

Pritzker’s goal: ‘Protect’ Illinois and his legacy

Pritzker said at his announcement Thursday that his goal in 2026 is to preserve his legacy and “protect” the story of Illinois that’s been written under his leadership. Pritzker didn’t outline a bold vision for his third term but rather pledged to build off what he has already accomplished.

He said his third term would focus on grappling with artificial intelligence, addressing the rising cost of living, continued spending on infrastructure and growing the state’s economy.

Pritzker reflected on his decision to seek reelection despite growing challenges facing the state.

“I don’t shy away from a fight, and we’re going to have to protect the people of Illinois,” Pritzker told reporters in Springfield. “And I feel like we’re in a moment when backing away from public service when things are hard doesn’t feel right. So that’s one of the reasons I chose to run for reelection.”

Pritzker was asked whether he would have run had Trump not been elected last year.

“I think I would, but I have to say that in this moment, it feels like walking away is the wrong thing to do given who is in the White House and given how this administration is attacking people all across this country,” Pritzker said.

The governor must also choose a new running mate as Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton has decided to run for U.S. Senate. Pritzker said he will choose one by the end of July so his campaign can start circulating nominating petitions in early August. Pritzker said in Chicago that he is looking for someone with enough experience to take over as governor if required.

Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, D-Peoria, may be an early front-runner for the job. Pritzker specifically referred to Gordon-Booth as qualified at a stop in East Peoria on Thursday when asked about potential running mates, WGLT reported. The assistant House majority leader has been in the General Assembly since 2009.

“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose — guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity,” the statement said.



Florida now requires schools to implement a review process for library materials objected to by parents and community members who think the content is pornographic or inappropriate. Laws that necessitate parental approval have drawn lawsuits and free speech concerns. Lawmakers have acknowledged excessive numbers of objections were raised and now nonparent residents are restricted to one objection per month.
In Florida, the attorney general recently opened a parental-rights arm to litigate laws related to gender transition, library materials, school surveys, and other topics that have dominated legislative, judicial, and executive conversations in recent years. In announcing the office, Uthmeier said Florida has been a “shining city on a hill” for “enshrining parental rights.”

Brenda Johnston Naatz Bandy passed gracefully on Wednesday, June 25th, 2025, surrounded by love, laughter, and music. Born on November 4th, 1939, in St. Johnsbury to Doris and Charles Naatz, she was an excellent daughter, sister, and occasional farmhand on their family dairy farm.
Among Brenda’s many gifts was the ability to make life feel simultaneously sacred and as amusing as a Carol Burnett skit. Her beauty was only rivaled by her talent, humor, and boundless care for others. As Miss Vermont, she performed a side-splitting Victor Borge comedy routine on the piano at the 1960 Miss America Pageant, winning the talent portion of the competition. She earned scholarships for her creative skills and attended Rochester Institute of Technology to study Interior Design before returning to Vermont to care for her mother in her final years. While Miss Vermont, she also won the attention of her assigned Cadet escort, Bill Currier, with whom she quickly fell in love. They married and traveled the world while raising three rambunctious children before settling in upstate New York. There, she was a church organist, choir director, a full-time mother, and the one-woman powerhouse of an 11-acre horse farm, where she boarded over a dozen horses and taught riding—all while keeping her sense of humor (and most of her sanity). 
She played every instrument she encountered with otherworldly skill, though her favorites include the pipe organ at the Peacham Congregational Church, piano, bagpipes, and the accordion. In addition to her endless musical and performing talents, she was a gifted craftsperson. She excelled at creating model horse-drawn carriages and miniature dollhouses along with all of the delicate painting, sculpture, and leatherwork that entailed.

A lifelong equestrian, Brenda’s love for horses easily withstood a lifetime of shoveling manure. She won several accolades and blue ribbons for her Morgan horses—including one New York State Grand Champion Morgan mare, Vanderland Gabrielle “Gabby”—and taught all of her children and grandchildren how to ride (and clean the stalls). Her deep love for animals was unmatched; even the most skittish stray cats grew to return her affections tenfold. 
Brenda was a skillful and beloved teacher and returned to school to earn her music teaching degree in 1986 at the age of 47. She taught music to all grades at Blue Mountain Union, where she met her second husband, Arnold Bandy, a social studies teacher and athletic director. Together, they shared great pride in teaching and learning with their students. With endless energy and enthusiasm, she led her students to create elaborate, impressive musical productions. Her pride in teaching was well earned, as she taught all those around her how to make things that mattered—music, art, a home, a life—by hand, by heart, and with just the right amount of humor.
For Brenda, the sun rose and set over the children in her life. She is survived by her beloved children, Tonya Currier and her husband Dan Griggs, Miles Currier and his wife Cheryl, Matthew Bandy and his wife Anne, and Auburn Watersong; her niece, Jennifer Gilman and her husband Peter Pelissier; her adored grandchildren, Tia Hohman and her husband Rusty, Gabe Harter, Emma Harter, and Liam Currier; her great-niece Kelsey Gilman and her great-nephews Teddy Gilman and Chad Larabee; her dearest and only great-grandchildren, Eden and Ezra Hohman. Brenda leaves behind a sprawling chosen family of dear friends and creative kin who will carry her memory forward with laughter, music, and love. 
In her passing, Brenda joins her husband, Arnold Bandy, her dear sisters Carolyn and Frannie, her beloved nephew Charlie “Thumper” Gilman, many close girlfriends, as well as dozens of spoiled horses, ponies, cats, dogs, and at least one goat waiting patiently for her to return with treats.

Patrick Morrisey gives an update on flood recovery at the Marion County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management  in Fairmont, W.Va. on Friday, June 27, 2025. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)Flash floods on Thursday evening struck several parts of West Virginia, including an area in the northern part of the state still reeling from severe weather earlier this month. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Friday no loss of life has been reported as a result of Thursday’s flash floods. Officials are assessing any new damage that might have occurred in Ohio County on Thursday, he said. 
“I know that I saw some pictures coming out of Triadelphia from last night, and that was a community that was hit very, very hard,” Morrisey said Friday during a press briefing from Fairmont. 
According to the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh, about 1.6 inches of rain fell in an hour in parts of the Wheeling area Thursday evening, causing roads and basements to flood and some creeks to exceed their banks. 
Nine people died in the flash floods that washed through northern West Virginia after several inches of rain fell in a short period of time June 14 and 15. 
The body of a ninth victim, 83-year-old Sandra Kay Parsons, was found in the Ohio River on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. No other people are believed to be unaccounted for, Morrisey said this week.
Overnight Thursday, high water caused the northbound lanes of the West Virginia Turnpike to be closed near the Dawes exit in Kanawha County for more than eight hours, according to news reports. 
According to radar estimates from the National Weather Service in Charleston, around 6 inches of rain fell Thursday evening in that area of the county, meteorologist Ray Young said. 
Morrisey said state officials are investigating the Turnpike closure, which he called “unacceptable.”
“We’re going to get to the bottom of everything,” Morrisey said. “I’m going to tell you that we’re going to get to the bottom of things to make sure that everything is done right, and if there are problems that were decisions that were made that were bad, we’re going to make sure that we let people know about that… But most importantly, we’re trying to make sure that that road is fully passable.”
Morrisey has asked for a federal disaster declaration that would make assistance available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Ohio and Marion counties for the floods earlier this month. He said he’s been in close contact with the Trump administration about the request. 
Morrisey stressed that flooded residents who have not done so should fill out a damage survey, available online at emd.wv.gov 
“Ultimately, that’s a critical part of the process to ensure that the feds know exactly what happened on the ground, and then they’ll make financial decisions as a result of it,” he said. “So if you haven’t done so already, we urge people to fill out their disaster survey form.”
Morrisey announced this week the West Virginia Housing Development Fund has approved providing about $500,000 for housing assistance to flooded residents. The funding is also available for those affected by floods in February. 
“It’s hard to fathom just how hard these communities were hit, but they have come together with strength and resilience during this challenging time,” Morrisey said in a statement. “The funds that I’ve made available for housing-related expenses are another step in the recovery process, and we’re working as quickly as possible to distribute these funds to those who need them.”
To apply for housing assistance, flooded residents can visit the Housing Development Fund’s website at https://www.wvhdf.com. 
In addition to the housing assistance, SNAP recipients who lost food during the June 14 and 15 flash floods have until July 7 to apply for benefits to replace it, the state Department of Health announced Thursday. 
The department extended the deadline to apply by 10 days, according to a news release. The extension applies to households in Marion, Ohio and Monongalia counties who lost food because of the severe storms that began on June 14. 
SNAP recipients are eligible for replacement benefits if they lost food due to a power outage that lasted more than four hours, the DoHS said. They must provide verification and a signed affidavit. For more information, contact a local DoHS county office or call the state Office of Constituent Services’ Customer Service Hotline at 1-877-716-1212.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of the Trump administration on Friday, the state of Washington still intends to seek a nationwide block of the president’s order to restrict birthright citizenship. 
“Washington still plans to seek relief for all its harms — that is what we argued for and won in the trial court,” attorney general’s office spokesperson Mike Faulk said in an email Friday.
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, alongside attorneys general from Oregon, Arizona and Illinois, had argued nationwide relief was necessary while litigation plays out over the order. 
But in a 6-3 ruling in the case on Friday, the Supreme Court imposed new limits on lower court judges issuing nationwide injunctions. 
Under the ruling, President Donald Trump’s order could go into effect in 30 days in states that didn’t sue, raising the possibility that babies born to immigrant parents in Washington would be U.S. citizens, while those born in neighboring states like Idaho would not be.
The high court did not rule on the merits of Trump’s executive order. Further legal battles over the order, including with the lawsuit backed by Washington, still lie ahead.
Brown has argued previously that the state, instead of the federal government, would have to pay for social services for babies born in other states without birthright citizenship who later move to states like Washington.
In his Feb. 6 injunction, U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour in Seattle agreed, ordering that anything less than nationwide relief is “ineffectual.” Coughenour’s order was one of three nationwide injunctions the Supreme Court considered.
Brown, in a statement, noted that the justices “confirmed that courts may issue broad injunctions when needed to provide complete relief to the parties.”
“We continue to believe that President Trump’s unconstitutional and cruel order must be stopped across the country to guarantee protection for Washington and its residents,” he continued.
Washington’s case currently sits at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after arguments in Seattle this month. Whether the Supreme Court’s ruling sends the case back to Coughenour is unclear. Faulk said the attorney general’s office expects more clarity on this question soon.
Trump’s executive action aims to end birthright citizenship for babies born to a mother and father who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
In 2022, about 4,000 babies were born in Washington to two parents without legal immigration status, according to the states’ lawsuit.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3450-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-27 15:06:54.901121

Jeff Landry shakes the hand of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. before a bill signing ceremony June 27, 2025, at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry endorsed legislation Friday to “Make American Healthy Again” with the nation’s controversial top health official at his side for the bill signing ceremony.
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended a bill signing ceremony at Pennington Biomedical Research Center after helping craft legislation the Louisiana Legislature approved unanimously to regulate what ingredients can be in the food served in public school lunches.
Kennedy said he anticipates other states will follow Louisiana’s lead, resulting in food manufacturers proactively making changes to improve the contents of their products and reduce the amount of ultra-processed food they generate.  
“We’re seeing the companies coming to the table … because they don’t want what you’re doing here in Louisiana,” Kennedy told the audience.
The key bill Landry signed was Senate Bill 14 by Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, which bans several dyes, artificial sweeteners and other ingredients from school meals. In its original state, the proposal also sought to restrict what people could purchase with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, but those provisions were stripped out during the legislative process. 
“It’s about transparency for restaurants and food manufacturers to disclose the types of foods they’re serving us and the impacts on our bodies,” McMath said during his introduction of Kennedy and the governor.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Landry announced Friday he would seek a waiver from the Trump administration to prohibit the purchase of some unhealthy foods with SNAP benefits and seek permission to let people buy certain prepared foods, such as rotisserie chicken. 
McMath’s bill is part of a nationwide backlash against “ultra-processed foods,” food dyes, seed oils and certain chemical additives Kennedy has targeted for elimination. Such products are typically high in calories, sugar, salt and unhealthy fats.
Kennedy, who worked with McMath on the bill, said most of America’s chronic health issues can be linked to the foods they consume.  
Also signed was Senate Bill 19 by Sen. Mike Fesi, R-Houma, which allows pharmacists to provide ivermectin without a doctor’s prescription. Its proponents say ivermectin can be successfully used to treat a variety of ailments, including COVID-19, though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved its use for intestinal parasites in pill form and to treat head lice and rosacea as a topical cream.
Though Kennedy praised the bills Landry signed into law, he also called for Congress to approve comparable federal measures. 
“We need national laws, and we’re going to do it on our own,” Kennedy said.

The bill signing ceremony took place at a conference center on the Pennington campus, where the audience included supporters and their children wearing green “MAHA Louisiana” hats. They took to the stage to provide a backdrop for Landry and Kennedy. 
Approximately a dozen conservative legislators were also in attendance. Earlier this month, the state Legislature approved $2 million for Pennington in the state budget to fill in the gaps of Kennedy’s cuts. 
The LSU Board of Supervisors recessed its bi-monthly meeting so its members could take part in the event.
Kennedy previously came to Baton Rouge in 2021 to testify before state lawmakers against a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for K-12 students. It was Landry, who was then the state’s attorney general, who invited him to appear before the legislative committee.
Kennedy’s appearance at Pennington Biomedical Research Center comes as the future of some employees at the facility and their work are in question as the Trump administration proposes drastic reductions in health and scientific research. 
Most recently, Kennedy has removed the members of a vaccine advisory panel for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and replaced them with vaccine skeptics.
Pennington has so far lost $4.1 million in federal research funding from agencies Kennedy oversees, which does not include the tens of millions more they are slated to lose if Kennedy’s proposed slashing of “indirect cost rates” goes into effect. 
When the Illuminator approached Kennedy after the event to ask about these cuts, a staff member quickly whisked him away, saying “he’s not taking questions.”
Dozens of people lined Perkins Road outside the research center to protest Kennedy’s visit.  
The people gathered included Jeanne George of Baton Rouge, whose granddaughters accompanied her and held protest signs by the roadside waiting for Kennedy to arrive.
“I grew up in the 1950s, and I had classmates who had braces because of polio,” George said. “So I’ve seen the benefits of vaccinations from the 1950s on, and I just feel so strongly about the importance of not not rolling us back. We need to continue to have the children being vaccinated. We need to have the flu vaccines. We need to have scientists making decisions about vaccinations and about health.”
Gayle Choojitarom, a retired cardiopulmonary health care professional, came to the protest from Watson. She worked the latter stretch of her career in New Orleans and took issue with the governor choosing a research institute for a “Make America Healthy Again” event.
“If legislation is put forth to Make America healthy again, it should be led by science and by facts and not by vibes and opinions,” Choojitarom said. 
She recalled treating someone in the late 1980s who contracted polio and relied on an iron lung, a respiratory device that helps someone breathe when they have trouble doing so on their own. The eradication of polio through vaccines in the U.S. in 1979 all but eliminated the need for such equipment, but Choojitarom said she fears Kennedy’s policy on vaccine approval and research will erase such progress. 
“We’re going to see more people die,” she said.” We’re going to see children die. We’re going to see babies die.”

(Lori Higgins / Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
The high per-student cost for operating buildings at 19 Detroit district schools, some of which also have low enrollment and are underutilized, is creating funding challenges and will have officials wrestling with what to do with them in the coming years.
The district is already in the process of phasing out the operation of four of the schools, but that may not be the fix the district seeks with the remaining schools. No recommendations have been made to the board. But a report on the small schools, discussed during a school board committee meeting Wednesday, outlined potential solutions that include merging schools, stepping up enrollment efforts, reconfiguring grades served, and investing in marketing.
The costly schools in the Detroit Public Schools Community Schools aren’t covering their costs, meaning their expenses far outweigh the revenue received through state and federal funding and grants, Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said during the committee meeting.
Northwestern High School, for example, enrolls 302 students and the building has a utilization rate of 23%. On the other side of the city, Pershing High School’s utilization rate is 20%. It enrolls 421 students.
Underutilized schools are a critical issue in Detroit, given the district must fill in the gaps in revenue for the schools that don’t have enough per-pupil revenue coming in. But it’s not a problem unique to Detroit. Enrollment declines across the U.S. mean many districts are grappling with what to do with underutilized schools.
DPSCD enrollment has declined from more than 156,000 in the 2002-03 school year to 49,000 during the last school year. The declines have left schools with far fewer students than they were originally built to hold.
Vitti said Wednesday that the community should not look at the list of 19 schools and assume they are all going to be slated for closure.
“It just means that in order for these schools to continue to function … we have to move money (in the budget) to cover the costs,” he said.
“Most of these schools are going to be fine,” Vitti said later in the meeting. But, he said, the district will have to consider the long-term future of underutilized schools with buildings that need costly work.
Board member Angelique Peterson-Mayberry, who chairs the board’s academics committee, said the information shared at Wednesday’s meeting is important for the community “to go deep into.”
“There’s a science and a method to why we’re saying if schools aren’t kind of paying for themselves with enrollment, this is a way to unpack that so that they understand,” Peterson-Mayberry said.
Among the 19 schools are a handful the district is already phasing out, including Ann Arbor Trail Magnet School, J.E. Clark Preparatory Academy, Catherine Blackwell Institute, and Greenfield Union Elementary-Middle School. At these schools, the district has stopped accepting new students and those enrolled at the time the phase-out began will be allowed to remain until they matriculate. When that happens, the schools will close.
The list includes Paul Robeson-Malcolm X Academy, which moved to another location during the last school year. That move was necessary because the district is constructing another building for the school at the old site. But the move has resulted in enrollment declines — from 392 students to 299 — as some parents opted not to make the move. The district expects enrollment to return to normal once the new school opens.
The list also includes two Montessori schools. Those schools are more costly to operate because Montessori programs require more paraprofessionals than a traditional school, the report says.
The report includes a cost per student as well as what the cost is for a comparison school. The comparison schools are similar schools based on grade band and enrollment type. For instance, schools that require an exam or application in order to enroll are compared to each other.
Below is a list of the schools on the list, not including those already being phased out:
Frederick Douglass Academy for Young Men

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 69
Utilization rate: 5%
Revenue: $1,723,543
Expenses: $3,049,269
Cost per student: $44,192
Comparison school cost per student: $12,858
Potential solution: Relocating the school to another high school and operate as a separate school within a school.

Davis Aerospace Technical High School

Grades: 9-12
Enrollment: 96
Utilization rate: 13%
Revenue: $1,888,804
Expenses: $3,082,647
Cost per student: $32,111

(Photo: Ahmed Jallow)Community organizers gathered in Raleigh Thursday for a press conference to raise awareness about what they described as attacks on marginalized communities.
The press conference brought together several local organizations from the Triangle region, including Muslims for Social Justice, People’s Power Lab, Refund Raleigh and Education Justice.
Manzoor Cheema, an organizer with Muslims for Social Justice and People’s Power Lab, said post-9/11 policies, that initially targeted Muslims have since expanded to affect immigrants of all backgrounds.
“Black, brown and Muslim community members are victims of frequent state-based injustices,” said Cheema, who has been active in the Triangle area for 25 years. “If you see an attack against one community member, you have to speak up, because next time it will be replicated to other people.” 
The organizations also call for ending U.S. military actions abroad, providing full funding for public services like schools, healthcare and housing.
Speakers also called out recent actions by the Trump administration, which has revoked the visas of more than a dozen international students across North Carolina.
 Nique Williams, representing Refund Raleigh, expressed solidarity with Palestinians and condemned what she said was U.S.-funded military operations. 
“We should be funding care. We should be funding love. We should be funding the needs of our people, instead of funding genocide and war,” Williams said. 
Preserving Palestinian identity through food
The organizers gathered at a new restaurant in Northeast Raleigh called Flip It! where Nahla Ahmad, owner of the seven-month-old restaurant, has made it her mission to educate people about Palestinian culture through food. “I want people to get to know the Palestinian culture, and I want people to know that Palestine existed,” said Ahmad.
Ahmad, who is 63 and has lived in the U.S. for 32 years, said her restaurant isn’t political but rather focused on preserving cultural identity.
The restaurant’s name comes from Maqluba, a traditional Palestinian dish literally meaning “upside down” served by flipping it so “the good stuff in the bottom comes on top.” It symbolizes Ahmad’s mission: turning perceptions about Palestinian culture right-side up. Each plate served, she said, is an invitation to understand a rich heritage she said is often misunderstood.
“We have been struggling for about 80 years just to make sure that people know that we are there. We have our own culture, our own food, our own country, and we are trying to spread the culture, the information about us so we can get as much support as we can.”
For Ahmad, this isn’t just about food. It’s about showing the world that Palestine is not just a place on a map, but a culture with deep roots and enduring spirit, she said. Through every plate of Maqluba turned upside down, Ahmad invites diners to flip their understanding—and truly see Palestine.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1804-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 14:06:58.642719

(Photo provided by Free & Just)Even before federal abortion-rights protections were overturned three years ago, a Fargo mother says she had to travel hundreds of miles and across state lines to end a life-threatening pregnancy.
Randi Lamoureux, an educator and business owner, became pregnant with her son Lammy in 2017. At 19 weeks, he was diagnosed with a severe fetal abnormality called DiGeorge syndrome. Lamoureux’s doctor told her that both she and Lammy were at risk for cardiac arrest if she stayed pregnant.
Lamoureux said she had to travel more than 300 miles for care at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
By the time she could make the trip, she was almost too far along under that state’s law.
“That was literally the absolute last day that I could get it in Minnesota,” she said. “More than 24 hours later, I would have had to have gone to another state.”
More miscarriages criminally investigated three years into post-Dobbs abortion bans

Lamoureux said the weeks before and after were full of devastating decisions she never imagined having to make. 
“Do we hold our baby? Do we take pictures of our baby? Do we cremate him?” she said. “Those are things that nobody else should have a say in, ever.”
Though Lamoureux, born and raised in Grafton, is conservative and deeply religious, she said she wants other North Dakotans to see abortion not as a political or religious issue, but as a personal and private choice. No one can understand that decision until they’re faced with it, she said.
“I wish I could have invited Kevin Cramer into the hospital room when we had to make decisions,” she said of the U.S. senator from North Dakota.
Today, Lamoureux lives in Fargo with her husband and 5-year-old daughter. She said she now considers abortion-rights advocacy part of her life’s purpose.
“I don’t want my 5-year-old daughter or anybody else’s daughters or anybody else to have to go through what I went through,” she said.
Earlier this week, Lamoureux traveled to D.C. with a group of other women who have been impacted by state-level abortion policy. They were invited to share their stories at a summit organized by Free and Just, an abortion-rights group, to mark the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, which gave rise to a patchwork of state abortion laws across the country. 
As part of the trip, Lamoureux said she went to the hill and met with members of Congress.
She said it felt good to share her story, but she can’t help but find it unfair that women like her have to recount such difficult experiences to try and shift policy. 
“To me, it’s like: Why? Why do we have to justify this? Why do we have to share our stories with anyone?” she said. “However, it’s the reality, and our stories are what make change.”
Lammy is still part of daily life for Lamoureux and her family. She said her parents recently visited his grave in Rochester.
“They called us, and we said a prayer together as a family,” Lamoureux said. “My parents left two little trucks for him and a sunflower.”
North Dakota Supreme Court hears arguments over abortion ban

Under a district court ruling last fall, abortion is legal in North Dakota through fetal viability, thought to be around 24 weeks, but no clinics provide abortion care in the state. 
North Dakota had adopted a law in 2023 banning all abortions except when the pregnancy poses a serious health risk to the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest in the first six weeks of pregnancy. That policy was struck down as unconstitutional last year by a District Court judge. The ruling was appealed to the North Dakota Supreme Court, which has yet to make a final decision in the case.
During the 2025 session, Rep. Eric Murphy, R-Grand Forks, introduced a bill he said sought to strike a compromise between reproductive freedom and regulation. It would have allowed women to receive abortions for any reason through week 15 of pregnancy, while medical professionals would decide whether to allow later term abortions on a case-by-case basis. The House overwhelmingly rejected the policy.
In a 2023 ruling striking down a previous state abortion ban, the North Dakota Supreme Court found that women have a fundamental right to seek abortions for health reasons. The justices also found that the state has a compelling interest in protecting unborn life. 
In a January opinion in the lawsuit, the state Supreme Court indicated that it may have to decide how to balance these interests as it considers the pending appeal over the state’s abortion law. It takes a fourth-fifths vote by the high court to declare a law unconstitutional in North Dakota.

(Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)As NATO wrapped up its latest summit in The Hague, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) said he is not in favor of Ukraine joining the organization.
“I think that an attempt to do that would essentially make it almost 100% certain that you wouldn’t be able to find a peaceful resolution to the war,” McCormick said on Wednesday evening, during a telephone town hall meeting.
Ukraine joining NATO has been viewed as a red line for Russia, McCormick said. But, he added that he views Russia as the aggressor in the ongoing war. Multiple presidents have previously expressed support for Ukraine joining NATO including presidents George W. Bush and Joe Biden.
However, President Donald Trump said in February that it is not practical.
More than 150,000 Ukrainians and Ukrainian Americans live in Pennsylvania, making the Keystone State home to the second largest population in the country.

McCormick, a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, also suggested that Russia may be facing more sanctions from the U.S. in the near future.
“They haven’t been willing to come to the table,” McCormick said. “They keep playing games. They seem to suggest they’ll do a deal, and then they don’t.”
“I’ve signed on(to) a piece of legislation in the Senate that I suspect we’ll introduce, if there’s not progress in the next week or two, with a number of other senators, to put sanctions back on Russia,” he added. “We’ve got to have an end to the fighting, and part of that is Russia, I think, acting in a more responsible way about a peace agreement.”
The state’s junior senator also said he supports Trump’s outlined path in reaching an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Part of that, he noted, is Europe establishing a security arrangement for Ukraine to ensure that they will be protected against future aggression.
He celebrated NATO’s decision on Wednesday to invest 5% in defense spending, which is an increase from previous years.

“We should probably increase the funding for NIH”
Referring to Pennsylvania as one of the life sciences capitals of the world, McCormick said the country “should probably increase the funding for NIH (National Institute of Health), not lessen it” as cuts potentially loom via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
“I don’t agree with what the policy has been on this, and I’ve expressed that to Secretary (Robert F.) Kennedy (Jr.) and others,” McCormick said.
He was responding to a constituent’s question who was concerned about a $5 million grant, aimed to pursue a cure for muscular dystrophy, potentially being pulled.

In February, the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) released a statement condemning the proposal to limit indirect costs to 15% of all grants.
“The neuromuscular disease community depends on a well-funded biomedical research ecosystem to discover breakthrough treatments and potential cures,” Donald S. Wood, PhD, President and CEO of Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), and Sharon Hesterlee, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of MDA said. “This is why MDA strongly condemns the National Institutes of Health’s policy guidance that all indirect costs will be capped at 15% in all grants. This arbitrary decision will prove catastrophic to neuromuscular disease research, and we call for NIH to immediately reverse this decision.”
McCormick said Pennsylvania is one of the biggest recipients of NIH funding in the nation, getting more than $1 billion a year that goes towards the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), University of Pennsylvania, Penn State Health, and other large hospitals, universities and research labs.
“It’s a huge issue in Pennsylvania,” he said.
McCormick said he doesn’t believe that cuts should be made to the grants that are in midstream where progress has been made.
“In many cases, people’s lives are dependent on this breakthrough kind of research,” he said. “I don’t think it makes sense to cut grants in midstream, even if the overhead numbers look too high.”
However, McCormick said these universities need to have more scrutiny. He thinks there should be a “very organized approach” to reviewing how NIH grants are given to ensure taxpayers money is being spent on “real good science research, which in most cases it is.”
McCormick said he had a call with NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya last week and said they “see a lot of common ground on this” and is attempting to have him come to Pennsylvania for a visit.

“I’m wrestling with it myself,” McCormick says about AI regulations in BBB
A provision in the reconciliation bill, dubbed by Trump as the “Big Beautiful Bill,” would prohibit states from regulating artificial intelligence (AI) for the next 10 years.
“I’m not sure where the Senate version is going to land,” McCormick said. “I think this is going to be something that we’re going to be wrestling with in the Congress for the foreseeable future, because AI is changing so quickly that we’re not keeping up with it.”
McCormick said he’s sympathetic to the provision because some states put what he called, “extreme regulations in place.”
“So, the problem with letting states independently regulate AI is that you get this mishmash of regulations that can be very restrictive to innovation and very restrictive to successful business,” McCormick said. “My view on the AI arms race is that China is our biggest competitor, and the key to winning that battle is not trying to restrict AI so much as to win the innovation game.”
However, McCormick said the work needs to provide, “clear ethical boundaries and ethical frameworks and regulation.”
“I think the biggest fear is that we’re not going to innovate enough, and if we let states start to regulate AI, we’re going to really get in the way of innovation,” he said.
However, he said in some specific areas, it becomes “really problematic.” He cited the music industry around Nashville, Tennessee.
“Country music singers are super worried about AI being used to steal their content: artists, musicians, actors, are worried about AI undermining them,” McCormick said. “So, Tennessee might want to put in specific regulation to protect their music industry.”
“So, there’s a tension here on recognizing that you need specific protections for certain types of industries, and to ensure that AI doesn’t result in kind of mass stealing of intellectual property and so forth,” he added.
McCormick said he’s trying to spend a lot of time understanding AI and admitted most members of Congress probably don’t even understand it, as it is evolving rapidly.
While  the Republican was still weighing his options on that provision, he defended other parts of the reconciliation bill, including extending the Trump tax cuts put in place during the president’s previous term, and the spending levels for border security, defense, Medicaid, and SNAP.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1240736733-mccormick.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 14:06:58.642719

A Source analysis of the Gila found the same.","The Whitewater-Baldy Complex Fire in Gila National Forest pictured at night in May 2012. A new study awaiting peer review from the Wilderness Society undercuts the United States Agriculture Department Secretary's claim that repealing the ""Roadless Rule"" will prevent wildfires. (Photo courtesy Gila National Forest)One big reason the United States Agriculture Department Secretary says she wants to strip protections for 58 million acres of federal forestland is to prevent wildfires, but a new study suggests allowing roads and logging into currently protected areas will do the opposite. 
A study from national environmentalist group The Wilderness Society concluded that more roads results in more wildfires, and said “roadless” areas that comprise roughly 30% of the nation’s federal forestland see far fewer wildfire starts. 
“Building roads into roadless areas is likely to result in more fires. These fires will, on average, be smaller than fires farther from roads, but there will be more of them, and some of them will grow to become large fires,” lead author Greg Aplet concluded in a two-page summary of the study findings. 
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins unveiled her agency’s plans earlier this week during the Western Governors’ Association annual meeting in Santa Fe to repeal the “Roadless Rule,” protections implemented in 2011 aimed at preserving wild forests. She said the rule hampers forest management and wildfire prevention and also said repealing the ban would get more “logs on trucks” as the Trump administration seeks to rekindle a nationwide logging industry in federal forests. 
USDA Secretary in Santa Fe announces agency intends to repeal Clinton-era ‘roadless’ rule

The Wilderness Society study, completed last month, is still undergoing peer review, according to the organization. Its authors, who submitted it for publication in the Fire Ecology journal, looked at three decades of wildfire ignition data across all national forests to determine whether higher wildfire frequency was found within 50 meters of roads. 
The authors determined that wildfire-ignition density was more than three times lower in areas protected as “Inventoried Roadless Areas.” Specifically, those areas saw 1.9 fires per 1,000 hectares, which is about 4 square miles. The highest wildfire-ignition density occurred in areas within 50 meters on either side of a road, the authors found, where there were 7.4 fires per 1,000 hectares. 
The authors did the same analysis by region, and found wildfire density along roads in the Southwest ranked the highest in the country. Roughly 13 wildfires per 1,000 hectares occurred in this region, compared with roughly 3 wildfires per 1,000 hectares in “roadless areas.” 
A Source New Mexico analysis of wildfire ignitions in the Gila National Forest had similar findings. 
Since 2014, the earliest year ignition data from the National Interagency Wildfire Center is readily available, roughly 1,400 wildfires have ignited within Gila boundaries, according to Source’s analysis. Of them, about 15% ignited within “roadless” areas with strict prohibitions against road construction or reconstruction, which comprise 20% of the forest area. 
Particularly in the southern part of the Gila, wildfire starts over the last decade appear to cluster alongside roads, according to Source’s map below:


The biggest fire in the Gila’s recorded history and also the second-biggest fire in New Mexico history, the 320,000-acre Black Fire, did not start in a “roadless” area, according to the Source New Mexico analysis. The Trout Fire, which is currently burning in the Gila, also did not start in the “roadless” area.
On Tuesday, United States Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz issued a statement applauding Rollins’ move to repeal the “Roadless Rule.” 
“This decision would unlock 30% of the National Forest System, enabling common-sense forest management practices to strengthen the health and productivity of America’s forests,” he wrote. 
He characterized wildfires burning in “roadless” areas as increasingly destructive, thanks to overgrown and unmanaged forests that need to be thinned and accessible. 
“The forests we know today are not the same as the forests of 2001. They are dangerously overstocked and increasingly threatened by drought, insect-born disease, and wildfire. It’s time to turn the page on the Roadless Rule and return land management decisions where they belong – with local Forest Service experts who best understand their forests and communities,” he wrote. 
By the #s: Nearly a quarter of the Gila is protected as ‘roadless.’ Those protections could be nixed

Even though the study found that wildfires tend to grow larger if they ignite in “roadless areas,” doing so isn’t necessarily problematic, Aplet, the study’s lead author, told Source New Mexico on Thursday. By definition, “roadless” areas don’t have structures or other high value assets at risk, so often little reason exists to fully suppress wildfires that burn in wild forests, he said. 
Forest managers at the Gila in particular possess skill at allowing good fires to burn in the wilderness, Aplet said. 
“The managers on the Gila at least, have allowed fires to burn on the Gila more than most national forests, and so those forests are less altered than areas that have been logged or other national forests that haven’t been similarly managed,” Aplet said. “And so when fires do burn on the Gila wilderness and ‘roadless’ areas, they have a better effect than they do on other lands.”
Aplet said the study began back in President Donald Trump’s first term, when Utah leaders were considering seeking a statewide exemption to “Roadless Rule” protections, alleging that “roadless” areas were a fire threat. 
“This didn’t sound right to us, so we looked into the numbers,” Aplet said. 
The state stopped pursuing the waiver, so Aplet’s work stopped, but Trump’s re-election prompted authors to take up the issue again, he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/7355231410_2f3cb1f481_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-27 14:06:58.642719

New Mexico Supreme Court asked to weigh in on Tesuque wastewater conflict

In an order issued last week, the New Mexico Supreme Court set a date for arguments on July 8.
The hearing allows the justices to ask questions of attorneys, said Tom Hnasko, an attorney representing residents, with a brief 20-minute window for arguments.
At the center of the dustup is the New Mexico Environment Department’s nod for a proposed permit for plans to dispose of treated wastewater from Bishop’s Lodge, a luxury resort, and adjacent homes.
The permit allows for the discharge up to 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater into a new low-dose disposal field using a treatment plant installed in 2024. The current state permit allows Bishop’s Lodge to dispose of about half that across two disposal fields on the property.
Residents objecting to the permit coalesced into the nonprofit Protect Tesuque, which claims the disposal method threatens to pollute drinking wells downstream. Tesuque Village, with a population of about 1,000 people, relies on private wells and septic tanks.
In April, attorneys representing Project Tesuque submitted an emergency petition that claimed  the state’s process amounted to a constitutional violation by unequally enforcing limitations in liquid waste laws between smaller and larger permits.
In court documents, The New Mexico Environment Department requested the court dismiss the proceedings, saying the claims did not meet the threshold of an emergency, needlessly interrupted the permitting process and that the water was treated to exceed state and federal quality standards.
“[Bishop’s Lodge] Santa Fe has the best available technology wastewater treatment facility on site that treats wastewater so thoroughly that the wastewater can be recycled and reused… to irrigate food crops,” the response stated.
Administrative proceedings for the permit’s approval started in May, but were delayed following an order from the New Mexico Supreme Court to pause the hearings until the court weighed in.

It has a young population and large family sizes. It boasts countless family-friendly events and attractions. And family values are — allegedly — at the center of its lawmakers’ decisions.
Unfortunately, our representatives are currently in the process of advancing a federal bill that would harm the most vulnerable families in our state. Republicans’ Big Beautiful Bill proposes scaling back key tax credits on which low-income families rely to make ends meet. But it’s not too late — while the bill passed in the U.S. House, our senators now have the opportunity to make changes and protect these vital tax credits.
I’m a sociologist at the University of Utah. I have spent my career examining how policies that were never really intended to improve health do so nevertheless. These include things like food assistance, minimum wage increases, and tax credits. We typically think about how these policies affect our wallets, but they also affect our bodies. They influence whether we can afford safe housing, adequate diets, regular health care, and other basic needs that shape our physical as well as mental health.
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a popular, bipartisan program that puts much-needed cash back into the pockets of working families, but it also improves their health. Research has shown that moms who received the full EITC have better prenatal care, birth outcomes, and mental health compared to moms who did not. And children in households who received the full EITC are less likely than non-recipients to experience food insecurity, behavioral health problems, obesity, and childhood abuse and neglect.
But this bill would require families to “pre-certify” the children they claim each tax year. Already, approximately 1 in 5 families who are eligible for the EITC miss out because it’s too difficult to file for it, and “pre-certification” is another unnecessary piece of red tape that will deter even more families.
Meanwhile, the Child Tax Credit, which currently provides up to $2,000 per child, has also been shown to have significant health benefits for both parents and children. The Child Tax Credit improves well-being in similar ways to the EITC by giving families’ more financial breathing room.
Proposed changes to the CTC in this bill would leave many families behind. First, it would make millions of U.S. citizen children ineligible if at least one or both their parents are not U.S. citizens. Secondly, estimates project that 163,000 kids statewide would earn less than the full CTC because their parents’ income is too low, meaning that families with the most need won’t get the full amount. In my own Congressional district alone, UT-01, a total of 33,000 kids would be left behind.
Utah state legislators have already expressed some concern about the local impact of these restrictions, which function as a sort of marriage penalty and would hit many active-duty and veteran service members especially hard.
Some argue that cutting these tax credits is fine because honest work is enough for Americans to get by. But we know this is not the case for most families. My personal experience, which motivates my own research, corroborates this.
Growing up, my father worked tirelessly to provide a decent standard of living for our family through a combination of long hours, manual labor, and sheer will. By the time I was in middle school, it had begun to take its toll; the downturn in his health was rapid. My mother’s physical and mental health likewise began to suffer as she set to filling the economic gap that had opened with my dad’s failing health. This strain marred my childhood and undoubtedly contributed to parents’ early deaths at the ages of 58 and 60.
Utah is a place that promotes the ideal that “when families win, we all win — economically as well as socially.” Our elected officials, and the people who voted them in, should keep in mind the impact of these critical programs in the service of that family-friendly agenda and the health of Utah families",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sensoryexercises-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 13:10:14.663101

The storied New Orleans restaurant recently pushed for a new state law prohibiting the unauthorized resale of reservations by third-party platforms. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.

Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.










We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


–  – Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey


Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

Five and a half years after nurses launched a campaign to restore union representation at UW Health, the state’s highest court ruled Friday that the Madison-based hospital system has no obligation to collectively bargain with employees.
Act 10, the 2011 state law that stripped most union rights from public employees, also removed legal guarantees of union representation for University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority’s employees, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for a unanimous Court.
“When we examine the statutory language along with the statutory history, it is clear that Act 10 ended the collective bargaining requirements formerly placed on the Authority,” Hagedorn wrote.
The Court rejected the argument from Service Employees International Union (SEIU) that with the Act 10 changes, the hospital authority as a corporation fit the definition of “employer” under the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act.
The Peace Act defines an employee as anyone working for hire other than an independent contractor and an employer as a person — including partnerships, corporations and some other legal entities — that engages the services of an employee.
The hospital authority doesn’t automatically meet that definition, however, Hagedorn wrote.
The hospital system was spun off from the University of Wisconsin in 1996 into a new “public body corporate and politic,” the UW Hospital and Clinics Authority. The hospital system’s employees were state employees represented by unions and with collective bargaining rights under Wisconsin’s state employment relations law.
The hospital authority “is not defined as a corporation,” Hagadorn wrote, “it is a ‘public body corporate and politic.’” He cited the Peace Act’s definition of “employer” that states the term does not include “the state or any political subdivision thereof.”
The 1996 law creating the new hospital authority removed its employees from the state employment relations law and added language specifying that the hospital authority was an employer under the Peace Act.
Act 10 changed that, Hagedorn wrote — repealing the hospital authority’s collective bargaining duty that was in the 1996 law as well as all other references to collective bargaining.
“In sum, Act 10 purged references to the Peace Act from the Authority Statute,” Hagedorn wrote.
“When it created the Authority, the legislature added the Authority as an employer under the Peace Act and imposed numerous other collective bargaining provisions. In Act 10, the legislature eliminated the Authority as a covered employer along with other collective bargaining requirements. We therefore hold that the Authority is no longer covered by the Peace Act and is not required to collectively bargain under the Peace Act.”
Friday’s ruling was the final stop for a case that started in September 2022. In an agreement brokered to avert a planned three-day strike by nurses demanding union recognition at UW Health, the hospital system and SEIU agreed to a joint petition to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC).
In the petition, the union argued that the hospital should be considered an employer under the Peace Act, while UW Health argued that Act 10 eliminated collective bargaining at the hospital system. WERC sided with UW Health, and Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost subsequently affirmed the employment commission’s conclusion.

Taylor. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Supreme Court handed a preliminary victory Friday to Montgomery County parents who object, for religious reasons, to the school system’s use of LGBTQ+-themed books in classrooms, saying parents should be allowed to opt their children out of such classes.
The 6-3 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor sent the case back to lower courts for a full hearing, but the majority left little doubt where it stands on the issue, with Justice Samuel Alito writing for the court that the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims.
“The Board’s introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion,” Alito wrote.
“The Board should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,” the majority opinion said. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
In a sharp, 38-page dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Kentaji Brown Jackson — said the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
Far from protecting the free exercise of religion, Sotomayor wrote, the majority “guts our free exercise precedent” in a ruling the reverberations of which “will be felt, I fear, for generations.”
In Pride month, transgender Marylanders reflect on strengths, weaknesses, of state protections

“Today’s ruling threatens the very essence of public education. The Court, in effect, constitutionalizes a parental veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators,” Sotomayor wrote.
“That decision guts our free exercise precedent and strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society,” her dissent said.
Both Alito and Sotomayor’s opinions included appendices that include pages from the books in question, including “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding” and  “Prince and Knight,” about marriages of two men; “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope,” about a transgender youth; and “Intersection Allies,” which tells stories of several children, including a transgender child.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after Montgomery County schools introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive, for example.
But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
The schools said the books were largely incidental to the curriculum, available for students who wanted to read them. But opponents noted that some schools read the books aloud in class, or read them every day of Pride Month, and provided guidance for teachers to counter students or parents who objected.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The case never got past the question of a preliminary injunction against the school system’s refusal to let students opt out, with district and circuit courts both letting the school board’s no-opt-out policy stand.
The only question before the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in the case on April 22, was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?” The court ruled that the policy does burden free exercise rights.
An attorney with the Becket Fund, which represented the parents who sued the school board, hailed the ruling as a “victory for parental rights in Maryland.”
“Kids shouldn’t be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents’ permission,” said Eric Baxter, a Becket Fund vice president and senior counsel, in a prepared statement. “Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents — not government — have the final say in how their children are raised.”
The Montgomery school board and school system released a joint statement in response to the ruling.
“Today’s decision is not the outcome we hoped for or worked toward. It marks a significant challenge for public education nationwide,” they said.
“In Montgomery County Public Schools, we will determine next steps and navigate this moment with integrity and purpose—guided, as always, by our shared values of learning, relationships, respect, excellence, and equity.”

In a brisk nine-page ruling, the Superior Court judge concluded that the Milton lawsuit was very similar to a previous bundle of suits fighting the multi-family housing law and should be dismissed.
The post Superior Court tosses Milton taxpayer suit against MBTA Communities law appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","OPPONENTS OF A PLAN to rezone the affluent Boston suburb of Milton spent weeks urging town voters and officials to pump the brakes while a court considered a suit challenging the MBTA Communities housing law. 
All the way up to a special Town Meeting in mid-June, a set of residents, planning board members, and warrant committee members tried to hold off a proposal that would allow for the potential to add 25 percent more total housing units, required by the state because of Milton’s proximity to public transit. Less than 10 days after Town Meeting voters moved ahead with a plan to comply anyway, Superior Court Judge Mark Gildea offered another firm rebuke to the naysayers.  
The 16 taxpayers who brought suit to halt local enforcement of the controversial MBTA Communities multi-family housing law lacked standing, Gildea found. The plaintiffs also did not convince the court that the state’s designation of the town as a “rapid transit community” was unreasonable, Gildea wrote in a crisp nine-page opinion handed down on June 26. 
He rejected the taxpayers’ request for an injunction and granted the state housing office’s motion to dismiss the suit. 
The conclusions Gildea reached in a June 6 order considering a bundle of town complaints about the MBTA Communities law “apply equally here,” he wrote, reiterating that the housing law is not an unfunded mandate. The taxpayers offered only speculative costs that they would have to bear if the town complied, Gildea said. The MBTA Communities law lays the groundwork for but does not require new construction, and Milton always has the option of pursuing state grants that already exist to fund infrastructure associated with new housing, he added. 
As to the third-rail of the entire Milton debate – whether the quaint Mattapan High-Speed Trolley should count as “rapid transit” in the same way that MBTA subway lines or the Silver Line bus does – Gildea needed barely 100 words to dispense with the matter. 
In the brief MBTA Communities statute, lawmakers made no mention of the Mattapan trolley, which the taxpayers argued meant that Milton is not a rapid transit community. Rather, they said, their more distant proximity to commuter rail or Red Line subway service should make them an “adjacent community.” That designation would require rezoning for only 10 percent more units – even less than the 15 percent required for commuter rail communities. 
Gildea agreed with the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities that “the mere use of a ‘rapid transit’ category is not arbitrary and capricious simply because that category is not found in [the law],” he wrote. The specific language of an “adjacent community” is also not found in the law, he added. 
The way that the housing office created its four community categories applied its “substantive expertise” to tailor the regulations to fit the real-word conditions of each MBTA community, Gildea said, just as the state Supreme Judicial Court ordered in January. 
“For a second time this month, the courts affirmed the intent of the MBTA Communities Law, which is to increase housing production to address one of the greatest challenges facing the people of Massachusetts – high costs,” said Ed Augustus, secretary of the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, in a statement Friday. He noted that nearly 80 percent of MBTA Communities “have already said yes to multifamily housing to bring down costs for all residents, and we continue to work closely with communities that have yet to do so.”  
As the judge tasked with overseeing the many MBTA Communities lawsuits, Gildea’s Thursday ruling might yet be appealed but severely narrows the likelihood that any of the other suits before him will be positively received at the Superior Court level. As lawmakers suggested during the Milton debate, this dispute may now rest in the hands of the same legislators who signed off on the sweeping policy change in the first place.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Americans have long enjoyed the practical and romantic aspects of the West. The West has provided us with minerals, timber, energy and space to roam freely for generations. We have a wonderful asset in the West — our public lands — which are owned by the people of the United States and held in trust for us by the federal government. Anybody can go out there and recreate, for free, any time, and that is a good thing for all of us.
Congress previously recognized the value of the public lands, declaring that these lands would remain in public ownership in an act known as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management are each commissioned in FLPMA to allow a variety of uses on their managed lands. Most of the public land in the West is thus managed under a nonexclusive shared-use arrangement. Lands for grazing, mining and logging — or all three — typically remain open to the public for hiking, hunting and camping.
Utah’s Mike Lee to make new attempt to sell off public lands in US Senate mega-bill

“Multiple use” is defined as “management of the public lands and their various resource values so that they are utilized in the combination that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people.” FLPMA addresses topics such as land use planning, land acquisition, fees and payments, administration of federal land, range management, and rights-of-way on federal land. Local communities are empowered to ask for transfers to accommodate growth patterns.
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has proposed significant changes to the manner in which public lands are sold. He seeks congressional action to bypass FLPMA and its requirements, instead claiming that the “housing crisis” can be eased if only the federal government will sell off millions of acres of public land to developers. That’s nonsense, and those proposals have drawn significant criticism for good reasons.
Previous homestead acts have done much to foster private land ownership in the U.S. Those effects are undeniably positive. But Sen. Lee’s proposal isn’t a homestead act, and it fails to take into account that the land in the West which is capable of human habitation has by and large already been claimed. There’s little water, even less infrastructure and where those shortfalls can be blunted, the cost of developing housing in those locations is significantly higher than in already settled areas. Think of the expense of drilling (and maintaining) a fresh water well for each home, along with the needs for electricity, telecommunications, solid and liquid waste, and you can easily determine that further developing wild land for housing results in costs that can’t be recovered.
Further, Sen. Lee’s proposals have not been subjected to hearings or formal input as he seeks to put them in the One Big Beautiful (budget reconciliation) Bill currently under consideration in Congress. While it’s true that the Senate parliamentarian ruled the Lee Amendment out of order with respect to that bill, Sen. Lee continues to push his proposal in the media, and in Congress. Senators Thune and Rounds have not declared their positions on his proposal to my knowledge. While maps show that South Dakota does not have any parcels for sale, Lee’s original proposal put parcels in the Wyoming Black Hills on the chopping block. Lee has since said he would alter the proposal to include only Bureau of Land Management land within 5 miles of a population center and exempt U.S. Forest Service lands altogether.
Americans need space to be free, and fortunately we have it still. We need wild spaces in America to allow for the continuation of the frontier spirit that made us who we are as a people.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court unexpectedly announced it will not rule on Louisiana’s congressional redistricting case this term, instead scheduling it for further arguments in the fall. 
The case, Callais v. Louisiana, involves non-Black voters who sued over the creation of a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House. Justices said they will issue an order specifying additional questions it wants addressed before they revisit the case later this year. 
“Although we hoped for a decision this term, we welcome a further opportunity to present argument to the Court regarding the state’s impossible task of complying with the Court’s voting precedents,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement to the Illuminator.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative who has served on the court since 1991 when he was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, issued a dissenting statement, arguing the court has a responsibility to act promptly. 
By delaying a decision, which isn’t likely to come until next spring, the court all but ensured a new congressional map, if necessary, would not be in place until the 2028 election and until the 2030 census cycle is underway.

“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Those were my mother’s words to me as we stood in the hallway of my parents’ home in Leland in 2008. At the time, I was a 20-year-old college student, home that weekend from Ole Miss.
My mother had sensed that I had been growing distant, reluctant to talk to her on the phone, and pulling away generally from my family. She knew — as mothers often know — that to become fully myself I thought I needed to leave my family behind. I thought they wouldn’t understand.
She stopped me in the hallway and asked what seemed like a simple question: “Eric, are you gay?” In the ensuing conversation, I officially came out to my mother, who like my father, brother and sister, had known all along. Though she was not surprised by the confirmed knowledge of her middle child being gay, what she said next surprised me. “I don’t want you to have a hard life.”
I recoiled from her words at that moment. I did not appreciate the link she made between me being gay and my life being harder as a result. Knowing her work in healthcare, I did not appreciate what I assumed was her subtle link between being gay and adverse health outcomes. I wanted to believe then — as I still do now — that to be gay does not immediately equate a harder life. I wasn’t naive enough to think that life wasn’t hard, but I believed in my bones that the fact of one’s sexuality shouldn’t be a primary reason for it. I believed that to be gay was no different than one’s eye color or height: an inescapable and unavoidable biological fact.

Since that 2008 conversation, living an “out” life seems to have gotten a bit easier as reflected in national numbers. A 2024 Gallup poll found that nearly one in 10 Americans identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. All in all, in the 12 years that Gallup has tracked LGBTQ+ identification in the United States, the rate of self-identification has nearly tripled.
While there are various explanations for this statistical change, many queer people prior to this administration believed our lives would not be made harder by being who we are and living our lives openly and authentically.
These national numbers reverberate locally. Recent numbers indicate that there are 93,300 LGBTQ+ adults in Mississippi, around 4.1% of the state’s total population. Further, despite a history of exclusion, LGBTQ+ folks in Mississippi raise and sustain families.
In a 2022 article for Mississippi Today, Nigel Dent related how “the percentage of same-sex parents in Mississippi is higher than the nation at 25.7% in Mississippi versus 17.2% nationally.” In 2022, Mississippi had the nation’s highest rate of same-sex couples raising children, an inversion of statistical realities that often place our state at the bottom of lists. The unexpected fact that same-sex couples in Mississippi are raising families at such rates should be a banner of pride for our state.
Mississippi is not an anomaly in the South. In 2023, the Williams Institute found that 35.9% of all of those who identify as LGBT (the center’s chosen acronym), more than five million people, live in the U.S. Southeast, more than any other region in the country. Chances are most Southerners today know someone who is lesbian or gay or bisexual or transgender. Beyond those of us who are LGBTQ+ in Mississippi, many of us have brothers or sons, sisters or daughters, mothers or fathers, cousins or chosen kin, who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer.
LGBTQ+ Mississippians are woven into the fabric of many of our daily lives, contributing to our economy, our culture, our sense of place, our ideas of community, family and home. The rainbow connection we create is being felt across the state.
In Jackson, Mississippi Capital City Pride hosts year-round events covering the state’s queer history and culture and the Jack Myers house opened in 2024 as the first LGBTQIA+ shelter in Mississippi. Since 2008, Tupelo has hosted a Pride parade as does the Biloxi-based Gulf Coast Association of Pride.
College towns such as Hattiesburg (Pine Belt Pride), Oxford (Oxford Pride), and Starkville (Starkville Pride) also host annual pride events and year-round programming. I attended this year’s Oxford Pride, where hundreds marched in full technicolor despite changing political dynamics and institutional support. In Water Valley, Violet Valley Bookstore is one of the nation’s most revered LGBTQ+ independent bookstores and is annually featured in a graphic from Oprah Daily.
Across many fields and walks of life, we are shaping our home state, creating and making the lives of all Mississippians better, easier, more beautiful and fulfilling. Why would we want to listen to rhetoric and support policy that makes the lives of any group of Mississippians harder? Why would we want to make the lives of LGBTQ+ Mississippians harder? Why would you want to make your son’s or your daughter’s or your friend’s or your co-worker’s life harder? What purpose does that serve? Whose purposes does it serve?
Today politicians across the country feel emboldened to advocate to make my life and the lives of folks like me harder in this politically divisive moment. Political leaders are positioning themselves to pass legislation that would strip away rights already codified and set a foundation for further intrusion into the lives and freedoms of LGBTQ+ Americans.
The following is but a sampling of our current moment: on March 8, 2025, Donald Trump posted a crossed-out pink triangle on his Truth Social, evoking the Nazi persecution of gay men. Republican leaders in five states—Michigan, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota—have suggested the Supreme Court overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage. Idaho and North Dakota have already passed such legislation. Four additional states—Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas—have introduced legislation that would create a separate category of legal marriage called “covenant marriage,” that could only take place between a man and a woman.
On June 10, the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the US, approved a resolution calling for the overturning of Obergefell as they deem it “def[ies] God’s design for marriage and family.”
Executive orders have forced the National Park Service to remove “transgender” and “queer” from the Stonewall monument website irrespective of any consideration of the historic facts pertaining to that site. Transgender flags are no longer allowed at Stonewall “officially,” though visitors continue to bring trans flags to leave at the site.
With the fate of Medicaid in limbo, some insurance companies now feel comfortable denying coverage for PrEP, or Pre-exposure Prophylaxis, a routine treatment that significantly lessens one’s risk of contracting HIV. With the defunding of the federal USAID and PEPFAR in the balance, access to HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention protocols has been interrupted globally.
As with any virus, HIV does not discriminate based upon gender or sexual identity, and an HIV diagnosis, while no longer fatal for most in the United States, does indeed make life more difficult for whoever it impacts.
Under the new leadership of Kristi Noem, Homeland Security has quietly moved to eliminate a ban on surveillance based on sexual orientation and gender identity leading many to speculate that the agency will now increase targeted surveillance on gender and sexual minorities.
Finally, executive orders, policy reversals and legislation targeting trans Americans are too many for one list to capture. Regarding the executive order against trans people serving in the US Military and using the pronouns of their choice in such service, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes called the policy “unadulterated animus.” Absolute hostility: a policy reversal that exists for no other reason than for one group to be hostile toward another group of fellow Americans.
Aren’t we better than this?
In Mississippi, some state officials continue to vilify groups of fellow Mississippians without regard for expertise or diligently consulting established facts on a given issue. Adding fuel to the flames of anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment without any grounding in evidence, such leaders strive to make the lives of a group of fellow Mississippians harder for no other reason than political utility.
What tangible benefit is there for a straight Mississippian to tell a trans Mississippian that they don’t exist? There is none. It is the politics of cruelty, plain and simple, a refusal, as Jane Fonda stated at the SAG awards earlier this year, to “give a damn” about someone different from you.
In Mississippi, only five cities — Clarksdale, Holly Springs, Jackson, Magnolia, Rosedale — and no county have passed ordinances to protect LGBTQ+ Mississippians from discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. If federal mandates are removed or held in the limbo of ongoing legal challenges, then, only 6% of LGBTQ+ Mississippians will be protected from discrimination under local law.
With recent rhetoric and proposed actions from federal and local governments, one can only imagine how the lives of LGBTQ+ Mississippians may be about to get harder. And to be clear, some folks within our community will be hit harder than others.
“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Seventeen years later, I understand now where my mom was coming from. She was coming from a place of care and concern for her child. Her words were not about who her son was but who other people were. She knew in her wisdom and experience that she would not be able to control how my life would be made manifestly more difficult by the actions of others who did not see, love and know me as unconditionally as she did. She knew people feared what they could not understand and that the so-called “marginal” among us will always be our most vulnerable.
My mother has been a healthcare provider since she was 15 years old in our native Mississippi Delta. She has often repeated a mantra attributed to Hippocrates, known best to us as the author of the Hippocratic Oath: first, do no harm. In a medical setting, such advice is often more idealistic than practical. Doctors and nurses must often react to extraordinary situations comparing risk and benefit for a myriad of treatments. Many treatments — such as those for cancer — often cause significant short-term harm in service of hoped-for long-term healing.
But the point is that many healthcare providers like my mother operate under the basic assumption that they should not cause further harm to their patients. That to heal, one must first aim not to make the problem worse.
I’ve been thinking in the last few months of the words harm and hard in conjunction. What if we simply told our politicians and representatives not to make it harder? No matter what you do — no matter what mistakes you may make in the process — no matter what ideological system aligns with your personal values — no matter from whom comes your campaign financing — no matter what your political party — can you first promise to not make it harder for any of us?
Can that be your first guiding principle and most basic commitment to all of your constituents? It would be nice to believe that public servants get into that line of work because they already adhere to that foundational ethic.
“I don’t want you to have a hard life.” Life is hard. I know of few people from all walks of life who have not gone through hard times. But we should expect our leaders not to go out of their way to make it harder for any one of us.
We should hold our leaders accountable when they attempt to target any group of us in ways that will make life harder for that group and, by the way, do little if anything at all to benefit those of us who are not in the targeted, oft-marginalized, group.
As a native Mississippian, my life hasn’t always been easy. But who I am in my full authenticity has prepared me to weather the hard times and cherish the easy ones.
In March of 2025, I attended my cousin’s marriage in Pass Christian; there, she married her long-term boyfriend. The weekend after, my partner and I attended his cousin’s marriage in Georgia. There, his cousin married his long-term girlfriend. Two straight-marriages in two weekends. Good times. Easy times. Fun times. Family time.
When I was growing up, I never dreamed that the legal path for me to marry the man I now call my partner would be as easy as it has been since 2015, since the Obergefell ruling. As my partner and I watched our cousins walk down the aisle to meet their beloveds and commit to them to weather life’s storms, for better or for worse, I prayed that option remains viable for us, two men who by the grace of God found each other. I pray, too, that marriage remains a legal option for all couples like us well into our nation’s future. Life is so much easier when you walk it with someone you love by your side. Love should be enough.
In 2008, a few months after I officially came out to my mother in that hallway conversation, my older sister got married. The easiest conversation I ever had about being gay was with my sister. The conversation was easy because it never took place. My sister knew; she knows. And yet, she didn’t need me to go through the hard part — the difficult step — of having that conversation where I described my supposed difference in contrast to her assumed normalcy.
My sister made it easy because all that mattered to her is that I’m her younger brother. For her, that was, and is, enough. No need to make it any harder than that.

Federal scientists released their annual forecast for Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms on June 26, 2025, and they expect a mild to moderate season. However, anyone who comes in contact with the blooms can face health risks, and it’s worth remembering that 2014, when toxins from algae blooms contaminated the water supply in Toledo, Ohio, was considered a moderate year, too.
The Conversation asked Gregory J. Dick, who leads the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, a federally funded center at the University of Michigan that studies harmful algal blooms among other Great Lakes issues, why they’re such a concern.

bulletin_current 
1. What causes harmful algal blooms?
Harmful algal blooms are dense patches of excessive algae growth that can occur in any type of water body, including ponds, reservoirs, rivers, lakes and oceans. When you see them in freshwater, you’re typically seeing cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae.
These photosynthetic bacteria have inhabited our planet for billions of years. In fact, they were responsible for oxygenating Earth’s atmosphere, which enabled plant and animal life as we know it.

Algae are natural components of ecosystems, but they cause trouble when they proliferate to high densities, creating what we call blooms.
Harmful algal blooms form scums at the water surface and produce toxins that can harm ecosystems, water quality and human health. They have been reported in all 50 U.S. states, all five Great Lakes and nearly every country around the world. Blue-green algae blooms are becoming more common in inland waters.
The main sources of harmful algal blooms are excess nutrients in the water, typically phosphorus and nitrogen.
Historically, these excess nutrients mainly came from sewage and phosphorus-based detergents used in laundry machines and dishwashers that ended up in waterways. U.S. environmental laws in the early 1970s addressed this by requiring sewage treatment and banning phosphorus detergents, with spectacular success.
How pollution affected Lake Erie in the 1960s, before clean water regulations.
Today, agriculture is the main source of excess nutrients from chemical fertilizer or manure applied to farm fields to grow crops. Rainstorms wash these nutrients into streams and rivers that deliver them to lakes and coastal areas, where they fertilize algal blooms. In the U.S., most of these nutrients come from industrial-scale corn production, which is largely used as animal feed or to produce ethanol for gasoline.
Climate change also exacerbates the problem in two ways. First, cyanobacteria grow faster at higher temperatures. Second, climate-driven increases in precipitation, especially large storms, cause more nutrient runoff that has led to record-setting blooms.

2. What does your team’s DNA testing tell us about Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms?
Harmful algal blooms contain a mixture of cyanobacterial species that can produce an array of different toxins, many of which are still being discovered.
When my colleagues and I recently sequenced DNA from Lake Erie water, we found new types of microcystins, the notorious toxins that were responsible for contaminating Toledo’s drinking water supply in 2014.
These novel molecules cannot be detected with traditional methods and show some signs of causing toxicity, though further studies are needed to confirm their human health effects.
We also found organisms responsible for producing saxitoxin, a potent neurotoxin that is well known for causing paralytic shellfish poisoning on the Pacific Coast of North America and elsewhere.
Saxitoxins have been detected at low concentrations in the Great Lakes for some time, but the recent discovery of hot spots of genes that make the toxin makes them an emerging concern.
Our research suggests warmer water temperatures could boost its production, which raises concerns that saxitoxin will become more prevalent with climate change. However, the controls on toxin production are complex, and more research is needed to test this hypothesis. Federal monitoring programs are essential for tracking and understanding emerging threats.
3. Should people worry about these blooms?
Harmful algal blooms are unsightly and smelly, making them a concern for recreation, property values and businesses. They can disrupt food webs and harm aquatic life, though a recent study suggested that their effects on the Lake Erie food web so far are not substantial.
But the biggest impact is from the toxins these algae produce that are harmful to humans and lethal to pets.
The toxins can cause acute health problems such as gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, fever and skin irritation. Dogs can die from ingesting lake water with harmful algal blooms. Emerging science suggests that long-term exposure to harmful algal blooms, for example over months or years, can cause or exacerbate chronic respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems and may be linked to liver cancers, kidney disease and neurological issues.

In addition to exposure through direct ingestion or skin contact, recent research also indicates that inhaling toxins that get into the air may harm health, raising concerns for coastal residents and boaters, but more research is needed to understand the risks.
The Toledo drinking water crisis of 2014 illustrated the vast potential for algal blooms to cause harm in the Great Lakes. Toxins infiltrated the drinking water system and were detected in processed municipal water, resulting in a three-day “do not drink” advisory. The episode affected residents, hospitals and businesses, and it ultimately cost the city an estimated US$65 million.
4. Blooms seem to be starting earlier in the year and lasting longer – why is that happening?
Warmer waters are extending the duration of the blooms.
In 2025, NOAA detected these toxins in Lake Erie on April 28, earlier than ever before. The 2022 bloom in Lake Erie persisted into November, which is rare if not unprecedented.
Scientific studies of western Lake Erie show that the potential cyanobacterial growth rate has increased by up to 30% and the length of the bloom season has expanded by up to a month from 1995 to 2022, especially in warmer, shallow waters. These results are consistent with our understanding of cyanobacterial physiology: Blooms like it hot – cyanobacteria grow faster at higher temperatures.
5. What can be done to reduce the likelihood of algal blooms in the future?
The best and perhaps only hope of reducing the size and occurrence of harmful algal blooms is to reduce the amount of nutrients reaching the Great Lakes.
In Lake Erie, where nutrients come primarily from agriculture, that means improving agricultural practices and restoring wetlands to reduce the amount of nutrients flowing off of farm fields and into the lake. Early indications suggest that Ohio’s H2Ohio program, which works with farmers to reduce runoff, is making some gains in this regard, but future funding for H2Ohio is uncertain.
In places like Lake Superior, where harmful algal blooms appear to be driven by climate change, the solution likely requires halting and reversing the rapid human-driven increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

“Every year, over 6.5 million dogs and cats and other household pets are surrendered to animal shelters” in the U.S., according to World Animal Foundation.
Although data on pet intake fluctuates, some shelters in South Carolina are currently so overcrowded that officials are reporting “crisis” levels.
Fostering, or providing temporary care for, is a great way to give pets a break from shelter life. Plus, fostering “also relieves pressure on shelters and rescues, allowing these organizations to help more pets in need,” says Pedigree Foundation.
Pets at shelters can range from puppies to dogs rescued from illegal and “barbaric” dog fighting rings. Fostering helps prepare all of them for adoption.
Fostering opportunities are available year-round.

But every June — National Foster a Pet Month — there’s a push to get more pet lovers to temporarily look after companion animals.
For years I fostered dogs. I cared for young dogs, senior dogs, and everything in between.
One of the dogs I fostered was Jeriko:. “J” loved my bathroom mat. Even though I made a comfortable space for him in the living room, he’d always return to the bathroom to lie on that mat. “J” showed me that dogs have preferences.
When he was adopted, I bought him the same mat to take with him to his “forever home.”
I also fostered Misty.
During the time I was caring for her, I asked a friend to look after Misty while I took a short vacation. When my friend came to the house to pick her up, Misty started doing “the zoomies.”
Misty was so excited that she ran in circles. She reminded me that dogs are expressive. Misty really liked my friend, and she showed it. In no time, my friend’s family fell in love with Misty and adopted her.

Then, there’s Arthur.
I first saw Arthur when I was pulling up to the shelter’s parking lot. I was returning a crate that belonged to them, and I saw a volunteer walking him back to the building. I thought, “This dog shouldn’t be here.” Arthur’s missing one of his legs.
The next day I called the shelter to see if Arthur was still there. He was. I picked him up, and he became my next foster.
When Arthur arrived home, I let him lie down on the couch and I sat next to him. He quickly got up and dropped on my lap. He showed me that dogs just want to be loved.
I quickly fell in love with Arthur and adopted him — “foster to forever.”
People frequently ask me about Arthur. Does he need a prosthetic? No. Is he ill? No. I like when people ask so they discard misinformed or preconceived ideas about dogs with special needs. Anyone who’s met Arthur knows he’s passionate about tennis balls, and he loves to run — even hop — to catch them.
Sometimes dogs who’ve spent time at a shelter are misunderstood.
Once while walking Misty, a neighbor saw us and said he couldn’t be near pit bulls. Misty’s a pit bull mix. I reminded the neighbor that breedism is a form of racism. He’d never spent time with Misty, so he didn’t know that she’s calm and affectionate. If he’d given Misty a chance, he wouldn’t have judged her just by her appearance.
Animals don’t judge us, so let’s not judge them.
By fostering and getting to know companion animals, we can inform potential adopters about their personalities. This increases their chances of getting adopted.
Saying goodbye once they’d been adopted always made me cry. I laughed and learned with them, and it was impossible not to get attached.
People sometimes said, “I couldn’t foster. It’d be too painful.” But to me it was simple. I could cry from joy that they’d found a safe and loving home. Or I could do nothing.
Fostering is flexible and varies.
There are hundreds of shelters across South Carolina, and they’ll help coordinate a schedule that works well for everyone.
Fostering can last for a few weeks or be as short as an afternoon walk. But regardless of the amount of time given, the benefits are manifold.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 15:29:22+00:00,CT Mirror,Avelo deportation flights prompt bill on jet fuel tax exemptions,Adam Walker | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/avelo-deportation-flights-jet-fuel-tax-bill/,William Tong joined a virtual press conference announcing a proposal to cut jet fuel tax breaks for airlines involved in deportation flights.,"In a growing effort to hold airlines like Avelo accountable for their role in controversial deportation flights, New York State Sen. Patricia Fahy is spearheading legislation that would revoke millions of dollars in jet fuel tax exemptions from carriers found to be violating civil liberties.
Fahy unveiled details of the proposal during a virtual press conference Wednesday, hosted by a national group called Coalition to Stop Avelo. 
The conference featured Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and advocates from across the country pressing for transparency and action against Avelo Airlines, which activists say is profiting from deportation flights contracted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
New Haven has been an epicenter for the boycott movement against Avelo, as the budget airline flies 30 passenger-travel direct routes from Tweed New Haven Airport, even as it’s spent the past nearly two months running deportation flights from a separate airport in Arizona.
The airline, facing financial pressures, has defended its DHS partnership as necessary at a time of increased competition to its New Haven passenger-travel business. Activists and officials from across Connecticut and the country have continued to criticize Avelo’s role in migrant removals.

Meanwhile, at Wednesday’s online press conference, Fahy, who represents Albany in the New York State Senate, explained the rationale behind her new legislative proposal. ​“It’s leveraging our proprietary authority over public airport contracts here in New York to say that it is part of the state oversight contractual authority that airlines have to uphold Constitutional rights,” she said.
Fahy’s bill targets New York’s jet fuel tax exemption — described by Fahy as ​“very, very generous” — that saves airlines between $11 million and $17 million statewide each year. Under the proposal, airlines engaged in deportation flights that undermine due process would lose that tax benefit. 
The legislation, titled the State Airport Facilities Enforcing Accountability in Immigration Removals (SAFE AIR) Act, aims to ensure that no state agency, department, or locality in New York enters into or renews contracts with airlines that transport individuals detained for deportation without a valid judicial warrant or order from a federal judge or magistrate — not merely an administrative immigration detainer — and proof that the individual has been afforded due process rights, including access to counsel and a hearing before an immigration judge.
Introduced in May, the bill is currently under consideration in the New York State Senate’s Committee on Procurement and Contracts. It has not yet passed. 
The SAFE AIR Act would also amend state tax law to deny fuel tax exemptions to airlines that fail to meet these standards, while protecting carriers that comply with valid court orders or lawful federal mandates. It empowers the state attorney general to seek injunctive relief or civil penalties against violators. 
“This is the first private-sector contract we’re aware of between ICE and a commercial airline,” Fahy said, referring to Avelo’s alleged cooperation with DHS. ​“If they’re violating civil liberties, they shouldn’t get a break from New York taxpayers.” (Avelo has also been the beneficiary of a Connecticut state aviation fuel tax break.)
During his remarks at Wednesday’s presser, Connecticut Attorney General Tong echoed Fahy’s stance, urging states to reconsider economic support for companies engaged in harmful practices. 
Tong said Avelo refused to provide information about its relationship with DHS and instead told the state to file a Freedom of Information Act request — a response he called dismissive of a state that has offered the airline significant support. He also criticized Avelo’s claim that working with DHS is essential to its survival, arguing no business model should depend on profiting from others’ suffering.
“When I heard what Avelo is doing to immigrants and families in total violation of the law and without regard to due process — and if Avelo says, ​‘Well, that’s not us, that’s DHS, that’s ICE.’ No, sorry. You’re part of the deal, too,” Tong said.
“We are considering all of our legal options and legislative options to get more information, number one,” Tong added, ​“and if we’re unhappy with what we see and understand from Avelo, to not do business with them and not to be their partner.”
When asked about the criticism, Avelo spokesperson Courtney Goff wrote to the Independent Wednesday, ​“We recognize the right of individuals to peacefully assemble and assert their freedom of speech. Avelo’s main priority continues to be maintaining the safety and timeliness of our operation that over 7.3 million Customers across the country continue to enjoy.”
The press conference, organized by the Coalition to Stop Avelo, highlighted the growing grassroots and legislative movement opposing the use of commercial airlines in deportation operations. Advocates from Delaware, Michigan, Tennessee, and other states joined Fahy and Tong in calling for stronger accountability measures and the end of taxpayer subsidies for airlines tied to immigration enforcement. 
The Coalition continues to coordinate protests, boycotts, and legislative campaigns nationwide, with new local actions planned in the coming weeks to pressure airlines, investors, and public officials, including protests set to take place this weekend in states such as New York, Florida, and Michigan.

Wes Moore (D) is turning to a strategist with close ties to a potential rival in the 2028 White House election to helm his 2026 reelection campaign in Maryland – and possibly a national campaign beyond that.
Moore has hired Ron Owens, a Michigander who has worked as a political operative and statehouse aide for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) to run his reelection campaign.
Many Democrats – in Moore’s political orbit and beyond – had expected Ned Miller, who ran Moore’s 2022 campaign, joined his administration and later oversaw his super PAC, to head the reelection effort. But Miller has moved to Georgia, to run former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms’ 2026 campaign for governor.
“I’m thrilled to have Ron Owens leading our reelection campaign as our campaign manager,” Moore said in a statement provided to Maryland Matters. “Ron brings immense experience to Maryland from his work all across the country – with him on our team we will create the most aggressive statewide operation in history to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot all across Maryland.”
Though only 29, Owens is a seasoned operative who worked most recently as a campaign adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, helping Democratic Senate candidates, including now-Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), with strategy and campaign management.
In 2023, he was campaign manager to Brandon Presley, a former state utility regulator – and cousin of Elvis Presley’s – who was the Democratic nominee for governor of Mississippi. Presley ran a surprisingly strong race in a red state, losing to incumbent Republican Gov. Tate Reeves by just 3.2 points.
Most of Owens’ political experience, however, is in Michigan, his home state. After a stint as a legislative aide to the state House Democratic leader, Owens was the deputy political director on Whitmer’s successful 2018 campaign for governor.
He spent two years as Whitmer’s public affairs specialist in her gubernatorial office, then was political director in her 2022 reelection campaign.
After Owens was hired to run Presley’s campaign, a leading Mississippi Republican cited the operative’s ties to Whitmer as a way of blasting the Democratic contender.
“COVID showed Americans that it certainly matters who serves as governor,” Henry Barbour, the Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi, told the Magnolia Tribune in 2023. “Democrats such as Gretchen Whitmer advanced their elitist, government-knows-best agenda that restricted Americans’ liberty. And Brandon Presley hired her top political operative.
“Don’t believe him for a minute when he tries to persuade you he’s not of the same political persuasion,” Barbour said.
Whitmer and Moore are both seen as top-tier potential candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. But while Whitmer is termed out of office at the end of 2026, Moore must first win reelection next year before he can fully focus on any hypothetical national campaign.
Still, in the early skirmishing leading up to the 2028 White House primaries, Owens’ decision to cast his lot with Moore, one of Whitmer’s potential rivals, is noteworthy, if only significant to insiders.
In a 2018 interview, Owens highlighted his work ethic and life philosophy.
“One thing that my mom instilled in my siblings and me was to, one, always be kind to other people, two, always work twice as hard as anyone else and, three, whenever you’re working you should always be doing something that is benefiting others,” Owens said in an nterview with Pride Source, a Michigan LGBTQ+ publication.
“We are fortunate to have him as our leader as we seek to continue our mission to create a Maryland that leaves no one behind,” Moore said.
At this stage, Moore still has a pretty skeletal campaign operation as the 2026 election ramps up, though that is likely to change soon. But he will enter a potentially perilous campaign season without Miller, who, after guiding the governor’s first statewide campaign, became a senior adviser and director of engagement for his administration.
In the middle of last year, Miller left state government to oversee Moore’s Unity First PAC and also played a leadership role in Freedom in Reproduction – Maryland Inc., the entity that helped pass the ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.
Moore appears to have also lost the services of his finance director, Patrick Denny, who was with the campaign since 2021.
The Moore campaign has not yet indicated who will replace Denny as finance director and it is not known who will oversee the governor’s PAC, which he largely used during the 2024 election cycle to attack Republican congressional candidates in Maryland. The PAC is now airing ads touting Moore’s economic record.
Even though he has publicly insisted in recent weeks that he is not running for president in 2028, Moore continues to behave like a possible national candidate. His trip in late May to South Carolina, site of an early and critical presidential primary, won wide attention from national political insiders and commentators.
Strategists on the popular “Hacks on Tap” podcast subsequently called Moore a “top 10” contender for 2028, and Chuck Todd, the former political director of NBC News, recently opined that Moore has the strongest resume and most gold-plated Rolodex of any of the hypothetical Democratic presidential candidates.
Moore appeared last week as a guest on “Pod Save America,” the breezy podcast hosted by former Obama administration officials. There, he explained why he’s not making plans to run for president, saying he never anticipated a career in politics and is enjoying serving as governor after starting the 2022 campaign as a relative unknown.
“I’m playing with house money right now and I love the work we’re doing in Maryland,” he said. The governor added that he will “go anywhere and everywhere” to tout the state’s progress.
 Bold-faced names

Moore’s out-of-state travels continue this month, and include a recent gathering with Democrats in Virginia, which is holding closely watched statewide elections this year.
Moore is headed to a fundraising brunch in Aspen, Colorado,on Saturday, hosted by Damian O’Doherty, the former Maryland political operative and co-founder of KO Public Affairs in Baltimore, who lives now in the Rocky Mountains but often returns to his home state.
The host committee of the event, which O’Doherty has informally dubbed “A Whole Lotta Skiers For Maryland Governor Wes Moore,” includes David Baugh, the executive director of the Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club, and a former superintendent of the Aspen School District; Rich Benenson, managing partner of the Denver office of the law firm and lobbying powerhouse Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck; Gordon Bronson, chief business officer at Continuum Partners, a real estate development and financing firm; Adam Goers, a former Democratic operative with ties to former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and now the Denver-based senior vice president for corporate affairs for Columbia Care, a cannabis company; and Michael Stratton, a senior Colorado-based Democratic and corporate strategist.
Moore’s fundraiser in Colorado coincides with the Aspen Ideas Festival, the signature annual event of the Aspen Institute. According to the festival website, the confab “brings brilliant minds from around the globe to discuss the ideas that will shape tomorrow and help us understand today. From sunup to sundown, we’ll explore critical issues and uncover ideas that spark wonder.”
The festival schedule shows Moore discussing “bold, purposeful leadership” on Saturday afternoon with Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, moderated by CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson.
“Big thinkers and doers share fresh ideas, challenge assumptions and ignite conversations that ripple far beyond [the Aspen conference venue],” the conference website says of the panel discussion with Moore and the other dignitaries. “Curiosity required.”
Moore is then scheduled to travel to Detroit, where he will deliver the keynote address at the Detroit NAACP’s 70th anniversary dinner on Sunday evening. That appearance was first reported by Politico.

What’s changed?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/ct-cannabis-marijuana-sales-recreational-medical/,"As sales of recreational marijuana have increased in CT, sales of medical cannabis have dropped, and overall sales have held fairly steady.","July 1 marks four years of legalized recreational cannabis use in Connecticut, and with legalization came major changes to the medical marijuana market.  
A law enacted in 2012 allowed the purchase and use of cannabis for medical reasons only. But in 2021, the state legalized recreational use for everyone 21 and older. Statewide recreational retail sales began in January 2023, and by May 2023, recreational sales accounted for the majority of state cannabis retail sales, a trend that has continued to today.
Connecticut was the 19th state to legalize recreational marijuana. 
Under state law, anyone 21 or older without a medical card is allowed to possess up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis flower or other cannabis product equivalent in public and up to 5 ounces in their private residence. Medical cardholders can posses up to 5 ounces of cannabis on their person.
Not only have recreational sales increased, but medical purchases have made up less than half of the state’s cannabis market retail sales since May 2023.
Both medical and recreational dispensaries sell similar products, but medical users who are using the product to treat “debilitating medical conditions” aren’t subject to the cannabis tax. Medical users can also buy other products that recreational users cannot, including capsules, tablets, pills, sublinguals and suppositories.
Medical users are also not subject to potency restrictions, while recreational cannabis is currently capped at 30% THC for cannabis flower and 60% THC products other than vapes. However, as of Oct. 1, 2025, the cap for raw flower will be raised to 35% THC and 70% THC for concentrates other than vapes.
The cannabis tax is dependent on both the product and the amount of THC; edible products are taxed the most heavily per milligram of THC and plant products the least. For an eighth of flower that’s 15% THC, for the tax currently sits at around 9.4%, fluctuating based on product pricing. Edibles are subject to a tax of $0.0275 per milligram of the product’s total THC content.
Medical card holders are required to apply for renewal annually, which involves a consultation fee with health care providers that can range from $100 to $350 for user 18 and older. For users under 18, users must have a condition specified by the legislature for medical usage as well as parental consent and a caregiver arrangement.
Because cannabis usage is federally illegal, medical card holders are prohibited from purchasing firearms, and everyone applying for a firearm is required to disclose their usage of cannabis and other federally controlled substances. Federal law bars all cannabis users from owning a firearm.
Each hybrid or recreational cannabis retailer registered in Connecticut must pay the cannabis tax, which varies by product. The state cannabis tax brought in $21.3 million in state revenue for FY 2024.
Overall, the sales tax — along with state sales tax, municipality sales tax and licensing and conversion fees for dispensaries — brought in $49.4 million in cannabis revenue for FY 2024.
While there are dozens of products on the market, usable cannabis flower, which is just the dried plant, brings in the most sales across the medical and recreational markets. Overall, in May 2025, recreational cannabis retail sales were $18.7 million. Medical retail sales were $6.6 million.
There is only one exclusively medical dispensary in the state. The rest of the dispensaries have transitioned and cater to both the recreational market and the medical market as hybrid dealers, or just the recreational market.
Statewide, there are 36 recreational dispensaries and 35 hybrid dealers. However, the number of dispensaries fluctuates. Back in January 2023, only nine hybrid dispensaries existed. Numbers from around February 2025 showed 64 dispensaries in the state— eight fewer than are currently open.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-26-at-10.15.39-AM-1024x737.png,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice, allowing South Carolina to exclude clinics that also provide abortions from its government health care program, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Thursday.
The South Carolina case that led to the 6-3 ruling began with Gov. Henry McMaster’s July 2018 executive order directing the state’s Medicaid agency to remove abortion clinics from its list of providers that patients can choose for coverage of non-abortion health care services.
The case is not about abortion — not directly, anyway — but whether South Carolinians can use their Medicaid health coverage at Planned Parenthood for services such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
McMaster’s directive was quickly blocked by the federal courts, as Planned Parenthood sued on behalf of a patient who said she wanted to get all of her gynecological care at one of the provider’s two clinics in South Carolina but couldn’t unless Medicaid paid.
The case has been decided and appealed multiple times as it bounced back and forth.
Ultimately, six justices on the nation’s highest court decided nothing in the federal Medicaid laws provided the patient a constitutional right to sue. Three of the justices considered more liberal dissented.
“Though it is rare enough for any statute to confer an enforceable right, spending-power statutes like Medicaid are especially unlikely to do so,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in his 24-page opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion.
McMaster declared victory.
“Seven years ago, we took a stand to protect the sanctity of life and defend South Carolina’s authority and values — and today, we are finally victorious,” the governor said in a statement Thursday.
However, nothing changes immediately.
Before South Carolina can officially remove Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid rolls, it needs another court order, said Katherine Farris, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.
That’s because justices’ decision on the patient’s right to sue sent the case back to a lower court.
Until the state gets the still-necessary permission, Planned Parenthood will continue providing services to Medicaid patients, Farris said.
“The state never claimed that we do not provide excellent care to Medicaid patients,” Farris said. “Rather, this is a purely political decision to deny patients the right to come to our offices because the name Planned Parenthood is on the door.”
Farris also noted that Wednesday’s ruling applies only to South Carolina.
However, it opens the door for other states to begin deciding which health care providers to approve or not approve to receive Medicaid funding, Farris said.
“The long-term consequences of that decision are devastating,” Farris said.
South Carolinians already can’t use Medicaid to pay for abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save a patient’s life, as per a federal provision the state follows.
Planned Parenthood’s clinics in Columbia and Charleston receive a small fraction of the state’s total Medicaid dollars.
Of the $35 million total spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state’s Medicaid agency.
 What the justices said

The arguments primarily centered around two words in the federal Medicaid law.
Medicaid patients “may obtain” care from any provider “qualified to perform the service,” according to one of the qualifications states must meet in order to receive federal Medicaid funding.
Planned Parenthood’s attorneys argued the words “may obtain” meant patients had a right to visit the doctor of their choosing, and they could sue if the state tried to bar them from exercising that right.
But that is not a “rights-creating term,” such as specifically calling the decision a “right,” “privilege,” “entitlement” or “immunity,” attorneys for the state contended. If Congress had wanted to be sure patients were guaranteed the ability to choose their doctors, it would have explicitly said so, the attorneys argued.
The nation’s highest court agreed.
Deciding otherwise “would risk obliterating the longstanding line between mere benefits and enforceable rights,” Gorsuch wrote.
If a state is found to be violating the law, the federal government could cut off its funding, Gorsuch wrote. And states, including South Carolina, have an appeals process allowing providers who have been removed from the provider list to protest, he wrote.
Whether people can sue to resolve such questions should be left to lawmakers, not judges, Gorsuch wrote.
“New rights for some mean new duties for others,” the opinion reads. “And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation.”
In the dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the majority’s reading of the law was “narrow and ahistorical.”
“The fact that the provision does not specifically use the word ‘right’ is not dispositive,” Jackson wrote. “We have never required Congress to use specific verbiage to establish individual rights.”
Gorsuch’s concern that the decision could open the floodgates to other lawsuits based on different parts of the Medicaid law is unfounded, considering that didn’t happen after the federal appeals courts previously ruled against South Carolina, Jackson wrote.
She warned that the ruling will weaken the Reconstruction-era law allowing people to sue in order to protect their rights and “is likely to result in tangible harm to real people.”
“At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them,” Jackson wrote. “And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians — and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country — of a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.’”
 Reaction from lawmakers

Republican lawmakers celebrated the opinion as another strike against abortions in the state. The federal ruling follows decisions by the state’s highest court upholding the state’s so-called “fetal heartbeat” law as a six-week abortion ban.
“Planned Parenthood has sued South Carolina over and over again, and over and over again, the abortion-giant keeps losing,” state Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said in a statement. “Today’s ruling is a win for all South Carolina taxpayers, and most of all, this pro-life generation looking forward to the day when Planned Parenthood’s doors close for good.”
The opinion allows the state to determine how it spends its money without interference from outside groups, Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a statement.
“The Supreme Court just slammed the door on Planned Parenthood’s latest attempt to force its radical agenda through the courts on our state,” Wilson said. “South Carolina, not federal judges or D.C. activist groups, gets to decide how we run our Medicaid program.”
The decision will disproportionately affect low-income women who relied on Planned Parenthood’s services, Sens. Margie Bright Matthews and Tameika Isaac Devine said in a joint statement.
“The real price of this decision will be paid by patients, especially Black, brown and rural women who now face fewer options and greater barriers to care,” the Walterboro and Columbia Democrats said.

The trio had been at the play area for about two hours when approached for this story. Cearnel pointed to a gallon-sized bottle of water and remarked that it had been a “block of ice” when they arrived.
“A lot of people come out here to beat the heat,” Cearnel said. “Two days ago, there were some grandparents out here with their grandchildren because their AC went out and they came to the splash pad because it’s free.”
On Thursday, the National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for most of Central North Carolina until 7 p.m. That was a downgrade from the Extreme Heat Warning in effect on Wednesday, when temperatures were several degrees warmer.
Wake County announced that temporary cooling stations across the county would remain open through at least June 30 as a response to the heat wave.
“During prolonged periods of extreme heat, it’s important for everyone to remain cautious and continue taking the proper steps to stay cool,” said Josh Creighton, deputy director of Wake County Fire Services and Emergency Management. “If at all possible, avoid strenuous activity outside during the hottest part of the day. Take breaks in the shade, or preferably in an air-conditioned space, and drink plenty of water.”
In Winston-Salem, housing activists gathered this week to demand the City of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County enact “immediate plans” to protect the county’s “elderly, children, unhoused and others without access to air conditioning from heat deaths.”
Housing Justice Now said the county’s response to the heat advisories had been “sorely lacking.”
“The only official response to the heat advisory from Forsyth County is a Facebook post stating: “be careful with the extreme heat expected this week!” Housing Justice Now said in a press release it shared earlier this week. “With conditions demanding more than a one-liner on social media, Housing Justice Now and community advocates urge public officials to do better.”
The group demands included extending the county’s public library hours and using vacant buildings such as the old courthouse and Kaledium North (a downtown museum that targets children and families) as cooling stations.
Back in Wake County, Vielka Gabriel, the season and volunteer supervisor, who oversees “Cool for Wake,” the county’s heat relief program that provides window air conditioners and fans to people who can’t afford them, said soaring temperatures this week sent demand into overdrive.

“We have lots of individuals that are seniors who have broken HVAC systems and can’t afford to get their systems fixed,” Gabriel said. “We’re also partnering with our public health department, which has been referring individuals with chronic illnesses, newborn babies that are coming out of NICUs (Neonatal Intensive Care Units).”
On Wednesday, Gabriel said “Cool for Wake” ordered eight air conditioners for senior citizens and donated six used ones to families who needed them.
“We’ve just restocked our regional centers with fans,” she said. “Yesterday alone, I’ve ordered about 150 fans.”
The fans are sent to regional centers, so residents don’t have to travel to Raleigh to get them. “Cool for Wake” also arranges deliveries of air conditioners to residents with chronic illnesses, she said.
“We’re utilizing a partnership with the Raleigh Regional Association Realtors Giving Network,” Gabriel said. “They took six requests on Tuesday, and delivered four and are delivering the other two today [Wednesday].”
Gabriel noted that residents who receive air conditioning units must arrange to have them installed.
Residents are grateful to receive fans, Gabriel said, but acknowledged that in the extreme heat the region is experiencing, a traditional box fan does little more than circulate hot air.
“This year, I’ve made a major push into getting more air conditioning units into homes,” Gabriel said. “It has been a challenge because of the cost. We have an amazing community, however, that has stepped up to the call and has been helping to get gently used units into homes.”
The Central America native has been looking into acquiring cooling units that are popular there. The units use water and ice to cool rooms, Gabriel said.
“We’re just trying to find ways that are truly effective in keeping a person cool.
In the meantime, Gabriel said residents should close curtains, lock doors and run AC units strategically to conserve energy.
This year, Gabriel said, “Cool for Wake” has worked with the Wake County Housing team to connect with the county’s westernization program to help seniors and others with to provide adequate cooling systems.
“Part of my ask would be for businesses and folks to help us get to the root cause [of why a resident doesn’t have an adequate cooling system],” Gabriel said. “If the HVAC system is the need, is there a way get donations or have [HVAC] companies come in and check units?”
Continued monetary donations are also critical, Gabriel said. And air conditioning units are no longer a luxury as summer temperatures continue to rise.
“We can get box fans rather cheaply, but if four people or five people got together and donated $25 each, it would help us be able to purchase more air conditioning units,” Gabriel said. “We really need to see the need for air conditioning units in the community.”
Financial donations can be made online at the Cool for Wake website.

(Photo by Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)The two unions representing nearly 40,000 Minnesota state workers — the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — separately announced Friday that they reached tentative agreements with the state.
MAPE members have been fuming about Gov. Tim Walz’s part-time return-to-office order that took effect earlier this month and have picketed outside negotiations between Minnesota budget officials and their union.
Under Walz’s order, state employees must work in the office at least 50% of the time unless they live more than 50 miles away or receive an exemption. Walz argues the policy will improve collaboration, mentorship and workplace culture, with the added benefit of bringing bodies and dollars back to downtown St. Paul.
The return-to-work order itself was not negotiable, MAPE said in a press release, but the union said the agreement includes a 21-day notice requirement for telework changes, up from 14 days.
“To fight off concessions in a year like this is a real testament to our members,” MAPE President Megan Dayton said in a statement. “They showed up at the table, at the rallies and at the site. This was a contract campaign in the truest sense, and our members won it.”
MAPE and AFSCME members have also expressed outrage over the state’s health care proposals, which they estimated would have raised many workers’ costs by thousands of dollars a year. The administration says rising health care costs left them no choice, but MAPE and AFSCME seems to have prevailed on this point.
The tentative agreement includes “a complete defeat” of the state’s health care proposals, AFSCME Council 5 said in a press release, and MAPE said it too had “successfully fought back the most aggressive health care cost increases.”
AFSCME Council 5 also won across-the-board raises of 1.5% in 2025 and 1.75% in 2026. MAPE said it secured over 3% in across-the-board raises over the 2025-2027 contract term.
“This tentative agreement is the direct result of the incredible strength, solidarity and determination shown by our union members from every corner of our state who were determined to fight for economic justice and the public services they provide every day,” AFSCME Council 5 Executive Director Bart Andersen said in a statement.
MAPE members will vote to ratify the agreement in August; AFSCME Council 5 did not announce when their dues-paying members will vote on the agreement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P1230073-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802
,DC,2025-06-27 14:45:33+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US Supreme Court limits injunctions, allows Trump to act on birthright citizenship ban",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-limits-injunctions-allows-trump-act-birthright-citizenship-ban,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Friday in a major decision reined in nationwide injunctions by some lower courts that had blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order barring birthright citizenship.The high court declined to decide the constitutionality of birthright citizenship itself, but said the executive order rewriting the constitutional right to birthright citizenship could go into effect within 30 days after Friday’s ruling.The ruling likely could hamper other legal challenges against Trump administration actions in which nationwide injunctions are sought.In a 6-3 ruling, the conservative justices found that nationwide “injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.”“The Court grants the Government’s applications for a partial stay of the injunctions entered below, but only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief to each plaintiff with standing to sue,” according to the ruling written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett.While the dispute before the court related to Trump’s executive order to rewrite the constitutional right to birthright citizenship, the Trump administration asked the high court to instead focus on the issue of preliminary injunctions granted by lower courts.“The applications do not raise—and thus the Court does not address—the question whether the Executive Order violates the Citizenship Clause or Nationality Act,” according to the ruling, referring to the practice of granting citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil.The order instructs lower courts to “move expeditiously to ensure that, with respect to each plaintiff, the injunctions comport with this rule and otherwise comply with principles of equity.""More than two dozen nationwide injunctionsIn the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, through April 29, judges issued about 25 nationwide injunctions, according to the Congressional Research Service.“The lower courts should determine whether a narrower injunction is appropriate; we therefore leave it to them to consider these and any related arguments,” according to the ruling.A narrower injunction could refer to a class action suit.Barrett argued that a nationwide injunction would not grant more relief for barring the enforcement of Trump’s executive order against a pregnant person who is not a U.S. citizen and fears their child would be denied citizenship.“Her child will not be denied citizenship. And extending the injunction to cover everyone similarly situated would not render her relief any more complete,” according to the ruling. “So the individual and associational respondents are wrong to characterize the universal injunction as simply an application of the complete-relief principle.”Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status.If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.It would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to the study.In last month’s oral arguments, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, contended that it’s unconstitutional for federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. Instead, he said, the injunctions should be limited to those who brought the challenges.Origins of birthright citizenship caseThe case, Trump v. CASA, was consolidated from three cases.One was brought by immigrant rights groups and several pregnant women in Maryland who are not U.S. citizens who filed their case in Maryland; the second came from four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon — that filed a case in Washington state; and the third came from 18 Democratic state attorneys general who filed the challenge in Massachusetts.Those 18 states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin. The District of Columbia and the county and city of San Francisco also joined.This is not the first time the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of birthright citizenship.In 1898, the Supreme Court upheld the 14th Amendment, in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, extending birthright citizenship.In that 19th-century case, Ark was born in San Francisco, California, to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had legal authority to be in the United States, such as a temporary visa. While Ark was born in California, his citizenship was not recognized when he went on a trip to China. Upon his return to California, he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act— a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.When his case went all the way to the Supreme Court, the high court ruled that children born in the U.S. to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.The Trump administration has argued that the 1898 case was misinterpreted and point to a specific phrase: “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.Attorneys for the Trump administration contend that the phrase in the 14th Amendment means that birthright citizenship only applies to children born to parents who are ""subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.That would mean, under their view, people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status are “subject to the jurisdiction” of their country of origin and therefore so would be any children they have.",,,,2025-06-27 11:10:43.386802

Read this story in English.
Los legisladores de Connecticut aprobaron en esta sesión legislativa una ley que reforma partes de las leyes estatales de protección al consumidor, añadiendo salvaguardas adicionales para quienes compran una amplia variedad de bienes y servicios.
El proyecto de ley de 33 páginas, promulgado por el Gobernador Ned Lamont a principios de este mes, fue una de las principales prioridades de los Demócratas del Senado este año e incluye cambios de gran alcance.
Amplía la capacidad de la Fiscalía General del estado para controlar la especulación de precios, exige que las empresas revelen las llamadas tarifas basura, exige a las empresas que producen dispositivos conectados a internet que informen a los usuarios si su tecnología captura y comparte audio o video desde los hogares, y más.
El Senador James Maroney, Demócrata por Milford, ayudó a impulsar el proyecto de ley, S.B. 3, en la legislatura y afirmó que ayudaría a proteger a los residentes de Connecticut en un panorama de consumo cambiante.
“Connecticut está intensificando sus esfuerzos para proteger a las familias de prácticas comerciales abusivas, ya sea mediante micrófonos en electrodomésticos, grabaciones de conversaciones o cargos sorpresa por productos engañosos que inflan sus facturas”, declaró Maroney, copresidente del Comité de Derecho General de la Legislatura.
Esto es lo que el proyecto de ley hará y lo que no hará.
Abusos de precios
Connecticut ya contaba con una ley que permitía al fiscal general del estado supervisar y procesar los casos de abuso de precios, o el aumento artificial del precio de los productos durante emergencias, como desastres naturales.
La S.B. 3 amplía la supervisión del fiscal general más allá de los minoristas, como supermercados y gasolineras. Ahora, la oficina del fiscal general también puede investigar y acusar a distribuidores, fabricantes, proveedores y mayoristas por cobrar precios “injustificadamente excesivos”.
La ley también amplió esa supervisión a los contratos de alquiler y arrendamiento.
Renovaciones automáticas
¿Alguna vez se ha suscrito a un servicio y ha olvidado que lo estaba pagando? Bueno, la legislatura de Connecticut quiere asegurarse de que reciba un recordatorio.
Parte de la nueva ley de protección al consumidor exige que algunas compañías con “renovaciones automáticas” o “cláusulas de servicio continuo” envíen a los consumidores un aviso anual indicando que se les seguirá cobrando por el servicio.
La ley también exige que las compañías informen a los consumidores cómo pueden cancelar ese contrato recurrente a través de un sitio web, teléfono o correo electrónico.
Sin embargo, este apartado del proyecto de ley no aplica a todas las compañías. Los legisladores establecieron exenciones específicas a esta norma para las empresas de gas, agua y electricidad, así como para los proveedores de servicios de internet. También establecieron exenciones similares para los bancos y las compañías de seguros.
Todos ellos ya están regulados por entidades estatales y federales independientes.
Sin embargo, los legisladores también eximieron lo que denominaron “servicios globales o nacionales” que ofrecen predominantemente “contenido audiovisual”, lo que parece incluir los servicios de streaming en línea.
Divulgación total de precios
Otra sección de la nueva ley aborda las tarifas ocultas, o tarifas basura, como a veces se les llama.
Los legisladores elaboraron un texto que prohíbe a las empresas anunciar, exhibir u ofrecer un bien o servicio a un precio que no incorpore todas las tarifas, cargos y costos que los consumidores deberán pagar.
Si dichas tarifas no se anuncian ni exhiben, o si los cargos se ocultan, se presentan de forma intencionada o se tergiversan, las empresas pueden ser demandadas en virtud de la Ley de Prácticas Comerciales Desleales de Connecticut.
Este tipo de requisito también se aplica a las propiedades en alquiler. El proyecto de ley generalmente establece que el arrendatario debe incluir cualquier tarifa, cargo o costo periódico que el inquilino deba pagar al anunciar una vivienda en alquiler.
Al igual que con las renovaciones automáticas, existen excepciones a la divulgación de tarifas.
Las empresas no necesitan detallar los impuestos federales, estatales o locales que se añaden al precio de compra. La ley tampoco se aplica en situaciones en las que una empresa no puede calcular de forma viable el costo de un servicio, como el envío, durante la compra.
Dispositivos conectados a internet
Los legisladores de Connecticut también abordaron un problema relativamente nuevo para los consumidores: los dispositivos que pueden grabar a las personas en sus propios hogares.
La legislatura, controlada por los Demócratas, busca evitar que las empresas que venden electrodomésticos, televisores o juguetes conectados a internet graben a consumidores involuntarios y utilicen esa información para sus propios fines.
La nueva ley especifica que las empresas que venden estos productos deben informar a los consumidores cuándo su dispositivo puede transmitir audio o video al fabricante o a un tercero. Los dispositivos también deben ofrecer a los consumidores la opción de desactivar dichas funciones, a menos que dicha acción inutilice el dispositivo.
Los legisladores también añadieron una sección al proyecto de ley que prohíbe que los dispositivos conectados a internet incluyan funciones integradas que permitan a las fuerzas del orden monitorear las comunicaciones de las personas.
Y prohíbe a las empresas utilizar los dispositivos para recopilar información que pueda ayudar a otras empresas a identificar al usuario para publicidad dirigida.
Maroney se refirió a estas secciones como las “disposiciones contra escuchas ilegales” del proyecto de ley.
Derecho a reparar
Una de las secciones más ambiciosas de la ley aborda el derecho a reparar, que busca garantizar que los consumidores tengan acceso a todos los materiales necesarios para reparar sus propios productos.
Más de media docena de estados ya han aprobado disposiciones similares.
La versión de Connecticut exige que los fabricantes de productos electrónicos o electrodomésticos pongan a disposición de los consumidores recursos para “diagnosticar, mantener o reparar sus productos”.
El proyecto de ley especifica que estos recursos deben incluir “documentación, piezas y herramientas”, y se aplicará a los productos “fabricados, vendidos o usados” en Connecticut después del 1 de julio de 2026.
Los fabricantes estarán obligados a poner a disposición dicha documentación, piezas y herramientas durante tres o cinco años, dependiendo del precio del producto.
Sin embargo, las empresas no están obligadas a entregar nada que se considere secreto comercial o propiedad intelectual, y el proyecto de ley no se aplica a los productos que ya no se fabrican.
Aun así, hay una larga lista de artículos que no estarán cubiertos, incluidos barcos, vehículos todo terreno, generadores, herramientas eléctricas, estaciones de carga de vehículos eléctricos, equipos de jardinería, equipos de construcción, equipos agrícolas, equipos forestales, equipos de minería y motores.

Andy Beshear, left, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly spoke to reporters in a call organized by the Democratic Governors Association (States Newsroom, Kansas Reflector).

The Democratic governors of two red states — Kentucky and Kansas — urged Republicans in Congress to scrap their massive budget bill, warning it would take health care and food away from needy Americans to give “tax handouts to the ultra wealthy.”
“We are a better country than what we’re seeing out of this big ugly bill. And it should not pass,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said during a Thursday press call organized by the Democratic Governors Association.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said, “I don’t think any amount of tweaking is going to make a difference in the long run. I think they just need to kill it and start over.”
Kelly, chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would “slash Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years and gut funding for critical food assistance programs, all while passing tax handouts to the ultra wealthy and raising the national deficit.”
The bill — endorsed by President Donald Trump, approved by the U.S. House and awaiting action in the Senate — would make permanent the tax cuts that Congress enacted during Trump’s first administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the bill would increase the deficit by more than $2 trillion, even with the spending cuts proposed over the next 10 years.
Kelly said she’s had conversations with Kansas Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and thinks he would vote against cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because “in his core” he knows they “are just wrong, not to mention really bad for the state of Kansas.” But, she said, “because it’s packaged with everything else, I’m afraid he’s going to feel the pressure to stay in the camp and vote with the tribe.”


Moran’s communications director, Angela Lingg, said “the Senate is continuing to negotiate any changes to Medicaid, and Sen. Moran is working to make certain Kansas hospitals are at the forefront of those discussions.”


Republicans are moving the bill through a process called reconciliation that enables them to avoid the Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement and pass the measure with 51 votes.
Beshear criticized Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who reportedly told his GOP Senate colleagues in a private meeting Tuesday that home state constituents who are worried about Medicaid would “get over it.”
Beshear called the comment, reported by Punchbowl News, cruel and callous.
A McConnell spokesman said the former Senate Republican leader was trying to remind his colleagues “that we should all be against waste, fraud and abuse while working to protect our rural hospitals and have safety nets in place for people that need it.”
Beshear said Kentucky’s other U.S. senator, Republican Rand Paul, “has expressed some disagreement with the bill. I wish it was for the right reasons. I wish it was about Kentuckians being hurt, but if he ultimately votes against the bill, then I think that’s a good thing.”
Paul has called for deeper cuts in spending, telling USA Today, “I think the big blowback is if we don’t do something to reduce the deficit we’ll be seen as hypocrites.”
Beshear warned the Medicaid cuts would harm rural economies by shuttering hospitals, killing health care jobs and forcing residents to drive long distances to see a doctor.
Kentucky Hospital Association president and CEO Nancy Galvagni told the Kentucky Lantern on Tuesday that a U.S. Senate committee’s proposal would force Kentucky hospitals to eliminate 20,000 jobs by ending supplemental payments to hospitals that care for large numbers of Medicaid patients.
The taxes on health care providers that fund the supplemental payments are under fire from the Trump administration. Some critics have referred to them as “legalized money laundering” because states use provider tax revenue to pull down additional Medicaid money from the federal government.
Kelly said the provider tax “should be open to discussion” but “thoughtful, deep discussions” are impossible when so many complex issues are steamrolled into one huge piece of legislation.
Beshear said the federal government has recognized provider taxes as a way to ensure that Medicaid reimbursements cover the cost of providing medical services in rural areas, keeping hospitals solvent.
“Red states typically have higher provider taxes than blue states,” he said. “So if they’re suggesting that this is some form of money laundering, which it’s not in any form of that actual legal term, then it’s their own governors that have engaged in it to the largest extent.”
Beshear called on supporters of the bill to be honest about its ramifications. He said it’s meant to “kick people off of Medicaid” not because they’re ineligible but for paperwork mistakes. “Somebody doesn’t check the right box and it kicks them off for six months.”
Kelly referred to the measure as the “Big Beautiful Betrayal Bill.”

A flurry of lawsuits is challenging the Trump administration's “slash-and-burn"" campaign, which axed hundreds of grant programs mid-stream. The White House is fundamentally misinterpreting a short phrase buried in recent regulation, the suits argue, to justify the sweeping cuts.
The post Flurry of lawsuits over Trump cuts hinge on nine words appeared first[...]","THERE WAS NOTHING subtle about the Trump administration’s approach to government spending when Elon Musk waved a chainsaw in front of a crowd of cheering activists at a February gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. The clear message from the face of the new Department of Government Efficiency: This is no delicate pruning exercise but one in which we’re felling entire trees.
The sweeping powers of the presidency give the administration plenty of running room to upend the status quo, but it can’t do that by simply reinterpreting federal laws and regulations. That’s the argument at the heart of a series of lawsuits challenging sweeping cuts to federal grants.
Hundreds of organizations across the country were notified in recent weeks that federal grants they operated – funding everything from anti-violence programs to initiatives to ensure clean drinking water – were being terminated immediately. 
The government authority to abruptly cancel millions of dollars in funding relied on the same boilerplate wording delivered to each grant recipient, usually in a short email: The award “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  
A coalition of state attorneys general that includes Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell filed suit on June 24 against an array of federal offices over the administration’s use of that nine-word phrase. The “nationwide slash-and-burn campaign” rests on a fundamental misinterpretation of a short subclause “buried in federal regulations” put out by the Office of Management of Budget, the attorneys general argue. 
While this clause says that agencies can indeed terminate grants if they no longer “effectuate program goals or agency priorities,” the AGs argue that the Trump administration is fundamentally misinterpreting the meaning of this language. 
The clause does not mean that when an administration changes its priorities that organizations abiding by the terms of their grants are suddenly subjected to having the grants yanked, the complaint argues. Instead, according to the lawsuit, the wording means the grant is subject to termination if it’s determined that the recipient is not meeting the goals set out for the grant program at its inception. 
The regulatory language governing grants was put in place by OMB in 2020, but the suit claims the federal office “never once indicated that the words ‘agency priorities’ would confer broad authority on federal agencies to terminate grants based on new or changed agency priorities.”  
Rather, the suit says, the office focused on establishing program goals at the time that the grant award was made public. In other words, to ensure the continuity of their funding, grant recipients have to do what the grant said they would do. 
Yet, in recent months, programs that have been using money in the way Congress intended in authorizing the spending suddenly saw the rug pulled out from under them.  
“The results have been devastating,” the coalition of mostly blue state attorneys general wrote in their complaint filed this week. “With the stroke of a pen, federal agencies have deprived states of critical funding they rely on to combat violent crime and protect public safety, equip law enforcement, educate students, safeguard public health, protect clean drinking water, conduct life-saving medical and scientific research, address food insecurity experienced by students in school, ensure access to unemployment benefits for workers who lose their jobs, and much more. Federal agencies have done all of this without any advance notice, without any explanation to the state recipients, and in direct contravention of the will of Congress.” 
Massachusetts housing groups, the state Department of Agricultural Resources, forestry services, public health programs, and violence prevention organizations are just some of the groups left reeling from abrupt cuts. 
In a separate suit filed in March, before the recent complaint from state AGs, organizations that fight against discrimination in housing organizations sued to “quite literally keep the lights on.” A US District Court judge in Massachusetts granted a temporary restraining order reinstating 78 Fair Housing Initiatives Program grants. 
These cuts came “arbitrarily and without notice, reason, or sensible explanation,” the housing organizations argued, and suddenly losing the funding would cause immediate and irreparable harm. 
The axe also fell on violence prevention organizations like Chelsea-based Roca, which saw a $6 million grant terminated for not being aligned with the agency priorities. Health Resources in Action, a Boston-based non-profit public health equity organization and one of the five named plaintiffs in a national class action suit, is among a group of community organizations suing the Trump administration for slashing Department of Justice grants because of changed priorities. 
In the suit, which received a hearing in federal court in Washington, DC, on Thursday, the community organization coalition argues that the use of the boilerplate language when the Office of Justice Programs ended more than 370 multi-year agreements and grants was unconstitutionally vague, exceeded the office’s authority, and did not comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. 
The group argues that the idea that the agency has broad discretion to terminate a grant already awarded because of a post-hoc change in agency position is a novel and unacceptable understanding of the grant termination provision.  
It also argues that the cuts are a constitutional violation, bypassing Congress’s appropriations authority and ignoring separation of powers. 
The DOJ is asking to dismiss the suit. The groups, it said, accuse the administration of “blindly terminating various grant agreements ‘en masse’ so that it can avoid spending congressionally appropriated funds,” adding, “These accusations are unfounded and wrong.” 
In the Trump administration’s view, the DOJ reviewed several thousand “competitive, discretionary grants” to assess whether those grants aligned with current agency priorities, deciding to terminate 376 grant agreements. It intends to reallocate those funds to “new projects that more directly advance agency priorities.” 
Along with asking that funds be reinstated, the community groups want an injunction and declaration that the DOJ’s interpretation of the right to terminate a grant based on its alignment with agency priorities is incorrect. 
In the suit filed this week, the attorneys general do not ask to stop any particular grant cut, but rather seek a legal declaration on the meaning of the OMB “priorities” clause. According to the court docket, the government has not yet submitted a response.
The Department of Justice is one of the named defendants and is representing the heads of OMB, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and he National Science Foundation. A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment in an email on Thursday. 
The states and programs in question receive billions of dollars in federal funding each year, the lawsuit asserts. Beyond the funds that the administration has already attempted to cut off, there are ongoing grant programs to which the organizations are planning to apply. 
These attorneys general and the impacted organizations are worried not just about the impacts of the funds already stopped mid-stream, but also the fate of future grant awards.
Indeed, a national fair housing group filed suit on the same day, arguing that “HUD is flouting its obligation to administer a fair housing grant program established and funded by Congress.” The agency is refusing to spend appropriated funds, the lawsuit argues, cutting off its usual grant awards schedule midstream. 
HUD has not awarded any new grants or asked Congress to revoke already approved funds for these new grants, and because any funds that are not assigned by September will expire, the agency’s inaction “risks the complete loss of the appropriated funds.” 
Each of the groups and states bringing the array of lawsuits argue that the damage goes beyond even the significant funding loss, and that they are already feeling the urgency.
Attorney Lisa Newman, representing the violence prevention coalition, told US District Court Judge Amit Mehta on Thursday that the erosion of trust and damage to reputation to these on-the-ground violence prevention groups, built up over decades, “cannot be overstated.” The groups have made promises to community members who will assume that the organizations are backing away from their obligations, she said.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)As many as 40 employees of the Indiana Department of Child Services could lose their jobs under a reorganization eliminating three layers of management, which agency leaders said would improve communication and decision-making.
The agency protecting Hoosier children from abuse and neglect announced the changes Friday. They go into effect July 1.
  Department of Child Services Director Adam Krupp
DCS Director Adam Krupp said the layoffs won’t put children at risk because “these are not the folks on the front line.”
Instead, the employees are part of middle and upper management that Krupp is reducing so that family case managers have a more direct line to authority. Between 16 and 40 employees could be laid off, depending on if some accept new lower-paying positions.
“This is going to reduce the opportunity for communication breakdowns and it’s going to reduce the delay in decision-making,” he said. “I very much believe this will improve our outcomes in terms of focusing on child safety and working closely with families, whether it be on the prevention side or the intervention side.”
The behemoth agency has more than 4,040 employees, with almost 1,800 family case managers who handle daily interactions with children and families.
“All Hoosier children deserve a safe place to lay their head at night, and our most vulnerable kids often need an extra layer of security. Things are not working as well as they should at DCS, but we are going to change that,” said Gov. Mike Braun. “With this entrepreneurial plan, we will remove layers of inefficient middle management and bureaucracy and instead redirect resources to frontline services like foster care and family case workers to keep kids safe.”
It is estimated the state could save between $4 million and $8 million from restructuring – dubbed Project Awaken — but that money could also be redirected to child safety efforts.
DCS Regions before and after
 
Krupp talked with the ICC and went through the nine layers of employees currently in the agency, from him all the way down to family case managers. The reorganization will eliminate a level of assistant deputy directors and several others.
The state will also move from 18 different regions — each with its own manager — to five. The agency said it looked at caseloads, square mileage and staff to help determine the regions, generally aligning with a central region and four quadrants.
He noted that these regions had slowly developed their own microcultures, or 18 different ways of doing things. The streamlining will result in more consistent policies.
“Executive management, right now, we are too far removed from a family case manager, and that’s not because of geographical distance. That’s simply because of all the layers of communication, information flow and decision-making,” Krupp said.

He added the state will continue to hire family case managers, noting it’s a constant cycle of turnover and training.
“It never really stops,” Krupp said.
He said currently the agency needs between 175 and 195 more family case managers to meet statutory caseload ratios. DCS has long struggled with retention due to the stress of the job and the three months needed for training.
There was a brief move during the General Assembly session to eliminate those caseload rules, but Krupp said that is not a priority. He said lawmakers considered giving the agency more flexibility.
As part of the restructuring, the legal division will also be aligned under the new regions and work more as a co-leader with regional directors. Financial and budgeting efforts have been centralized so that there is more visibility into day-to-day spending. DCS has regularly overspent its appropriation in the state budget.
Krupp added that work toward reorganization started during the transition period after the November election. The agency in May announced new mission, vision and purpose statements and this is the second phase of reorganization.

Rodgers Health Center will provide doula services to maternity patients (Suzanne King/The Beacon).When Tristin Dockery was in labor with her first son in 2021, she only had one request: To get up and walk around her hospital room.
The nurse on duty said no.
So Dockery, then 20, stayed in her uncomfortable hospital bed as one contraction followed another. It was at the height of COVID. She and her husband were alone. And Dockery didn’t think she had much choice but to do as she was told.
“We were young and we’d never had a baby,” she said. “We didn’t know what we were doing.”
Dockery, an esthetician who works and lives 50 miles east of Kansas City in Lexington, was determined that things would be different last year when she learned she was pregnant again. She turned to the Maternal and Infant Health Center (MaIH) in Lexington.
The organization provided a doula who helped Dockery through her pregnancy and the first months after she gave birth.
“I had someone who was going to be there,” Dockery said, “who was going to help me focus on what I needed and what I wanted.”
On June 26, Altruism Inc., the nonprofit that runs the MaIH Center in Lexington, will open a second center. This one is in Kansas City’s urban Westside neighborhood.
The new Kansas City center, opening in partnership with Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center, will share space with the health center’s maternity care clinic at 2121 Summit St. and be called the MaIH Center at Sam Rodgers.
Putting doula care and other nonclinical support services in the same space with maternal health is an effort to remove a potential barrier that could keep expectant parents from getting all the services they need, said Janelle Harvey Jordan, chief operating officer at the Samuel Rodgers center.
“We’re trying to help mothers by having everything in one area,” Jordan said. Offering doula services provides “an avenue for new moms to have better outcomes.”
 What is a doula?

Doulas don’t provide medical care, but they establish relationships with patients and answer questions, give advice and offer support. They also advocate for patients, helping them communicate with their medical provider.
Studies show that the extra attention and education significantly boosts maternal outcomes, lowering the risk of cesarean deliveries by 47% and cutting the chance of preterm deliveries by 29%. Doulas also improve by 46% the rate at which new parents show up for postpartum medical checkups.
Once considered a perk only for those who could afford it, doulas are increasingly seen as an important tool in the effort to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce pregnancy-related deaths in poor and underserved communities.
In fact, last year Medicaid programs in both Missouri and Kansas began covering doula services. In its emergency rule granting the coverage last fall, Missouri’s Department of Social Services cited “an immediate danger to public health, safety or welfare of pregnant women in Missouri” as the reason doula services should be covered.
It is one of the changes Missouri’s Medicaid program has made in recent years to try to improve the state’s concerning maternal mortality rate.
According to data collected by KFF, a health policy research organization, Missouri’s maternal mortality rate between 2018 and 2022 was 24 deaths per 100,000 live births, and Kansas’ was 23 deaths per 100,000 live births. For the United States overall, the rate was 23.
But in Missouri the pregnancy-related mortality rate was three times worse for Black people than for white people. And in Kansas, more than half of pregnancy-related deaths were people who identified as racial and ethnic minorities.
In both states, pregnancy mortality reviews found that most deaths related to pregnancy were preventable.
According to the March of Dimes, more than 20% of Missouri infants were born to people who did not get adequate prenatal care. And in Kansas, the organization found that almost 17% of infants were born to people who didn’t get adequate prenatal care.
 Balancing the scales

Tonia Wright, Altruism’s CEO, is confident that making doula care available to more expectant parents will mean that more people get the care they need, and that will help balance the scales.
“In Missouri, a woman who is covered by Medicaid is seven times more likely to have a pregnancy-associated death,” Wright said. “By allowing doulas to bill for their services, it’s leveling the playing field between Medicaid-covered pregnant people and privately insured pregnant people.”
Wright, whose marketing firm, Grace Advertising & Consulting Inc., has long advised health care organizations, decided after the pandemic to form a nonprofit to help smaller health-related organizations. At first she thought she would help them with marketing and advocacy. But then she saw an even greater need and decided to tackle health disparities directly.
“The statistics in Missouri about maternal and infant health were just landing hard,” she said. “COVID had ripped the veil and really laid bare what was happening, especially for poor white women, Black women and Hispanic women. I could not escape the research studies, the news stories. So I pivoted.”
That’s when she founded the MaIH Center in Lexington.
It offers doulas for free to clients without insurance. The Kansas City center will do the same.
People who have doula care tend to have better outcomes, Wright said, because their needs are more likely met. Someone with access to government food assistance and regular health checkups — services a doula might help set up for a client — is less likely to have gestational diabetes, pregnancy-related high blood pressure and even postpartum depression. Those are all leading causes of maternal deaths.
Dockery said her doula, Shariah Edwards, helped her deal with severe morning sickness, which lasted her entire second pregnancy. She helped Dockery write a birth plan, so when she went into labor her wishes about medication and other things would already be in her medical chart.
And Edwards was with Dockery at the hospital for her labor and delivery, making sure her plan was followed. After Dockery’s second son was born, Edwards stayed by her side, Dockery said, helping her deal with postpartum depression.
“She came to my house,” she said. “She watched the baby so I could take a nap. She offered to help me clean up. And she really just sat with me a lot and talked through it all.”
 Doulas aren’t new to Sam Rodgers

Doulas are not new to the maternity care the Samuel Rodgers center provides. The community health clinic, a federally qualified health clinic, participated in a program funded by UnitedHealthcare to encourage new approaches to prenatal and postpartum care.
The center experimented with multicultural outreach campaigns, emphasized screenings to identify patients facing social barriers to care and offered patients help signing up for Medicaid, government food aid and other community programs.
The result, according to a UnitedHealthcare blog post, was a 30% increase in behavioral health and dental care for obstetric patients, a 3.6% improvement in full-term births and a 90% improvement in people showing up for postnatal care appointments.
And in 2023, the Samuel Rodgers center received a $2 million grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration to continue this work, which included offering doula care.
The health center’s new partnership with Altruism is helping extend that work again. It’s not hard to find benefits to giving patients the extra support a doula provides, said Bob Theis, Sam Rodgers’ chief executive officer.
Helping a pregnant person maintain a healthy pregnancy not only makes that birthing person healthier, it makes their new baby healthier.
“Having a good prenatal care program results in healthy birth weight babies and healthy birth weight babies bring stronger children into the world,” Theis said.
And caring for a baby at a healthy weight can cost a fraction of what it takes to care for a baby who comes into the world early or underweight. Theis said a low birth-weight baby’s care might cost 10 times more than a baby born at a healthy weight.
At least by the measure of birth weight, Sam Rodgers’ efforts to promote and improve prenatal care are paying off. Theis said the center’s percentage of low birth-weight babies fell to 5.5% in 2024 from 8% four years earlier.
Extending doula care by partnering with Altruism, he said, will add to that success.
“We’re building healthy kids in our community,” Theis said, “because one day I’m going to retire, and I want to make sure that we’re building a strong community of strong children to take care of me when I’m ready.”

Laura Kelly, left, and Kansas Department of Labor secretary Amber Shultz, right, announce the launch of the state's new online unemployment system Nov. 22, 2024, at the Statehouse in Topeka. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas program aimed at preventing unemployment fraud has been caught in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
The U.S. Department of Labor in May canceled $400 million in unemployment insurance grants across the country. Included within the grant funding was language that the Trump administration associated with DEI initiatives, such as studying the “equity of the unemployment system” and an “equitable access director.”
A spokesperson for the department said the cuts were “part of the administration’s ongoing effort to remove unlawful DEI programs across government.”
But at the Kansas Department of Labor, the rescission didn’t eliminate any DEI programs.
Instead, it defunded a program that implemented identity verification tools, fraud analytics and safeguards to prevent criminal attacks and system failures, which were crucial in the wake of record volumes of fraudulent claims during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Amber Shultz, Kansas labor secretary, wrote a letter Thursday to U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, expressing her “deep concern and disappointment” over the federal government’s decision, which she called “both confusing and contradictory.”
“The rationale of canceling a grant specifically intended to detect and prevent fraud is, frankly, counterproductive,” Shultz said in the letter.
Kansas forfeited $1 million of the $1.7 million total without forewarning.
“Revoking this support now leaves states more vulnerable to the very threats we were all called to confront,” Shultz said.
She called the funding loss “a huge blow,” and said she anticipates that employers and claimants will feel the impacts, which could mean slower claims processes.
The termination notice the state received from the federal government reasoned that the grant “no longer effectuates the department’s priorities for its grant funding.”
Communication between the state and federal departments has been nonexistent. Shultz said in a phone call that she and department staff have been attempting to communicate with the federal department, without any response.
A statement to Kansas Reflector attributed to a U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said America’s unemployment system is in an “infrastructure crisis, riddled with waste, fraud and abuse.”
The statement said the Biden administration squandered its opportunity to fix the system by focusing “on equitable access rather than advancing access for all Americans in need.”
Shultz said none of the funding for Kansas’ unemployment insurance fraud prevention grant program was used for DEI initiatives.
The federal department is fulfilling its goal, Shultz said, “if they want fraudsters to have equitable access to our funds.”
A different grant from the U.S. Department of Labor under the Biden administration, called the equity grant, gave Kansas more than $4.5 million, which the state used to ensure all Kansans could access the unemployment system. That meant focusing on rural Kansans without broadband access, Shultz said.
With the federal funding, the state fraud prevention program was able to conduct investigations and recover funds lost to fraudulent claims. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kansas and many other states faced extreme volumes of unemployment fraud, largely from international crime rings, which took advantage of aged and vulnerable claims systems. Kansas recently recovered $11 million in fraudulent claims, which totaled around 2.4% of the $460 million in state and federal funds lost during the pandemic.
The federal department’s Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office have pressed states across the country to improve fraud prevention and recovery efforts.
“Yet now we are asked to do so with fewer tools, fewer resources, and diminished federal partnership,” Shultz said in the letter to Chavez-DeRemer. “That not only undermines the substantial progress already made, but it also weakens our readiness for future crises.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/241122_unempP-01-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-27 10:01:53.693125

Mike Dunleavy has canceled a bipartisan proposal that would have allowed rural school districts to maintain teacher housing with money from the state’s rural schools fund.
House Bill 174, from Rep. Robyn Niayuq Burke, D-Utqiagvik, passed the House and Senate by a combined 54-5-1 margin.
The vote count led lawmakers to raise the possibility of overriding the veto.
Burke, reached by phone on Thursday, said that when she heard about the veto, she immediately sent a text to the group chat shared by members of the House’s coalition majority.
“The response was, yes, let’s override,” she said.
It would take 40 votes from the 60 members of the combined House and Senate to override the governor’s decision on HB 174, and a vote isn’t expected until the Legislature convenes in January.
If enacted, HB 174 would allow small school districts to use the state’s Regional Educational Attendance Area fund for major maintenance at district-owned housing.
It would also allow Mount Edgecumbe High School, the state-operated boarding school in Sitka, to use the fund for major maintenance. Currently, the high school is maintained using funds from the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities.
HB 174 also would remove a $70 million cap on the size of the REAA fund, allowing the Legislature to stock that account with more money.
In his veto message to the Legislature, the governor said that enacting HB 174 would diminish the equity across school districts “and commits the state to a local housing obligation, diverting already scarce dollars away from critical classroom repairs and complicating grant rankings.”
The message also said that the repeal of the cash cap on the REAA fund could allow general-purpose dollars to accumulate “without project deadlines and adding ongoing operating costs to the state.”
That latter comment is a reference to the bill’s fiscal note, which said that the state would have to hire two new employees to deal with the change and that there would be other costs associated with implementing HB 174.
Burke said the veto wasn’t a surprise and that the governor’s legislative office had tried to reach her about the bill, but that meeting didn’t take place before the legislative session ended.
Burke is a graduate of Mount Edgecumbe, as is her mother, grandmother and grandfather. Other lawmakers, including Sen. Donny Olson, D-Golovin, have tried to advance HB 174-like legislation in prior legislative sessions, without success.
In 2024, a similar bill passed the Senate but died in the House Finance Committee. 
“There’s a lot of excitement about it,” Burke said.
“I’m sure they’re pretty disappointed,” she said of the bill’s advocates, “because they’ve been working on that for quite a while. I’m frustrated, disappointed, not surprised, and will look forward to overriding it.”
Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, is a longtime advocate for Mount Edgecumbe. The Beacon’s call about the veto was the first he had heard of it, “but it doesn’t surprise me,” he said.
Stedman said that while it’s possible that the Legislature could override the governor’s decision, doing so is tough, “because the governor runs blocking maneuvers — no matter who the governor is, that’s just business, right? So it’s easy for him to pick off a few votes.”
It’s also a rural issue, which adds to the difficulty of gaining support, Stedman said.
The veto is “unfortunate for Edgecumbe,” Stedman said, “but there’ll be another governor in a year and a half, and we’ll give it to the next governor.”
So far this year, Dunleavy has vetoed five policy bills in addition to his line-item budget vetoes. Since taking office in December 2018, Dunleavy has vetoed 14 policy bills, a low number by historical standards.
But since 2014, the number of bills passed by the Legislature has dwindled, legislative statistics show. As a proportion of the number of bills passed by lawmakers, Dunleavy is vetoing at an above-average rate when compared to prior governors.

June 20, 2025. | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceFor more than a century the Joseph A. Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan has been home to a wide collection of materials documenting social unrest, protest, and various movements that were at a time considered radical. 
Referred to in the 1930s as “probably the most complete record of the social unrest of our times that has ever been assembled,” the collection holds books, periodicals, pamphlets, recordings of speeches and protest songs and other artifacts from movements including anarchism, feminism, labor, civil rights and anti-colonialism. 
Housed in the university’s Special Collections Research Center, the Labadie Collection is also home to one of the largest and most heavily-used stores of transgender history in the country.
While the university already boasted a strong collection of materials on trans history in 2000, that collection would be bolstered considerably through a donation from the National Transgender Library and Archives, which began as the collection of Dallas Denny.
A search for identity and information
“I knew I was transsexual by the time I was 12 or 13 and I remember the summer before I started the ninth grade. My father had retired from the Army, and we moved to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and I pedaled my bicycle to the library there and looked up every word I knew, which was very little,” Denny said.

She found two books. 
“One of them was in reserve, which meant I’d have to ask the librarian for it because I was just 13, and I was unwilling to do that because I felt like she would probably get in touch with my parents and my life would be over,” Denny said. 
The other was in circulation, but Denny was unable to find it on the shelves. Last she checked, after graduating from high school, it still was not available. 
“I was looking for information all through college and just not finding anything, you know, [an] occasional article in a magazine or something, but nowhere to go for help, nowhere to go for information, nowhere to go for support,” Denny said. 
After completing graduate school in 1979, Denny discovered there was a gender clinic at Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville, where she lived at the time. 
“I went there, and they turned me down, they turned down most people, but on the grounds that, essentially, I was not dysfunctional enough to be transsexual because I had two college degrees, because I worked as a child protective services worker for the state of Tennessee, because I was sexually attracted to women, because I had been married,” Denny said.  
Upon visiting the medical library, their material backed up the hospital’s findings, because those materials were generated by the clinics, Denny said. 
Denny later found a group for heterosexual crossdressers. While they did not allow trans members, Denny joined, holding her breath in hopes that they would be in touch with someone with information about her identity. 
After about five months, a member came in with a magazine called Transgender Tapestry, which held a support group in Atlanta. 
“They gave me information I’ve been looking for my whole life,” Denny said. 

Shhh, NTL&A, V. 2 No. 0, in AEGIS News No. 3 
After she was recruited to help run the support group in 1988, which she did for a year, Denny went on to found the American Educational Gender Information Service, or AEGIS in 1990, publishing pamphlets, medical bulletins and a magazine, while providing services including a 24-hour trans help line.
“My reasoning was, you know, if I am well educated and I am smart and I am literate and I couldn’t find information, how many other people are out there in a similar situation?” Denny said. 
The ‘90s was largely a print culture, Denny said, and she was exchanging newsletters with more than 100 other organizations around the world. Publishers would send her books, and whenever she’d attend a trans conference, Denny said she’d buy everything that was for sale. 
While she’d started with zero information about her identity, Denny’s collection would go on to fill two big rooms in the house she was renting. 
“I started realizing that, you know, the history of people like me was pretty much scattered through history and mostly lost, and there seemed to be little interest in rediscovering that history,” Denny said, noting that she founded another group, the Transgender Historical Society. 
Denny donated her collection of materials to AEGIS in 1993, marking the start of the National Transgender Library and Archives, however, the advent of the internet would mark the decline of brick and mortar nonprofits like Denny’s. 
While people would previously write in requesting information, receiving a response a week or two later, the internet had rendered that model obsolete, Denny said. Now individuals could share information with a wide audience for almost no cost. 
AEGIS transitioned away from a paper and stamp organization into one based on the internet, rebranding as Gender Education and Advocacy in 1998. However, that left the question of what to do with the organization’s considerable print collection.

Finding a new home for the archive
Ultimately, the organization put out a request for proposals to house the materials on January 13, 2000 and received a number proposals, which Denny said came down to two finalists: The University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan. 
As part of the criteria for applicants, Denny said the materials had to be stored in a physically and intellectually safe location, which had secured funding for the foreseeable future.
While the University of Minnesota had a long history of working with trans people, Denny said the University of Michigan was selected due to the Labadie Collection’s focus on social movements that were often unpopular. 
“I felt like it would be intellectually secure there, and it wouldn’t be reinterpreted as a gay and lesbian history instead of a trans history,” Denny said. 
It also helped that the University of Michigan had a building to house the materials, while Minnesota did not.

Labadie Collection)






 
Prior to acquiring the National Transgender Library and Archives, the Joseph A. Labadie collection already held a multitude of materials on transgender movements due to its strong LGBT collection, Curator Julie Herrada told the Michigan Advance.
When the call for proposals went out, Gender Education and Advocacy board member Sandra Cole, a professor who founded the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Gender Services Program, recommended the university apply. 
On taking a deeper look at the materials, Herrada realized the collection spanned a number of topics from medical materials on surgery and psychology to items on public health, law and cultural materials tied to LGBTQ movements. While the collection was too large to take into the Labadie Collection, Herrada said she’d gathered other units and staff within the library system and asked about working together to collect the materials and house them within their relevant departments. 
“Surprisingly, everybody was really on board with it and said that they would also make it a priority for access so it wouldn’t sit uncatalogued for however many years,” Herrada said. 
Upon collecting letters from the community to submit alongside her proposal to Gender Education Advocacy, Herrada found an outpouring of support. 
“That was real eye opening for me that there was this whole community of people out there that were advocating not only for the trans community, but for us to have this, create the space for this collection, and to maybe make it grow,” Herrada said. 
After making her case to the head of the library on the logistical matters needed to process, catalog in addition to transporting the materials from Atlanta, Georgia to Michigan, Herrada said the obvious support from the community made their case much stronger. 
Herrada oversaw the packing and shipping of the materials from their home in Atlanta to their new location in Ann Arbor, in September 2000, and on March 25, 2004 the university held a dedication of the National Transgender Library and Archives with Denny as the guest of honor.

While the original collection has long since been fully cataloged, Herrada says Denny still regularly sends them materials to add to their holdings. 
With the acquisition of the National Transgender Library and Archives in 2000 and the university’s previous holdings, Herrada said the collection has seen individuals traveling from across the world to utilize its holdings. While other universities have collected materials on transgender people, U of M was one of the first, she said. 
Having these materials available to individuals from across the globe fulfills both Denny’s personal mission of providing people with information to make sane decisions about their lives, while preserving a rich history Denny said she would hate to see lost.
Additionally, the University of Michigan was the first institution to partner with the Digital Transgender Archive, Herrada said, with Denny sending materials to the archive first for scanning, before the materials are passed on to the Labadie Collection. 
While most libraries require individuals to put in a request to view archived materials, Denny, who serves on the archive’s board, said the Digital Transgender Archive serves as a way for people to have easy access to information on trans life and history. 
Holding the line amid national backlash
Over the years, many of the movements documented within the Labadie collection have become more mainstream, Herrada noted, pointing to the growing acceptance of lesbian, gay and bisexual individuals since they began collecting materials on those communities. 
“I don’t know if I could say that we’re sort of at the forefront for making these movements more mainstream and more accepted and more accessible, but that’s part of the plan, I think,” Herrada said. “We need to have access to this material, because a lot of it is inaccessible otherwise.”
As the federal government takes aim at several marginalized groups throughout the nation under the guise of opposing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, Herrada said it’s more important than ever to dig in their heels and to not only maintain, but strengthen the commitment to having these materials available. 
While the Labadie Collection has not faced any threats to its holdings on transgender individuals, Herrada said there have been some discussions around being more aware and tightening security on materials given the national climate. 
Denny shared her own concerns about holdings at other institutions, noting that the previously-independent Kinsey Institute, which holds a vast collection of materials on human sexuality, had merged with Indiana University. With Indiana state law barring the university from using state funds for the institute and the university board facing a conservative takeover, Denny expects further attacks on the institute’s funding, raising concern that institute’s materials may be less accessible in the future. 
  Rep. Lorissa Sweet, R-Wabash introduced the amendment to strip public funding for the Kinsey Institute during a hearing on the state budget in February 2023. (Screenshot of annual report.)
While she’s a bit concerned about the University of Michigan, due to the University’s decision to eliminate its diversity equity and inclusion office and halt work on its DEI 2.0 strategic plan, Denny held greater concern for the Kinsey Institute.
In addition to threats at the university level, local libraries have become a battleground as conservative groups seek to ban or sequester materials with LGBTQ+ themes. 
Alongside the University of Michigan, Denny has supplied materials to the University of Victoria in British Columbia’s transgender archives and other collections documenting trans history.
Denny noted she didn’t want all transgender materials centralized in one location due to the possibility of war or natural disaster and that she was glad there were a number of places to access these materials alongside those that had been digitized and were available online.
“Transgender people are, and probably were, and probably still are, famous for purging. They’re like, ‘I can’t be like this.’ And they’ll get rid of everything and often they just throw it in the trash or burn it,” Denny said, noting that a lot of times materials people were looking to get rid of would appear at conferences.
Now, unlike when she was 13, there is a wealth of material for trans individuals, Denny said. 
“All it was really about in all of my work was for people to have information, to make competent decisions about their lives, because if you know nothing you can’t do that” she said.

A year after the U.S. Supreme Court granted cities more authority to clear homeless encampments, how much has California’s homelessness crisis changed? 
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains — along with Lisa Halverstadt from Voice of San Diego and Aaron Schrank from LAist — the landmark Grants Pass v. Johnson ruling allowing local authorities to arrest unhoused people for sleeping in public spaces has empowered cities across California to ramp up efforts to sweep encampments, or pass more punitive anti-camping rules.
In Los Angeles for example, the police department made 68% more camping arrests in the second half of 2024 (after the court ruling), compared to the first. But last March, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency found that while 94% of people targeted under the camping ordinance wanted shelter, only 17% were able to secure it.
That includes Deadra Walicki, a 51-year-old unhoused person living near Van Nuys Boulevard in L.A.’s San Fernando Valley. In a span of 16 months — from August 2023 through December 2024 — the LAPD cited Walicki 34 times for illegal camping.
Walicki, for the most part, ignores the citations because she has neither the money to pay the fines nor a phone to contact her case manager. She lives in an encampment with her male partner, and says she wants both of them to be admitted into separate gender-segregated shelters at the same time. This, however, hasn’t happened yet.

Walicki: “The cops come here Monday through Friday and give tickets for being in the zone of the shelter. It’s whatever they want to do.”

L.A. isn’t the only city where citations for camping and other homelessness-related offenses soared shortly after Grants Pass. After filing more than 100 public records requests, Marisa found that in San Francisco, arrests and citations increased 500%, and in San Diego and Sacramento, arrests and citations doubled and tripled, respectively.

Cutting research funds, cutting forests

Let’s dive into some federal news affecting California:

Restoring research funding: On Monday federal judges issued rulings to restore hundreds of science research grants, including about 430 in California, which President Donald Trump’s administration initially canceled earlier this year as part of an effort to cut funding for programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion. The frozen funds affected research related to, among other things: dementia, vaccines and health disparities among women and the LGBTQ+ community. The administration has filed appeals for some of the rulings, and it remains unclear when the money will be restored. Read more from CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.


Removing forest protections: The Trump administration said it plans to rescind a rule developed under the Clinton administration that could result in the lifting of bans on logging and road construction within parts of national forests, including more than 4 million acres throughout California. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture said this would prevent fires, but some experts argue that timber harvesting may actually promote more flammable fuels in forests.

Banning ultra-processed food from school meals?

The state Senate is considering a bill that would get rid of food containing chemical additives — such as stabilizers, coloring and flavoring agents — in school meals by 2035.
As CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang explains, the proposal by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel has strong bipartisan support, and aligns with both Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to limit the harms of ultra-processed foods, and the federal administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign.

Gabriel, an Encino Democrat: “Even though Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much, one of the things they can agree on is this common sense notion that we should be protecting our kids.”

But a coalition of food and beverage manufacturers and other business groups oppose the measure, arguing that it makes consumers inaccurately perceive all ultra-processed food as unsafe. Pizza, for example, has ingredients such as dough conditioners and stabilizers to keep them shelf stable.

Dennis Albiani, a coalition spokesperson and president of Capitol Advocates lobbying firm: “Healthy products are going to be pulled in and labeled as ultra-processed, which in the lexicon of America means dangerous and unhealthy.”

California could lose votes in the electoral college and suffer economic setbacks if President Trump’s immigration crackdown deters people from moving to the state.


It hasn’t happened yet, but California is bracing for a demographic and economic hit under President Donald Trump’s multi-pronged effort to limit the entry of people born abroad and deport those already in the U.S.
In fact, during the last Trump administration, California’s population declined in part because immigration to the state slowed down after the White House put up increased obstacles to enter the U.S., according to the state’s chief demographer, though COVID-19 didn’t help. The Newsom administration is worried about history repeating itself enough to cite Trump’s immigration policies as an economic risk in the state budget forecasts.
Key business sectors, including hospitality and construction, rely on the labor of workers in the U.S. without legal authorization, who themselves are a small portion of California’s immigrant population. The state’s leading tech companies, major drivers of state wealth, overwhelmingly employ highly educated people born abroad.And all these people help California maintain its population and its status as the state with the most electoral college votes during presidential elections.A full third of the state’s prime working-age population is made up of immigrants, including immigrants in the country without authorization. That latter group represents roughly a tenth of the state’s workers, said Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at UC Davis who studies the economic impact of immigrants. And despite popular rhetoric, California workers living here without legal authorization fill jobs that few legal residents want.
Most of the undocumented workers in California have been here for a long time — an average of 15 years, Peri said.“They have family and they have kids who are American citizens normally,” Peri said. “So these are people very well integrated in the economy of California.”
More than a quarter of the state’s population was born abroad; double the national average. Nearly half of California’s children were born to an immigrant parent and more than half of California’s immigrants are naturalized U.S. citizens.
Plus, California’s immigrant community is diverse: 49% are originally from Latin American countries and 41% from Asia. For the past decade, more immigrants from Asia came to California than from Latin America.After Trump directed a pause in immigration raids at farms, hotels and restaurants two weeks ago, days later he doubled down again on those industries and targeted major cities in a social media post.“We must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside. These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center,” he wrote.A large business group, the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, released a statement this month that said it’s “deeply concerned by recent enforcement actions that have disrupted the well-being of our communities, compromised public safety, and threatened the stability of our local economy.”Here are three ways an immigration crackdown could affect California.
Congressional seats and the electoral college
California is on track to lose at least one more congressional seat after the U.S. Census counts all the residents in the country in 2030 — and Trump’s policies on legal and illegal immigration could further erode the state’s electoral college dominance.For much of the last three decades, more residents in California have moved to other states than out-of-state residents have moved to California. But the overall population loss to out-migration is offset by the sheer number of immigrants attracted to California. Though the trend has slowed down lately, the state is home to the largest number of immigrants in the country — about a fifth of the total U.S. immigrant population.
“If that immigration stops, then that’s going to have some real consequences for our population growth and ultimately for our representation, for sure,” said Eric McGhee, a demographer and politics researcher at the Public Policy Institute of California.
By representation, he means both the number of House seats California is apportioned after the census and, by extension, the number of electoral college votes the state is given (which is calculated by adding a state’s House seats and U.S. Senate seats).
Because Congress capped the number of House members to 435 nearly a century ago, a state basically needs to grow its population at a higher rate than the national average to gain seats. California didn’t do that in the previous decade; as a result, it lost a House seat for the first time in state history in 2021. 
The electoral math concerning immigration in national elections is nuanced, though. People in the U.S. without legal authorization are counted in the U.S. Census. So, if Trump’s immigration raids lead to a large decline of people in the country without proper legal status, that affects California’s overall population. But Florida and Texas, the largest states that now regularly support Republican candidates in presidential elections, also have large numbers of people without proper legal status.California has an estimated 1.8 million here without authorization, down a million from a decade ago. Texas has 1.6 million and Florida 1.2 million. That means those states have a slightly larger percentage of people here without proper legal status than California, according to tallies by the Pew Research Center.But those states are also domestic net-migration winners; they gain more people from out of state than they lose to other states.One major reason California loses so many people is the high cost of housing. McGhee says high living costs are also increasingly a drag on the state’s attractiveness to new international arrivals.Bottomline, “if you’re interfering with immigration flows to California, that’s going to hurt the state’s growth,” said McGhee. “Unless we can somehow start to attract people back to the state  from other states and reverse that out-migration.”But “that doesn’t seem likely to happen anytime soon,” he added. 
California relies on undocumented labor
Workers without proper legal status “have allowed the economy of California to grow in many sectors,” Peri said. They work in fields that U.S. legal residents generally don’t want, either because they have higher levels of education, want higher incomes or have retired.A report released last week by UC Merced and the business-focused think tank Bay Area Council Economic Institute estimated that removing all undocumented immigrants from California would decrease economic activity by $275 billion, or 9% of the state’s GDP. That figure includes both direct labor by undocumented workers and the economic output generated by their and their employer businesses’ spending. 
In construction, mass deportations would curb GDP by 16%, and in agriculture, 14%, the report’s authors found. Undocumented immigrants make up more than a quarter of the workforce in both industries. 
They also found about 11% of the state’s small business owners are undocumented, as well as about 700,000 of the state’s homeowners — about a third of the state’s undocumented population.

“Most of this population has very deep and longstanding ties to the state of California,” said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. “They’re really embedded in our economy, both in dollars and cents and institutional knowledge” on job sites.Three-quarters of U.S. registered voters — including 59% who backed Trump — said they agreed that immigrants without proper authorization mostly fill jobs that American citizens don’t want, The Pew Research Center reported in 2024.
California adults without legal authorization work at much higher rates than the overall workforce. Around 85% of California adults without authorization to stay in the country work, Peri said; the comparable figure for the state’s overall working age population is around 62%.“They don’t have access to any of the welfare support that a citizen will have, because they are undocumented, and so the only source of income for them is really work,” Peri said. That’s in spite of the fact that they contribute billions of dollars in tax revenue to local, state and federal governments, according to the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
If Trump’s immigration raids and deportation efforts force these workers to leave, “companies will start leaving California because they cannot find the construction workers, the farm workers; hotel and hospitality will become smaller because you don’t have this type of worker,” said Peri. And companies are limited by how much more they can pay workers to attract new employees before the price of their goods exceeds what buyers can afford. That affects U.S.-born workers and legal residents, as well, who’d have fewer job openings as companies stall their growth plans.
But undocumented immigrants’ concentration in low-wage industries has also made them vulnerable. State labor officials have found undocumented immigrants to be particularly at risk of wage theft and other exploitation, and have focused their enforcement efforts in industries that disproportionately employ such workers such as car washes, garment factories and janitorial services. 
How immigrants drive California’s economy
Peri said that when we talk about immigration overall, there’s an even larger positive effect on the economy, since half of recent immigrants are college-educated and so are big players in founding companies and helping lead California in science and technology.“And so the wage impact of immigration in total, there is no evidence that is depressing wages,” he said.An immigration crackdown may prompt a growing number of would-be or recent immigrants to reconsider California or the U.S., said experts with the California Department of Finance, a state agency in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office.
They might be thinking, “why am I going to invest and build something in California or the United States?” said Somjita Mitra, chief economist in the forecasting division of the Department of Finance.Case in point: two-thirds of Silicon Valley workers were born abroad, according to a 2025 report by Joint Venture Silicon Valley. Tech companies and the high compensation they pay workers are a chief source of state revenue for California.There’s evidence that Trump’s policies slows down immigration to California. In the 2015-16 fiscal year, about 211,000 immigrants moved to California, according to data from the Department of Finance. By 2018-19, a couple of years into Trump’s first term but before the COVID-19 pandemic, that figure drops to 159,000 individuals.“Some of it is slowing down what’s happening at foreign embassies, making them come multiple times for multiple vetting sessions, slowing their processing down,” said Walter Schwarm, the finance department’s chief demographer.The figure rebounded in the latter half of Joe Biden’s presidency to more than 220,000 new international arrivals. It does not include immigrants without proper legal status.

And the vast majority of immigrants are between the ages of 28 and 40, “so they really form a core of the labor force,” he added, especially as more U.S.-born Californians retire.The country lost out on at least $335 billion in economic growth because of a slowdown in foreign-born workers between 2016 and 2022, a period that includes Trump’s first term and the COVID-19 pandemic, found Madeline Zavodny, an economist who wrote a 2024 paper for the National Foundation for American Policy.Trump’s immigration sweeps and the fear they induce are also prompting immigrants to shop and spend less, which is a drain on the economy. “If there’s a lot of uncertainty, if there’s a lot of confusion, it kind of makes people not want to go out and spend their money,” Mitra said.“The fact of the matter is, a lot of the revenue that is being generated, and a lot of the economic growth that is being generated in this country … is coming from the contributions of legal immigrants,” Schwarm said.Asked if she’s worried Trump’s immigration policies will have a detrimental effect on California’s economy, Mitra said “yes, I am worried about that.”

About 1 in 4 transgender people live in states with some form of bathroom restrictions, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research group that tracks LGBTQ+-related legislation.
So far this year, at least eight states have passed new transgender bathroom laws or expanded existing ones.
In March, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a pair of Republican-sponsored bills restricting the use of bathrooms and locker rooms in public buildings.
The House bill requires public school students and anyone in a government building to use the bathroom or locker room corresponding with their sex assigned at birth, regardless of their gender identity, appearance or the gender on their legal documents. The Senate’s bill, which requires public school students to use facilities that align with their sex at birth, was introduced after a local school board called on lawmakers to restrict bathroom use.
SC senators approve K-12 mandate that ‘a boy will use the boys’ bathroom’

Wyoming Republican Rep. Martha Lawley, who sponsored the House bill along with another one restricting transgender girls’ participation in sports, called them “commonsense measures.”
“As the first state to grant women the right to vote, we showed the nation that Wyoming leads when it comes to equal opportunity,” Lawley wrote in an op-ed she published online ahead of the legislative session. “Now, we can lead again, ensuring our daughters and granddaughters can pursue their dreams with the same sense of fairness and security.”
Earlier in the session, a local Wyoming basketball coach who is a transgender woman spoke against the bill because she said it would require her to share a restroom with teenage boys, WyoFile reported.
Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota and West Virginia have also passed or expanded similar bathroom laws this year.
South Carolina renewed its K-12 bathroom law this year as part of the state budget. The mandate — initially inserted into the budget last year during the Senate’s floor debate — applies to multi-stalled school restrooms and places where students undress, to include locker rooms and gym showers.
Such directives attached to South Carolina’s state spending package — called provisos — are officially one-year laws. But they roll over from one year to the next indefinitely, unless legislators vote to take them out. There was no debate at all this year on the bathroom rule, which carries over into the fiscal year that starts Tuesday.
A lawsuit challenging it was filed in federal court last November on behalf of a transgender middle school student in Berkeley County. Attorneys for the national nonprofit Public Justice have asked for the law to be suspended pending the case’s outcome, but nothing has been decided.
In Arizona, the legislature passed a bill in May that would have restricted school bathrooms and changing rooms, but Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed it, along with two other GOP-backed bills targeting transgender people.

The Legislature is considering phasing out chemical additives in school meals linked to health problems. Opponents say the definitions are so broad that it could ban items like tomato sauce and olive oil.



During the school year, kids attending schools in the Tahoe region are served cafeteria meals of ground turkey tacos, chicken or tofu bowls with brown rice, a salad bar filled with locally grown produce and other healthy items.
About 80% of breakfasts and lunches served at Tahoe-Truckee Unified School District are made from scratch without food additives such as dyes and preservatives, and nutrition workers have worked to eliminate prepackaged foods and serve minimally processed meals.
“The health of your entree is your ingredients, so we control those ingredients by cooking or making our own,” said Kat Soltanmorad, food and nutrition services director with the district.
Tahoe-Truckee Unified is part of a small but growing group of school districts in California trying to make the billion meals served in public K-12 schools every year healthier and less processed. The schools have relied on nearly $15 billion in state and federal funding over the past few years to begin making some of these changes.
Now lawmakers have set their sights on mandating improvements in school meals. A measure introduced by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat from Encino, aims to start phasing out some ultra-processed food at schools by 2028 and remove them by 2035. The bill targets foods with chemical additives, such as stabilizers, coloring and flavoring agents.
The bill doesn’t list specific foods or additives that would be banned. Instead, it tasks the state’s environmental health agency with identifying “particularly harmful” ingredients by next July. But there’s controversy brewing between the bill’s supporters and the agriculture and food manufacturing industries that worry safe products could be targeted.
For example, pizza — a favorite among students — often contains many ingredients like dough conditioners and stabilizers that manufacturers say are needed to produce the foods and keep them shelf-stable. Health experts say some are linked to cancer and other health harms. 
The bipartisan measure passed the Assembly in a 65-1 vote, with 13 members not voting, and is now being considered by the Senate. It comes on the heels of a January executive order from Gov. Gavin Newsom directing the state health department to recommend how to limit harm from ultra-processed foods. The proposal also coincides with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign, which prioritizes chronic disease, including obesity and diabetes.
“There is a growing national awareness, particularly among parents, about how deeply what we feed our kids impacts their physical and mental health,” Gabriel said. “Even though Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much, one of the things they can agree on is this common sense notion that we should be protecting our kids.”
James Gallagher, Republican Assembly leader and co-author of the bill, said he used to be skeptical about state efforts to regulate additives like food dyes, but as he reviewed the evidence, he became convinced that kids should not consume them.
“Our kids should be eating better,” said Gallagher, a sixth-generation rice farmer from Chico. “What we all agree on really is let’s get out the most harmful ingredients that might be present in foods that are going into kids lunches.”
“Even though Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on much, one of the things they can agree on is this common sense notion that we should be protecting our kids.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER JESSE GABRIEL
A coalition of grocers, farmers, food and beverage manufacturers, and business groups has risen in fierce opposition to the measure. They say that creating a system that designates most groceries as ultra-processed will give consumers the false impression that their food is unsafe. 
More than 80% of products sold in grocery stores would be considered ultra-processed under the state definition, said Dennis Albiani, president of lobbying firm Capitol Advocates representing the coalition. 
“The definitions are so broad and so vague that many both healthy and determined healthy products are going to be pulled in and labeled as ultra-processed, which in the lexicon of America means dangerous and unhealthy,” Albiani said.
For example, manufacturers inject small amounts of nitrous oxide into the top of olive oil bottles to prevent the oil from oxidizing, he said. Canned goods like tomatoes and other vegetables often contain citric acid and other preservatives. Vegan and vegetarian meat supplements, which are touted as being healthy and environmentally friendly, also rely on thickeners, flavors and binders. Under the state’s proposed legislation, all of these added ingredients could classify those foods as ultra-processed, Albiani said.
First in the world to define ultra-processed
The measure would make California the first government in the world to define ultra-processed foods, according to the bill’s sponsor, the advocacy and research organization Environmental Working Group.Researchers generally consider ultra-processed foods to include ingredients like starches, fats and proteins that have been substantially modified from their original form, as well as additives like chemical binders, food dyes and flavors, and high levels of salt or sugar. Often they are high in calories and low in nutritional value.But there is no standardized definition. Under California’s definition, a food would be considered ultra-processed if it contains ingredients in nine categories: stabilizers, propellants, emulsifiers, colors, flavoring agents, flavor enhancers, surface-active ingredients, surface-finishing agents and non-nutritive sweeteners. Other food additives monitored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would also count.California and federal laws already include requirements that regulate the nutrition content of meals such as how much salt, fat, sugar and calories are in a serving.The measure would require the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment to identify and maintain a list of “particularly harmful” ultra-processed ingredients — ones linked to cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and other serious health problems. Schools would be required to begin phasing them out by 2028 with complete elimination by 2035. Vendors would also be prohibited from selling schools food with the identified substances.Bernadette Del Chiaro, a senior vice president with the Environmental Working Group, said the measure is “chemical neutral.” Rather than specifying which ingredients may be harmful, it allows the state’s expert toxics agency to follow the science and make that determination, she said.The legislation builds on recent laws passed in California to eliminate synthetic food dyes from school meals and certain additives from all food sold in the state that are associated with cancer, reproductive harm and behavioral problems in children. “What we’re talking about now in the 21st Century is a threat of food that isn’t really food. So it doesn’t matter if it’s low in fat or high in fat if it’s loaded with chemicals,” Del Chiaro said. Gabriel acknowledged that the bill needs work to “sharpen the definitions” as it moves through the Senate, but he also said it doesn’t ban any food, even from schools. The reality, he said, is that the environmental health agency will identify harmful ingredients that school districts and vendors will have to remove from products. “A lot of what this may boil down to is switching from one brand of oatmeal to another, or switching from this type of maple syrup product to a different product that is just maple syrup,” Gabriel said.

Although the authors say the measure is focused on school meals, Daniel Conway, vice president of government relations for the California Grocers Association, said he’s concerned that it will have implications beyond school nutrition. The ultra-processed food definition would apply to all food sold in the state even if the prohibition on “particularly harmful” ultra-processed foods is for schools only. “This is going to incorporate foods that we have otherwise been encouraging people to eat,” Conway said. “Really focus it on school nutrition and school meals, and that would go a long way to address our concerns.”Gabriel, whose previous nutrition bills have at times drawn both praise and political scorn, such as the so-called “Skittles ban,” said California’s commitment to removing harmful substances from food predates Kennedy’s rhetoric. But it helps that many of his Republican colleagues are supportive. Gallagher, the Republican co-author, said the “MAHA movement” in the Trump administration has helped give this bill momentum but agrees with Gabriel that California lawmakers have been paying attention to the issue for years. 
Link between childhood obesity and ultra-processed foods
One in five children in America is obese, and the ubiquity of processed and ultra-processed foods are a significant contributing factor, said Dr. Rohit Kohli, chief of gastroenterology at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and an expert in fatty liver disease among children.
Kohli thinks efforts to remove or limit ultra-processed foods from school meals, which low-income children in particular rely on, are a good idea. “We would see societal-level benefits from a societal change,” he said.
“In large population studies, we are seeing, unfortunately, the higher the rate of (ultra-processed food consumption) the higher the rate of obesity,” Kohli said. That’s because ultra-processed foods are usually calorie dense, he said.
Obesity and severe obesity rates among children and teens steadily increased between 1999 and 2016 in the U.S. despite some studies showing slowing growth, according to a 2018 study published in the journal Pediatrics. Severe obesity, in particular, increased among all child and adolescent age groups and populations during the study period, according to the authors. 
Children from low-income families are also more likely to have lower physical fitness and a higher risk of obesity, studies show. One of the reasons is little availability of affordable healthy food.
That makes lifestyle changes very difficult for most children and their families, Kohli said. When he speaks to overweight or obese children about their favorite foods, sugary beverages and pre-made, ultra-processed meals like pizza or fast food top the list. Those types of food are designed to be cheap, convenient and hyper-palatable, he said, which makes it hard for families to remove from their diets. 
What some schools are already doing
Some districts in California are already trying to improve upon the state and federal standards governing school meal nutrition. They’re using state grants to build new kitchens, hire chefs, train staff and renegotiate contracts with vendors and local farms.
Michael Jochner, nutrition director for Morgan Hill Unified School District, said food costs have dropped 30% over the past five years because the district switched to whole foods or “clean” packaged items. A lot of the savings come from working with local farmers, he said. 
“When you start shopping locally you have more control over the local market. You can go to a local farmer and say ‘Hey this is what I need,’ and we negotiate the price,” Jochner said. 
The changes in his district’s menu have also eliminated more than 34 pounds of sugar consumed per student each year. They did it primarily by removing sugary beverages like juice and chocolate milk and replacing sweet breakfast foods like cereal and banana bread with savory items. Breakfast includes sausage patties, bagel sandwiches and plain Greek yogurt with fruit.
Removing items high in sugar also often removed ultra-processed ingredients like binders and anti-caking agents, Jochner said. “One amazing move took out a bunch of stuff simultaneously,” he said.
In Fresno Unified School District, the third largest district in the state, 14 million meals are served to kids annually. Nutrition director Amanda Harvey said her program has also worked to reduce sugar and remove food additives. They’ve increased the whole grains served to students and do more scratch cooking. For their most popular item — a spicy chicken sandwich — they swapped out a pressed chicken patty with a breaded whole muscle, such as a thigh or breast, to eliminate a preservative that may be linked with respiratory harm and liver damage.
But Harvey said it’s unlikely any district could make 100% of meals in-house.
Schools will still need vendors, and this legislation would force them to comply or lose schools as customers. At one point, Harvey said she approached one vendor to see if it could remove several food additives and was told no.
“This would put the impetus on vendors to clean up their product,” Harvey said.

In major cities and more rural areas, arrests and citations rose in the months following last summer’s Supreme Court decision. In some places, officials insist the events are unrelated.


Homeless residents of some of California’s biggest cities increasingly are facing criminal penalties for the actions they take to survive on the street, according to a first-of-its-kind CalMatters analysis of data throughout the state.
Saturday marks the one-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson, which upended California’s homelessness strategy by allowing cities to enforce blanket bans on camping — even if no shelter beds are available. Immediately after the decision, unhoused Californians and the people who help them reported seeing an increase in enforcement. But CalMatters’ reporting, gleaned from more than 100 public records requests, appears to be the first statewide effort to quantify that increase.
CalMatters analyzed data on arrests and citations for camping and other homelessness-related offenses for 2024, comparing the six months before the June 28 Supreme Court decision to the six months after. We found increases in cities throughout the state, even in those where local leaders said they didn’t change their policy as a result of Grants Pass. 
Here are some of the places with the most significant increases, according to police data:

In San Francisco, then-mayor London Breed promised to be “very aggressive” in moving encampments following the Grants Pass decision. She delivered: Arrests and citations for illegal lodging increased from 71 in the six months before the ruling to 427 in the six months after — a 500% increase.
Even though Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass spoke out against the Grants Pass decision, calling it “disappointing” and vowing to lead with housing instead of enforcement, homelessness-related arrests increased 68% after the ruling. 
Citations and arrests doubled in San Diego, which also doubled the size of its police teams that respond to homelessness.
In Sacramento, the number of citations and arrests nearly tripled – from 96 in the six months before Grants Pass, to 283 in the six months after. From January through May 2025, Sacramento police had already issued 844 citations and arrests, suggesting enforcement continues to trend upward.
Stockton issued just 14 homelessness-related citations in the six months before the Grants Pass decision. In the six months after the ruling came out, that number jumped to 213.
It wasn’t just big cities that saw more enforcement: Citations and arrests increased by more than two-thirds in Ukiah, on the North Coast, and more than doubled in Merced, in the San Joaquin Valley. 

The ruling, which found that the city of Grants Pass, Oregon did not violate the constitution by banning encampments throughout the city when no shelter was available, accelerated a shift toward a pro-enforcement approach to homelessness. Buoyed by voters fed up with large encampments near their homes, Gov. Gavin Newsom used the opportunity to urge cities to ramp up enforcement and pass anti-camping ordinances. 
The people making the case for enforcement argue it’s a type of “tough love” that’s sometimes necessary to get people off the street. If someone refuses multiple offers of help, the threat of arrest might make them finally say yes, said San Diego Police Department Capt. Steve Shebloski. 
“I hope nobody has to go to jail, and I hope everybody takes services,” he said. “I just dont think that’s the reality of where we’re at with certain individuals.”
The type of help police can offer varies widely by city and situation. In San Diego, the Homeless Outreach Team, which includes police officers as well as social workers and mental health professionals, is supposed to offer shelter before issuing citations or making arrests. Between May 2024 and May 2025, that team made 357 placements into housing or shelter, Shebloski said. People refused help 2,471 times, he said. And they accepted another form of services 3,578 times, from a referral to a treatment program, to a ride to an appointment, to a new toothbrush. The department does not track how many people wanted shelter but couldn’t get it.
In Stockton, police take a more hands-off approach: They hand out flyers with six phone numbers people can call to reach homeless shelters and other organizations.
But shelter beds aren’t always available. Last year, California had more than 187,000 unhoused residents, and fewer than 76,000 year-round shelter and transitional housing beds, according to data compiled by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Doctors, academics and social workers who work with people on the street often say arrests make it harder for unhoused people to get back on their feet. When someone living outside gets a citation, they often miss their court date — they might lose the ticket or simply forget the date amidst the chaos of life on the street — which leads the court to issue a warrant for their arrest. People with active warrants can’t qualify for many housing and treatment programs. 
“They don’t understand. It’s not camping. It’s surviving.”Beverly Harding, 58, Sacramento
In many situations, people cited or arrested for homelessness-related crimes are never charged, or the charges are quickly dismissed. But the threat of an arrest can be just as disruptive as the arrest itself. People leave their campsites to avoid getting taken to jail, and in so doing, lose touch with the outreach workers trying to connect them with housing and other services.
“In a weird way, it undermines the housing process to such an extent that you end up working for homelessness and against the people who are experiencing homelessness,” said Brett Feldman, director of street medicine at USC. 
Some leaders are pushing back against the enforcement mindset. This week, two Democratic Congress members introduced the “Housing Not Handcuffs Act,” which would prohibit federal agencies from punishing people for living outside if they have no other option. 
Grants Pass made no difference, say cities where arrests and citations spiked
In the year since the Grants Pass decision, at least 50 cities and three counties in California passed new ordinances targeting homeless encampments, according to a recent analysis by UC Berkeley Law students and faculty. Some ban camping only in specific areas, such as near schools, waterways or levees, while others ban camping throughout the entire city. Some cities, such as Fresno, made camping a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and $1,000 in fines. 
Even cities that didn’t pass ordinances started cracking down on encampments with new vigor, using old rules. 
To quantify that crackdown, CalMatters filed more than 100 public records requests to police departments, sheriff’s offices, prosecutors and city and county governments for data on arrests, citations, charges filed and encampment removals. Those requests span a sample of about 35 large and small cities and counties throughout California. When requesting law enforcement data, CalMatters asked each agency to provide a list of the ordinances it uses to address homeless camps. In some cities that included ordinances that specifically prohibit encampments, but it could also include rules that ban sitting or lying on the sidewalk, impeding the right of way, storing belongings on public property and violating city park rules. 



Los Angeles Councilmember Nithya Raman said she was surprised to see the data showing arrests related to homelessness increased 68% in her city, jumping from 920 in the six months before Grants Pass, to 1,549 in the six months after. Not all of those arrests led to someone being taken to jail. Some were what is called “noncustodial arrests,” where the person is released on site.
There were no policy changes in how the city dealt with encampments after the Supreme Court ruling, Raman said. But the city continues to expand its list of “sensitive locations,” such as near schools, where it bans encampments, she said.
“One of the city’s top priorities is to reduce unsheltered homelessness and bring people indoors and off the streets,” Raman said. “Our urgency to do that did not come from the Grants Pass decision in any way, shape or form. We were already focused on that.”
Mayor Bass’ office did not respond to requests for comment.
But Feldman, who provides medical care in encampments on the streets of Los Angeles, said he saw a noticeable change after the Supreme Court ruling. Suddenly, the areas where his team used to regularly find people were empty. That was a problem, because only about 5% of the team’s patients have reliable cell phones. If medics can’t find their patients, they can’t give them important follow-up care — such as their monthly antipsychotic injection or medicine to treat opioid addiction. As a result, their patients get sicker. 
“It was really tough for a few months,” Feldman said, though he believes enforcement has gone back down to pre-Grants Pass levels in recent months. That’s because most people have moved out of the heavily enforced areas (such as around schools) and re-settled in places that escape police notice, he said.  
The data CalMatters obtained from the Los Angeles Police Department does not include 2025 information.
San Diego similarly did not pass a new camping ban after Grants Pass. Its “unsafe camping” ordinance passed in 2023, and police also enforce older rules that prohibit encroaching on the public right of way. Shebloski says Grants Pass hasn’t changed anything in San Diego, despite the correlated increase in enforcement — 524 arrests and citations in the six months before Grants Pass, and 1,045 in the six months after. That’s because the police department added officers to its Neighborhood Police Division and Homeless Outreach Team, under the direction of its new police chief — which coincidentally lined up with Grants Pass, he said.
“I can tell you there’s absolutely zero operational direction that, ‘Grants Pass is now passed, go out there and write tickets,’” he said.
Outreach workers struggle to find clients
Beverly Harding, 58, has been on the streets for about 10 years. For the last year of that time, she was sleeping in a makeshift tent she pitched in various places along X Street in Sacramento, by attaching tarps to the shopping cart that held her food.
She still cries sometimes when recounting her run-ins with police, who she says have confiscated treasured items, including a necklace that held her mother’s ashes. An arrest last fall was particularly traumatic. A friend’s dog had bitten her wrist a few days before, and she’d gone to the hospital for treatment, she said. When the officers grabbed her injured wrist and handcuffed her, Harding said she almost passed out from the pain. She said she still gets shooting pains through her damaged wrist.
“They don’t understand,” Harding said. “It’s not camping. It’s surviving. And if you don’t have a home, where else are you going to try to survive? Anywhere you can.”

These days, the authorities are moving unhoused people around Sacramento on a daily basis, said Joe Smith. He’s the director of residential services for homeless services nonprofit Hope Cooperative and board chair for the county’s continuum of care, which coordinates the area’s response to homelessness. Because of that movement, Smith said, people are seeking out hidden spots to sleep, away from the gaze of law enforcement.
That’s making it harder for outreach workers, who have housing and other services to offer, to find their homeless clients. Smith saw that first-hand last fall. An unhoused man finally got a spot in Smith’s Hope Landing housing program after years of trying to get off the streets, but no one could find him. The program pushed his move-in date back three times, in hopes that someone would be able to track him down. 
The client eventually resurfaced and Smith was able to get him into housing earlier this month. It was just in time: A few more days, and the client would have lost the spot and had to start the entire process over. Even so, the delay meant he needlessly spent about six extra months on the street.
Smith, who was homeless himself between 2005 and 2011, said he’s “deeply concerned” the increase in enforcement is making other people lose out on housing opportunities.
“How devastating is that?” he asked. “Surviving outside becomes a lifestyle for you, and your ticket out comes up and nobody can find you. What a shame that is.”
A missing tent doesn’t mean someone has found housing
Shortly after the Grants Pass decision, then-Mayor Breed vowed to crack down on homeless encampments. What difference did the 500% increase in arrests and citations make in the city?
The number of tents and structures on San Francisco’s streets dipped to 222 in March — the lowest it’s been since the city began counting regularly in April 2019. That’s down from 360 in April 2024. 
But just because someone has ditched their tent doesn’t mean they are off the street.
“Most people are just sleeping on cardboard or on the street and moving every night,” said Chris Herring, a UCLA professor of sociology who researches homelessness in San Francisco and beyond. 
In Stockton, the city launched a “take back our parks” campaign to crack down on encampments after Grants Pass. Around the same time, the police department was recovering from a COVID-19 pandemic-era staffing shortage and increased its staffing in the departments that typically respond to homeless encampments. 
Police issued hardly any citations for violating park rules (including camping, drinking and lighting fires in a public park) or obstructing sidewalks in the six months before the Grants Pass ruling. In the six months after, police cited people for those offenses 213 times. 
Police give a 72-hour warning before they clear an encampment, said Officer David Scott, public information officer for the Stockton Police Department. If people don’t move after those 72 hours are up, officers may cite them. In rare cases, if someone is being combative, police may make an arrest instead, he said.
Police also hand out flyers with phone numbers people can call for housing, shelter beds, showers, meals and other resources. 
“We’re always going to be out there,” Scott said. “We want to provide those resources and help to those individuals that are vulnerable. And we’re going to continue the efforts in that area. But at the end of the day, we’ve got to make sure that our city is safe and as clean as we can get it.”
The flyers list numbers for six service providers (including one that’s listed twice). But there’s no guarantee any will be able to help with whatever the homeless person calling needs. St. Mary’s Community Services, one of the providers listed, had two-dozen beds available across its men’s, women’s and recuperative care programs as of June 25. A week before, it had just 11. None were available for families. 
Police have no way of tracking whether anyone calling St. Mary’s or the other providers gets help, or whether they just move a few blocks down the road and start the cycle over again. 
And for some people, police interactions don’t stop just because they’ve moved indoors.
After living on the streets for about a decade, Harding recently moved into a community of tiny homes for homeless residents in Sacramento, where case workers are supposed to help her find permanent housing. 
Shortly after, Harding and her boyfriend were hanging out in front of a nearby laundromat, using the Wi-Fi. She was downloading music onto her phone, and he was downloading games. Harding said they had a thin blanket over them, because it was cold.  
An officer showed up and told them camping wasn’t allowed there, and they had to move, Harding said.
“I said, ‘Excuse me. I’m not camping. I live next door.’”

In Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Diego, homeless Californians describe their experiences over the past year as camping ban enforcement has increased. 


Deadra Walicki has lived in the same spot for more than a decade: a cracked patch of asphalt in L.A.’s San Fernando Valley, squeezed between a boarded-up grocery store and Amtrak tracks so close that passing trains shake the ground beneath her tent.The air carries the scent of diesel fumes from busy Van Nuys Boulevard below and rotten food from the dozens of garbage bags piled up near her mattress, baking in the summer sun.She stays put so that friends, family members and case workers can always locate her. But that consistency has also made Walicki, 51, a target for the police officers who patrol the area.The Los Angeles Police Department cited Walicki for violating the city’s camping ordinance at least 34 times between August 2023 and December 2024.
 “They drove through today and I waved at them,” said Walicki, her smile revealing cracked porcelain veneers. “The cops come here Monday through Friday and give tickets for being in the zone of the shelter. It’s whatever they want to do.”

It’s been 12 months since a groundbreaking U.S. Supreme Court decision rewrote the playbook on homelessness, allowing cities in California and beyond to make homeless encampments illegal, even when no shelter is available.
Before the justices ruled in Grants Pass v. Johnson, Los Angeles and other cities generally had to offer someone a shelter bed before punishing them for sleeping on the street. But that went out the window when the justices upheld an ordinance by the Oregon city of Grants Pass that banned camping on all public property. 
Since the ruling, camping-related citations and arrests have soared in cities throughout California — everywhere from Sacramento to Los Angeles to San Diego and beyond.
In each of those three cities, police are citing many of the same people again and again. And while some have managed to move indoors, many others are still camping in the same places, racking up citations that ultimately make it more difficult to find housing.
We tracked down a few of those people. Here are their stories: 
Los Angeles: 10 citations in six months
Walicki motions across the train tracks to what looks like a giant rubber bubble. It’s a transitional homeless shelter that opened in 2020.While L.A. does not have a blanket ban on public camping, the city’s main anti-camping law  allows enforcement in select sensitive locations chosen by council members, including near schools, parks and homeless shelters.L.A. Municipal Code 41.18 says people camping within 1,000 feet of a shelter can be cited. That’s what the majority of Walicki’s citations are for, but she claims the shelter is about 2,000 feet away, as the crow flies.Hope the Mission, which operates the shelter, did not dispute her distance assessment when contacted for comment, but the citations keep coming.City-led cleaning and enforcement at homeless encampments makes outreach work harder, according to the nonprofit. Outreach teams build rapport with participants only to lose track of them.“When they do this cleanup, we go back the next day, that same day,” said Hope the Mission outreach worker Armando Covarrubias. “Where can we find ’em? We can’t contact them because they have no phones.”
In recent years, L.A. city leaders have used the ordinance to designate more and more areas for anti-camping enforcement, creating a patchwork of hard-to-follow rules for unsheltered Angelenos like Walicki.
Last March, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency released a report showing L.A.’s anti-camping law has not been effective at getting people into housing or keeping encampments away: It found 94% of people targeted for removal under the ordinance wanted shelter, but only 17% were able to get it.
Los Angeles hasn’t changed its enforcement as a result of Grants Pass, according to the City Attorney’s Office. But LAPD data show the department made 68% more camping and homelessness-related arrests  in the second half of 2024 than the first. Those include non-custodial arrests, where the violator is released at the scene.
Walicki received 10 camping citations in the latter half of 2024, according to LAPD records obtained by CalMatters. She was even cited for camping two mornings in a row that October, at the same intersection.
“ People are being targeted every day in the city through enforcement, through resolutions to get them to move,” said Shayla Myers, senior attorney with Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, a nonprofit providing free legal services for poor Angelenos. “That’s the very definition of criminalization.”
When patrol cars arrive — usually in the morning, Walicki says — officers give people about 10 minutes to pack up. Anything left behind disappears into the back of sanitation trucks. Over the months, she’s lost bags of recycling she’d collected for cash, sleeping bags, clothes, even dental tools for her veneers.
Walicki lives in the encampment with her partner Steve Maroulis, a 57-year-old man with mental disabilities. The two of them want to go at the same time into two separate gender-segregated shelters, but haven’t had any luck.
“It would just be nice, for safety reasons,” she said. “And I don’t want either of us to be alone out here.”

Police records capture the chaos of tracking someone arrested so frequently. Her name appears as Deadra, Dedra, and Debra. Her last name is spelled five different ways across case files.
Each citation adds to a growing pile of legal paperwork she largely ignores. She hasn’t paid any fines because she doesn’t have the money, she said. Court dates blur together. Walicki said she’s tried to show up to court for some of her infractions, but she’s never gone on the right day.
Others have dealt with more serious consequences for camping. David Cerritos, 46, has lived in Skid Row for five years, his tattered tent on a sidewalk flanked by wholesale smoke shops in the shadow of downtown L.A.’s skyline.Cerritos was cited at least 12 times last year, including six times after the Supreme Court decision.Unlike Walicki, with her repeated citations, Cerritos has been handcuffed and temporarily detained for violating the ordinance several times, he said.“If you don’t comply, you’ll just be arrested,” he said. “And then even if you get cited out, hours later or whatever, by the time you get back, you’ve lost everything.”If someone resists, refuses to comply with or obstructs camping ban enforcement, LAPD can submit the case to be charged as a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail. Otherwise, LAPD will designate it an infraction punishable by a $250 fine, according to the department’s guidelines.Several of Cerritos’ arrest records include mention of disorderly conduct. For him, these arrests usually mean spending 6 to 12 hours in jail while everything he owns disappears. Cerritos said he’s lost barbering clippers, tattoo equipment, bicycles, tools, laptops and more.LAPD submits misdemeanor cases to the L.A. City Attorney’s office for prosecution consideration, and that office ultimately decides whether to file misdemeanor charges or knock them down to infractions.The office said it filed charges in 87 camping violation cases in 2024 — 8% of the 1,034 enforcement actions LAPD made under the ordinance last year.For Cerritos and Walicki, the citations and fines don’t mean all that much. For them, any interaction with police or city workers feels like enforcement, whether a charge is issued or not.Cerritos feels like he’s getting harassed more than usual recently, but he’s not interested in moving. Like Walicki, he has a case manager but no phone. ”Now if they were forcing me to move away from here, and I went even just a block over, you might never find me,” Cerritos said.After years of frequent arrests and citations for camping, neither Cerritos nor Walicki are any closer to leaving their spots, for permanent housing or anywhere else. 
Sacramento: Go to jail, or go to a tiny home
Over the past three years, Jerry Carter could often be seen biking around Sacramento’s Midtown neighborhood, his brindle bull terrier, Zaddy, riding in style behind him on a homemade trailer he built special for the beloved pup.
Music followed him as he zipped past trendy bars and restaurants, playing R&B, jazz or reggae (never rap) from a small speaker. Sometimes he played his all-time favorite: Prince, who he saw perform at Arco Arena in 1997.
Local businesses and other homeless people who slept nearby knew him by sight, if not by name. 
The police knew Carter, too.
Over the past year, they gave him at least seven citations for camping, storing his belongings on public property and blocking the sidewalk.

Each encounter with police followed a similar playbook, Carter said. Officers showed up and told him he had 10 minutes to pack up all his belongings. Anything he couldn’t pack in time, he had to abandon. 
Carter said he lost a lot of possessions that way: bicycles, clothes, tents and more. Losing bikes stung the most: Getting hit by a car a few years ago left Carter in constant pain, making it hard to walk. But biking is easier.
Sacramento bans camping or “using camping paraphernalia” on public property. Police can cite or arrest someone if they are using a sleeping bag, or even a piece of cardboard as a mattress and a tarp as a blanket — but not if they are sleeping on a bench with no camping materials, according to a police training bulletin. 
Enforcement of that ban, as well as related ordinances, spiked after the Grants Pass decision. The number of arrests made and citations issued nearly tripled, from 96 in the first half of last year, to 283 in the second half. From January through May of this year, that number jumped to 844.
In most of those cases, the person was cited and released, not taken to jail. Violations led to an arrest 199 times in 2025.
Despite the frequent tickets and attempts to push him out of the bustling shopping and dining district, Carter never moved far from his preferred spot, around 21st and K streets. All of his citations over the past year were issued within about a two-and-a-half-block radius. He felt he had to stay central if he wanted to eat: That’s where his friends were, and where passersby would stop and give him money or food.
“I could survive there,” he said.
Carter became homeless about three years ago, after he says a property manager stole cash from his apartment while he was in the hospital. Carter moved out to avoid a physical confrontation. After that, Carter admits he “gave up a little bit.” He didn’t have the money to get a new apartment, and, focused every day on survival, he didn’t have the energy to start the process of getting back on his feet.
Initially, when the cops showed up wherever Carter was sleeping, an outreach worker would come too and put Carter on a waitlist for shelter. But nothing ever came of that, Carter said. 
Then, at the very end of December, Sacramento County opened a new tiny home community for homeless residents. The Stockton Boulevard site, which was part of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2023 promise to build tiny homes throughout California, has 155 small cabins with room for a bed (or two beds if it’s for a couple) and a few belongings. Residents share communal bathrooms with plumbing and showers. Case managers meet regularly with residents to try and help them find permanent housing. 
As the tiny homes gradually filled, one police officer started urging Carter to move in. Carter said no multiple times. He’d spent a few days in a different tiny home site last year. He hated it, he said.
Finally, the officer gave Carter an ultimatum: Go to jail, or go to a tiny home. Carter knew getting locked up meant he might lose his dog. And he’d heard the new tiny homes were actually kind of nice. So he said OK. 
“I guess he was actually a caring officer,” Carter said. “It didn’t seem like he was a caring officer, because he kept on writing tickets and everything. But he kept on just pushing me.”
Carter moved into his tiny home about two months ago, where, when he finally got to shower for the first time, it felt like he stood under the hot water for hours. He no longer has to worry about police waking him up at 6:30 a.m. and demanding that he move,  sometimes only minutes after he’d finally managed to fall asleep amidst the noise and chaos of the street.
“That’s wonderful,” Carter said. “I can actually sleep in. I can take naps.”
But the police actions that got him there also took a toll. Each time officers wrote Carter up, they gave him a piece of paper that said when he had to appear in court. But Carter invariably lost the papers. It would rain and they’d get wet and ruined. Or they’d get mixed in with the items the police tossed out the next time they told him to move. 
He didn’t think it was a big deal. After all, camping is a misdemeanor. There’s no way the court would issue a warrant for such a small offense, Carter thought. 
He was wrong. Now, at 53 years old, he has warrants out for his arrest for failing to appear at multiple court dates. It makes him worried that he could be biking down the street one day, minding his own business, and get arrested and taken to jail. 
“I’m just too old to have any type of trouble like that,” he said.

Carter’s hardly the only one in that position, said Terra Hennefer, the case manager supervisor for the tiny home site where Carter lives. 
“We see a lot of people that end up with the tickets,” she said. “Then it makes more work for us trying to clear their warrants and stuff before we get them into housing.”
Landlords often conduct background checks and won’t take someone with a warrant, Hennefer said. The county also runs background checks on people applying for subsidized housing vouchers.
Hennefer’s team works with the probation office to help residents resolve outstanding warrants. The first step is to set a new court date, and make sure the resident doesn’t miss it.
Then a judge will decide on a penalty, which could be a fine. Her organization, a shelter and interim housing provider named First Step Communities, can help cover the cost. But it’s frustrating, she said, as that money could instead go toward helping more people get off the street. And it adds yet another hurdle to what for many is a seemingly endless list of tasks on the way to housing.
Carter has just started that process. His case manager, Matthew Burbridge, is working on getting his Social Security benefits restarted and finding him permanent housing through CalAIM, the state’s expanded Medi-Cal program. 
The problem is, neither Burbridge, nor anyone else, knows how long that may take.
“They’re working on it,” he said. “It might be quick, it might be long. We don’t know. But we’ll be ready when the time comes.”
San Diego: Moving into a swamp 
Micah Huff for a time lost touch with a San Diego case manager who was trying to help him move to a city-backed homeless campsite as he sought to avoid police and encampment clean-ups.   
Huff, 45, moved to a boggy area near Ocean Beach bordered by brush, mud and city streets because it’s harder for the authorities to find him there. He had to hike in and out and said he’s already moved his belongings across the wetland once. Earlier this month, he said he expected to move again soon, as he’s done every couple weeks since the city stepped up enforcement.
Since May 2024, records show police cited Huff seven times for offenses tied to his unsheltered status and arrested him twice. 
Police data obtained by Voice of San Diego shows arrests and citations for violations tied to homelessness more than doubled in the six months after the Grants Pass ruling. Rather than the ruling, police attribute the increase to the new police chief assigning more officers to engage with community members and enforce crimes tied to homelessness. 
A year before the Grants Pass decision, the San Diego City Council approved a camping ban that police began enforcing in summer 2023, while also continuing to enforce older ordinances, such as those that prohibit encroaching on the public right of way.

The city’s street homeless population fell last year, and Mayor Todd Gloria credits that reduction to approaches such as the camping ban, continued enforcement of existing laws and increased shelter offerings and more outreach. 
Arrests can be traumatic: One of Huff’s arrests, which police records suggest may have occurred last September, has made a lasting impression on him.  
Huff was meeting a friend he hadn’t seen in a while at a dog beach in Ocean Beach. The two fell asleep near a public restroom, Huff said, and were startled awake by police. Police arrested Huff for encroachment and possession of drug paraphernalia, though Huff says the supplies weren’t his. 
Huff said his heart raced during his encounter with police. He heard an officer talk about a backpack with drug supplies. Huff’s blood pressure surged, a reaction that Huff said put him at risk of a heart attack or stroke due to a blood pressure condition. 
Then he passed out. 
Huff said police took him to Scripps Mercy Hospital in Hillcrest. Huff estimates the officers waited six or seven hours before finally giving up on booking him and leaving.
He left the hospital with medications that were stolen within a few days of his return outdoors. 
Superior Court records show that Huff has yet to be charged for these offenses or other alleged homelessness-related violations over the past couple years. 
The outcome of the city crackdowns, according to Huff, has simply been that he’s been pushed “further and further away” into remote areas — currently a literal swamp — to avoid enforcement or clean-ups. 
But increasing enforcement in recent weeks and months at nearby Ocean Beach hasn’t convinced 38-year-old Ryan Taylor to move elsewhere. Taylor, who has been cited nine times and arrested five times for offenses tied to homelessness, continues to set up an umbrella and blankets at the beach. 
One recent arrest came on Memorial Day, when Taylor was picked up on a warrant for failing to appear in court to address homelessness-related charges. He was relieved to find most of his belongings still at the beach when he returned the next morning.  
More recently, Taylor’s case manager has been helping him work on addressing his criminal cases in court. He is set to appear at a July 24 hearing to start the process. 
Taylor hasn’t left the Ocean Beach area he’s settled in for most of the four years he’s been homeless in San Diego despite the repeated arrests and citations, he said, because he’s “just accepted that’s the way that it is.” 
Taylor also said he’s repeatedly accepted offers of shelter when police show up next to him at the beach, but said shelter has never been available when he agreed to it. 
“To me, it seems like the people that need help or whatever don’t have money, giving them more tickets doesn’t help them, propel them to get them financially out of the hole or help them,” Taylor said.

San Diego police Capt. Steve Shebloski, who oversees the division focused on homelessness-related enforcement, and Denny Knox, executive director of business group OB MainStreet Association, argue that increased enforcement is having a positive effect, though both also said there’s more work to do. 
Shebloski noted recent homeless census results showing a 4% drop in unsheltered homelessness in the city and less visible homelessness in communities including San Diego’s downtown.  
But Dawn Contreras, a case manager for nonprofit PATH working with both Huff and Taylor, said the increased enforcement only makes homeless service workers’ jobs more difficult. 
One day this spring, Contreras said she was picking up an unsheltered client for a required webinar to obtain housing when a beat officer — not assigned to the Neighborhood Policing Division that Shebloski oversees — ordered her client to clear his camp. Contreras said she implored the officer to allow the man to clean the camp later so he could head to his meeting. 
“You’re not willing to bend for just one hour?” Contreras said. 
The officer refused. With Contreras’ help, the unsheltered man later signed onto his meeting a few minutes late. Rescheduling it would have added another logistical hurdle for both Contreras and her client as they prepared to move him off the street.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/082224-LA-Homeless-Camp-Sweep-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C685&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 09:02:32.273604

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — Professors and students at the University of Alabama said in federal court Thursday that a 2024 state law banning DEI and so-called “divisive concepts” had chilled academic freedom and thrown funding for student organizations into uncertainty.
The testimony concluded a two-day evidentiary hearing over the law, known as SB 129, before U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor. A group of professors and students have sued the state and the University of Alabama Board of Trustees over the statute, saying it violated the First and Fourteenth amendments.
Richard Fording, a UA political science professor focusing on race and politics, said Thursday that the law has forced him to make significant changes to his courses, including reducing coverage of topics such as the Black Power movement, Black Lives Matter, and white nationalism. Fording also said it led him to cancel an undergraduate course on “Politics and Poverty.” He said he was concerned about teaching topics that could be interpreted as violating the law.
“That’s a decision I made based on everything that I witnessed since (SB 129 has) been implemented,” he said.

In two other courses, “Social Movements and U.S. Politics” and “Politics of Voting Rights,” Fording said he removed some discussions on systemic racism and oppression, central to the social movements he teaches and the history of voting rights, to avoid any student complaints and potential sanctions. He no longer assigns related readings and refrains from facilitating class discussions on these sensitive topics.
“(In) group discussions, students may express opinions that relate to divisive concepts, and because I facilitate those discussions, if those discussions become kind of one-sided, that can make a student feel like they’re being compelled to assent,” Fording said.
Cassandra Simon, a professor in the University of Alabama’s School of Social Work, testified that the law led to a class project chosen by students being abruptly canceled “the morning that we were to have it.”
Simon said that Dean Schnavia Smith Hatcher of the UA School of Social Work asked in an email for the project to be canceled because it “could be viewed as sponsoring a program that promotes DEI” by requiring “a student assent to a divisive concept” and “attend or participate in coursework that advocates” for a divisive concept.

She disagreed and told Hatcher that the class picks the project to work on while she offers support, and that she had “never gotten into trouble.” But according to Simon, Hatcher said she would “be subject to progressive disciplinary action up to and including termination.”
“I was specifically told in an email by my administrator, my immediate supervisor, my dean, that if I did my did not have my students cancel their project that I would be subjecting myself to, in the exact words, progressive disciplinary action up to and including termination,” Simon said in a press conference Thursday.
Simon called the law vague and confusing, saying that she still does not understand why her class project was canceled.
“I still don’t understand what [SB 129] is. I am not a non-intelligent person. I have talked to many people who don’t understand what it is, all who are very intelligent and informed, and view themselves as the experts in their fields and as educators,” she said.
Both professors said that while they were not directly told to change their courses to comply with SB 129, they did so out of caution due to UA’s administration treatment of Dana Patton, a director of the Witt Fellows Program and a political science professor at the University of Alabama who testified Wednesday, during an investigation of anonymous complaints that claimed the program was “embedded” with “divisive concepts.” In her testimony, she detailed an intense investigation she faced after the university received an anonymous complaint.
“I felt like the administration should have determined if it actually was students in my course who complained and talked to other students in my class, because I was being accused of violating the law, and that complaint came from the state legislature, so I felt like there should have been a little bit more investigation into that,” Patton said in a press conference Thursday.
Students who testified in Thursday’s hearing said that SB 129 has also impacted funding for school organizations that may potentially promote “divisive concepts.”
Sydney Testman, a University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) political science student, said that the Social Justice Advocacy Council (SJAC) was “demoted” from a “university funded organization” to a “registered student organization” after SB 129’s implementation, which meant that they no longer automatically received funding from UAB. Because the organization lost funding, her role as finance coordinator, which provided her and other student leaders with a yearly stipend, was also terminated.
Miguel Luna, a UAB student studying political science and history, testified that his organization, Esperanza, which focuses on Hispanic and Latine students, relied on funding from the former Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), which was rebranded as the Office of Access and Engagement to comply with SB 129, and other organizations like SJAC. 
Since the anti-DEI law was implemented, he said he lost access to those funds and could no longer provide incentives like food at events, leading to a decline in the events they have hosted.
“Many other student organizations have also found that when you provide incentives, people will attend, especially the off campus people that you’re trying to reach,” Luna said.
During cross-examination by Jay Ezelle, an attorney representing the UA Board of Trustees, Luna acknowledged that Esperanza did not apply for direct USGA funding in the most recent academic year, partly because the deadline had passed and he believed, based on his experience on the executive council of USGA, that Esperanza would not be eligible due to its mission.
Judge Proctor asked why the organization didn’t submit the application anyway.“What would have been involved in submitting? Why not take a chance? Why not take the effort, submit the application, get a ‘no,’ rather than assume,” Proctor asked.
Ja’coby Bibbs, a UA political science student and president of the UA chapter of the NAACP student chapter, detailed the historical significance and practical benefits of the Black Student Union (BSU) and the LGBTQ+ center that was closed in August to comply with SB 129. He said the BSU office, located on the first floor of the Student Center, served as a hub for fostering connections, mentorship, and community among Black students and other minority groups.
“The Black Student Union space was invaluable to my experience, to my success at the University of Alabama,” Bibbs said, adding that the space helped him in his application to the Blackburn Institute, a prestigious leadership development and civic engagement program for UA students. He emphasized that the BSU space was open to all students, regardless of race or ethnicity, and did not require membership or a fee for entry.
Bibbs recounted an incident involving racist text messages sent to Black students on campus, stressing that the absence of the BSU space deprived students of a place to “cultivate and really digest what was happening.” He described the BSU as “an ode to the trailblazers who came before us,” including the first Black students and professors at the university.
The BSU space was a place where “people who get me, people who look like me, understand what I’m going through,” Bibbs said.
Proctor indicated he wants to decide whether to issue an injunction before class starts in August and might rule on the state’s motion to dismiss after. An oral argument hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PXL_20250626_1731190742-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Early morning May 22, 2025, when most families were still asleep, members of the U.S. House passed a bill to make sweeping cuts to Medicaid, SNAP — which helps people afford groceries — and other basic safety net programs, all to finance tax breaks for the wealthiest in our country. 
A Senate vote is imminent.
The 215 representatives who voted for this bill said “yes” to kicking over 13 million people off their health care through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, while raising costs for millions of others. These representatives said “yes” to ransacking the pantries and clearing off the dinner tables of 3 million families on SNAP who are struggling to get by. These representatives said “yes” to taking away school lunches from 18 million kids. 
In Minnesota, the effects of these cuts will be devastating. Fully $11 billion of the $18 billion that Minnesota spends on Medicaid comes from the federal government. Cutting these funds will leave people without access to doctors and the medicines they need to survive. SNAP serves over 450,000 Minnesotans who are trying to make it to another day.
These 215 of our U.S. representatives said “yes” to endangering the health, livelihood and well-being of millions of families, all to reconcile their budget that seeks first and foremost to cut taxes benefiting the top 1%, who already pay in too little compared to other developed countries. 
This is a cruel, fiscally irresponsible and wildly unpopular budget bill. 
Touting this as a “beautiful” bill is disingenuous and brazen. There is nothing beautiful about denying people cancer treatment. There is nothing beautiful about children going hungry. There is nothing beautiful about prioritizing those already well off at the expense of families just trying to get by.  Should this bill become law, it will cause irreparable damage to families.  
Not in our name
As faith leaders and members of our community, we cannot remain silent to the cruelty unfolding that denies the humanity and dignity of our families, congregants and neighbors. Our policies and our budgets reflect what we value. Yet, what House members passed in the budget bill — and what the Senate is currently considering — defies the values of the vast majority of Americans. No matter our worldview or ideology, most of us recognize the wisdom of the Golden Rule.  
It is troubling to see politicians who claim to be Christian govern in a way antithetical to the core values of the teachings of Jesus.
Biblical writings emphasize again and again the importance of caring for one another, particularly the sick, hungry and vulnerable.  
But do you know what you won’t find in the Bible? Instructions to deny sick people care. A parable advocating for letting a child go hungry. A proverb praising a rich man for stepping on others to amass more wealth for himself. 
Our faith tradition doesn’t only emphasize caring for vulnerable people in our communities because it’s right — and it absolutely is. Our faith tradition emphasizes it because over millennia, societies and people in power needed to be reminded again and again when they lost their way of caring for one another.
To the 215 representatives who voted for the House bill: You most certainly have lost your way. 
Another moral crossroads
We are at another moral crossroads in our country. Will we have a government that makes life better for all? Or will we have a government that aims above all to further enrich the rich on the backs of working families? 
Will we allow our elected leaders to continue to draw sharper, wider lines between the “haves” and “have-nots,” or will we embrace budgets that ensure everyone is better off by making sure everyone has their basic needs met? 
As a country, we have faced identity crises before — of who we are and what we stand for. We’ve wrestled with dark parts of our history tainted by injustice, cruelty and prejudice. We’ve expanded rights, freedoms and protections for those who were too long denied them. Frankly, we’re still wrestling. But we’ve risen to the occasion before, and we must do so now again. 
What the passage of the House bill signals is grave but not guaranteed. 
The House bill passed narrowly by one vote (215-214), four of whom were Minnesota representatives. Now the Senate is deliberating. You can contact your Congress members. You can urge senators to think hard about the budget bill that cuts people’s health care and food assistance. 
If your representative voted for the House bill, politely ask them what kind of government they want to have a hand in making. 
If and when it comes to the House again, insist they do better.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Medicaid-rural.jpg,,,2025-06-27 09:02:32.273604

The Hallsville School District was asking for a $6.5 million bond issue to finance more parking for the growing high school, a new elementary classroom and increased security for schools. And on April 8, nearly 75% of voters approved the measure, and the district launched pre-construction and design work.
But the project came to a halt the afternoon of June 6 when Superintendent Tyler Walker learned the district hadn’t met public-notice requirements before the election. So their bond counsel, the law firm Gilmore & Bell, couldn’t submit the bond issue for certification to the Missouri State Auditor’s Office.
“This was not the fault of the school district,” Walker told The Independent, “yet the school district and the students we educate are unfortunately being punished.”
Hallsville is the only school district to publicly acknowledge issues with its bond measure, but there could be as many as 10 political subdivisions forced to throw out the results of the April election.
Mark Grimm, an attorney with Gilmore & Bell, said in a June 3 email to the auditor’s office that eight to 10 of his firm’s clients may need to put voter-approved bonds back on the ballot because they appear to have fallen short of the state law laying out public notice requirements in the run up to an election. 
 Missouri Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick speaks to reporters about a critical report of the Secretary of State’s office on Jan. 23, 2024 (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).
Notice of a bond issue must be published in local newspapers twice — once two weeks prior to the election and again within one week of the election. In each instance, Grimm wrote, notice ran three and two weeks before the election.
Exactly which bond measures are in jeopardy isn’t clear. The firm couldn’t comment on specifics about its clients, and the auditor’s office — which must certify that local bond measures comply with state law — was not provided with a list.
In an interview with The Independent, Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick said the state law is clear. The last thing he wanted to do was disqualify a voter-approved measure, Fitzpatrick said, but his hands are tied because public notice requirements are very specific and allow no flexibility. 
“If we’re aware of the deficiency,” he said “we can’t knowingly certify that the bonds comply with all the laws.”
Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Shell Knob, acknowledged similar issues with public notice have gone undetected over the years. In fact, an $8.5 million bond measure for the Centralia R-VI School District, Hallsville’s neighbor to the northeast, was certified with similar problems.  
The office has historically relied on bond attorneys like Gilmore & Bell, Fitzpatrick said, to ensure their clients are in compliance with state laws before submitting paperwork for certification. While his staff ensures publication takes place, “it was not part of our process to closely check the dates of the publications.”
“There’s a level of trust that has been historically built into this process,” he said, “because this is a sporadic thing. It’s not something where we have a team of people sitting around all day and their only job is to review these bonds and check every single law.”
Bill Burns, general counsel for Gilmore & Bell, doesn’t agree with the auditor’s position. He believes Missouri law gives Fitzpatrick enough wiggle room to certify voter-approved bonds despite “minor deficiencies relating to publication notices that would not in any way affect the outcome of the election.”
But Fitzpatrick said the law firm should have been on the lookout for these sorts of problems after a dust up in February involving the Higbee Fire Protection District — another Gilmore & Bell client — resulted in a bond measure being refused certification over similar issues. 
“I am surprised that we’re dealing with this now,” he said. “I would expect that bond counsel will be more proactive and communicate with the county clerk on these deals moving forward to make sure the publication dates are where they need to be. But I would have also thought that following the February deal.”
 Higbee Fire Protection District

Over the course of two elections last year, voters in Randolph County approved $1.6 million in bonds to support the Higbee Fire Protection District. It was only supposed to take one election, but the county clerk put the wrong total on the August ballot, requiring the rest of the bonds to be approved in November. 
By February, all that was left for the bonds to finally be issued was the certification of the auditor’s office.
And that’s where things went sideways.
Fitzpatrick’s staff kept asking for a copy of the sample ballot that was published in the newspaper prior to the election. Erick Creach, an attorney with Gilmore & Bell representing the district, instead sent affidavits attesting that the county clerk published a sample ballot.
As it turns out, the reason Creach couldn’t share a copy of the sample ballot was because it was never published as required by law. 
“Erick called first thing this morning,” wrote Leslie Korte, general counsel for the auditor’s office, in a Feb. 26 email obtained by The Independent through Missouri’s Sunshine Law. “He admitted that despite their prior representations and the certification of the clerk, they in fact did not publish the notice as required. For any election. He basically wanted us to let that slide.”

Korte wrote that she informed Creach that the auditor “cannot certify a bond that we know does not comply with state law.”
“I also addressed the secondary issue, which is Gilmore & Bell sending us documents certifying to facts that are not true, and him providing us documents yesterday afternoon identifying them as something they are not,” she wrote. “I told him all bond packages we receive from them going forward will be under heightened scrutiny, and if anything like this happens again, how it is addressed by our office will be escalated.”
Creach responded later that day reiterating that sharing the affidavits wasn’t an attempt to fool anyone but rather to “keep your office updated as I was piecing together the information, which to your point should have been addressed prior to submission of the transcript in the first place.”
The firm, Creach wrote, will “have a call today internally to discuss best practices regarding submission of transcripts and review of documentation to ensure this doesn’t happen in the future.”
Fitzpatrick said in an interview this week that Gilmore & Bell “kind of intended to mislead us on that one, and we were unable to certify those bonds because no publication took place.”
 Brookfield R-III School District

In May, the auditor’s office refused to certify bonds for the Brookfield R-III School District in Linn County, again due to public notice deficiencies. 
Though the school district was not a Gilmore & Bell client, the firm took note and decided it would “submit certain hypothetical fact situations” to the auditor in the hopes of clarifying what could disqualify a bond measure, said Burns, the firm’s general counsel. 
One of the hypotheticals the firm submitted was publication three weeks and two weeks before the election. The auditor’s office confirmed it would not certify under those circumstances. 
Grim responded that “we believe there are 8-10 bond elections from April for political subdivisions we represent where the election authority complied with all publication requirements except the publications fell slightly outside of the two week/one week provision.”
One of those was Hallsville. 
“While we definitely agree that good public policy is to ensure compliance with election laws,” Grimm wrote, “failing to register bonds due to election law technicalities has the result of effectively annulling an election.”
He requested the auditor’s office consider certifying bonds regardless of the public notice issue, with the understanding that “going forward, no such grace will be provided.” And he noted the auditor’s office had just certified a bond for one of the firm’s other clients, Centralia, that had the exact same deficiencies. 
Korte responded in a June 4 email that for Centralia, the auditor’s office “relied on the representation of bond counsel that the bonds complied with all state laws, including state law that dictates when those publications must take place.”
Given the number of state laws that exist to cover the issuance of bonds, Korte wrote, it would not be surprising if over the years a bond was certified “despite having an unknown or undisclosed legal defect.”
“That should never be taken as a tacit approval of any failure to comply with state law,” she wrote. “If anything, it should be used by bond counsel as a cautionary tale causing them to double down on their efforts to ensure they are monitoring their clients’ bonds and advising on how to issue bonds in full compliance.”
 Hallsville School District

Boone County Clerk Brianna Lennon, who oversees elections including publishing notices,  told The Independent that her office intentionally chose to publish sample ballots three and two weeks before the election.
“We have tried, especially this past time, to make sure that we have some (safeguard),” she said. “So if there is a mistake that’s made in one of the weekly papers, we still have a grace period to be able to publish.”
A changing newspaper industry has made it harder to publish sample ballots. After a local paper was bought by a large corporation, Lennon’s office struggled to get edits made of notices and receive proofs prior to printing.
Lennon didn’t think her notice strategy would run into statutory issues, since the heart of the law is to ensure voters are informed. Her office goes beyond the law’s requirements and sends sample ballots in the mail to voters and posts them online in advance of all elections.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Hallsville plans on resubmitting the bond issue for November’s election, which Walker estimates will cost the district “between $10,000 and $20,000.” Until the issue is funded and approved by the state, no payment is due to Gilmore & Bell.
The cost of delaying construction isn’t quantifiable, he said, and will cause “significant planning issues for the district,” with improvements critically needed.
“The safety and education of our students is of utmost importance to all of us in Hallsville,” he said.
Walker felt he had no reason to doubt the district’s bond counsel, since Hallsville previously passed three bond issues with Gilmore & Bell’s assistance, and he knew the firm’s reputation as “one of the best.”
“Districts rely on bond counsel because the process to pass a bond issue and finance a successful issue is a complicated one,” he said. “It requires the assistance of a bond counsel to navigate the legal and financial complexities that are involved in the process from start to finish.”
Fitzpatrick said his office will begin requiring bond counsel to sign an affidavit when submitting paperwork for certification of a bond measure “basically saying that, to the best of their knowledge, all laws have been complied with.”
State lawmakers have also reached out to him, Fitzpatrick said, with interest in changing the public notice law when the legislature reconvenes in January. Burns said his firm agrees that the law needs to be adjusted. 
“The main thing I think that really needs to be changed is becoming more lenient with the date of the publication,” Fitzpatrick said, adding: “There’s a lot of kind of antiquated aspects of it.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/money-e1750989760274-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

,California,2025-06-27 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Five years later, the pandemic still weakens two California employee safety nets",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/pandemic-california-employee-safety-net/,"The state still hasn't fixed problems with its unemployment and workers compensation funds, both of which faltered during the COVID pandemic and haven't recovered.","When the COVID-19 pandemic struck California five years ago, it massively impacted California families not only medically but economically.
As the state forced many businesses to close their doors, 3 million Californians lost their jobs, shooting the state’s unemployment rate up to more than 16%. In turn, two state programs that are supposed to cushion employees from the effects of workplace disruption were hard-hit.
The most obvious impact is what happened to the state’s unemployment insurance program.
As workers were laid off, they filed claims for weekly benefits from the Unemployment Insurance Fund, which is financed by employers through payroll taxes.
However the fund, which had been struggling to pay claims prior to the pandemic, was soon exhausted, and the state borrowed about $20 billion from the federal government to keep benefits flowing.
The Employment Development Department also suffered a managerial implosion, leading to not only the blockage of payments to legitimate claimants, but billions of dollars in payments, mostly out of federal funds, going to fraudsters.
Five years later, not only has the state been unable to claw back the billions in fraudulent payments, but the state’s unemployment fund’s debt to the federal government has continued to grow. Interest charges are piling up, and there’s still a gap between income and outgo even though the state’s unemployment rate today of 5.3% is about a third of what it was in 2020.
The Employment Development Department estimates that the debt will rise to $23.7 billion by the end of 2026, even though federal officials have raised their payroll taxes in California to chip away at the debt. Underlying the issue is a decades-long political stalemate over unemployment insurance benefits and taxes.
The other safety net program affected by the pandemic is workers’ compensation, which provides medical treatment and support payments to employees suffering job-related illnesses and injuries.
Most employers purchase insurance either from private insurers or from the quasi-public State Compensation Insurance Fund to cover employee claims. Some big employers, including state and local governments, self-insure for “work comp,” as it’s dubbed.
An estimated 200,000 work comp claims were filed by COVID-19 victims, even though a connection between the disease and the workplace is tenuous at best.
Nevertheless, those claims and sharp increases in medical costs are being cited by the insurance industry’s Workers’ Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau in seeking an 11.2% increase in employer-paid insurance premiums, tentatively approved by the state Department of Insurance to take effect on Sept. 1.
It’s the latest chapter in the long-running political friction over work comp costs and benefits, which collectively approach $20 billion a year.
Roughly once a decade, the major players in the work comp system — employers, insurers, unions, work comp attorneys and medical care providers — clash over the issue. The last time was in 2012, when then-Gov. Jerry Brown negotiated a compromise that raised benefits but imposed new rules on eligibility for benefits and medical care to save enough money to pay for the increases.
Although opposed by medical providers and attorneys, the deal had the desired impact, including a sharp reduction in insurance costs vis-à-vis payrolls. However, California’s insurance costs, 1.86% of payroll, remain among the highest in the nation, according to a biennial survey by the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, widely considered the most authoritative source of work comp premium data.
The stage would seem to be set for another of the Capitol’s periodic work comp clashes. However, legislation that would have increased cash benefits to disabled workers never made it through the first committee this year, so the contending forces will face off sometime in the future.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/102423-Unemployment-Insurance-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Roberts, 59, is scheduled to be put to death Aug. 21 by nitrogen gas. He is the fourth person the state will put to death this year and the third using that method of execution.
A Marion County jury convicted Roberts of two counts of capital murder in December 1992.
According to court documents, Jones was sleeping at her boyfriend’s den, Wendell Satterfield, where Roberts was also staying. Roberts left his job and went to the Setterfield residence. He packed his belongings, stole money from Jones and shot her three times in the head using a rifle, then set the residence on fire.
The jury voted 7-5 to recommend Roberts be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge overruled the recommendation and sentenced him to death.
After an appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded the case back to the trial court to allow Roberts to present mitigating evidence in hopes of a reduced sentence.

The storied New Orleans restaurant recently pushed for a new state law prohibiting the unauthorized resale of reservations by third-party platforms. (Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.










I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert


The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.










We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


– Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey


Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Steep fines in Iowa set off state-federal showdown over child labor laws

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader.
Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

(Photo: Spencer Dondovan for USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.)The federal government raised its estimate this week for how much oil and gas could be extracted from public lands in Nevada, placing the state third for oil potential.
Nevada holds 1.4 billion barrels of “undiscovered” oil beneath its public lands – only falling behind Alaska and New Mexico – and 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas, according to the newly compiled figures released by the U.S. Geological Survey last week.
“We think there’s resource potential there, and it just so happens there’s a lot of federal land,” said Chris Schenk, the lead author of the report.
The estimates are of “technically recoverable oil and gas resources” — many of which may not be economically viable to extract — that could be retrieved with current technologies. It’s the first time the agency has tallied the amount of oil and gas under national parks, wilderness areas and other public lands nationwide since 1998.
Technology has improved significantly since then, increasing the estimated resources that could potentially be extracted from public lands, according to the report.
The analysis was prepared in response to a directive by the Trump administration to “unleash” domestic energy supplies. In February, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed his agencies to identify energy and critical minerals on public lands.
“American Energy Dominance is more important than ever, and this report underscores the critical role science plays in informing our energy future,” Burgum said in a press release announcing the study.
The report also comes as Republicans in Congress try to push a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Nevada, Utah and other Western states.
Nationally, the analysis estimated 29.4 billion barrels of oil and 391.6 trillion cubic feet of gas lie below all federal lands – enough oil to meet the county’s needs for four years and a dozen years in the case of natural gas.
The last federal analysis of undiscovered oil and gas resources on public lands in 1998, estimated about 7.8 billion barrels of oil and 201 trillion cubic feet of gas. 
Schenk, the lead author of the report, said the analysis uses decades of federal data to estimate the potential for oil and gas where it hasn’t been discovered yet, but there’s still room for “uncertainty.”
“Whenever you’re exploring for resources, whether it’s minerals or oil and gas, there’s uncertainty before you drill,” Schenk said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty, because it’s undiscovered.”
That uncertainty is reflected in the lack of oil and gas leasing in Nevada, despite available data pointing to potential sources in the state.
Nevada lease sales have long drawn little interest from industry. It’s not uncommon for large swaths of nominated land to never get a bid.
For example, the Bureau of Land Management offered five oil and gas parcels in Nevada totaling 6,800 acres this week. None of the parcels received a single bid. Those same parcels also failed to attract any industry interest in 2023 and 2024.
“We recognize that interest in Nevada is lower than other states in the West where development is more economical, such as New Mexico and Wyoming. The scale of this auction, for instance, was small relative to others,” said Aaron Johnson, the vice president of public and legislative affairs for the Western Energy Alliance trade group.
When land does get leased for oil and gas development, it underperforms in auction. From 2015 to 2024, the average bid per acre in Nevada was just $4.10—compared to $4,900 per acre in New Mexico.
Still, the Trump administration has pushed to lease more of Nevada’s public lands including 264,000 acres of public land in Elko County’s Ruby Mountains, a popular hunting and outdoor recreation site in Nevada. 
Drilling opponents remain skeptical that there’s much oil and gas in Nevada or that extracting it would make economic sense any time soon. They think the development push is rooted in speculation. 
“We’ve been leasing these low potential lands since the 1950s,” said Russell Kuhlman, the executive director of the Nevada Wildlife Federation. “We have yet to find anything that would get the oil and gas industry excited.”
Kuhlman said speculative oil and gas leasing in Nevada removes land that would be better suited for the recreation economy, wildlife conservation, or renewable energy development in the state.
Over 90 percent of public lands managed by the Interior Department in Nevada are available to be leased for oil and gas drilling. Once leased, public lands are locked up from being managed for multiple uses such as outdoor recreation and conservation for the life of the lease, which could be 10, 20 or even 30 years.
“That’s really where the issue is, once land is identified as an oil and gas lease, it’s essentially put in that folder and forgotten about by the Bureau of Land Management,” Kuhlman said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/snow-1024x625.png,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Paul Sarlo, the state Senate's budget chair, said Thursday that when lawmakers eye certain tax hikes, it's ""always a difficult ask and a difficult choice to make.""  (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Budget panels in both legislative chambers approved a series of tax increases on Thursday meant to keep New Jersey’s books balanced in the fiscal year that begins July 1, but legislators stopped short of a vote on the full budget.
Lawmakers advanced proposals that would raise fees on the sale of certain expensive buildings, hike cigarette and nicotine taxes, and push up tax rates on online gambling and sports betting in a bid to keep the state’s budget above water.
Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate budget chairman, said the tax hikes would help Gov. Phil Murphy keep his pledge to pass along a $6 billion surplus to the next governor. Murphy leaves office in January.
“Any time you have to tax an industry or ask someone to put more money in, it’s always a difficult ask and a difficult choice to make,” Sarlo said.
The full budget did not get a vote Thursday, with lawmakers saying the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services was still drafting the bill after negotiators reached an agreement on how much New Jersey would spend in the next fiscal year.
Budget committees are expected to vote on the bill at 8 p.m. Friday, with votes before both full chambers planned for Monday, the last day they have to pass a budget without shutting down the state government.
Republican members, who broadly opposed the tax bills advanced Thursday, expressed some frustration over the budget process, noting the timing of the committee’s vote on the budget bill made it likely that few would see the vote.
“This overall process, none of us is happy with,” said Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth), the chamber’s GOP budget officer. “If you got something you want to release in the dark of night when no one’s paying attention, everybody knows you put it after 4:30 on a Friday in the summer.”
Among the tax hikes approved Thursday was a bill that would raise tax rates on online gambling and sports betting to 19.75%, from 15% and 13%, respectively. The proposal, earlier reported by the Press of Atlantic City, resembles a pitch the governor made in his budget address that called for the state to raise tax rates on online gambling to 25%.
The governor’s proposal was set to generate $402.4 million in additional revenue in the coming July-to-June fiscal year. The reduction from 25% to $19.75% would reduce those collections by about $85 million.
“Any time there’s anything that could negatively impact our casinos in Atlantic City, we want to just raise our concerns because Atlantic City is kind of the powerhouse of South Jersey, and we don’t want to do anything to impact their competitiveness with other states,” said Hilary Chebra, director of government affairs for the Chamber of Commerce of South Jersey. “We do appreciate that it is less than what the governor proposed.”
Some lawmakers have pushed to raise the state’s tax rates on casinos’ online gambling winnings, noting that New Jersey’s existing rates are far out of step with its neighbors. New York levies a 51% tax on casinos’ winnings from online sports betting, while Pennsylvania’s online sports betting rate is 36%.
Sen. John McKeon (D-Essex), the bill’s prime sponsor, initially pitched raising New Jersey’s rates to 30%.
Legislators made broader changes to a separate Murphy proposal that would have doubled the 1% fee on property sales valued above $1 million and imposed an overall 3% fee on those worth more than $2 million.
Under the Legislature’s version, the fee would remain at 1% for homes worth between $1 million and $2 million but rise for more expensive homes, climbing to 2% for homes worth between $2 million and $2.5 million and rising by an additional half percentage point for every $500,000 in value, to a cap of 3.5% on property worth more than $3.5 million.
“This is one thing I wish didn’t have to be included, but I also fully understand the need to balance a budget, provide necessary revenue, to continue to work down our structural deficit, to provide a healthy surplus,” Sarlo said.
Lawmakers made another significant change: Their version of the tax would be paid by sellers rather than by buyers, as is the case under current law. The change would reduce owners’ profits from the sale of property but reduce upfront costs for home buyers.
Murphy’s proposal was expected to generate $317 million in additional state revenue in the next fiscal year, though revenue relying on home sales can be highly volatile. Sarlo said legislators’ version would raise about $282 million and impact between 2% and 3% of home sales.
The bill calls for the state to refund the difference in fees for a property that was sold before July 10 and whose deeds were recorded no later than Nov. 15, 2025.
The committee’s vote on the so-called mansion tax measure was delayed by hours. When it first came up for a vote, the panel’s Republican members had not seen the current version. When it was brought up a second time hours later, the measure had been amended again to allow additional time for homes to be sold and face the lower fee.
Lawmakers also approved a bill that would raise the state’s cigarette tax to $3 per pack, from $2.70, and triple tax rates on electronic cigarette cartridges to 30 cents per milliliter or 30% of the retail price for bottled fluid.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sarlo-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

It used be that we tried to make America great by making it a vibrant, welcoming, open, prosperous place where we were proud to welcome people from other places.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Moats: Wresting people from their families is no way to solve our border problem.","This commentary is by David Moats of Salisbury. He is editorial page editor emeritus of the Rutland Herald, where he won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for a series of editorials on Vermont’s civil union law.


Three federal judges in Vermont have played a leading role in trying to establish constitutional protections against the unlawful seizure and imprisonment of people by arbitrary government force.
These three cases are a small sample of the vast program of immigration enforcement launched by President Trump in order to deport thousands of immigrants to El Salvador or South Sudan or wherever he can send them. Such a program could not be anything but brutal. Justice takes time — to hold hearings and consider individual cases. We are all individuals deserving of justice, and our immigration status does not alter that constitutional reality.
The cruelty of the program has become apparent to millions of Americans who turned out in all 50 states on June 14 to declare that America is not a nation of kings.
By the logic of the Trump administration, all those millions could well have been rounded up and imprisoned in some vast gulag. After all, the administration has advanced the idea that protest itself may be antithetical to the national interest. And dissenting views seemed to be the only specified basis for the seizure of foreign nationals in two of the Vermont cases.
One of those foreign nationals, Mohsen Mahdawi, is a lawful resident of Vermont and a student from Columbia University, where he was also a pro-Palestinian activist. His activism, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, could “potentially undermine” U.S. foreign policy.
The absurdity of Mahdawi’s arrest, and of Rubio’s claim, was compounded by the fact that masked and armed ICE agents seized him after he had turned up in Colchester for a citizenship interview. In other words, he was doing everything right. While in prison, he has said he felt empathy for his father and other relatives on the West Bank who had been imprisoned by Israelis. But as it turned out, U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford saw no justification for his detention and ordered his release.
In another case, a Turkish woman, Rümeysa Öztürk, was grabbed off the street in Somerville, Mass. by masked government agents and whisked away in a car. In ordering her release from a Louisiana detention center, U.S. District Judge William Sessions found the government’s justification for her detention to be pathetically weak. What had she done? She had co-authored an op-ed piece for a student newspaper supporting Palestinian rights. 
But of course, this is what people in America do — they express wide-ranging views on issues of their choosing. Rather than undermining American policy, this freedom is a bulwark of our democracy, drawing people here from all over the world, seeking to participate in that freedom. The Johnson and Nixon administrations thought that dissent on the Vietnam War was inimical to American interests, even if history proved that dissent on the war was pointing the nation in the right direction. 
In a third case, U.S. District Judge Christina Reiss found that there was no basis for the government’s case against Russian scientist Kseniia Petrova, whom it had held in detention for four months. She had entered the country with frog embryos obtained from a lab in France to further her research at Harvard Medical School. Not only was her detention illegal, but it represented a further chilling assault on science. The most brilliant scientists from abroad have long sought to come to the United States, but now they are wondering why they should.
Vermonters are familiar with these three cases. But multiply them by the thousands, and we gain an understanding of the outpouring of protest in downtown Los Angeles, and in other cities, as well as the recent No Kings marches in every state. Brutality seems to be not an accident, but a feature of the administration’s policy.
It was on display in the manhandling and cuffing of Sen. Alex Padilla. His crime? Showing up at a press conference and daring to ask a question of Kristi Noem, secretary of homeland security. That was followed later by the manhandling of Brad Lander, New York City comptroller, also on a bogus charge.
It used to be that public officials knew how to handle questions that made them uncomfortable. It was part of their job. Now the job seems to be the deployment of force to send the message that dissent won’t be tolerated.
Except dissent is spreading in all parts of the country. Wresting people away from their families, sending them off to who-knows-where — this is not right, and it is no way to solve the border problem. The government will argue that making life miserable for foreigners here will dissuade others from coming.
It used be that we tried to make America great by making it a vibrant, welcoming, open, prosperous place where we were proud to welcome people from other places. Not American carnage, but America the beautiful.

Like marriage, love unites. And, ten years after Obergefell, I’ve come to see that love doesn’t just win — it transcends.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Meg York: Reflections on 10 years of marriage equality.","This commentary is by Meg York of Montpelier. She is director of LGBTQ+ family law and policy and senior policy counsel at Family Equality. She recently advocated for updated protections for LGBTQ+ families in Vermont — confirmatory adoption — a bipartisan effort signed into law by Gov. Phil Scott in May.


Jocelyn hugged her knees to her chest as she sat on the floor. I sprawled on the industrial carpet, gazing at her curling hair, her soft blue eyes, her awkward cuteness. It was a queer-straight alliance meeting. She was there as queer. I was a straight ally, or so I thought.
Raised in a conservative, evangelical home, being queer never crossed my mind. When something’s not an option, you don’t consider it. But in my mid-twenties, I began to reconsider myself.
Jocelyn and I became fast friends, doing everything together. We spent time outdoors, organized reproductive rights demonstrations and marched in the streets over the unjust outcome of Proposition 8, which banned same-sex couples from marrying in California where we lived. We laughed. We cried.
I came out as a lesbian.
My parents were shocked. They asked why I was choosing to hurt them. They admonished me not to tell my extended family. “Love the sinner, hate the sin,” they said — except none of it felt like love.
Early mornings, Jocelyn and I would walk together. We recited Mary Oliver poems and planned our wild and precious lives. Days turned into months, months turned into years. We found a new version of love. I am going to marry this woman, I thought.
We got engaged on a bridge in Central Park. I had never seen Jocelyn smile so brightly. In early spring, the trees were just beginning to bud. Jocelyn adorned her hair with little pink flowers. I took photo after photo. I couldn’t get enough of her.
We were in love, but our families were in turmoil. “It’s not God’s plan,” they cried. Though Jocelyn’s parents were more supportive than mine, their acceptance had limits. “Maybe if you just don’t call it a wedding…” We hugged, grieved, and moved to Vermont — one of the few states at the time with the freedom to marry.
We were married in 2012 in Chester. It was just Jocelyn and me. It was beautiful and painful. We longed to be surrounded by friends and family.
For several years, we enjoyed newlywed bliss and navigated administrative challenges. We hiked, swam, skied and paid extra for health insurance because federally, I wasn’t Jocelyn’s spouse. Evenings, we danced in the kitchen, the aroma of cast-iron cooking in the air. We filed taxes, jointly (Vermont) and single (federal). It was love, marriage and enough red tape to make anyone’s head spin.
In 2015, Obergefell v. Hodges affirmed the freedom to marry nationwide and struck down state-level bans. At the same time, my parents were beginning to come around. We breathed a sigh of relief.
Five years into our marriage, we shared that we were trying to get pregnant. My parents fell silent. “Kids need a mom and a dad, Meg.” It felt like the progress we had made was falling away. Like a road in Vermont. Like mud season.
But then, spring arrived: My daughter was born, and then my second daughter, and then my son. And in those years, as my parents watched us raising our three young children, something changed. Last week, my mom commented how thankful she is to have gained another daughter in Jocelyn, and how she couldn’t ask for better parents for her grandchildren.
My parents aren’t going to be marching in any pride parades anytime soon. Yet, as they have seen what marriage equality means to us and the stability it provides their grandchildren, they have come around. Our lives have touched their hearts and helped them understand that our family is as deserving of love and respect as any other family.
Today, most people in our country support marriage equality. This year, attempts to urge the Supreme Court to overturn the Obergefell decision, issued 10 years ago this month, made headlines but ultimately failed — thanks in part to Republican opposition.
Some conservative lawmakers called it cruel to revoke a right couples and families now rely on. Others, despite personal objections, said it’s not their job to invalidate this freedom. In this age of extreme division, that is a victory. 
I want people to embrace the full humanity of LGBTQ+ people like me. Like my wife. I want them to see our family and how beautiful it all is. How we must protect equality and legal family security. I’ll never stop working toward that goal. At Family Equality, I work daily to protect LGBTQ+ families and our children in Vermont and nationwide.
Acceptance can be long, slow and complicated. I know this at the core of my being. I know this in my bones. But I’ve seen that living authentically can open hearts and minds. Love is raw and beautiful and uncomfortable and real.
Like marriage, love unites. And, ten years after Obergefell, I’ve come to see that love doesn’t just win — it transcends.

“I’m concerned that if we were to go as expansive as you’re suggesting that these schools, police stations, fire stations that would likely close in many communities because of lack of revenue,” said Supreme Court Justice Christopher Goff.
  Indiana Supreme Court Justice Christoper Goff asks a question during a hearing on June 24, 2024. (Screen shot from oral arguments)
But homeowners would save money if more acreage was classified under the 1% percent cap. It would also put an additional administrative burden on assessors to examine the use of property — rather than the one-acre limit in effect today.
Hoosier voters approved property tax limits in 2010 capping bills at 1% of the property’s assessed value for homesteads; 2% for other residential property and farmland; 3% for business. Increases from separately approved referendums are outside those limits.
Plaintiffs in the case believe the corresponding state law limiting the 1% cap to your dwelling and one acre of land conflicts with the constitutional provision.
There were no estimates on how much land the case might impact. The median lot size in Indiana is 9,200 square feet while the average is closer to 13,000 square feet. An acre is 43,560 square feet.
Lawmakers recently passed a bill to reduce homeowner property taxes next year but income taxes could make up the difference.
The case at hand
Taxpayers in this case – Dr. Tulsi and Kamini Sawlani — have 3.9 acres of land. The Lake County Assessor has limited the 1% cap to one acre, leaving the remaining 2.9 under 2% cap. Their attorney said this costs them about $ 1,000 annually.
Gerold Stout, arguing on behalf of the Sawlani’s, said most Hoosiers assumed when voting for the tax caps that their entire property would count as their homestead regardless of size.
The Indiana Tax Court found the one-acre limitation unconstitutional because it conflicts with the constitutional language that includes “curtilage” as part of a principal place of residence.
  Chief Justice Loretta Rush highlighted court accomplishments with lawmakers during the annual 2023 State of the Judiciary. (Monroe Bush for Indiana Capital Chronicle)
By definition, a curtilage is the area of land attached to a house — typically including the yard, garden, and outbuildings, and considered legally part of the dwelling. But state law doesn’t define it.
Instead, lawmakers used the one-acre limitation, which Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush noted dates back to 1979.
She and other justices noted that the Tax Court decision makes it a case-by-case decision by assessors in 92 counties, meaning it could apply differently from community to community even though there is also a constitutional mandate for a uniform and equal property tax system.
Rush asked Stout to define curtilage, which he could not. He instead said it depends on how a homeowner is using the land.
“How many times did you play volleyball? What if you didn’t mow it?” Rush asked. “It seems a little happenstance.”
Stout conceded assessors would have to talk to homeowners to decide how they use it.
Defending the law
That’s why lawyers for the Lake County Assessor and the Attorney General’s Office argued the tax court decision should be reversed.
Ayn Engle, representing Lake County, said lawmakers were well within their exclusive authority to define curtilage at one acre.
“The tax court usurped the legislatures’ broad authority … and acted more as a legislative body than a judicial branch.” she said.
While Engle conceded the court could narrowly rule against the specific homeowners in the case because they didn’t provide evidence supporting their curtilage claim, she encouraged the court to decide the merits of the one-acre limitation.

“I think if assessors are required to look at more than one acre, you’re going to have assessors doing things differently across counties,” Engle said.
She said waiting would just kick the can down the road a year or two and assessors need clear rules now.
“I’ve been a judge a long time. That’s just the way it works. People come coming, people keep bringing cases,” Goff said.
Deputy Solicitor General Jenna Lorence conceded there “might” be specific circumstances in which the one-acre limitation could be found unconstitutional, but said that is for another day.
Justice Mark Mass said, “I’m a little confused. As I understand you are tasked with defending the constitutionality of state statutes. And here, today, you’re suggesting that this statute could be unconstitutional as applied … You seem to be arguing both sides of this.”
Several groups have filed briefs in the case and also participated in the arguments, including the Association of Indiana Counties and the Indiana Association of Realtors.

(Photo: Alejandra Rubio for Nevada Current)Legislation expanding protections for reproductive health providers, offering support around breastfeeding, and requiring schools to release data when law enforcement use force against students are among the bills taking effect July 1.
There are 191 bills slated to take effect next month, with a significant portion making appropriations to various state departments and agencies.
Among the list of laws going into effect is Assembly Bill 266, which prohibits people who are breastfeeding from being denied access to public accommodations.
The legislation also requires Nevada Department of Health and Human Services to provide online resources around breastfeeding, including information about Medicaid coverage for counseling and lactation support.
Democratic Assemblymember Cecelia González, the bill’s sponsor, told her colleagues in May that there are enough challenges to breastfeeding. Lacking protections to breastfeed in public or information about available community resources shouldn’t be another barrier, she said.
An original version of the bill sought to make denying accommodations to people breastfeeding a misdemeanor but that provision was removed.
The bill received strong support in both chambers, six Republicans – Assemblymembers Jill Dickman, Lisa Cole, Rich Delong and state Sens. Carrie Ann Buck, Robin Titus John Ellison – voted against the bill.
“This bill is important because it acknowledges the struggles that many new mothers face and it aims to provide the support they need to succeed in their breastfeeding journeys,” González said during the hearing in May. “By increasing access to resources to lactation consultants, peer support and workplace accommodations, we can ensure that no mother feels alone or unsupported during one of the most challenging and rewarding times.”
 Protections for medical providers

Since the overturning of Roe v Wade in 2022, reproductive health workers have seen “increased violence and harassment,” including stalking and death threats, Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth of Reno said in a May hearing.
Assembly Bill 235 would ensure employees and volunteers of reproductive health care facilities would be better protected. 
The bill, sponsored by Roth, allows those who work or volunteer in reproductive care the ability to request a court order that keeps their personal information confidential on otherwise public records within the offices of county recorder, county assessor, county clerk, city clerk, Secretary of State, or Department of Motor Vehicles. Their spouses, domestic partners or minor children could also request a court order.
Alexis Solis, the interim director of Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, told lawmakers in May that the political environment in the last few years has become more divisive, hostile, “and in some cases for our staff, dangerous.”
“Providers and Planned Parenthood staff in Nevada have been targeted with religious mail, have had anti-abortion propaganda physically dropped off at their homes, have received numerous threatening phone calls and have experienced numerous threatening incidents in Planned Parenthood health centers in Las Vegas,” Solis told lawmakers.
The legislation passed the Assembly 33-9 with bipartisan support. In the upper chamber, only Republican state Sen. Lori Rogich joined Democrats in support.
 FAFSA for incarcerated

Assembly Bill 153 offers assistance to people incarcerated within the Nevada Department of Corrections in completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to potentially receive aid, such as pell grants, to pay for prison education programs.   
People leaving prisons who are able to find meaningful employment are less likely to recidivate, said the bill’s sponsor, Democratic Assemblymember Brittney Miller. 
“By equipping individuals with knowledge and skills, educational programs within the correctional facilities can significantly improve their prospects upon release,” she said.
AB 153 passed out of both chambers nearly unanimously. Only Republican state Sens. Robin Titus and Lisa Kranser voted against the bill.
 Other bills going into effect


Assembly Bill 420, also by González, requires school districts in Clark and Washoe counties to report data on use of force against students and when police officers use pepper spray or tasers. The first annual report is due before the first day of the 2026-27 academic year and will cover the 2025-26 school year, which begins in August.
Senate Bill 348, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Julie Pazina, increases the fee hospitals pay the Nevada State Public Health Lab for newborn screenings. The additional funds will be used to expand the number of rare but treatable conditions newborns in Nevada are screened for. The prior rate had been the same for more than a decade and kept Nevada behind what the federal government recommends for newborn screening.
Senate Bill 116, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Skip Daly, establishes a formula to authorize the pay raises for the elected county positions such as district attorney, sheriff, county clerk, county assessor, county recorder, county treasurer and public administrator. The formula keeps those public servants’ pay above the highest paid person in their office. The raises will go into effect July 1 with the new fiscal year.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/little-flags-scaled-e1717251573683-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

“You know, as I stand here, I’m reminded about the things that make Indiana an amazing state, one of the best states in the union, by far, because of integrity, hard work, dedication and excellence. I think there is not a better group of students that embody that than FFA members and students,” he said.
Beckwith recalled growing up in the world of agriculture with his father as president of the Michigan Dairy Association.
He encouraged the students to think beyond themselves.
“What are you leaving? What are you giving back? What are you doing to serve your fellow man, your community, your friends, your family and those that will come after you?” Beckwith asked.
He said the best leaders in his life were the ones who would sacrifice themselves to uplift others.
“That is the mark of a true leader … And those are the people that everybody wants to be around.”

Beckwith also encouraged the young Hoosiers to have empathy and be sensitive to what others are going through on life.
“You need to be walking with them, doing life with them, you know, linking arms with them. And if you do that, you’re going to be somebody that for years to come, will be very successful. No matter where your steps take you, you will be successful in everything you do.”
Braun started his speech by talking about his time in the U.S. Senate and then told the teens that he gets up early each day — without using an alarm clock — to pack as much into his day as he can.
He said most people know him as running a successful automative business, but one of the most enjoyable times of his life was as a farmer. And he stressed how important it was for he and his wife to return to their hometown of Jasper.
“You’re going to have a lot of forks in the road, and the more you get involved in what you like, it’s gonna prepare you for whatever you choose to do,” Braun said.
“You never know where life is going to take you. All I can tell you, is you’re showing right here that you’re going to be a mover and a shaker. You’re probably in the arena that I’ve enjoyed most, being a tree farmer and involved in the row crop side of it, having that turkey farm. If you get up each day, you view it with opportunity. You work hard. You never know where life might take you. Someday, you might even decide to get into public service.”
The governor ended by telling the students not to afraid of challenges.
“Always be willing to stick your neck out and take a little risk, otherwise, you’ll get down the trail and maybe be disappointed that you didn’t do more.”
I know these aren’t the kind of speeches that elected officials can give every day. They have to focus intently sometimes on budgeting, taxes and policy. But for one day it was a fond departure. And I hope the kids enjoyed it as much as I did.

But earlier this month, the Trump administration threw this process into flux when it overhauled guidance on how states nationwide should select applicants for the more than $42 billion in funding. The move effectively nullifies hundreds of applications already received, and sets Washington and other states on a tight timeline to figure out who should get money. 
“Two years of working on it and all of a sudden we’re supposed to switch on a dime or less, on a pinhead,” said state Rep. Cindy Ryu, a Democrat from Shoreline who chairs the House Technology, Economic Development and Veterans Committee.
Perhaps the biggest change to the federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment, or BEAD, program concerns what technology will be prioritized. 
The program originally favored expanding fiber-optic cables, but the new rules require a “technology neutral” stance because “the full force of the competitive marketplace must be utilized,” according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
This agnostic approach creates room for satellite, fixed wireless and other technologies, which has the potential to send billions more to Elon Musk’s Redmond-based Starlink internet service. Musk served previously as a top adviser to President Donald Trump and spent upward of $200 million to help get Trump elected last year.
The BEAD program was created under the federal infrastructure law that former President Joe Biden signed in 2021. It was fashioned as a way to expand high-speed internet service into rural areas and other parts of the country where it was unavailable or lacking.
In Washington, local applicants looking to get some of that money include private companies, public utilities, tribes, nonprofits, local governments and more. The state has said it will offer $300 million in matching funds for local governments and tribes.
This year, Washington’s broadband office received hundreds of applications from across the state, and provisionally awarded money to some applicants. 
Other states were further behind than Washington, and now face application rounds as short as four days to meet new deadlines set by the Trump administration, said Aaron Wheeler, director of the Washington State Broadband Office, in a webinar last week.
“We were coming to the end, so we’ve got kind of a few of these things in place, but it does mean that there were some things that needed to be adjusted on the fly,” Wheeler said.
Washington expects to open up the next round of applications in early July. States have until early September to submit final plans on how to spend their portions to the federal government. The feds say they’ll review those plans within 90 days. 
The guidelines from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration aim to streamline the process, reduce costs, speed up deployment and increase marketplace competition, according to the agency. They eliminate a mandate to analyze climate resilience, and provisions related to open access, low-cost service plans and labor requirements.
State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyen noted that Musk’s Starlink is a Washington-based company.
“Over 60% of the satellites currently in orbit are made right here in our state,” he said.
“As the federal guidelines evolve to allow more alternative technologies, we will continue to work closely with partners across the state to make sure we do not miss this generational opportunity to deliver broadband access to every community,” Nguyen added.
An applicant’s perspective
The Kitsap Public Utility District remains laser-focused on fiber-optic cable as the solution to poor internet access. 
Experts see wired service as the gold standard for fast, reliable internet. 
Claire Ward, a telecom strategist at the Kitsap County utility, fears it’ll now be a “race to the bottom” for other applicants seeking cheaper options to expand access. To her, while there is room for satellite and fixed wireless as solutions, they would serve more as band-aids than long-term fixes.
On Wednesday, two members of Washington’s congressional delegation, Sen. Maria Cantwell and Rep. Suzan DelBene, made that point to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
“We made the decision to invest larger sums now in broadband infrastructure that would be resilient and capable of meeting Americans’ growing digital demands for decades,” reads the letter they signed alongside dozens of lawmakers.
Ward hopes Washington will still lean into fiber under a provision in the original bipartisan infrastructure law that says “priority broadband projects” funded under BEAD must be designed “designed to provide broadband service that meets speed, latency, reliability, consistency in quality of service, and related criteria” that can be scaled to meet evolving technology needs. 
Only fiber could meet that requirement, Ward and others say.
The moving goalposts have left Ward feeling tired. She’s worried applicants who now need to reapply for funding will run out of resources and give up on the program. 
“I hope that they will be able to dig in their heels,” she said.
She doesn’t want to see the broadband program fall the way of the federal Rural Digital Opportunity Fund started under the first Trump administration, which has seen many providers default and rural areas left without any improved service.
In six months, Ward thinks, the state will know how well BEAD will serve Washington.
In the background
Broadband officials are also grappling with an unpopular provision tucked into the massive tax cut and spending bill Republicans are considering in Congress. 
The sweeping legislation, now in the Senate, would impose a 10-year ban on state regulation of artificial intelligence. If states don’t follow the prohibition on enforcing new or existing laws, the federal government would rescind the federal broadband funding. 
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown has said the ban would jeopardize the state’s laws on deepfakes in political advertising and fabricated sexual images known as “revenge porn.” Dozens of attorneys general from Republican- and Democratic-led states oppose the measure, arguing they can’t rely on Congress to adequately regulate artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, at this tumultuous moment, Wheeler, the director of Washington’s broadband office, is stepping down Friday. Wheeler, who was appointed in March 2024, is taking a job with the Suquamish Tribe. The state Department of Commerce, which houses the broadband office, expects to name an interim director while recruiting for a permanent leader.
“That person’s preferences of technology are going to have a big impact on how the Washington state BEAD program plays out,” Ward said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/laptop-internet-broadband-computer.jpeg,,,2025-06-27 08:03:36.022175

Jackson Public Schools will take them. 
The district, in partnership with Women for Progress of Mississippi, is hosting its annual “Stuff the Bus” event, where people can drop off much-needed classroom supplies for JPS teachers. 
Volunteers are taking donations from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday at the Interstate-55 Kroger and the Walmart near Mississippi Highway 18. Buses are stationed at both sites to collect supplies. 
Items in high demand include dry-erase markers, scissors, staplers, hole punchers, pencils, pens, crayons, notebooks, tissue and paper of all kinds. In lieu of supplies, the district is also accepting gift cards to be used for classroom needs.
“We are incredibly grateful to our lead sponsors and all community members who step up each year to support our teachers,” said Thea Faulkner, director of the district’s Partners in Education program that focuses on connecting the community to the schools, in a statement. “Your generosity makes a real difference in our classrooms.”
The donations might be especially important this year. Schools across the country and state are preparing for the upcoming school year with a tighter purse than usual, thanks to the Trump administration’s decision to freeze some federal funds.

Balloons, unicorn headbands and crayons adorned the inside of the Michigan Hall of Justice, where the state supreme court meets, as members of the judicial system and child welfare system joined reunified families to celebrate the work it takes to restore families.
Through coordination between courts and child welfare professionals, parents who are struggling and need support in order to reunify with their children are given opportunities in family courts to be met with opportunity, not punishment, Cavanagh said. 
“It is not an easy journey for these parents or their children, but their resilience and strength in staying the course makes it all the more worthwhile when they get to live together as a family. At the center of all of it is love,” Cavanagh said. “Love is what brings families back together against all odds. Love is what makes Reunification Day possible, and love is what puts the smile on these faces and the tears in our eyes.”

In order to promote healing in the state, the child welfare system in Michigan needs to continuously ask hard questions on how things can be improved to best serve communities, Demetrius Starling, senior deputy director of Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ Children’s Services Administration said. 
But at the heart of child welfare, Starling said the goal is to make Michigan a state that not only protects children, but restores families.
Separating children from their parents for the family’s welfare can be a traumatic experience for everyone involved, and is not a decision made lightly, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Lisa McCormick said. As the judge that presides over the county’s family division, McCormick thanked the child welfare professionals, foster parents and family relatives in the room that have stood with parents as they navigate reunification.
Reunified families who received support in family court in Ingham County joined in sharing their stories of how the services they received during the reunification process changed their lives.

Jamie Hodge told the crowd she still remembers forcing a smile and waving at her children so they would be less scared while child protective services took them away.
“When I became a mother, I experienced a kind of love like nothing I’d ever felt before, a kind of love that made me want to be the best mom I could possibly be. I would have never believed then that I would ever struggle with homelessness, addiction and my children being removed,” Hodge said.
Nothing in her life has been more heart-wrenching than watching her kids be taken away, Hodge said, and the experience left her bedridden for days. She said the only thing that motivated her to continue was the hope of reunification.
Family recovery court in Ingham County was a guiding light to recovery, Hodge said. It provided support and guidance on how to navigate getting her children back.

While working towards reunification, Hodge said the resources the court provided helped her get into treatment for addiction, gain employment and rent a house.
“I had a judge who believed in me and who helped me learn to advocate for myself and never gave up on me. I had a village. I was able to take such a hard time and turn it into an opportunity,” Hodge said, joined by her children at the event Thursday.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)While utility consumers grapple with skyrocketing costs, lawmakers say they are looking for ways to keep electricity affordable and demand accountability from power companies. 
Led by Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Somerset), a group of bipartisan lawmakers announced a package of six bills intended to modernize New Jersey’s electric grid and keep rates stable. The state has previously relied on utility companies to upgrade the grid, but things haven’t moved fast enough — leaving it to the Legislature to act, Zwicker told reporters Thursday at the Statehouse in Trenton.
“Our transmission lines, as I’m sure some of you have heard, are unprepared to deal with the skyrocketing demand for energy. New innovations, such as electric cars, appliances, AI-based technology, all require massive amounts of electricity,” Zwicker said. “We are right now plugging 21st-century technology into a 20th-century energy grid, and the problems continue to mount.”
Democrats have blamed PJM Interconnection, the regional transmission organization that oversees and controls the electric grid for 12 states, including New Jersey, for the spike in electric bills seen starting this month. They have called for an investigation of the company’s capacity market auction, a price-setting auction that saw a nearly tenfold increase over the previous sale last July.
“If you’re hearing, as you drive through New Jersey, blood-curdling screams, they’re real, and they’re from the citizens of the state,” said Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex). “People are going to be unbelievably angry, and they should be unbelievably angry.” 
Some of the bills in the package announced Thursday would: 

Require artificial intelligence data centers and crypto mining facilities to submit an energy plan to the Board of Public Utilities and mandate certain renewable energy for AI and crypto newly coming to New Jersey. 
Establish a program to “facilitate the development of energy-related projects.”
Create a new incentive program to redevelop decommissioned power plant sites into fusion energy hubs. 

Lawmakers said three other bills would be filed Thursday.
Smith stressed that New Jersey has to work in conjunction with the 13 states and the District of Columbia that PJM also oversees. Even if New Jersey rejected data center plans here, he noted, they could still be built in places like Virginia using the same electric grid New Jersey relies on. 
He suggested that without major reforms at PJM, New Jersey should considering working with another regional transmission organization. These organizations are supposed to keep power costs as low as possible, “and clearly, that’s not working with PJM anymore,” Smith added.  
Smith said New Jersey could absolutely remain with PJM, but “they know they have a problem.” 
“It’s unfair, inherently unfair to everybody out there in New Jersey. So I think putting that out there — let’s investigate,” he said. “Could we have a better deal someplace else? Should we do it ourselves? It’s smart for New Jersey to do it.”
New Jersey Republicans have blamed Democrats and Gov. Phil Murphy’s energy policies for the price hike, criticizing Murphy’s focus on offshore wind projects that have yet to materialize and have been blocked by the Trump administration.
Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) said New Jersey is “being held hostage,” echoing other Democrats who have claimed PJM is keeping prices high by refusing to connect various renewable energy sources to its grid.
“Bottom line is very simple — Legislature has to concentrate on what we can do and be effective. Modernizing the grid is real. It should happen,” he said. “We shouldn’t have to tell the utilities to do it. We should not have to direct the BPU to do it.” 
PJM has previously blamed the current price spike on a divergence between supply and demand.
“These higher prices are the result of a loss in electricity supply caused primarily by decarbonization policies that have led to an uptick in generator retirements, coupled with an unprecedented spike in electricity demand due largely to the advancement of data centers to power artificial intelligence, the electrification of vehicles and heating systems, and the onshoring of U.S. manufacturing,” Dan Lockwood, a spokesperson for PJM, told the New Jersey Monitor earlier this month.

Regardless, a report issued Thursday by the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan estimated that the proposed cuts would result in at least 200,000 state residents no longer having health care coverage either through directly losing access to their plan, or by service providers that rely heavily on Medicaid funding to operate going belly up.
The report noted that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage to approximately a quarter of Michigan’s more than ten million residents and has taken on a larger role over the past two decades, mainly due to enrollment spikes from economic downturns following the 2009 Great Recession and 2020 COVID pandemic, as well as the 2014 expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to certain low-income, non-disabled adults. Michigan was one of 40 states that exercised that option.
“We want to help establish the public understanding of how Medicaid works,” Eric Lupher, the council’s president, said. “Medicaid has such a large impact on the state, both as a share of the state budget and in terms of how many people have health insurance through the program. This paper gives people the information they need to understand the debate and prepare for what might happen if the legislation is enacted.”
The council’s report, which was issued prior to the parliamentarian’s ruling that the GOP proposal violated the Senate’s rules, was based on the original numbers. It says if substantial cuts are made to Medicaid as currently being proposed in the “big, beautiful bill”, Michigan stands to lose at least $2 billion per year in Medicaid revenue, and as much as $4 billion, resulting in policymakers having to decide between drastically cutting back the program, making reductions elsewhere in the state budget, or finding new revenue sources to make up the shortfall, “none of which are attractive options.”
Memo1180-Federal_Medicaid_Cuts_Will_Have_Big_Consequences_in_Michigan
Additionally, the proposed Medicaid cuts would likely have a negative outcome on local hospitals, particularly in rural areas. 
“If Medicaid spending is reduced substantially, some rural providers are likely to become unviable, which will not only impact those losing Medicaid coverage but also affect people living in those areas who have secure, private coverage,” the report stated.
The GOP bill is intended to extend the 2017 tax cuts made during President Donald Trump’s first term, as well as make spending reductions in an effort to vastly shrink the size of the federal government.
A report released in May by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services estimated as many as 700,000 Michiganders could lose coverage if the Medicaid cuts were to win approval, with calculations indicating that upwards of 40% of them would be dropped due to the implementation of work requirements.
The research council’s report concurred in that overall assessment, saying that while the precise estimates vary, expanded work requirements will result in significantly less people being eligible for Medicaid coverage. However, it said that would mostly be due to the “administrative burden” of fulfilling the requirements, not necessarily because the recipients did not truly have a need for assistance.
“Differing opinions exist as to whether the people who will be unenrolled due to work requirements should receive benefits from the program, but the fact that the requirements will decrease enrollment is intentional,” the report stated.
The council said one goal of the report was to provide insight into the complexity of the federal-state Medicaid partnership in delivering health care coverage while also supporting the state’s health care system.
“As a matter of policy, Medicaid is relatively complicated, so it is not always easy to understand how a change in the law might impact the actual delivery of health care on the ground,” Karley Abramson, the research council’s associate for health policy said. “If you are not familiar with how Medicaid eligibility and funding work, you would not necessarily realize how dramatically the proposed legislation could impact people and health care providers in the state.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Schools nationwide, including across Oklahoma, are still waiting for federal funds supporting English learners and migrant students while the Trump administration seeks to eliminate both programs.
As schools prepare their annual budgets for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins Tuesday, the Oklahoma State Department of Education reported this week it hasn’t yet received money from the federal government for migrant education and English language acquisition, along with a few other funds typically awarded annually to all 50 states.
The U.S. Department of Education, under Trump Cabinet Secretary Linda McMahon, has suggested eliminating the $375.6 million fund designated for children of migrant workers who travel from state to state within the school year and the $890 million for students learning English as their non-native language. McMahon’s budget proposal also suggests sweeping changes to other funding initiatives. 
The federal agency is yet to disclose a funding estimate for English learners, migrant education and Title II teacher-development programs for the 2025 fiscal year, which for the federal government ends Sept. 30. Education advocacy groups say the delay is cause for alarm and hinders districts’ ability to prepare for the coming school year.

Oklahoma received $6.43 million from the federal government for English language acquisition and $240,000 for migrant education in the 2024 fiscal year. About 13% of Oklahoma’s 700,000 public-school students are English learners, according to state records. The most recent national data available counted 79 migrant children in Oklahoma and 267,643 across the country.
The federal Department of Education has said it’s still finalizing funding decisions for FY 2025 and “remains committed to meeting its statutory responsibilities and stewarding taxpayer resources responsibly.”
Oklahoma state Superintendent Ryan Walters said he intends to “implement President (Donald) Trump’s America First reset” in public school classrooms, but he noted the U.S. Department of Education, not the state, controls federal allocations to schools.
“Our guidance to districts is to only budget for allocations (the U.S. Department of Education) has already rewarded,” Walters said in a statement to Oklahoma Voice.
In its 2026 fiscal year budget proposal, the Trump administration specifically recommended eliminating funding for migrant education, also known as Title I Part C, because it “encourages ineligible non-citizens to access taxpayer dollars stripping resources from American students.”
“Elimination of this program is part of the administration’s overall effort to restore fiscal discipline and reduce the federal role in education,” the proposal reads.

Walters similarly has referred to immigrant students as a “taxpayer burden” crippling schools. He proposed a now-defeated policy to require public-school families to verify their citizenship status during school enrollment.
The federal agency said it isn’t requesting funds for English learner programs, either, because “states and localities, not the federal government, are best suited to determine what evidence-based literacy instructional materials will improve outcomes for all students.”
That connects with the Trump administration’s larger goal of turning over broad control of federal education dollars to the states. 
If Trump succeeds, it could be more challenging to maintain the same level of financial support for English learner programs in states like Oklahoma where political leaders espouse rhetoric similar to Walters’, said Jeff Hutcheson, director of advocacy and public policy for TESOL International Association.
“I am concerned that, especially in some states, there may be some steps backward in the service and support of English learners,” Hutcheson said.
TESOL stands for teaching English to speakers of other languages, and the federal government has been an invaluable source of professional development and support for teachers who work with this student group, Hutcheson said. The U.S. Department of Education also holds states and schools accountable for upholding English learners’ civil rights.

Not all 5 million English learners attending U.S. public schools are immigrants, Hutcheson said, but this group does have some overlap with migrant children, whose federal funding also is in doubt.
The migrant and English learner programs together provide about $218,000 to Frederick Public Schools, a district of 700 students in southwest Oklahoma. 
Superintendent Shannon Vanderburg said his district educates children of migrant laborers working on farms in the area.
The district already rehired employees who provide migrant and English learner services for the next school year. To lose federal support for either program would be a “big hit,” Vanderburg said.
The migrant education funds are flexible, he said, which allows Frederick schools to provide tutoring, summer and weekend reading academies, eye doctor and dentist visits for students, and GED programs for their parents.
Just under a quarter of Frederick students are learning English as their second language, state records show. The district received high marks on state report cards for these students’ progress toward English proficiency.
“The awful part of this is, you can see through our kids’ test scores that it’s working,” Vanderburg said. “What we’re doing is working and working well, and I just don’t want to lose that momentum with our kids.”
A letter from 82 advocacy organizations and education-focused groups, including the TESOL International Association, urged Congress not to cut English learner funding, also known as Title III. 
Instead, the letter’s cosigners, led by UnidosUS, encouraged federal lawmakers to increase Title III funding from $890 million to $1 billion to keep up with economic inflation and growth in the number of English learners. 
“Congress must not betray their commitment to English learner education, as our nation cannot afford the consequences of leaving these students behind,” the May 23 letter states.
The letter also criticized the U.S. Department of Education’s decision to abolish its Office of English Language Acquisition. A federal judge has since overruled the agency’s mass layoffs, but the matter is still tied up in court.
Future of rural education program in doubt
Other programs, though funded this year, could be eliminated in the future. 
Rather than doling out money into “numerous small, poorly designed programs,” the federal Education Department aims to consolidate funding into larger, more flexible block grants given to every state. These grants would grant individual states more control over how they spend their federal education funds, a measure Oklahoma state leaders welcomed.
Funds designated for rural schools, homeless children, gifted and talented programs, and school safety are among the many programs the Trump administration suggested for consolidation into state grants. 
That means the federal government would no longer require states to continue funding most of these initiatives, if state officials don’t wish it. 
The administrative work and auditing that come with federal dollars are “just burdensome,” said Jeff Thompson, superintendent of Sharon-Mutual Public Schools. 
The district of 220 students in northwest Oklahoma receives about $115,000 a year in federal funds, including about $20,000 from the Small, Rural School Achievement Program, which the U.S. Department of Education aims to end with consolidations in 2026.
“If they could find a way to get us the money and let local control take over, that would be the best way,” Thompson said.
However, these programs provide essential services that would be nigh impossible for many rural schools to replace. 
That’s the case in Sharon-Mutual schools, too, Thompson said. The district uses the money to pay for technology needs and its parent communication system.
The neighboring Mooreland Public Schools in northwest Oklahoma receives about $40,000 from the rural achievement program. 
Superintendent Theron Graybill said this money allows the district to provide an updated Chromebook to every student.
“It’s pretty vital for us in keeping us up-to-date on technology out here,” Graybill said.

Now, the U.S. Congress plans to extend a 2017 federal tax law that would hand even more benefits to the richest few, while hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians face the loss of health care and food assistance, as well as rising costs. 
North Carolina state leaders will soon have a choice: Will they accept the harm being forced on our communities and slash essential services? Or will they step up to protect people’s health, stability, and financial well-being?  
So far, signs point in the wrong direction.  
Some state lawmakers have introduced proposals this session which indicate the legislative majority will embrace plans that take health care away from North Carolinians. Legislators in both the House and Senate introduced proposals that fast-track Medicaid work reporting requirements — an unnecessary and punitive measure that could strip health care from up to an estimated 496,000 people as soon as federal law allows. These proposals push the state’s Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to begin planning for the implementation of Medicaid work reporting requirements on an expedited timeline, requiring DHHS to notify the legislature of the funding necessary for implementation within 30 days of approval by the Center for Medicaid Services.  
But there is another path, and we must demand that state legislative leaders choose it for the health and wellbeing of us all.  
Our state legislators should be unwilling to accept a future in which more North Carolinians are uninsured, sick, and hungry. They must recognize that when federal leaders walk away from their responsibilities, the consequences fall on states like North Carolina. And state lawmakers have the tools to respond.
Here’s one simple step for them to take: They can establish a higher income tax rate on incomes over $1 million.
A millionaire’s tax at 7 percent on incomes over $1 million — a rate still lower than the highest rates pre-2013 — would provide more than $980 million in additional revenue every year. That revenue could protect North Carolinians from harmful federal cuts.   
Right now, North Carolina uses a flat income tax rate — the same rate for someone living in poverty and a millionaire. The flat income tax rate means the richest would receive the biggest windfall from any future tax cuts.   
In contrast, adopting a higher rate on higher incomes wouldn’t impact the rate paid by the vast majority of North Carolinians, and even millionaires would still pay the lower rate on their first $1 million in annual income. That’s how graduated income tax rate schedules work to ensure fairness and adequacy — necessary functions of a tax code that provides funding for the health care, child care, housing, and education that delivers better outcomes for people and a stronger economy. 
As congressional leaders push for more federal tax breaks for the rich — shifting the costs of essential programs onto states — everyday North Carolinians will be expected to pick up the slack. Estimates of the tax break from the U.S. House package find that the richest 1 percent of North Carolinians, whose annual income averages about $1.9 million, would receive an average annual tax cut of nearly $65,000 (3.5 percent of their income), a disproportionately larger cut relative to that received by the worst-paid North Carolinians, who would receive a tax cut of just $80 (just 0.6 percent of their annual income).

Here in North Carolina, state Senate leaders have signaled where they stand. Rather than fight for the wellbeing of every North Carolinian and keep costs low for us all, they would continue to cut taxes for millionaires. In their budget proposal, the Senate leaders propose reducing the personal income tax rate to 1.99 percent as soon as 2031 if certain revenue triggers are met. To be clear, for more than a decade, millionaires have reaped significant benefits from state income tax cuts and, once again, they would reap the lion’s share of this next state income tax cut.
According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, this Senate proposal alone would deliver an additional average annual tax cut of $64,700 to millionaires in North Carolina, on top of their federal tax cuts and more than a decade of state cuts. This is more than 52 times the average amount received by non-millionaires, who would see roughly $1,200.

At a time when so much is at stake for our communities, it’s essential that leaders make sure the wealthy pay what they truly owe. State leaders can protect North Carolinians from the losses Congress is proposing by implementing a millionaire’s tax now.   
A budget that hands out more tax breaks to millionaires at a time when essential federal supports are being dismantled isn’t just short-sighted — it’s dangerous. 
North Carolina needs a better plan than what Senate leaders are offering us. When lawmakers choose people over profits, our state can build a future where everyone has the freedom and opportunity to thrive.

(Getty Images)Indiana’s cigarette tax is set to increase for the first time in nearly two decades, following a late April legislative scramble for additional revenue.
Separately, a gasoline excise tax will continue its annual one-cent climb. The changes take effect July 1, with the beginning of the state fiscal year.
The price of a pack of cigarettes is expected to average $11 after the tax jumps from $1 to $3, per the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. Other tobacco and nicotine products will also get pricier.
“We really are pleased that the Legislature and Gov. (Mike) Braun moved forward and approved an increase in these tobacco taxes,” said Mike Seilback, who is the national assistant vice president for state public policy at the American Lung Association.

Want to ditch nicotine? Call Indiana’s hotline at 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) or visit QuitNowIndiana.com.

He called the hike — the first since 2007 — a “win-win-win.”
Rising prices can discourage people from using the products and developing nicotine additions, but current users may also seize on the sticker shock as a reason to try quitting. And those who don’t stop will fill the state’s coffers.
“Most tobacco users want to quit, but nicotine is highly addictive — the average tobacco user tries to quit, you know, seven times before they’re successful,” Seilback said. “By increasing this tax, we expect many Hoosiers to take the opportunity to make another quit attempt and be successful.”
The American Lung Association estimates that 38,000 adult Indiana smokers will successfully quit in response to the tax boost.
The health and other impacts could start hitting within a year.

“It usually starts with less heart attacks,” Seilback said, as well as fewer secondhand smoke-induced asthma attacks. Lung cancer takes longer to develop, but he also anticipated seeing sales flag and quit line calls rise.
That’s a boon for the chamber, which has been pushing an increase for nearly 15 years.
“This is a workforce issue … A healthy state and healthy Hoosiers is good for business,” President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders said.
She cited a 2020 fact sheet from Indiana’s Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Commission that found workers who smoke each cost their employers an estimated $5,800 more in health care and lost productivity annually than non-smoking workers. Collectively, smoking costs Indiana upwards of $6 billion annually in health care and lost productivity.
A lower smoking rate, Sinders said, improves employee wellness, lowers health care costs and cuts absenteeism.
Change takes effect the sooner people are aware of the tax increases, according to Seilback. Quit line advertising can help.
That’s why the Chamber’s Wellness Council of Indiana on Thursday released an updated version of its Quit Now Tool.
“It’s a much-strengthened playbook designed to help employers act on this unique moment,” Ashley O’Rourke, the council’s executive director, said in a news release.

The web-based platform offers ready-to-use modules and printable course completion certificates. It’s now easier for managers to invite employees online and see their progress. The tool also added accessibility features.
“We feel like this is an important opportunity for us, the Indiana Chamber, to be out there with resources for employers and Hoosiers who, again, see that … $2-a-pack increase, and want to take that next step,” Sinders said.
Seilback warned that the General Assembly’s job isn’t done yet.
He noted the recent proliferation of nicotine pouches and heated tobacco products, particularly among younger Hoosiers.
“This is an industry that survives on addicting their next generation of customers,” Seilback said. “So, unfortunately, the industry is always coming up with new products that aren’t covered by current policies.”
“That’s why it’s so important that the Legislature continues … to make sure that (new products) are taxed appropriately,” he added. “Because we’re not going to achieve the gains we need to, from a public health perspective, if (people) are just switching. We want to make sure that they never start and that current users quit.”
Another increase
Transportation infrastructure will also get a boost after Indiana’s gasoline excise tax hops another penny higher. It’s indexed to inflation, but the annual increase is statutorily capped to a cent.
It will now add 36 cents to the price of every gallon of gasoline.
Sinders said the tax funds roads — and more — that are “really important to the state, to our future economic prosperity.”
The chamber, as the state’s largest broad-based business advocacy organization, has members who like and dislike the increase.
But, Sinders said, “all business cares about infrastructure and wants to make sure that our roads are … funded in a way that kind of sets us up for success, and sets these businesses up for success.”
The gasoline sales tax, which is updated monthly, will increase July 1, too. It’s up by about a cent, and will cost 17 and a half cents per gallon.
Federal gas taxes add 18.4 cents per gallon and there is also an oil inspection fee of one cent.
That brings the total of state and federal taxes per gallon to 72.9 cents.

Read the first installment by clicking here.
NEZ PERCE RESERVATION, IDAHO – Long before the American government removed them both from their ancestral homelands, wolves and Native Americans coexisted side-by-side for centuries.
Those connections run deep for Shannon Wheeler, the chairman of the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee.
Wheeler remembers growing up as a boy, hearing elder members of the Nez Perce Tribe tell stories about wolves.
One story involves a young boy talking with his grandfather.
“They were talking and the grandfather told him that each of us have a wolf inside of us.
We actually have two wolves inside of us. 
One’s a good wolf, and one’s a bad wolf.
And they’re constantly fighting one another. 
And the grandson asked him, ‘Well, Grandpa, which wolf wins?’ 
And he says, ‘Whichever one you feed the most will win,‘” Wheeler said.
The story of the two wolves is one that Wheeler carries with him to this day.
“We’re able to utilize that lesson and our teachings to our younger ones coming up as we continue to try to grow our people and to fit into part of a world that is outside of who we are and outside of our culture and so we need those strengths,” Wheeler said. “We need to know that we’re feeding the good wolf inside of us so that we are that strong.”

In addition to the stories, some members of the Nez Perce Tribe develop even deeper spiritual connections with wolves.
“What I can tell you from my position as the Tribal chairman is the wolf has always played a significant part in who we are as people, based on even the names of our people,” Wheeler said. “Many of our people have gone out for wéyekins … A wéyekin is something where you go and fast and you get your animal spirit, and it’ll come to you. And sometimes it’s a himíin, it’s a wolf. Himíin is the name for us for wolf.”
Nearly 70 years after the U.S. government drove the wolf population to near extinction in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, that spiritual connection is what led tribal members to work to bring the himíin back to Idaho, Yellowstone National Park and the West. This is the story of how the Nez Perce pulled off a task no one else wanted – and why they’re still fighting for wolves today.
 An opportunity by the Creator to occupy this land

For thousands of years the Nez Perce Tribe has lived, hunted, fished and traded in what are now parts of Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Wyoming.
Over time, members of the Nez Perce Tribe developed a deep connection to the land and animals, said Allen Pinkham, a member of the Nez Perce Tribe who was born in 1938.
“To us, we are given the opportunity by the Creator to occupy this land that we’re at right now, and then we’re supposed to take care of the land and all the species that we utilize because it’s a life source,” Pinkham said. “It’s an opportunity to believe and have faith in your Creator. That’s what we do, and we’re supposed to take care of everything else, because it provides and sustains life for ourselves.”
Today, the Nez Perce is a federally recognized tribe that has about 3,500 members and governs the Nez Perce Reservation that is located in north-central Idaho.

The Tribe’s headquarters is located in the town of Lapwai, Idaho, and the reservation sits on a fraction of the Nez Perce’s ancestral territory. Lapwai is a working-class town nestled in a valley and the reservation is a mix of grassland, forested mountains and rural communities anchored by the Clearwater River.
An 1855 treaty between the Nez Perce Tribe and the U.S. government set aside about 7.5 million acres of land for the tribe.
But after gold was discovered on the reservation, additional treaties shrunk its size to less than a tenth of what it was. It’s now about 770,000 acres
 The Idaho Legislature wanted no part of the federal governments plan to reintroduce wolves to Idaho

Thanks to bounties, trapping and widespread poisoning, by the 1930s the U.S. federal government all but killed off wolves that used to roam the U.S. Rocky Mountains from the Canadian border to Mexico.
But in the 1990s the U.S. government undertook one of the most controversial wildlife programs in history – capturing wild wolves in Canada and reintroducing them in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park.

On Jan. 14, 1995 – in the aftermath of a major snowstorm, Suzanne Asha Stone was part of a convoy of vehicles that made a white-knuckle drive across icy roads to release four wolves at Corn Creek at the edge of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Central Idaho. At the time, Stone was an intern on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s wolf capture and reintroduction team.
Conditions were so sketchy that some members of the team unbuckled their seatbelts as they worried about plunging into the freezing Salmon River below, Stone said.
“If you slid off the road into the river, you wouldn’t have had time to disconnect your seat belt,” Stone said. “It was kind of like the decision of what’s the worst that could happen, and preparing for that.”
The wolves, which had been flown from Canada, were placed in kennels and driven in the back of U.S. Forest Service pickups to the Frank Church Wilderness.
When they arrived at Corn Creek, the wolf team opened the kennel doors and immediately released the wolves into the wild.
Those first four wolves reintroduced in Idaho had only been running wild for three days when the Idaho Legislature nearly derailed the entire operation.
On Jan. 17, 1995, the Idaho Legislature rejected the Wolf Recovery and Management Plan developed by the Legislative Wolf Oversight Committee.
The move blocked the state from leading wolf recovery in Idaho.
And it left the federal government without a local partner to monitor and oversee the first wolf population to call Idaho home in more than half of a century.
What happened next is a largely untold story of how the Nez Perce Tribe stepped in to save wolf reintroduction in Idaho.
Even now, 30 years later, many people in Idaho don’t know the role the Tribe played.
 ‘A song for the wolves:‘ How the Nez Perce Tribe saved wolves in Idaho

Even as the Idaho Legislature said no to wolves, the Nez Perce Tribe was demonstrating its connection to wolves and investment in wolf reintroduction.
Just before wolves were reintroduced to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in January 1995, the late Horace Axtell, who was the spiritual leader of the traditional Nez Perce Seven-Drum religion, and Tribal member Allen Pinkham traveled to Missoula, Montana.
Axtell and Pinkham came to offer blessings for the wolves that had been captured in Canada and were being kept in kennels at an airport hangar before their release. They met the wolves just before they were transported over the final leg of their journey for reintroduction.
During the ceremony, Axtell welcomed the wolves back home to Montana, Idaho and Yellowstone.
“And so he sang a song for the wolves,” Pinkham said.
About that time, the late Nez Perce leader Levi Holt traveled to Boise to meet with policymakers, said his nephew, James Holt.
Levi Holt delivered a speech at the Idaho State Capitol pushing to have the Nez Perce Tribe take responsibility for the new wolf program in Idaho, James Holt said.
“My uncle Levi, being very active at that time, made that impassioned speech before decision makers to actually push them to have the Tribe be the managing partner for that reintroduction effort,” James Holt said.
It worked.

Because of the Tribe’s connection to wolves and history of coexistence, the Nez Perce Tribe was ready to take over wolf reintroduction and conservation after the Idaho Legislature said no.
“The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was looking for a partner, and we became that partner,” said Aaron Miles Sr., who has worked as natural resources manager for the Nez Perce Tribe since 1999.
Miles was still finishing his forestry degree at University of Idaho when the Nez Perce took over the program in Idaho. He took pride in seeing the Tribe taking a lead role in protecting a species that had shared a homeland with his ancestors.
But Miles also heard plenty of stereotypes and lots of misinformation about the Tribe – even among college students he was helping tutor.
“I’d hear all the chatter about, well, can the Tribe do this? How can they do that?” Miles said. “They’re all these questions, and sometimes it was racist. It wasn’t just the fact that they were asking an honest question. But it had to be like, ‘OK, these Indians, this or that,‘ and here I am helping some of these guys with their homework, and that really upset me.”
 Hiking and howling, the jaw-dropping work of monitoring Idaho’s new wolf population

Biologist Marcie Carter is a member of the Nez Perce Tribe who served on the Tribe‘s wolf project starting in June 1997.
Carter got her start while she was still a student at Lewis-Clark State College and helped put together the first wolf management plan.

“Our goal was to go into the field, find paired up wolves that potentially had pups, and document the reproduction of those wolves, and also count how many pups were out there,” Carter said.
“That summer I don’t even recall how many, we probably had maybe five or six pairs of wolves that had puppies that year,” Carter said. “So they started out very well.”
Carter and another biologist spent their summer hiking around Central Idaho in places like Stanley and the Bear Valley area near the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, looking for wolves.
The wolves had been fitted with radio collars that allowed the wolf project team to track their location.
Typically a pilot and another team member would fly overhead, locate the wolves from the air and then use a radio to relay the animals‘ location to the biologists on the ground.
At that point, the biologists would hike in and locate the wolves.
“We worked 10 days in a row, and then we’d take four days off,” Carter said. “And we camped out, we backpacked and lived in a tent and slept on our Therm-A-Rest and ate packaged noodles. And every day for those 10 days, that’s what we were doing. We were up, out and looking for any type of sign of wolves.”
Although she grew up in Idaho and had spent time in the woods, Carter hadn’t really ventured into the wilderness until she joined the Nez Perce‘s wolf project team.
Before setting out, she had to borrow a backpack, sleeping bag, tent and cook stove.
A typical assignment during her first summer in 1997 involved flying into Central Idaho’s remote Chamberlain Basin with a team of other biologists.
Located within the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, the Chamberlain Basin was the site where one of the first wolf packs in Idaho established territory following the reintroduction of wolves. That pack became known as the Chamberlain Basin Pack.
“That was basically our lives during that time,” Carter said. “It was just backpacking, walking, hiking, listening. It was a great time.”
The reason they spent so much time in wolf country is because that is the best way to get an idea of how the wolves are doing and what they are up to.
Carter and the team conducted howl surveys. With hands cupped over mouths, researchers threw their heads back and let out their best imitation wolf howls.
They hoped to get live wolves to howl in response, which helped them track the wolves’ location.
As the team hiked and drove across wolf country, they scoured the ground for wolf tracks and droppings that researchers call scat.
They analyzed data from wolves fitted with radio collars.
They documented the newborn pups.
And they counted the wolves that were killed.
Once a year the team packed all that data into a report documenting Idaho‘s wolf population.
“It was all very positive and very, very jaw-dropping type work,” Carter said.
Although the wolf project started as a cool summer job for her, it became more than that.
Carter soon began asking one of her grandfathers about wolves.
They talked about how himíin, the Nimíipuu language word for wolf, comes from the word for mouth. That’s because wolves talk to each other, Carter said, with their howls.
When older members of the Nez Perce Tribe began to find out about the wolf project, they asked Carter about her work and shared stories about the Tribe’s history.
When they talked about losing wolves from the landscape, sometimes the older Nez Perce members talked to Carter about other losses the Tribe experienced.
“It was a learning experience for me, not just in the field, but culturally,” Carter said.
“It’s just that it goes back to the loss of the connection that all Tribal people went through, with being moved to the reservation, being forced to stop speaking our language,” Carter said.
“It did kind of raise that awareness – also for other Tribal people – that loss that we had experienced and continue to experience,” Carter said. “And then that reconnection – it happened with wolves. It’s happening with salmon. Maybe someday it’ll happen with grizzly bears.”
Over six years on the wolf project, Carter documented growth and stabilization in Idaho’s wolf population.
And as she observed wolves in their natural habitat, Carter saw a very different side to the animals that people warned her about.
“I saw these families of wolves taking care of each other and playing, and they are not this evil that people think,” Carter said.
 As the wolf population increased in Idaho, calls for change grew

During Carter’s time monitoring wolves, the population increased significantly.
Compared to the original 15 wolves released in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in 1995, the Nez Perce Tribe reported a minimum of 192 wolves in the central Idaho recovery area in the fall of 2000.
At the end of 2005 – a decade after wolves were reintroduced to Idaho – the Nez Perce team and Idaho Department of Fish and Game biologists had identified 59 resident wolf packs in Idaho.
Biologists observed a minimum of 370 wolves in 2005, and estimated the state’s wolf population to be 512 in 2005.
By 2005, wolf territory in Idaho stretched from near the Canadian border, south to Interstate 84 and east from the Oregon border to the Montana and Wyoming borders, the wolf team noted in its annual report.
During 2005, Wildlife Services officials said 26 cattle, 218 sheep and nine dogs were reported as “confirmed” or “probable” wolf kills.
As the number of wolves and wolf kills increased, so did the calls to remove the wolf from the Endangered Species List and turn management of wolves over to the states.
Under the Endangered Species Act, animals that are listed in danger of extinction are given protections – like the protection of critical habitat and prohibitions on hunting – and recovery plans. For species protected by the Endangered Species Act, the animals’ recovery and stabilization is the priority.
Animal species that have been saved by Endangered Special Act protections include the bald eagle, the California condor, the whooping crane and grizzly bear, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Once species are removed from Endangered Species Act protections, regulations can be eased and states can approve hunting rules or other management and lethal population control methods.
In January 2006, then-Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Interior transferring day-to-day management of wolves to the state of Idaho.
After about a decade, the Nez Perce Tribes’ role leading wolf recovery in Idaho had come to an end.
“I think we would have kept it, but the funding was going away, and so we did not have the money to keep a program going,” Carter said. “And so I think the only way was basically to hand it over to the state.”
 Removing wolves from protections under the Endangered Species Act

By 2007, the state of Idaho was officially planning for its first wolf hunts since reintroduction in 1995. At that same time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife put forward plans to remove the gray wolf from the Endangered Species List.
A series of legal battles ensued, where wolves were removed and then returned to the Endangered Species List.
In January 2009, Samuel N. Penney, the then-chairman of Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee, wrote a letter expressing the Tribe‘s full support for removing wolves from Endangered Species Act protections in Idaho, Montana, eastern Oregon, northern Utah and eastern Washington.

Penney told then-Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar that wolves met recovery goals for the Northern Rocky Mountain region in 2002.
By 2008, Idaho’s wolf population was estimated at over 800 wolves in 88 packs, Penney wrote.
“The Tribe wants, and understands that citizens of United States also want, wolves to be conserved,” Penney wrote. “The Tribe is confident that you understand the importance we place on being able to make decisions locally about how to wisely manage this resource in combination with all our other wildlife resources.”
Ultimately, wolves were removed from Endangered Species Act protections in 2011 after Congress inserted language into the federal budget requiring the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to remove wolves in Idaho, Montana, eastern Washington, eastern Oregon and north-central Utah from the Endangered Species List.
By May 2011, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game had taken over management of wolves in Idaho, and put wolf hunting tags up for sale.
Then in 2021, the Idaho Legislature expanded wolf hunting and trapping by removing the limit on the number of wolf tags hunters can buy, allowing trapping on private land year round and allowing the state to enter into contracts with third parties to kill wolves.
The state of Idaho had officially set out to reduce the wolf population by killing the predators.
Now Marcie Carter and other wolf advocates worry the government is starting to go down the same road it did 100 years ago when wolves were eradicated from the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
“We did all this great work, and we spent hours and hours out in the woods and then to come to this point where they’re treated like vermin, it’s really disorienting,” Carter said.
“It’s definitely being undone,” Carter added. “It’s been being undone since we stepped out. It’s very expensive to recover wolves and it’s not very expensive to take them off the landscape.”
Journalists Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin reported and wrote Howl over the course of 14 months, trekking deep into the backcountry in some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 chasing the story of America’s wildest and most controversial wildlife comeback story – wolf reintroduction.

Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis are also backing Trump’s decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. 
The post After criticizing ‘warmonger’ Liz Cheney, Hageman backs U.S. intervention in Iran appeared first on WyoFile .","More than two years ago, Wyoming welcomed then-former President Donald Trump for his first political visit to the state. At a rally in Casper, Trump urged voters to choose Harriet Hageman over Liz Cheney in the race for Wyoming’s lone seat in the U.S. House. Chief among the reasons Trump highlighted was Cheney’s interventionist stance. 
“The Cheneys have never met a war they didn’t like,” Trump said, referring to both the congresswoman and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who played a pivotal role in the U.S. invasion of Iraq. 
“Wyoming deserves a congresswoman who stands up for you and your values, not one who spends all of her time putting you down, going after your president in the most vicious way possible and loving endless, nonsensical, bloody, horrible wars that never end,” Trump said. “They just never end.”
Hageman, too, cast Cheney as a “warmonger” for her “interventionist ways” during the 2022 campaign, and promised voters she would be a different kind of congresswoman for Wyoming.
Now, in her second term, Hageman joins U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis in backing the Trump administration’s intervention in the Middle East. 
The three members of Wyoming’s federal delegation have made public comments supporting Trump’s decision on Saturday to bomb three Iranian nuclear facilities. 
While a ceasefire between Iran and Israel is reported to be holding, Trump has said the conflict is both “over” and that it could start again “soon.” There have also been conflicting reports about the extent to which the U.S. strikes destroyed Iranian nuclear sites. 
Barrasso, Lummis and Hageman did not respond to WyoFile’s inquiry asking to what extent they would support additional U.S. intervention in the conflict. 
Background
Before her ousting, Cheney supported U.S. intervention in the war between Ukraine and Russia. 
“America cannot defend and maintain our own freedom and security if we think that we’re simply going to withdraw from the world and not lead,” Cheney told CBS in February 2022.

In response, Hageman condemned the Russian invasion to Cowboy State Daily but pushed back on Cheney’s stance. 
“It’s also alarming to see that Liz Cheney simply can’t resist falling back into her interventionist ways. In her remarks, she came awfully close to calling for American military intervention, which would be extraordinarily dangerous and something that I strongly oppose,” Hageman said. “We must do whatever we can to support the Ukrainians, but inserting American troops squarely into the conflict would be a horrible idea.”
Since then, Hageman has voted against Ukrainian aid while supporting assistance for Israel. 
More recently, Hageman said, “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”
Ahead of Saturday’s strikes, Barrasso gave an interview to Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.” Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is a former co-host of the weekend show. During his TV appearance, Barrasso defended Trump for “doing absolutely the right thing to keep America safe.”
“He has been very consistent for 10 years, saying Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. He said it strongly. He’s read it repeatedly, because he knows that Iran with a nuclear weapon is a threat to the people of the United States, and we stand with the people of Israel,” Barrasso said. 
After the Saturday strikes, the Wyoming senator reiterated his position on X. 
“The greatest threat to the safety of the United States and the world is Iran with a nuclear weapon,” Barrasso wrote in a post. 
As Senate Majority Whip and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Barrasso has advocated for increased defense spending.
“Republicans will rebuild our military, improve military readiness, expand shipbuilding, and invest in new technologies to keep America safe, including an Iron Dome for America,” Barrasso said on the Senate floor in March. “All of this makes our military more lethal. Americans strongly support these policies. They know that this is the path towards safety and security.”
In 2023, Barrasso split with Lummis over whether to repeal the resolutions that gave the executive branch permission to wage decades of war in the Middle East, according to the Jackson Hole News and Guide. 
Lummis supported the repeal, describing the resolution as a move away from the model of “forever wars.” Generally speaking, Lummis has held a
cautious stance regarding American military intervention, recently citing concerns over spending levels. 
In the case of Iran, Lummis supports Trump. 
“For years, Iran has openly chanted ‘death to America’ and has acted as the world’s largest sponsor of terrorism. Iran having nuclear weapons is a threat to our country and allies. President Trump was right to order this strike on their nuclear facilities,” Lummis posted on X. 
“May God continue to bless our troops.”

An Albany County tornado this month proved a harmless weather event. Unless, that is, you’re part of southeastern Wyoming’s passionate and growing mountain bike community. 
The post Laramie’s Windy Windy gets very windy appeared first on WyoFile .","Amid a dramatic summer storm that brought hail and thunderstorm warnings, a tornado touched down June 17 outside Laramie and was on the ground for around five minutes, according to Albany County Emergency Services. 
The tornado ran 1.6 miles and its maximum wind speed reached an estimated 105 mph, according to the National Weather Service. Its path cut through a section of U.S. National Forest land, and there were no injuries or damage to structures.
A harmless weather event. Unless, that is, you’re part of southeastern Wyoming’s passionate and growing mountain bike community. 
The tornado spent its brief time on Earth knocking down a dense swath of trees across a beloved and critical piece of the growing Pilot Hill trail network. 
That trail section’s name? Windy Windy. 
The title invokes two homonyms, Richard Vercoe, one of the volunteers who maintains the trail network, told WyoFile — it is windy, as in curving across the landscape, and also windy, as in buffeted by Wyoming’s steady blow. 
“It’s the only section of trail named after the wind, and that’s where the tornado hit,” Vercoe said.

Windy Windy is a stretch of the trail connecting the pathways of the Pilot Hill area, a grouping of public land owned by various government entities and managed to the benefit of recreationalists, with the sprawling forest service land that includes the Happy Jack trail network. It’s a principal thoroughfare for mountain bikers linking together trails for long rides, Vercoe said. 
Windy Windy climbs and descends gently as it carries cyclists between forest and wide-open, high-country views, according to Vercoe, earning it devotion from area riders both for the flow of its trail and its aesthetics. 
But when a long-distance rider reached Windy Windy the day after the funnel struck, he found downed trees layered on top of each other. 
Vercoe, who visited the site the next day, said the tornado left the downed trees in a pattern so circular it made him think of the otherworldly crop circles that puzzle farmers and intrigue UFO enthusiasts. He estimated the diameter of the circle at about 200-300 yards. 
According to NWS, the tornado’s path was 450 yards wide, with the heaviest damage occurring along the connector trail.

Vercoe belongs to a volunteer group called the Trail FAIRIES (short for Fast Acting Initial Response Indefatigable Environmental Stewards). Those stalwart cyclists, through arrangements with the agencies that own the public land and the nonprofit that stewards the Pilot Hill biking area, clear downed trees and other trail obstacles quickly. The idea is to keep the cycling community from having to wait on the timelines of government agencies.  
It was two U.S. Forest Service sawyers who first worked to restore Windy Windy, Vercoe said. They began their work the day the rider reported the damage. Using chainsaws, the government sawyers cleared as many as 60 downed trees that first day, Vercoe said. The following day, he and two other volunteers resumed the task and cleared a similar number. The following day, two more volunteers repeated the performance. All told, Vercoe said they might easily have had to saw through 200 downed trees to reopen a 6-foot wide swath of trail through the damage zone.
“You’re sawing trees at multiple heights — chest high, ground level, head high,” he said. Some trees had their tops snapped off 20 feet up, others were tossed entirely out of the earth, he said.

Four days after the storm, bikers were again passing along Windy Windy. 
The tornado hasn’t ruined the scenic stretch, Vercoe said, especially for those who call the area home. 
“As we ride through there you will see these crazy acts of physics, and then soon these really unique ecological processes,” he said. “Over the next 10 years, you’re going to get to watch a tornado ecological succession story. I think it added a whole new flavor to Windy Windy.”

NPR and PBS may suffer with Congressional funding cuts, but rural, red America will be most impacted, writes KHOL Executive Director Emily Cohen.
The post Public media is local journalism. Let’s get the facts straight about defunding it appeared first on WyoFile .","We’ve missed the mark about how we’re talking about Congress’ attempt to defund public media.

Opinion

Here’s what’s getting lost: Public radio and television stations are independent and community-owned. One-third of public radio stations are not NPR affiliates, and most aren’t located in big cities. In fact, the people who will be most hurt by these cuts live in rural, often conservative parts of the country — places like much of Wyoming, where news deserts have crept in, local journalism has dried up and public media is often the only newsroom left.
Federal dollars allocated by Congress to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting are redistributed to 386 public radio stations via annual grants. To qualify for CPB funding, stations must show significant local support and investment. KHOL, the station I manage, didn’t qualify for a CPB grant until 2020, 12 years after we first went on the air. 
Once awarded a grant, those stations decide how to spend their money. The federal Communications Act — Congress’ own rules! — requires that 25% of these grants are spent on “national program acquisition or distribution.” Some stations chose to pay for NPR with these dollars, akin to how newspapers license wire stories from AP or Reuters. The intent is to supplement, not substitute. Unfortunately, the public often doesn’t realize this distinction — apparently, neither do many lawmakers — and local stations are suffering as a result. 
At KHOL in Jackson, the station I lead, we air some national shows like Marketplace and The Daily distributed by American Public Media and Left, Right and Center distributed via NPR, but we’re not an NPR affiliate. 
Like the 386 public radio stations supported by CPB grants, we’re independent. Our reporters live in the community we serve. Our daily newscast, feature stories and public affairs shows are for, and about, the people who live and work here. 
The role of public media
In an era when journalism is increasingly polarized, with clickbait and social media often driving ideological divides, public media remains a rare public good. It’s free, locally grounded and committed to facts and civic life.

As local newspapers have closed, people are turning to national news and “influencers” who view the world through whatever lens they choose. (This May, social media surpassed television as the most popular news source.) There’s a structural reason behind the polarization of the press: Straight news doesn’t really pay for itself anymore. 
Americans are pinned between paywalls at legacy outlets like the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal and free content from The Daily Wire or Breitbart that have explicit political alignments.
That’s where public media comes in. It offers high-quality journalism that’s free, widely accessible and local. 
Let’s reframe the debate
This is a moment for public media to reclaim its community-centered identity, but first we need to do a better job talking about what we do and who we are. We are community newsrooms serving places the national press rarely reaches. We’re often the only journalists in town. We’re watchdogs, storytellers and public servants.
Defunding public media won’t fix bias in media. Instead, it will tear down the infrastructure that brings independent, free, local news to the places where it is most needed.

(Courtesy of Rhoades for Public Service Commission)OMAHA — The Democratic primary for the U.S. House seat in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District might soon get more crowded.
Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades told the Nebraska Examiner this week that she is “testing-the-waters” for possibly jumping into the race in the Omaha-based 2nd District now represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon. She said she could be interested whether Bacon stays in the race or retires. 
“It’s certainly not a secret that I’m considering it,” Rhoades said. 
People ask her to consider
She said “some folks” have been lobbying her to get in, and her campaign shared internal polling indicating her and State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha within the margin of error for Democratic primary voters in NE-02. The polling has former political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell at what Rhoades called a “distant third.”
“John and I are starting from the same place,” Rhodes said. 
State Sen. John Cavanaugh running for Congress in Nebraska’s 2nd District

Earlier this month, Cavanaugh, the son of a former Democratic congressman from Omaha, formally announced his candidacy. Powell, the daughter of a leader in Spanish-language news, announced her bid in May. Besides the two highest-profile Democratic candidates in the race, Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis have confirmed they are running.  
Republicans are waiting in the wings for Bacon’s decision, a list that local conservatives have said includes former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom, Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding and perhaps Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei. 
Background in politics
The lifetime Omahan was the last Democrat elected to a statewide position as a member of the Nebraska Public Service Commission, the state’s catch-all regulator for topics as varied as telecommunications and pipelines. She also has a history of helping local Democrats win elections as a political consultant, including a significant role in helping John Ewing Jr. become the first Democrat to lead the largest city in Nebraska in roughly a decade. 
She pointed to her working-class background and her record of “doing the right thing even when it’s hard” as a plus for voters. Rhoades said the main issues she would focus on would include protecting and growing the middle class, creating jobs that pay a living wage jobs and protecting democracy.
Rhoades told the Examiner that Cavanaugh and an unnamed potential candidate had asked her and her husband, Ben, to work on their campaigns. She said she would only join the House race if she sees data that shows her in the strongest position to defeat whichever Republican emerges.
“Ben [Onkka] and I are in the process of evaluating who the strongest candidate is for the district. If it’s me, I’ll run,” Rhoades said. 
What the district wants
The polling indicates that potential Democratic primary voters in the district want someone who would fight President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress, someone who can win and someone with a proven record. Rhoades described herself as a “check, check, check” on those.

In recent weeks, Rhoades was rumored to be a candidate to replace Ewing in his former position as Douglas County treasurer, but the Douglas County Board this week hinted at wanting a “non-political option” to fill the remainder of Ewing’s term, someone who won’t run for the office. 
Rhoades said her experience differentiates her from the two high-profile Democrats in the House race. She said she has held multiple elective positions for over 20 years and knows how to help Democrats win elections. 
She said that Cavanaugh could have some baggage as part of a political dynasty, and there are concerns about his potentially vacating a statehouse seat, because Republican Gov. Jim Pillen would get to appoint his replacement. 
Rhoades said Powell’s inexperience could make the race a “very difficult time.” 
“I think that this may not be the right time and the environment for … a rookie,” Rhoades said. 
Rhoades has faced some criticisms from her years in service and work with Democrats in Douglas and Sarpy Counties, including for butting heads with some fellow Democrats and some co-workers in the Douglas County Courthouse.
Rhoades emphasizes that her decision on whether to run will be “data-driven.” She says she lacks the hubris to believe that she is the only Democrat who can win. She said she would decide whether to form a federal fundraising committee or jump into the race in the coming weeks.

By virtually any measure, the Confederated Salish-Kootenai Tribal Nation is an incredible success story against all odds. Forcibly removed from their homeland in the Bitterroot Valley, despite not having waged war against the white settlers or army, their own “Trail of Tears” brought them to the Flathead Valley to live within the boundaries of the vastly reduced lands they retained in the Hellgate Treaty of 1855.
Although the Hellgate Treaty is widely regarded as one of the best treaties signed by any of the nation’s Indigenous people, even land supposedly reserved for the exclusive habitation of the Salish-Kootenai was opened to purchase by non-tribal settlers by the Dawes Act of 1887.  
The act’s intentions were to allocate reservation lands the tribes already owned to individual families as private property and, as part of the “civilization” of Native Americans, it required tribal members to register with the federal government to receive their “allotment.” 
The entire debacle was part of the Allotment and Assimilation Era from 1887 to 1934.  Simply put, the federal government’s plan was to force Native Americans to be “assimilated” into European-American culture.  
Importantly, any reservation lands not allocated to tribal members was deemed “surplus” land and opened to purchase by non-tribal settlers.  This excursion into reservation lands was further exacerbated by the ability of tribal members to sell their allotment parcels to non-tribal members.  
The fracturing of the Salish-Kootenai’s tribal lands through sales to non-tribal members continues to cause serious problems today, including the long and on-going battle to retain their water, hunting and fishing treaty rights.  
Article III of the Hellgate Treaty could not be more clear regarding the Tribe’s fishing rights:  

        “The exclusive right of taking fish in all the streams running through or bordering said reservation is further secured to said Indians; as also the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places…”    
Yet, just this week the Confederated Salish-Kootenai Tribal Nation issued a very serious warning to tribal members regarding the fish they have treaty rights to catch because they are poisoned.  
The Fish Consumption Advisory urges “all tribal members to avoid consuming all species and sizes of fish harvested from the lower Clark Fork River from the Bitterroot River near Missoula to the Flathead River near Paradise. Recent testing has confirmed the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins and furans in fish at levels that are unsafe for consumption by Tribal peoples.  It is also advisable to avoid consuming rainbow trout and northern pike harvested from the Bitterroot River and the upper Clark Fork River above the Bitterroot River to Rock Creek, and, to avoid consuming rainbow trout from the Blackfoot River.
As the Advisory explains: “These contaminants pose a health risk to all fish consumers, and an even greater health risk to the most sensitive members of the Tribal population including women of child bearing age, pregnant nursing women, and young children. These contaminants have been linked to negative health effects in the immune, and nervous systems and may be associated with birth defects…PCBs and dioxins are classified as probable and definite human carcinogens, respectively.”
So what good are treaty fishing rights if you can’t eat the fish because they’re poisoned?  Are they really “rights” — or is this just another in our nation’s long and shameful history of abrogating its treaties with Native Americans?  
Moreover, Montana’s poison fish affect us all. Just as our government has failed the Salish-Kootenai, they have likewise failed to uphold our rights to the “swimmable/fishable waters” guaranteed by the Clean Water Act — because no one, tribal or non-tribal, is immune to poisoned fish.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Salish-men-tipis-1903.jpg,,,2025-06-27 07:00:38.061133

Wes Moore (D) is turning to a strategist with close ties to a potential rival in the 2028 White House election to helm his 2026 reelection campaign in Maryland – and possibly a national campaign beyond that.
Moore has hired Ron Owens, a Michigander who has worked as a political operative and statehouse aide for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) to run his reelection campaign.
Many Democrats – in Moore’s political orbit and beyond – had expected Ned Miller, who ran Moore’s 2022 campaign, joined his administration and later oversaw his super PAC, to head the reelection effort. But Miller has moved to Georgia, to run former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms’ 2026 campaign for governor.
“I’m thrilled to have Ron Owens leading our reelection campaign as our campaign manager,” Moore said in a statement provided to Maryland Matters. “Ron brings immense experience to Maryland from his work all across the country – with him on our team we will create the most aggressive statewide operation in history to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot all across Maryland.”
Though only 29, Owens is a seasoned operative who worked most recently as a campaign adviser to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, helping Democratic Senate candidates, including now-Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), with strategy and campaign management.
Potential 2028 presidential hopefuls Moore, Walz steal show at South Carolina Democratic weekend

In 2023, he was campaign manager to Brandon Presley, a former state utility regulator – and cousin of Elvis Presley’s – who was the Democratic nominee for governor of Mississippi. Presley ran a surprisingly strong race in a red state, losing to incumbent Republican Gov. Tate Reeves by just 3.2 points.
Most of Owens’ political experience, however, is in Michigan, his home state. After a stint as a legislative aide to the state House Democratic leader, Owens was the deputy political director on Whitmer’s successful 2018 campaign for governor.
He spent two years as Whitmer’s public affairs specialist in her gubernatorial office, then was political director in her 2022 reelection campaign.
After Owens was hired to run Presley’s campaign, a leading Mississippi Republican cited the operative’s ties to Whitmer as a way of blasting the Democratic contender.
“COVID showed Americans that it certainly matters who serves as governor,” Henry Barbour, the Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi, told the Magnolia Tribune in 2023. “Democrats such as Gretchen Whitmer advanced their elitist, government-knows-best agenda that restricted Americans’ liberty. And Brandon Presley hired her top political operative.
“Don’t believe him for a minute when he tries to persuade you he’s not of the same political persuasion,” Barbour said.
Whitmer and Moore are both seen as top-tier potential candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. But while Whitmer is termed out of office at the end of 2026, Moore must first win reelection next year before he can fully focus on any hypothetical national campaign.
Still, in the early skirmishing leading up to the 2028 White House primaries, Owens’ decision to cast his lot with Moore, one of Whitmer’s potential rivals, is noteworthy, if only significant to insiders.
In a 2018 interview, Owens highlighted his work ethic and life philosophy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“One thing that my mom instilled in my siblings and me was to, one, always be kind to other people, two, always work twice as hard as anyone else and, three, whenever you’re working you should always be doing something that is benefiting others,” Owens said in an nterview with Pride Source, a Michigan LGBTQ+ publication.
“We are fortunate to have him as our leader as we seek to continue our mission to create a Maryland that leaves no one behind,” Moore said.
At this stage, Moore still has a pretty skeletal campaign operation as the 2026 election ramps up, though that is likely to change soon. But he will enter a potentially perilous campaign season without Miller, who, after guiding the governor’s first statewide campaign, became a senior adviser and director of engagement for his administration.
In the middle of last year, Miller left state government to oversee Moore’s Unity First PAC and also played a leadership role in Freedom in Reproduction – Maryland Inc., the entity that helped pass the ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.
Moore appears to have also lost the services of his finance director, Patrick Denny, who was with the campaign since 2021.
The Moore campaign has not yet indicated who will replace Denny as finance director and it is not known who will oversee the governor’s PAC, which he largely used during the 2024 election cycle to attack Republican congressional candidates in Maryland. The PAC is now airing ads touting Moore’s economic record.

Even though he has publicly insisted in recent weeks that he is not running for president in 2028, Moore continues to behave like a possible national candidate. His trip in late May to South Carolina, site of an early and critical presidential primary, won wide attention from national political insiders and commentators.
Strategists on the popular “Hacks on Tap” podcast subsequently called Moore a “top 10” contender for 2028, and Chuck Todd, the former political director of NBC News, recently opined that Moore has the strongest resume and most gold-plated Rolodex of any of the hypothetical Democratic presidential candidates.
Moore appeared last week as a guest on “Pod Save America,” the breezy podcast hosted by former Obama administration officials. There, he explained why he’s not making plans to run for president, saying he never anticipated a career in politics and is enjoying serving as governor after starting the 2022 campaign as a relative unknown.
“I’m playing with house money right now and I love the work we’re doing in Maryland,” he said. The governor added that he will “go anywhere and everywhere” to tout the state’s progress.
Bold-faced names
Moore’s out-of-state travels continue this month, and include a recent gathering with Democrats in Virginia, which is holding closely watched statewide elections this year.
Moore is headed to a fundraising brunch in Aspen, Colorado,on Saturday, hosted by Damian O’Doherty, the former Maryland political operative and co-founder of KO Public Affairs in Baltimore, who lives now in the Rocky Mountains but often returns to his home state.

	The host committee of the event, which O’Doherty has informally dubbed “A Whole Lotta Skiers For Maryland Governor Wes Moore,” includes David Baugh, the executive director of the Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club, and a former superintendent of the Aspen School District; Rich Benenson, managing partner of the Denver office of the law firm and lobbying powerhouse Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck; Gordon Bronson, chief business officer at Continuum Partners, a real estate development and financing firm; Adam Goers, a former Democratic operative with ties to former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and now the Denver-based senior vice president for corporate affairs for Columbia Care, a cannabis company; and Michael Stratton, a senior Colorado-based Democratic and corporate strategist.
Moore’s fundraiser in Colorado coincides with the Aspen Ideas Festival, the signature annual event of the Aspen Institute. According to the festival website, the confab “brings brilliant minds from around the globe to discuss the ideas that will shape tomorrow and help us understand today. From sunup to sundown, we’ll explore critical issues and uncover ideas that spark wonder.”
The festival schedule shows Moore discussing “bold, purposeful leadership” on Saturday afternoon with Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, moderated by CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson.
“Big thinkers and doers share fresh ideas, challenge assumptions and ignite conversations that ripple far beyond [the Aspen conference venue],” the conference website says of the panel discussion with Moore and the other dignitaries. “Curiosity required.”
Moore is then scheduled to travel to Detroit, where he will deliver the keynote address at the Detroit NAACP’s 70th anniversary dinner on Sunday evening.

Construction employs more immigrant laborers, many likely living here illegally, than any other industry, and the industry is starting to draw more attention — even in conservative states — as the Trump administration pushes for more deportations. (Jay Waagmeester | Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.











Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance



Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The run-away success of 33-year-old Democratic Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayor’s race shook the political establishment across the country. In Wisconsin, where Democrats are hoping to regain control of at least one legislative chamber in 2026, and where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has not yet announced whether he’ll seek a third term, Mamdani’s overthrow of the uninspiring establishment candidate and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo should trigger some serious thinking about how Democrats win in the Donald Trump era, and who they represent.
On Wednesday, the morning after the New York City primary, the Republican Party of Wisconsin put out a press release attempting to connect Mamdani to Rebecca Cooke, the Democrat planning to run in a rematch race against U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden in Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District. The through-line between Mamdani and Cooke is that Sen. Bernie Sanders has endorsed both candidates. The Wisconsin GOP seized on what it saw as a political opportunity to defend Van Orden in a statement bashing “radical Rebecca” and asking: “Does Democrat political operative Rebecca Cooke agree with her fellow Bernie endorsed candidate on his radical positions? … Keep in mind, President Trump carried WI-03 by 8 points just last year.”
Cooke, contrary to Republican campaign propaganda, is a middle-of-the-road Democrat who earned the endorsement of the Blue Dog Coalition, the most conservative Democratic group in the U.S. House. She certainly agrees with Mamdani that the housing crisis and high prices are key issues for working class voters, but she’s unlikely to support his bolder proposals like publicly owned grocery stores. And Wisconsin Republicans are wrong to think they can easily beat Democrats by accusing them of being “radical” and tying them to Mamdani and Bernie Sanders.
The real radical in the 3rd Congressional District is Van Orden, a MAGA diehard who voted to take away medical care and nutrition assistance from his own constituents, and who likes to make a spectacle of himself, yelling at pages in the U.S. Capitol and mocking Democrats who expressed grief after the assassination of a state legislator in Minnesota.
It seems likely that by 2026, when the “big, beautiful” destruction of public goods from Medicaid to the Forest Service to infrastructure and education to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy have begun to bite, voters will have had more than enough of that brand of radicalism.
Wisconsin voters have a strong independent streak. 
Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential primary here by 13.5 percentage points. Sanders’ anti-establishment, progressive populist message resonated particularly strongly with voters in the 3rd District, in the same counties that ultimately went for Donald Trump that year and again in 2024. 
As Democrats in our swing state try to figure out how to win again, they should take a lesson from the voters in New York City who rejected the arrogant and deeply compromised Cuomo and chose an inspiring progressive populist, catapulting him to leadership of a new generation of Democrats. 
That doesn’t mean Mamdani would win in the 3rd District, or that he’s the model for Democratic candidates everywhere. But it does say something that he triumphed over his detractors from both political parties despite their money and clout, by connecting directly with voters who were worried about housing and high prices. Like both Sanders and Trump, Mamdani presented an alternative to the political establishment and listened actively to voters’ actual concerns. He bravely stood up to big money and stale conventional wisdom. He recognized the urgency of the moment. He leveraged the enthusiasm of young people and beleaguered working people who feel overlooked. He inspired people. He was a breath of fresh air.
What does that mean for Wisconsin? 
This week the latest Marquette Poll reported that 55% of voters don’t want Evers to run for a third term as governor. Various political commentators have compared Evers to ex-President Joe Biden, warning that at 73 (almost a decade younger than Biden) he might be too old to win. The poll helped fuel a new round of that sort of speculation.
But the question for Democrats is not whether Evers should run again. Presented with no alternative, 83% of Democratic voters told Marquette pollsters they want Evers. 
The real question is, what is the party’s vision for its own future and the future of our state? For a long time, Democrats in Wisconsin have lacked a bench. If Evers decides not to run, there is no obvious candidate to take his place. Meanwhile, Evers is currently engaged in backroom negotiations with Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on the state budget. Embarrassingly, Democratic leaders in the Legislature are not included in those talks and appear not to know what’s being traded behind closed doors. 
Asked whether she thinks the closed door sessions are OK, Senate Minority Leader Diane Hesselbein told reporters, “I think this is probably normal. I’ve talked to other majority and minority leaders in the past, and this is kind of how it’s happened in the past.”
That’s it?
As legislative Democrats conduct what some have called a dress rehearsal for real power, preparing to step into the majority for the first time in more than 15 years, it’s not clear how they will govern. Will they still let a Democratic governor call all the shots in budget negotiations? Will they play hardball if a Republican takes Evers’ place — following the example of the current Republican majority and blocking every initiative the governor proposes and seizing his powers whenever they get a chance? What are their bottom-line issues? How will they transform the lives of the people of our state? 
We badly need a more functional government and a more cohesive Democratic Party in Wisconsin.
More than anything, we need bold, progressive leadership that articulates a strong vision for a government that serves the interests of the majority of voters, not just rich people and insiders. Mamdani showed that there is real hunger for that in the electorate. That should be an inspiration to Wisconsin’s future leaders.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The U.S. Congress is debating many important issues as part of the “big beautiful bill.” One very concerning proposal that may be flying under the radar compared to the other provisions is a section in the U.S. House version of the bill that would impose a 600% tax increase on charitable foundations. Thankfully, this massive tax increase is not included in the U.S. Senate version.
As explained by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation: “Federal law requires grantmaking foundations to pay out 5% of their assets each year, to pay full income tax on unrelated business income (UBI), and to pay a 1.39% federal tax on investment income. OBBBA adds some well-crafted reforms (a floor to corporate charitable contributions, and closing some loopholes on UBI) but it would convert this flat tax to a progressive one based on asset size, where larger foundations pay a higher tax rate up to 10%. This tax increase will have unintended consequences, sweeping thousands of community and faith-based foundations into its scope. Large and bad are not the same thing (particularly when it comes to charitable endeavors. The Senate should avoid setting a precedent for wealth taxes and remove this tax increase.”
  Sen. Julie VanOrden, R-Pingree, conducts committee business during the Senate Health and Welfare Committee meeting on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Idaho State Sen. Julie VanOrden, R-Pingree, recently wrote an op-ed warning of the possible consequences of this tax increase on the Gem State. She said: “Idaho’s broader charitable ecosystem is equally essential. The Idaho Community Foundation has distributed more than $177 million in grants across all 44 counties. This year’s Idaho Gives campaign alone raised over $5 million for local nonprofits. These organizations thrive not because they have to, but because they choose to give. They are on a mission to serve our communities and the most vulnerable among us. Taxing that generosity is not only shortsighted; it’s self-defeating.”
Mountain States Policy Center agrees that this tax increase is the wrong approach. That is why we joined a coalition letter on June 23 to House leadership, encouraging them to remove this massive tax increase on charitable foundations from the bill as the Senate wisely did.
That coalition letter says (in part): “The draft Senate bill rightly eliminates the private foundation tax increases included in the House version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA). The House-passed bill would raise taxes on charities by more than 600%, allowing the IRS to take nearly $16 billion from private charitable foundations that would otherwise help improve the lives of many Americans. Countless programs and services that provide for the needs of people in every state are funded by the generosity of private citizens. Without them, we would see more Americans reliant on government, which ultimately costs us all more for what is often an inefficient bureaucratic solution.”
The letter continues: “Charitable giving helps form the bedrock of a resilient America by supporting organizations committed to creating a stronger, healthier society where every person has the opportunity to thrive. We support our nation’s long history of encouraging private initiative and generosity that benefits the common good, and we will work to advance conservative and free market policies that continue this legacy.”
Congressional leaders plan to vote on the final version of the bill before the Fourth of July. There is nothing beautiful about imposing a big 600% tax increase on charitable foundations. Let’s hope we’re also celebrating the defeat of this misguided tax increase when the fireworks go off on Independence Day.

It happened just a few weeks ago: Jim Obergefell was moving things in his office when he came across the ashes of his late husband, John Arthur, now 12 years gone. Arthur had last wishes for his ashes. Obergefell had yet to fulfill them.

This story was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

“And it struck me that, oh, I am actually now mentally, emotionally ready to take care of John’s ashes,” Obergefell told The 19th. “It was the first time that I had that feeling so clearly and so strongly.”
Obergefell, 58, is ready to move on. Not exactly from the love of his life or the history-making Supreme Court decision that came after Arthur died. But certainly from the insecurities straight America was grappling with a decade ago about same-sex unions.
Obergefell is that Obergefell: the named plaintiff in the landmark lawsuit that extended marriage equality to every state in the nation in 2015. Ten years later, he celebrates that win and the many ways it rewrote his life. And in a time when LGBTQ+ rights are again under assault, he is looking to the future — of the queer rights movement and also his own.
A journey to the Supreme Court
Obergefell’s journey to the Supreme Court was hardly destined. It began 12 years ago, on June 26, 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that prohibited the government from recognizing same-sex marriages.
Obergefell and Arthur had been together for 21 years at the time. The two had discussed getting married before. But they wanted it to be legal, and their home state of Ohio didn’t offer same-sex marriages.
Arthur was gravely ill with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and he barely left his home hospice bed.
After the ruling, Obergefell leaned over to Arthur, hugged, then kissed him.
“Let’s get married,” he said.
Arthur agreed.
Trump administration to end national LGBTQ+ suicide hotline

The logistics were not easy. Arthur was in no shape to travel, and the couple could not wed in Ohio. Obergefell researched and found that Maryland would let him get a marriage license even with only one of them present. But both would need to arrive in the state for the ceremony.
When friends and family learned about their predicament, they pooled together money to charter a medical jet for Arthur. The two flew to Baltimore. Over the course of 45 minutes, they exchanged vows on the tarmac before flying home.
“In the days that followed, we said the word ‘husband’ hundreds of times a day,” Obergefell said on the Decidedly Podcast in 2023.
But just five days later, their joy was muted when civil rights attorney Al Gerhardstein informed them that because of Ohio’s ban on same-sex marriage, Arthur would be listed as single in death.
Arthur and Obergefell were angry. The couple sued the state of Ohio in federal district court and won. Three months later, Arthur died.
The following year, Obergefell, still in mourning, lost on appeal. But he refused to believe he might lose altogether.
“I just kept going,” Obergefell said. “It was the right thing to do.”
On June 26, 2015, he won. For the country, the win was immensely practical. Many told Obergefell it gave them so much hope it saved their lives. For Obergefell, it meant a legacy for the man he loved.
“I made promises to John to love, honor and protect him, and I was going to keep doing that,” he said.
Changing history
It’s difficult to overstate the impact of Obergefell’s case on the nation or the world. Since the 2015 ruling, the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates, 591,000 queer couples have wed, generating an estimated $5.9 billion in wedding spending for state and local economies.
It has also radically transformed Obergefell’s life. Introverted and unassuming, he has spent the last decade campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights. He helms Equality Vines, a wine company that donates its proceeds to advancing civil rights causes.
It’s a position that makes him deeply proud if not a little fatigued.
“I’m not tired of talking about it,” he said of the 10-year anniversary of the ruling. “I’m just physically tired from all of the interviews and the photographers and the speaking gigs and the events. Yes, I’m exhausted.”
For 12 years, Obergefell has kept Arthur alive through retelling their story countless times in courtrooms and for the media. That exercise, of telling and retelling, helped Obergefell process his profound loss.
But he has never recoupled. It wasn’t that Arthur didn’t want him to. In fact, Arthur told him regularly that he wanted him to find love again. He asked his friends and family to tell Obergefell that he wanted him to find love after he was gone.
“I know it was sincere, because he told me that he had other people tell me that,” Obergefell said.
U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on gender affirming care for minors

It isn’t about the pressure he feels as the face of marriage equality, he said, though part of him wonders what it would be like to date after making history.
“I don’t know how to date,” he confessed. “I’m clueless when people flirt with me, and as much as I hate it, and I don’t go into any conversation or anything like this, but you know, there’s that part of me that sometimes wonders, you know, are they interested in me as a person, or are they interested in me as Jim Obergefell, named plaintiff?”
Obergefell’s name has become synonymous with marriage equality in the United States, an issue that has not always united the LGBTQ+ community. Some queer activists have argued that same-sex marriage was a misguided goal for the movement as queer youth continue to face high rates of homelessness and transgender people grapple with police violence and incarceration, among other issues.
More work to do
Obergefell, too, is worried that the needs of the community’s most vulnerable have gone unmet. He has watched horror-struck over the last five years as state legislatures have moved to restrict transgender rights.
“We need to fight for every marginalized community, because the queer community includes every marginalized community, and equality for one is pointless without equality for all,” he said. “I didn’t go to the Supreme Court just so White, cisgender, gay men like me could get married.”
Despite all of the setbacks in LGBTQ+ rights, and even threats to Obergefell’s game-changing victory, he is hopeful — and feels stronger than ever. People assume his case was difficult for him. It was, but the path was also obvious, to him and to Arthur. They loved each other.
“If we weren’t willing to fight for each other and for what was right, then what’s the point?”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents riled up folks when they conducted a dragnet in a South Nashville neighborhood a month ago and detained nearly 200 people.
But city streets aren’t the only place where federal agents are picking up immigrants for deportation. The Davidson County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Thursday it has released 283 inmates to ICE custody in 2025, notably higher than last year’s number.
Oddly enough, the sheriff’s office doesn’t have information on whether those inmates have legal documentation to be in the country. It sends fingerprints collected in the booking process to national databases, including those ICE is able to access, according to spokesman Jon Adams.
ICE contacts the sheriff’s office to request a detainer, then picks up the inmate, leaving the local agency with nothing but a number of people released to federal custody.



				Based on the 283 inmates released by the Davidson County Sheriff’s Office to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Metro Nashville appears to be cooperating with the federal agency on deportation, despite claims to the contrary by Republican lawmakers. 			


The Davidson County Sheriff’s Office hasn’t participated in the 287(g) screening program for immigrant inmates since 2012 when Sheriff Daron Hall said it was so successful it was no longer needed. For the five years the department used the program, it processed more than 10,000 undocumented immigrants for removal from the country, according to a WPLN report.
But based on the jail pickups, Metro Nashville appears to be cooperating with the feds, even though Republican lawmakers are hammering at Democratic Mayor Freddie O’Connell after he raised concerns about the Nashville sweep. Metro inadvertently posted the names of three ICE agents, then removed them, and O’Connell updated a years-old executive order requiring personnel to notify the mayor’s office if they encounter any federal agents, including those from ICE. Those moves spurred Republican legislation to punish governments that ID ICE agents, and GOP leaders have called on O’Connell to rescind the notification order.
Tennessee GOP Congressman calls for investigation of Nashville mayor amid immigrant detentions

Since opting out of the program, the sheriff’s office no longer serves as an extension of the federal ICE program. But based on the number of jail deportations, they have quite a few encounters with the federal agents. 
Republican leaders have said repeatedly over the last few months that new laws are needed to remove undocumented criminals who pose a public safety threat. 
Those have been under way, though, for nearly two decades. 
Former President Barack Obama removed more than 4 million people, earning him the moniker “deporter in chief.” Former President Joe Biden deported 271,000 immigrants in 2024, according to a BBC report. Over the first four months of this year, the Trump administration removed about 200,000 people from the country.
Based on those numbers, undocumented immigration is nothing new, and neither are deportations. Some just cause more chaos than others.
Trying to get off the radar
Tennessee State University broke ground Thursday on two academic buildings for the College of Agriculture, but the historically Black college will remain under a state microscope for a good minute.
As part of an agreement signed last week with state leaders, the university must meet several financial requirements in order to shift more than $90 million from a 2022 capital grant to campus operations over the next three years.

In addition to making a quarterly report to the Tennessee Board of Regents, comptroller and commissioner of Finance and Administration, TSU must meet deficit reduction goals and cut yearly expenses, fix state audit findings, come up with a space use and real property plan, and set find an enrollment figure it can handle without going broke.
State officials reached the agreement with TSU and interim President Dwayne Tucker after forcing out former President Glenda Glover and replacing the board of trustees in 2024. 
TSU and Glover caught the ire of Republican senators when the university sought last-second approval to lease apartments for student housing when it started an aggressive scholarship program after the COVID pandemic. The university used a federal grant to fund the scholarships, then ran out of money.
In the last year, state leaders have been micromanaging the university’s money with Tucker, who is working without pay, to put TSU on stronger financial footing.
The estimated $90 million buildings for the Food and Animal Sciences and Environmental Sciences programs will support the university’s academic, research and agriculture extension missions.
“This project underscores the state’s continued confidence in our university and the strength of our land-grant mission,” Tucker said in a statement.
  “The hard work starts now,” state Comptroller Jason Mumpower recently told Dwayne Tucker, interim president of Tennessee State University. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout 2024)
Republican senators have said consistently they want TSU to succeed, yet they didn’t show any confidence in the administration until recent months. State officials allowed TSU to take an advance last fall on the $250 million in capital funding, just to make payroll and stay afloat.
A state study found TSU had been shorted by as much as $500 million over many decades, while a federal report said the university was shorted by more than $2 billion, a figure Republicans are rejecting. Either way, TSU has battled with finances for years, struggling to balance the books and resolve audit findings, even if state investigations found no wrongdoing. 
State Comptroller Jason Mumpower, one of Glover’s biggest critics, said he has confidence in Tucker. After the recent signing of a memorandum of understanding, Mumpower said he told the interim president that “the hard work starts now.” 
The question is whether they can repair decades of underfunding, bad management and, some might say, neglect on the part of a lot of people in high positions.
Cepicky’s pick
Republican state Rep. Scott Cepicky said on a podcast this week he’s picking House Speaker Cameron Sexton to win the 7th Congressional District seat expected to be vacated by U.S. Rep. Mark Green.
“The wild card here is Sexton,” Cepicky said on “3 Dudes with a View,” a Columbia production. He added that his “gut feeling” is Sexton will win if he gets in.
Sexton’s office has consistently declined comment, but he is set to make a big announcement in August. 
For the second time, Green announced his decision to leave the post, once Congress votes on the president’s budget plan. 
Cepicky declined to comment Thursday to the Lookout on whether Sexton told him he will run for the post.
The prediction is tempered somewhat because Cepicky also said Sen. Bill Powers could be a strong candidate, even though Powers announced last week he won’t run.
While Sexton’s potential candidacy is bandied about, former Tennessee General Services Commission Matt Van Epps announced this week that Nashville car dealership magnate Lee Beaman and his wife, Julie, will be finance co-chairs for his 7th District campaign. 
Beaman also served as treasurer of U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles’ first campaign when he was late filing his Federal Election Commission report and reported raising much less money than he initially claimed. The FBI was investigating him, but Trump squashed that probe when Ogles came to his defense.
Beaman also was the sole donor of $50,000 to Volunteers for Freedom PAC, which put $24,000 into an ad buy backing Ogles, raising questions about illegal coordination between the campaign and PAC.
AI argument
State Sen. Bo Watson joined Republican lawmakers from across the country Thursday in urging Congress not to approve a 10-year moratorium on artificial intelligence laws as part of the president’s budget bill.
Watson, chair of the Senate finance committee, adamantly opposes a ban on states and local governments regulating artificial intelligence systems, models and decision systems for children’s online safety, consumer protections, transparency and accountability measures and “generative AI harms,” which could build up societal biases in data and potentially allow sensitive personal data to be stolen. (This is making my brain hurt.)










For an administration who has really been focused on returning authority back to the states, this is one aspect of this piece of legislation that I’m quite disappointed in.


– Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixson


Watson invoked Tennessee’s new law preventing “deep fakes” and the ELVIS Act, which protects artists from infringement on their voices and images, during a Thursday webinar on the subject with lawmakers nationwide who oppose the federal ban. The moratorium would withhold broadband funding in exchange for doing nothing.
“For an administration who has really been focused on returning authority back to the states, this is one aspect of this piece of legislation that I’m quite disappointed in,” said Watson, a member of the state’s council overseeing AI policy.
Watson, a Hixson Republican, added that Congress is so slow to act that by the time it deals with problems stemming from AI, the states will be left to “wrestle” with the consequences.
“That’s why it’s critically important that this part of the bill be removed,” Watson said, and states be allowed to work with the feds on AI laws.
It might not be the only rough part of the federal legislation.
Congress also is considering cutting Medicaid spending that could cause Tennessee’s TennCare program to lose $16 billion in federal funding, according to U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, brother of former Tennessee state Rep. Rick Tillis.
The pending and potential budget buster for Tennessee is accompanied by a massive uptick in national spending for ICE and border patrol and an overall increase that even former DOGE director Elon Musk opposes. 
This proposed expansion of federal control over AI coincides with U.S. deportation efforts nationwide despite opposition in many states, renewing the age-old states’ rights argument that was supposedly put to rest 160 years ago. Some folks want the states to prevail only when it’s politically expedient, presenting a bit of a contradiction.

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Pedestrians and bicyclists along the Colorado Riverfront Trail in Grand Junction may have noticed something out of the ordinary this spring. In some fenced-off sections near Blue Heron Lake, 700 goats are grazing on an array of invasive species such as tamarisk, Russian olive, kochia, and Russian knapweed.
Grand Junction is using goats to combat noxious weeds to make more room for native plants like cottonwood trees and willows. At the same time, they are lowering the risk of wildfire in this hot, dry, high-desert landscape by reducing the vegetative fuel load. 
“It can be hard to stop a fire where there’s lots of vegetation,” said Rob Davis, Grand Junction forester and open space supervisor. “If it gets going on a windy day, and there’s lots of downed debris …with 9 inches of precipitation a year, and high summer temperatures, the fire risk is high. Using goats for grazing is an environmentally-friendly strategy to help us reduce fire risks and knock down some of our invasive weeds.” 
Plus, people out recreating enjoy seeing the goats, Davis added.
“There’s that added benefit that people just like it,” he said.

A goatherder watches over the goats and nudges them down the trail after they’ve sufficiently grazed a patch of dead or unwanted vegetation. Goats will typically leave the mature cottonwoods and willows alone. However, the city sometimes places a fence around young trees to keep the goats from munching on the saplings.
On the Front Range in Boulder County, the town of Superior has brought in a herd of 300 goats to graze on its open spaces for both weed control and fire mitigation. The catastrophic Marshall Fire in 2021 destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the region.
Superior first began using goats in 2019, as a sustainable method for vegetation management. After the Marshall Fire the town “doubled down” on using goats for fire mitigation, said Leslie Clark, director of Superior’s parks, recreation and open space. 
Superior evaluates its open space properties annually to prioritize where to graze the goats each summer and winter, Clark said. Properties are monitored to gauge results before and after grazing. 
“Initial results look positive,” Clark said. “People like the results. The goats reduce the vegetative fuel that contributes to wildfire risk. The goats leave the area looking natural. The city later reseeds the areas with native species to improve biodiversity and reduce the number of noxious weeds.”










People like the results. The goats reduce the vegetative fuel that contributes to wildfire risk. The goats leave the area looking natural.


– Leslie Clark, director of Superior’s parks, recreation and open space


Using goats for weed control and fire mitigation is not new. Lani Malmberg, owner of Colorado-based Goat Green, said she was the first company to offer this type of fire mitigation work 25 years ago. She and her goats have been featured in The New York Times, the L.A. Times, and other national publications. She now runs her Goat Green grazing business with her son Donny Benz and his fiancée.
Malmberg, 68, said she conceived the idea of using goats decades ago while studying botany, biology and environmental restoration at then-Mesa State College in Grand Junction. She said she watched how knapweed took over a cornfield while working a summer job in Colorado. 
It occurred to her then, “Someone ought to run a business to eat the problem,” Malmberg recalled. “Now there are a lot of goat businesses” — and she has trained people at some of them.
Lockheed Martin uses 1,200 of Malmberg’s goats for fire mitigation at its facility in Littleton. Goat Green has done grazing projects for many Colorado cities in the past, including Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Castle Pines, Broomfield, Golden, Glenwood Springs and Carbondale.
“Over the past 30 years I have worked in all the Western states, doing fire mitigation in California, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Montana and Nebraska,” Malmberg said. 
When asked where her company is based, she replied, “Under my hat — wherever I’m on contract.”
“Fire mitigation is a big deal. Open space (managers) are clamoring to get goats. People are jumping into it. It’s an alternative to machinery and chemicals.”
More environmentally friendly than chemicals
Superior pays for the goat service via grants from FEMA and Boulder County, with matching grants provided by the town of Superior. The program is funded from 2025 through 2027. 
Louisville has used goats to control noxious weeds for several years, said Nathaniel Goeckner, the city’s natural resource supervisor. Louisville contracts with Goats on the Go, in Boulder County, to graze 200 goats on open space around Louisville. Depending on the vegetation, the city also uses cattle for fire mitigation work, Goeckner said. Its grazing program is paid for with grants from Boulder County and a city sales tax.
Longmont also uses goats — though not for fire mitigation, said Jim Krick, ecosystem manager for Longmont’s Parks and Natural Resources. The city has brought in goats since 2023 for weed control — targeting kochia in particular, where it competes with native plants. The goats are brought in just before the weeds form and spread their seeds, Krick said. Longmont typically grazes goats on an acre per year based on its budget.

Grand Junction contracts with Ecological Grazing Service, owned by Jennifer Studt, who, along with her husband, raises goats and sheep on a ranch in nearby Loma. She hires a goatherder who stays with the goats the entire time, moving his small camper, and the goats, down the trail when an area is sufficiently grazed. 
Studt says goats do particularly well here because they have a more resilient stomach. They can eat poisonous plants like Russian knapweed, which is highly toxic to most animals — but not goats, she said. And, whereas Russian olive seeds pass through other animals’ dung, which then gets repopulated elsewhere, in a goat’s gut the seed won’t survive, Studt said. Therefore, goats don’t spread noxious weeds.
Studt’s goats began grazing along the riverfront May 23 and will finish eating their way along the trail by the end of this month. They’ll return in late October, when other annual weeds begin to germinate. 
“There are bucket loads of dead noxious weeds here,” Studt said. “And while goats will eat live plants too, they really like the crunchy, dead material — a lot of other animals not so much. Goats like a lot of roughage in their diet. We’re taking something noxious, poisonous to other animals and turn it into fertilizer which helps overall soil health — which helps the native plants come back.”
Using goats to reduce fuel loads, and invasive plant species is a more environmentally friendly method than using chemicals, Davis said. The Grand Junction program is funded through the city’s operating budget.
Although using goats doesn’t necessarily eliminate the use of herbicides, it reduces the amount of chemicals used in grazing areas, said Grand Junction spokesperson Kelsey Coleman in an email to Colorado Newsline. 
The town of Superior contracts with Goat Bros, which Clark said offers educational days when the public can meet the goats close up, and learn how goats improve the environment. 
“It’s an opportunity to get closer to the goats,” Clark said. “We don’t want people interacting with them, otherwise — they’re working.”

(West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Standing behind a sign that read, “Education Not Indoctrination,” Gov. Patrick Morrisey celebrated a bill Thursday that he says will “reinforce civic values” in education by putting a new learning center on West Virginia University’s campus.
For Morrisey, the legislation is a part of his priority to combat what he says is the “woke agenda.” The Republican governor already banned diversity initiatives in state government, and, as a result, WVU closed its Division of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and opened a new, rebranded office.
House Bill 3297, passed by the GOP-led legislature in April, mandates that WVU operate the “Washington Center for Civics, Culture and Statesmanship” focused on teaching constitutional studies and “great debates of Western civilization.” It will also present the “fact-based instruction on America’s founding,” according to the governor’s office.
“We need to make sure that students are learning how to think, not what to think,” Morrisey  said.
Morrisey gets to choose its initial director, according to the bill. He is required to make that decision in consultation with the Senate and WVU’s Board of Governors. 
“Unfortunately, a lot of our schools and higher education institutions they’ve turned into indoctrination factories for radical, anti-American thinking. That can’t happen in West Virginia,” he said. 
  Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock
Del. Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, sponsored the Washington Center legislation.
“I just want something established … to start allowing an option for students that attend higher education … to study all these different subjects under their humanities as they’ve been traditionally taught,” he said at the press conference.
Along with a director, the bill requires the university to hire five additional faculty, which comes in the wake of WVU eliminating around 300 faculty and staff jobs for financial reasons. 
The Washington Center can use existing faculty and courses to accomplish the bill’s requirements of civics instruction. The measure says it should advance the “understanding of American constitutional thought and institutions.”
Shauna Johnson, WVU’s executive director of strategic communications, said the university looks forward to building on its programs and long history of civics instruction. 
“As our nation prepares to celebrate its 250th anniversary next year, West Virginia University looks forward to building on its programs and long history of civics instruction,” she wrote in a statement. “The Washington Center will give us the opportunity to enhance our work to develop responsible and informed citizens and highlight the importance of our institutions and democratic framework.”
Democratic lawmakers in the House of Delegates and Senate who represent Morgantown voted against the legislation, citing concerns about government mandates for a university and a political appointee overseeing academics. 
Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, told House members during bill debate that he worried about who might want to fund the school if the state doesn’t. 
“Who will want to pay to have a say in how we educate the next generation?” he asked. 
Senators amended the bill to require that Washington Center’s curriculum be approved by WVU’s Board of Governors. They also added in language that banned lawmakers, during or up to two years after the end of their service in the legislature, from serving as the center’s director or being employed by the center in any capacity. 
While the bill initially didn’t come with funding for the center’s director and faculty, the final budget bill contained $1.5 million for WVU to use on the center. 
Johnson didn’t respond to a question from West Virginia Watch about whether it would take additional university funds to get the center up and running. 
The legislation goes into effect July 11. 
“We appreciate the governor and legislature for including $1.5 million in the fiscal year 2026 budget to support the creation and operations of the Washington Center,” Johnson wrote. “More details will be available at a later date.”
Earlier this year, McGeehan was involved in a controversial move by the West Virginia Water Development Authority to give $5 million to an Ohio-based Catholic-affiliated career and vocational college to create a right-wing think tank. The Parkersburg News and Sentinel reported that McGeehan helped the College of St. Joseph the Worker with their application for WDA funds. 
The water development authority, which made the decision without a required recommendation from one of three state officials, said the deal is constitutional because it will serve a non-religious economic purpose of teaching trade skills. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia sued to block the water development authority from using the money in Ohio, and a judge recently ruled that the suit can move forward in court.

That’s according to Department of State Police spokesperson Shanon Banner, who told Michigan Advance in an email that Nugent had a weapon on him due to a breakdown in security screening. Nugent appeared Wednesday before a joint hearing of three different House committees mostly to rail against deer-bating and other conservation regulations from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Natural Resources Commission.
Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livionia), who called his testimony and invitation to speak before legislators “absurd,” posted on TikTok Thursday that it appeared that Nugent had a weapon on him while he stood and practically yelled at members of the House for more than 10 minutes. Pohutsky’s seat at the large dais in the House Appropriations Room at the state Capitol was directly in front of where Nugent was sitting.

Open carry and concealed carry of firearms are both banned on Capitol grounds, with limited exceptions.
Banner later confirmed that Nugent did have a weapon on him.
“Mr. Nugent was screened at the north entrance of the Capitol [Wednesday]. The weapons detection system functioned correctly and alerted to a possible weapon; however, the trooper staffing the entry point did not see the alert until after Mr. Nugent left the screening area,” Banner said via email. “Upon completing his meeting, MSP personnel contacted Mr. Nugent and notified him of the weapons policy, and he complied. We are still evaluating how the weapons detection alert was missed and will be following up to ensure this does not happen again.”
Banner did not say what kind of weapon Nugent had on his person when testifying before legislators.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)To marry an old idiom to modern jargon, “can’t see the forest for the trees” is a bandwidth problem. 
Cognitive bandwidth; that is a fancy way of saying “limited attention ability” in people, as opposed to the computer version and definition of bandwidth. This is natural for human beings. Focusing on a few things intensely as opposed to a broad array of things is just how most folks are wired. Add in modern technology where focus is personally curated exactly to what folks want to see on their screens, and you get a populace of folks who can stream their favorite trees 24/7, forest be damned. 
Getting the right kind of trees in front of the right kind of voters means the forest is ripe for harvest. Just a matter of bandwidth. 
The post-COVID vaccine debate takes up oodles of bandwidth. This past legislative session saw considerable time, effort and coverage to the ultimately rejected Senate Bill 460. That failure, the culmination of years’ worth of efforts by activists, was followed by Gov. Patrick Morrisey issuing an executive order on religious exemptions for vaccines on his second day in office. Thus, we have the sequence of events that led to the Beckley press conference. The podium had a placard made up stating “protecting religious liberty” to add another layer of search engine optimized branding to the program. The purpose of the proceedings was for Morrisey to publicly throw his support behind a very convenient lawsuit that highlights this very issue and will move the vaccine exemption matter into the courts and around the legislative and state school board impasse. 
 In review, the sitting governor, the legislature, the court system, the news media coverage, the social media attention and all of those views being terraformed by the national news cycle on the same topic… that is a whole lot of bandwidth on this one issue. Which gives the impression it is an issue enormously affecting a whole bunch of West Virginians.
But does the noise match the numbers? In 2023, 53 exemptions were requested with the West Virginia Board of Public Health,  with nine permanent and 24 temporary exemptions granted.  With all the attention on the issue, 321 exemptions were requested for the past school year, as reported by Lori Kersey. That is 321 requests out of 245,047 total students. With some calculator help for my Frametown Elementary math skills, which comes out to 0.130995278% of the students in West Virginia. 
 That’s a lot of bandwidth for a number that is percentage-wise on the south side of zero. 
Medically, when dealing with the infectious disease vaccines are designed to prevent, that small percentage could be enormous if it — God forbid — would involve a polio or measles outbreak. Constitutionally, every citizen’s rights are supposed to be equal under the law as is their right to redress any grievances they might have with their government. Morally, in a perfect world every person would matter just as much as every other person. But we don’t live in that world. Which is why fights over rights are so important. These are vital, foundational issues wrapped up in the messaging of the moment. 
Politically, though, this is an exercise in how focusing a political base on a certain kind of tree while broader focus gets fuzzy is vital to modern electoral engagement. Religious freedom rhetoric, mixed with recently well-earned distrust of the marriage of health science and government, poured into a “for the children” mold makes political dynamite. Lighting off that stick of dynamite doesn’t sound as justified when it is framed as making a large explosion that affects the many under the extremely specific projected needs of the decimal point few. A large socio-political boom chiefly made because such a bang will be particularly useful to the folks with ambitious plans. 
Principles do not have to exist at odds with proportionality in our popular politics. When politicians insist they must, it is a red flag that something is going on in the rest of the forest and we should step back from the tree at hand to see what it is. Being able to say, “This is an important issue, but…” and taking in the full context of not just the issue but the moment is the first basic step in not being railroaded into action just because so-and-so said so. Using all of one’s bandwidth on one or two issues leaves a perspective that is not only skewed, but susceptible to undue influence.
Increasingly, that’s the standard operation procedure for our office holders, media coverage and personal policy opinions. Entities that have incentives to keep all the focus only on the trees they want the focus to be on. Like debates over a few hundred vaccine exemptions that distract from the dozens of school closures. An issue that, when you look closely, is becoming a platform for giving the governor more power over the state school board. A power struggle over schools and who controls them that comes as a larger fight over the ever-increasing state burden to fund school choice looms. All of that coming after a half-century of school consolidations for the majority of West Virginia that isn’t the panhandle or Potomac Highlands. There are a whole lot of trees in this particular policy forest that can be stared long and hard at.  
It would be ridiculous to be in West Virginia and never notice the forests that blanket the hills for lack of bandwidth to see it. Yet many are doing that with politics, losing all perspective to the power of the moment. There is no vaccine to keep from losing perspective and proportionality in our politics. Only prevention.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Vaccine-GettyImages-1344323367-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)President Donald Trump recently declared, “We were at our richest from 1870 to 1913. That’s when we were a tariff country.” More recently, at a University of Alabama commencement, he proclaimed the graduates were “the first of the Golden Age of America,” suggesting they could become “the greatest generation” of Americans. 
While his nostalgia is clear, it’s essential to recognize that the so-called “Golden Age” he envisions closely resembles the Gilded Age — a time when America’s wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few, while the majority struggled with poor working conditions, low wages and limited opportunities. 
The economic boom of that era, fueled by monopolies and unregulated capitalism, was far from the broad-based prosperity that Trump’s “Golden Age” would seem to promise.
Yes, during the Gilded Age, America’s GDP grew swiftly. Steel output soared, railroads expanded, and millions of immigrants were welcomed to the U.S. But beneath the surface was a society defined by extreme inequality, labor exploitation, monopolistic power and systemic political corruption. These weren’t merely side effects of rapid growth; they were central to how the U.S. political economy functioned at the turn of the 20th century.
The danger of deregulated nostalgia
In “Why Nations Fail,” Nobel Prize-winning economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson explain that long-term prosperity comes not from tariffs or deregulation, but from inclusive institutions, meaning institutions that provide broad access to opportunity, protect property rights, invest in public infrastructure and empower people to shape their future. By contrast, extractive institutions are designed to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few — exactly what defined the Gilded Age President Trump’s “Golden Age” so clearly seeks to model.
Advocates of resurrecting that era often praise interstate competition through “race-to-the-bottom” deregulation and minimal federal oversight as keys to success. In reality, regulatory competition of the Gilded Age forced states to gut labor protections and enable corporate exploitation. Far from fostering inclusive growth, this “race to the bottom” entrenched extractive systems that crushed social mobility, stagnated wages, and concentrated wealth and power in the hands of a few. It wasn’t a model of progress; it was a system built to benefit economic elites at the expense of the working majority.
It wasn’t until the Progressive Era that the U.S. began confronting the damage. Reforms such as child labor laws, antitrust regulations and food safety measures started the shift away from extractive norms. While leaders like Theodore Roosevelt played a role in breaking up monopolies and expanding basic protections, the broader transformation came from a growing demand for fairness and economic inclusion.
These reforms didn’t just tweak the system; they largely dismantled an economy rigged for elites and began building one that served the many. The New Deal and postwar investments in infrastructure, education and health care weren’t acts of charity: They were strategic moves that transformed the U.S. into a global powerhouse. As “Why Nations Fail” makes clear, it is inclusive institutions — not trickle-down fantasies of a renewed Gilded Age — that drive real prosperity. They unleash innovation, expand opportunity and create growth that benefits an entire society, not just those perched at the top.
Fiscal warnings and misguided solutions
Today, that inclusive foundation is under threat from rising inequality, debt-driven growth and a creeping nostalgia for policies that favor power and wealth consolidation over competition, like many embedded in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie’s recent floor speech offers a needed warning: The current trajectory of fiscal irresponsibility — massive spending increases without real planning — is unsustainable. “We’re putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg,” he said, blasting what he called “fantasy math.” His critique of growing deficits and deceptive budgeting is valid. But the answer is not a retreat into Gilded Age austerity.
Slashing investments in education, health care, food security and infrastructure undermine the very foundations of inclusive growth. Fiscal discipline should mean aligning spending with long-term, broad-based investments — not dismantling the systems that support families, such as Medicaid for health care, SNAP for food assistance, Job Corps for workforce training, and federal grants for access to higher education.
Real greatness requires looking forward, not back
The real lesson of the Gilded Age isn’t that less government is better: It’s that bad government enables extraction, corruption and exclusion, eroding a nation’s future from within. President Trump’s calls for a new “Golden Age” echo the same flawed logic that underpinned the Gilded Age: Prioritize corporate power, promote race-to-the-bottom interstate deregulation, and treat public investment as waste. It’s not a vision of shared prosperity; it’s a blueprint for repeating one of the most unequal and unstable periods in U.S. history.
Today’s challenges, from deindustrialization and climate risk to a rapidly aging population, demand more than misguided nostalgia. They require systems built for resilience, fairness and broad participation. That means not dismantling institutions and disengaging, but doubling down on smart, inclusive institutions that empower the many rather than protect the privileged few.
If we want true American greatness in the 21st century, we must invest wisely, govern inclusively, and stay clear-eyed about the past. The Gilded Age was not a golden era; it was, as Mark Twain famously observed, gilded: shiny on the surface, but hiding rot beneath. Even HBO’s “The Gilded Age,” with all its glamorous fashion and opulent parties, doesn’t shy away from showing the bitter realities of the era — systemic inequality, exploitation of labor, and entrenched power structures that served the wealthy few.
President Trump may try to brand this chapter of American history as a “Golden Age,” but no amount of nostalgic gloss can hide what this age may truly be: an economy built on exclusion and extraction. History should remind us that it’s a path we cannot afford to walk again. The Gilded Age is history, so let’s work to keep it that way.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.
Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.
The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”
“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”
In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.
“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”
Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,
The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

It was my first time teaching high schoolers, and I was nervous.
But Carter — confident, articulate, and full of charm — quickly put me at ease. He spoke with sophistication, shared his dream of becoming an interior designer, and talked excitedly about acai bowls and fashion trends. So when a reading pretest revealed he recognized just 23% of letter sounds and was reading and writing at a kindergarten level, I was shocked.
Carter’s story is not unique—and that’s exactly the problem. According to the 2024 Nation’s Report Card (NAEP), a staggering 71% of Pennsylvania eighth graders scored basic or below basic in reading. While headlines often focus on early elementary reading struggles, too many older students quietly slip through the cracks, lacking foundational literacy skills by the time the curriculum shifts to “reading to learn.”
By then, the help they need is often unavailable. Teachers are expected to bridge these enormous gaps without the training or tools to do so. They want to help students succeed, but too many are entering classrooms without the tools they need to support children who read and write years below their age-appropriate grade level.  We are losing a generation of students to a literacy crisis that is both preventable and solvable.
Here’s where we can start: Require every teacher, regardless of grade level or content area, to receive evidence-based training in the science of reading. My personal struggle to access high-quality science of reading training, despite scholarships and grants, highlights a widespread systemic barrier for dedicated teachers. Our state must prioritize professional learning initiatives, partnering with experts to provide the essential skills educators need. No teacher should face such obstacles when striving to improve student literacy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
We can leverage the Pennsylvania Reading Leadership Council, formed in January 2025 to advise the Pennsylvania Department of Education on the development and maintenance of reading instruction and curriculum. This council can help ensure that all teacher training aligns with the science of reading.
During my 16th year as a teacher, I completed the AIM Institute for Learning & Research’s Pathways to Proficient Reading course, which provided me with a deep, research-backed understanding of how children learn to read, practical strategies, and ongoing support to implement that knowledge effectively, ultimately leading to improved literacy outcomes for my students.
The course content is explicitly designed around the vast body of research on how the brain learns to read. This includes critical components like phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.
Before completing this course, I lacked the strategies to help students like Carter — students who had missed out on explicit instruction in phonics, spelling patterns, and syllables. This course gave me a clear understanding of how children learn to read and what to do when they struggle.
With this knowledge, I was able to give Carter what he’d been missing: instruction grounded in structure, not guesswork. In just six weeks, he gained six months of reading growth. On the last day of our program, Carter smiled and said, “I used to hate reading, but I kind of like it now.” He even asked to take home some of the stories we’d read together, “Beds for the Kids” and “On the Job With Bill”— and he added “kindergarten teacher” to his list of possible careers.
If that’s what six weeks of structured literacy can do, imagine what’s possible with sustained, statewide training and support for all teachers.
In 2024, Louisiana’s fourth-grade reading scores soared 32% above the national average after partnering with the AIM Institute. Louisiana isn’t the only state driving change through teacher training. Mississippi, also collaborating with experts in the field, achieved a stunning feat: first in the nation for 4th grade and 8th-grade reading on NAEP results. Pennsylvania must follow suit. We need a similar partnership with the AIM Institute to equip every educator to teach reading and writing effectively.
It’s time for Pennsylvania to stop waiting and start leading.
By encouraging the Literacy Leadership Council to partner with science of reading experts to train teachers in effective literacy instruction, we can ensure every child learns to read and write, building a stronger future for our Commonwealth.  Every student should be able to walk into a classroom and be met by a teacher who knows how to teach them to decode words, understand language structures, and unlock the world of reading, just like I did with Carter.

The top priority: to send more hurricane aid west, as the mountains recovered from the deadliest storm in state history. And lawmakers had to meet a regular obligation, approving a state budget for the next two years.
But as so often happens on Jones Street, compromise did not come easily.
As the final days of regular business ticked by six months later, the General Assembly found themselves unable to agree on either issue — stuck in closed-door negotiations, bogged down in procedural debate and besieged by angry shrimpers.
A final breakthrough on Helene relief came Thursday — an agreement between the House and Senate to send $500 million to the western mountains.
But Republicans, who maintain strong control of the legislature, failed to find a middle ground on the budget. They left Raleigh without a new deal, and with a gulf wide enough to be branded “philosophical differences” by the Speaker of the House.
“We’re kind of holding tight right now,” Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters. “And making sure we’re not spending too much until we get the taxation resolved.”
The session was Hall’s first as speaker, and his fifth overall. He’s waved away questions of productivity and pointed to past budget struggles to say that the current stalemate is nothing new. His counterpart across the building voiced a similar sentiment.
Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), in his second decade in the role, was frank in his assessment of where budget negotiations stand.
“I think the whole thing boils down, in many respects, to insistence on the part of the House to try and renegotiate agreements that we’ve made in the past,” Berger told reporters. “And we were not willing to do that.”

Democrats remain in the minority in both chambers, though modest gains in the House have at times complicated the math for Republicans.
But both Democratic caucuses left the Legislative Building Thursday exasperated — arguing that the nonexistent budget was a result of GOP dysfunction and bad priorities.
“This is what happens when you’ve got supermajorities,” House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said. “Suddenly it becomes about everything but trying to help out folks. Because here’s the thing, at some level, you’ve got to govern.”
Democrats entered the session with a new leader of their own — as Sen. Sydney Batch (D-Wake) took the reins of the Senate caucus after Sen. Dan Blue’s (D-Wake) long tenure in the role.
“I think they’ve actually been at a stalemate,” Batch said of Republican leaders. “And they’ve been using each other’s bills to go ahead and fight with one another.”
Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday evening that the state faced “urgent challenges” that “need to be addressed through a fiscally responsible, full budget.”
What’s done: Helene aid, phones in schools & more
All told, the current General Assembly has sent over $1 billion in state dollars to western North Carolina for hurricane relief. That came in the form of two aid packages — one in March, and another this week.
Combined with two bills approved last fall, the legislature has spent around $1.9 billion to help the mountains recover from the record shattering disaster.
Republican leaders remained adamant that it was their top priority — but also stressed caution, not wanting to front-run federal aid or plunge the state into difficult financial straits.



That approach resulted in some long-requested line-items, like a grant program for small businesses, being left on the cutting room floor. Democrats, who frequently pushed for more investment but were seldom consulted, backed the aid bills but said they wanted to see more.
Among the other bipartisan-backed bills that crawled across the finish line: regulations on cell phone use in schools.
House Bill 959 requires districts to set cell phone policies. At minimum, students are barred from using them during class time. And the bill also asks districts to establish guidelines on internet use for students.
It received just one vote in opposition (Sen. Ralph Hise, R-Mitchell).
Other proposals now sitting on Stein’s desk proved far more contentious.
A trio of bills aim to wipe diversity, equity and inclusion efforts from all corners of the public sector — targeting K-12 schools, higher education and state government.
Republicans have taken after the Trump administration’s focus on the issue, aiming to eliminate diversity trainings and inclusive hiring practices. Democrats strongly opposed the measures, calling them harmful and chilling to academic freedom.
And one of the most controversial bills of the session started as a broadly popular plan — to crack down on “revenge porn” and sexual exploitation.
But when House Bill 805 reached the Senate, it took on a new identity: one loaded with conservative measures defining biological sex, recognizing just two genders and regulating school library books.
“We cannot ignore the biological realities,” Sen. Buck Newton (R-Wilson) said during floor debate.
Senate Democrats, infuriated by the changes, began to tie the chamber in procedural knots. An hour-long rules debate culminated in Batch waving a stack of cash in the air, declaring she would pay her members’ fines for failing to vote “yes” or “no.”
Batch called the culture war amendments a “poison pill.”
“They’re not going to go ahead and kill it themselves,” she said. “They just put a lot of other things on it, instead of letting bills just die or get passed on [their] own.”
In the end, the bill did pass, changes and all. The House approved of the changes — this time without Democratic support.

Veto battles: Immigration and guns
It took months into his first term for Stein to finally uncap his veto pen. Now that he has, Republicans will attempt to override him.
As of Thursday evening, the governor had vetoed three bills. Two of them deal with immigration.
One closes what Republicans have called a “loophole” in a 2024 law requiring sheriffs to comply with ICE “detainer” requests. The other requires state agencies to cooperate with ICE and bars undocumented immigrants from receiving state-funded benefits, among other things.
The ICE detainer bill is unconstitutional, Stein said, as he issued his veto. And the other immigration enforcement bill, he argues, “would … make us less safe.”
Stein also vetoed a bill allowing those over 18 to carry concealed firearms without applying for a permit.
A three-fifths majority vote is required in both the House and Senate to override a veto. Senate Republicans will likely meet that threshold with little difficulty, but the House GOP will have to count votes carefully — they’re one vote short of a supermajority.

Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg) previously voted for the ICE detainer bill. If she and every Republican are present, the House can override Stein’s veto.
The math is less favorable on the concealed carry bill, which received two “no” votes from Republicans.
Both chambers can call up override motions at any time when they return for session over the coming months.
What’s fallen short: State budget and shrimping ban
Throughout the final week of session, visitors clad in white t-shirts flooded the hallways of the Legislative Building, and at one point, trucks circled the block honking.
They were business owners and advocates for North Carolina’s coastal shrimping business. And they desperately wanted to kill a bill banning inland shrimp trawling.
Proponents say the bill bans a practice that harms juvenile fish and ruins habitats. The shrimping industry says the bill would be ruinous for their businesses.
On Wednesday afternoon, two of the most vocal Republican opponents to the bill left a private caucus meeting and were greeted with deafening cheers.
The bill was dead, Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort) told the group of advocates. He raised his arms in the air as Sen. Bobby Hanig (R-Dare) embraced one visitor after another.
“God bless America!” one person shouted.

Meanwhile, budget writers in the House and Senate struggled to find any common ground whatsoever.
It had become apparent in the weeks prior that the chambers’ full budget proposals were too far apart to quickly come to an agreement. So in a last-ditch effort, both chambers began fast-tracking what are commonly called “mini-budgets’: slimmed down spending bills that bridge the gap until a full two-year agreement is reached.
The Senate unveiled a bill that funded key economic development projects, enrollment growth for schools, and an array of other items.
The House promptly rejected it, countering with two bills of its own. One of them would have given teachers and state workers raises, while cutting 20% of state jobs (many of them vacant). Those, too, were dead on arrival in the Senate.
Those salary bumps are one of the key sticking points between the House and Senate. But arguably the most important gap revolves around state income taxes. Berger and Senate Republicans are staunchly opposed to changing a series of gradual cuts to the personal rate over the coming years. Hall and House Republicans have said some adjustment is likely necessary to avoid a budget shortfall.
In the meantime, the government will keep running — despite no budget being agreed to by July 1, when the new fiscal year starts. But new projects will stay in limbo, and teachers and state workers won’t see any raises for now.
“Our teachers, law enforcement, and other state employees deserve real pay raises so we can recruit and retain the best,” Stein said in a statement Thursday evening.
“In addition, at a time when the federal government is proposing severe cuts to Medicaid, leaving Raleigh without taking steps to fully fund North Carolina’s Medicaid program is irresponsible. I stand ready to work with the General Assembly to invest in our people and expand opportunities so every person can succeed.”
The final days’ GOP back-and-forth caused some Democrats to voice their exasperation.
“It’s a shame the other house is led by someone who wants to hold it up,” Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) said as the House took a vote on their bill to raise salaries for teachers and state workers. “That we had to break it out of the main budget, and broke this way … what a shame.”
Rep. Mitchell Setzer (R-Catawba), presiding over the House, was less moved.
“It’s been done that way since the beginning of time, sir,” he replied.

But far fewer — about 300 when discounting resolutions extending congratulations and condolences, and granting officiants’ wedding rights — survived the six-month session.
Some were killed outright, while others were left to languish in political purgatory known as legislative committee, or without the necessary budget funding to survive. 
On Thursday, we brought you five wins from the legislative session. Now, here are five losses.

1. Gas tax hike not enough to layoffs and service reductions at RIPTA
Cuts are coming soon to the state’s public bus service. That’s even after the General Assembly propped up the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) with nearly $15 million in the fiscal year 2026 budget, including with revenue from a 2-cent increase in the state’s gas tax.
It wasn’t enough to fill what was a $32.6 million shortfall when Gov. Dan McKee released his version of the budget in January. After state lawmakers reduced the deficit to $18 million, RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand said 90 layoffs and a 20% reduction in service may be necessary.
Durand told reporters Thursday afternoon that the deficit was down to $10 million after the agency identified another $8 million in savings from a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan.
When cuts would take effect is still to be determined. The agency plans to hold a series of public hearings on potential service changes starting July 28. But RIPTA already has a guide available — an efficiency study of its operations and financial situation mandated in the state’s fiscal 2025 budget. The governor and legislative leaders wanted the agency to finish the study by March 1, but the board of directors was focused on finding a permanent CEO and didn’t commission Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP to conduct the study until March 27.
The final report is expected to be complete no later than mid-July, Durand told the agency’s board of directors Thursday. Transit advocates said they believed the late efficiency study hurt RIPTA’s chances of getting additional state funds.
“Our hope was that the efficiency study would point out a menu of options for reducing costs before the session ended,” McKee spokesperson Olivia DaRocha said in an email Thursday. “Now, the vendor and RIPTA must continue the work of right-sizing operations to protect taxpayers.”
The efficiency study has been released in phases. A May 30 draft report identified underperforming routes, including the 88 bus, which travels between Simmons Village in Cranston to the Walmart off Plainfield Pike; Route 69, which connects the University of Rhode Island to the Port of Galilee; and the 59X express route in North Smithfield and Lincoln.
A June 16 draft memo suggested fare increases and rerouting rural routes to low-income areas, along with “reverse commutes” from Providence to other municipalities.
RIPTA was not without its champions in the General Assembly this year. On the final night of the session, Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, sought to raise an additional $10 million via a floor amendment that would have tapped a bit more into the gas tax and highway funding shares that would normally go toward the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. But the proposal was defeated by a 12-16 vote.

2. Building decarbonization dreams deferred 
Providence Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak beamed after the House of Representatives passed her bill requiring the state to track energy usage from large private and public buildings over 25,000 square feet. Kislak has been trying to set up a state building decarbonization program for four years. 
But her celebration of the June 20 vote was short-lived.
As the hours stretched from night into early morning during the marathon session finale, it became clear the Senate would not take up the legislation, ultimately dooming the measure advocates had viewed as crucial to meeting mandatory state emissions reductions.
The Senate instead passed a resolution asking the state’s Office of Energy Resources to recommend how to begin measuring large building energy use. Lawmakers had received a letter from Chris Kearns, the state’s acting energy commissioner, citing concerns about the bill’s “aggressive” timeline and lack of staff to achieve its mandates.
Deadlines for carbon reductions under the state’s 2021 Act on Climate Law are approaching. The first legally enforceable benchmark calls for cutting emissions 45% from 1990 levels by 2030. Preliminary modeling already suggests the state might miss its 2030 target if it doesn’t take action, including in the building sector, which accounted for nearly half of annual emissions in 2022, the most recent data available.
“We are absolutely ready to do this,” Kislak said in an interview. “We should already be doing this.”
Meanwhile, the city of Providence has laid the framework under a municipal building energy benchmarking program, with an inaugural December 2024 report documenting the energy and emissions usage for 63 city-owned buildings above 10,000 square feet. 
Much like the capital city’s program, Kislak’s bill, having already been revised, doesn’t prescribe target emissions for buildings; instead, it seeks to get a handle on how much energy they use now.
Yet even in her own chamber, lawmakers fretted over the burden on business owners, with 20 representatives — all 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats — voting against the bill.
Kislak acknowledged the bill’s name — “the Building Decarbonization Act of 2025” — might have caused some confusion.
“I should have called it the ‘building energy use measuring bill,’” she said. “That’s what it is, a measuring bill.”

3. Administration v. public records reform 
Advocates for legislation to reform Rhode Island’s Access to Public Record Act, unchanged since 2012, steeled themselves for criticism from McKee’s office. But the force and breadth of opposition — spanning a dozen state agencies, each with multiple points of contention — surprised even Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat and bill sponsor.
“In my 17 years as a lawmaker, I have never seen that many agencies respond to something on their own,” DiPalma said, referring to the letters and testimony to the Senate during an initial May 22 bill hearing. 
The legislation was held by the Senate Committee on Judiciary following the hearing. The House companion never received an initial hearing. 
DiPalma insists McKee’s office orchestrated the takedown, an allegation McKee’s office has not directly addressed in inquiries for comment.
“Transparency is in the public’s interest—that’s not in dispute—but the state must balance transparency with privacy rights and costs to the taxpayer,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office said in an emailed response. 
The 15-page legislation encompassed minor language tweaks and major updates meant to protect and expand access to affordable public information, while integrating new data sources like traffic accidents, police body-worn camera footage and text messages between officials into the definition of public records.
Based on the onslaught of administration criticism, DiPalma had already accepted defeat long before the Rhode Island General Assembly went on recess June 21.
“I’m going to spend my energy and calories where they are needed,” DiPalma said. 
But, he pledged to resuscitate the public records reform bill in the same form next year. Nor was DiPalma willing to meet with McKee’s office to talk over his concerns.
“I am not meeting again to hear them tell me the same thing, ‘no no no,’” he said.
Seconds later, DiPalma added a caveat: “But I am willing to meet with anybody if they are willing to figure out how to make something better.”

4. Universal school meals not on the menu
Lawmakers’ recurring appetite to provide free meals to all Rhode Island schoolchildren went unsatiated yet again in 2025. 
Three bills this year would have provided free breakfast and lunch for every kid attending public school, regardless of their family’s income. All three bills were heard by committees in their respective chambers of origin. And all three bills died before making it to a floor vote, just like last year. (The legislation did pass the Senate in 2023.) 
Rep. Justine Caldwell, an East Greenwich Democrat, led the legislation in the House of Representatives, just like she did last year. Caldwell’s bill was mirrored in the Senate by Sen. Lammis Vargas, a freshman Democrat from Cranston. Also in the Senate was another bill by Sen. Jonathon Acosta, a Central Falls Democrat.Co-sponsored by many of the same senators who signed on to support Vargas’ bill, Acosta’s bill sought to flex more regulatory muscle, with stricter rules around participation for local school districts. 
All three bills would have taken effect on July 1, 2026, and would have phased in universal school meals over three years.   
The push for universal school meals is not unique to Rhode Island and derives from programs adopted during the COVID‑19 pandemic with two years’ worth of federal waivers. As of May 2025, nine states had made this pandemic-era reform permanent by taxation, ballot initiatives, or maneuvers in the budget. 
McKee included $800,000 in his proposed fiscal 2026 budget in January to upgrade approximately 6,500 Rhode Island students from reduced-price meals to gratis ones. 
And as a new legislative session dawned in January 2025, then-Majority Leader Valarie Lawson named school meals as one of her policy priorities this session. Lawson co-sponsored both Senate bills, and in April, the East Providence Democrat became Senate president. 
But even a friend in a high place was not enough to uplift the bill in the chamber.
“The Senate President continues to support this bill and believes that it is a worthwhile investment,” Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, said in an email Thursday. “She will continue to support it when it is re-introduced next year, and will monitor if developments at the federal level impact the program.
Those federal developments could leave a crater-sized impact. The budget outlined in the “Big Beautiful Bill” has free school meal advocates worried that school meal programs could be severely delimited by changes to eligibility requirements.

5. McKee’s priorities forced to take a backseat
Gov. Dan McKee railed against legislative leaders for passing a “bad budget” that included higher taxes and fees he deemed unnecessary and burdensome to working families.
Many of his priorities were also stripped from the final $14.3 billion tax-and-spend plan, or significantly reduced.
Take, for example, the governor’s pledge during the 2024 State of the State address to raise residents’ incomes by $20,000 by 2030. The “Rhode to Prosperity” plan remained merely an outline until a year later, when McKee unveiled his proposed fiscal 2026 budget. The governor wanted to spend $9 million from state coffers and employer taxes to train secondary and higher education students, and the existing workforce, with the goal of boosting their income.
These programs are “crucial” to help residents adapt amid nationwide economic uncertainty, DaRocha, a McKee spokesperson, said in an email.
But lawmakers did not sign on to the funding needed for new apprenticeship programs at the Community College of Rhode Island and expansion of existing training programs through Real Jobs Rhode Island and PrepareRI. 
Initially, the fiscal 2026 budget unveiled by the House Committee on Finance also scrapped any new money for McKee’s signature Learn365 program, though state representatives agreed to add back $1.5 million for the after-school municipal learning program just before approving the spending plan on June 17.
Shekarchi in a June 10 briefing with reporters explained the cuts were necessary because of competing priorities and requests that exceeded available funds.
“What’s obvious was part of the solution was not doing the expenditures that the governor wanted,” said Michael DiBiase, former state administration director who now serves as president and CEO of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. “That’s how they reached balance.”
Meanwhile, both chambers took another swipe at McKee over his role in steering a 2021 state education contract to the ILO Group, with overwhelming support for a bill banning bid-rigging and penalizing public officials and vendors who flout the rules. McKee has not yet signed the legislation into law, though he indicated at an unrelated press conference Wednesday that his concerns with the bill were addressed.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Jessica Schneider, a member of Chesterfield County’s Board of Supervisors, was about to address a growing crowd of people protesting area immigration raids outside the Chesterfield County Courthouse Wednesday morning when her phone buzzed with news that visibly shook her.
Another immigrant, Salvador Calderon-Cuella — whose immigration status remains unclear at this time — had just been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and quietly whisked away through the courthouse’s back entrance.
Calderon-Cuellar had pleaded guilty in April to two misdemeanor traffic offenses — driving without a license and failing to yield when entering a highway. The fines totaled $130, according to Chesterfield General District Court records. On Wednesday, he arrived at the court to make the payment.
“As we are just here, someone was being taken out the back,” said Schneider, her voice cracking during an interview with The Mercury.

“He had no prior arrests. Can you tell me that that is a violent criminal person that should be detained? This is a person that is here, working in our communities, and why are we punishing him?” Schneider said. 
Since Friday, at least 14 immigrants had been arrested by ICE agents in and around the courthouse, according to reporting by Virginia Scope and other local media outlets. The arrests occurred over the course of several days, many following minor court appearances like Calderon-Cuellar’s. Immigration advocates say some of those arrested had no criminal convictions at all. 
The rash of immigrant arrests in Chesterfield comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has bolstered federal efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants, actions Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares have pledged to support. 
Schneider sees the sweep as part of a broader, politically charged campaign by the president and his allies.
“Trump says he wants to get rid of violent criminals and gang members,” she said in the interview. “But that’s not what’s happening now. This is just all about the cruelty and the racism. To purify our country is what I believe they’re trying to do.”
She grew more emotional as she reflected on her husband’s family history in Germany.
“We’ve been through this. We know what happens when people start to say that we’re better than them, and that we have to get rid of those people. And if we turn a blind eye, look at what happened then,” she said, holding back tears. “We need to stand up for our immigrant friends, neighborhood members and community members.”
 Community and economic toll

The arrests, which are also happening in many other parts of Virginia, come amid growing concern about the ripple effects of stepped-up ICE activity in the state. 
A recent study by the Commonwealth Institute and the Immigration Research Initiative warned that mass detentions of undocumented immigrants not only fracture families but could damage Virginia’s economy.
According to the report, released on Tuesday, undocumented immigrants are central to several key industries. They make up 28% of child care workers, 25% of construction workers, and 25% of cooks. Deporting just 10% of this population would result in a $69 million annual loss in state and local tax revenue — not to mention labor shortages and rising consumer costs, the study found.
“Forcibly removing community members en masse rips the fabric of our communities, erodes trust in law enforcement, and is costly for all of us,” said Freddy Mejia, policy director at the Commonwealth Institute and a co-author of the report.
Shamier Settle, a senior analyst with the Immigration Research Initiative and co-author, warned that deportations don’t only harm undocumented families. 
“Our economy is not a zero-sum game — when immigrants are deported the number of jobs for U.S.-born workers declines.”
 A courthouse, not a ‘sanctuary’

The courthouse arrests have also rattled local officials, even those with no formal oversight of immigration enforcement.
Amanda Pohl, chief clerk of the Chesterfield County Circuit Court, told The Mercury she only learned of the ICE presence after the first arrests occurred. While her office does not control operations in the General District Court — where many of the detentions happened — she immediately began reviewing policy with her staff.
“They’ve been in plain clothes, and so I don’t actually have an accounting of how long they were here, who was here, and how many were here,” she said of the federal agents. “Since I’ve been here, we do not call ICE on anyone, we do not ask for immigration status, and we will continue to implement that practice.”

While Pohl emphasized that her staff does not coordinate with ICE and wants the courthouse to be welcoming for all, she acknowledged the limitations of her authority. 
“We are not able to stop [ICE] if they come to the building,” she said. “But we are going to do our best to make sure that ICE is not in our office and not lurking about.”
Pohl disputed social media rumors that Chesterfield had declared itself a “sanctuary” county — suggesting such misinformation may have drawn ICE’s attention.
“Chesterfield is not a sanctuary county at all,” Pohl said. “But I firmly believe that this is hallowed ground, this is a sacred area. We have to respect the rule of law and due process, and that’s not what’s happening here.”
 Residents rally in response

About three dozen county residents and news media gathered outside the courthouse Wednesday in a protest organized by local civil rights groups and community leaders. Speakers condemned the ICE arrests as inhumane, excessive and a betrayal of democratic ideals. A lone passer-by who yelled out “God bless Donald Trump” was quickly shouted down.
Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield County NAACP, addressed the crowd first.
“Let us be clear, courthouses are sacred places in a democracy,” she said. “When ICE conducts raids in courthouses, we do more than just dispute legal proceedings. We undermine the very foundation of due process.”
Martin warned that courthouse raids don’t only impact immigrants.
“Imagine being a victim of domestic violence, showing up to court to seek a protective order, and instead being detained by ICE. Or think of a key witness in a criminal case who now refuses to testify out of fear of deportation,” she said. “These are not hypothetical situations. They are happening and happening right now.”
Among the speakers was Christian Martinez Lemus, a policy analyst with CASA, a national immigrant advocacy group.
“What we are seeing in the courts, which are supposed to be the places of law and order, is the full erosion of due process and constitutional rights,” Lemus said. “Make no mistake, this is not an issue of illegality. This is an issue of poor people being sent away for political purposes.”
Lemus framed the arrests as part of a broader anti-immigrant agenda driven by Trump-era ideology.
“President Trump’s vision is to wipe out the diversity melting pot this country is known for,” he said. “If ICE agents can wear masks, abduct people in courts, and send them to undisclosed prisons, do you think you are safe? No. We will fight darkness and fear through hope.”
Chesterfield resident Curtis Smith said he attended the protest out of concern for civil liberties.
“What ICE is doing is despicable,” he said. “I shouldn’t be in terror of walking out the courthouse and then wondering if I am going to get dragged off to a detention center because ICE agents saw that I have a Spanish name or something.”
He called the courthouse sweeps a “horrible ambush tactic,” adding that “people should have a chance to go to court without fear of something else that might happen to them when they go to court.”
 Political reactions split

Earlier this week, Youngkin defended the arrests, linking them to a broader law enforcement strategy. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the governor said Virginia’s Homeland Security Task Force had carried out over 2,000 arrests in collaboration with ICE, the FBI, DEA, and state police.
“The fact that there have been some arrests at the Chesterfield County Courthouse makes sense, because they clearly have been arrested, they clearly are here illegally,” Youngkin said. “It’s working. And most importantly, we’re getting really tough bad guys off the street.”
Miyares, whose office played no role in the arrests, nonetheless offered support for the federal operation. 
“These individuals fall into one of two categories: they’re either here illegally and have committed violent felonies, or they’ve already been ordered to be deported by a federal judge,” Miyares said in an email.
But civil rights leaders and Democratic lawmakers expressed alarm.
Del. Michael Jones, D-Richmond, released a blistering statement denouncing the courthouse operations as a “rupture in the social covenant” and a violation of constitutional values.
“The courthouse stands as hallowed ground within our constitutional republic — a sanctuary where justice is sought,” Jones said. “When ICE agents transform this space into a site of apprehension, they desecrate the very temple of justice their oath of office obligates them to uphold.”
Jones warned that such enforcement “engenders a climate of fear that permeates entire communities” and proposed several reforms, including designating courthouses as “sensitive locations” where ICE action would be restricted.
“These enforcement tactics do not occur in a historical vacuum,” he said. “They violate basic dignity. Justice without mercy isn’t justice at all — it’s just power masquerading as righteousness.”
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said the senator is monitoring developments and stressed the importance of transparency. 
“ICE officers should be clearly identifiable to the public as law enforcement to mitigate risk — including risk to themselves if people misunderstand what’s happening,” the spokesperson said.
In the meantime, the full scope of ICE’s presence in Chesterfield and other parts of the state remains unclear. Neither ICE nor the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has responded to The Mercury’s requests for comment.
 Statewide operations

However, the Chesterfield detentions are part of a broader pattern of stepped-up immigration enforcement across Virginia in recent months. 
In Sterling, ICE arrested 10 individuals outside the Northern Virginia Immigration Court earlier this year, prompting similar concerns from advocates about courthouse-related detentions undermining due process. 
In Albemarle County, ICE agents detained two men inside the Albemarle County Courthouse, sparking outrage from local attorneys and activists who said the operation put public safety and legal access at risk.
Additional raids have occurred outside traditional courthouse settings. 
In Northern Virginia, ICE and the FBI jointly detained seven undocumented individuals in what the agency called a “targeted enforcement operation” focused on alleged public safety threats. 
A separate joint operation in Richmond led to the arrest of an undocumented Egyptian national with a prior criminal history, though ICE did not release the individual’s name or further details. 
Overall, federal data cited by Axios indicates Virginia has seen a significant increase in deportation and detention activity in 2025, with the state now among the top 10 nationally for total ICE removals.
Also in Virginia, the Youngkin administration in February launched the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force (VHSTF) through a partnership between the U.S. Department of Justice and the commonwealth. 
Drawing in more than 200 agents from federal (FBI, ICE, DOJ) and state departments (Virginia State Police, Department of Corrections), the VHSTF was created to blunt transnational organized crime, gang violence, and immigration violations. 
Within two months, it recorded its first milestone — 521 arrests, including 132 individuals with alleged gang affiliations such as MS‑13 and Tren de Aragua — underscoring Youngkin’s description of the initiative as a model “federal-state collaboration” in law enforcement.
Top officials praised the task force’s rapid progress. Youngkin lauded the joint effort as a blueprint for national enforcement efforts, stating that its success “should be replicated all across the country.” 
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi hailed the operation as evidence of “unprecedented collaboration,” FBI Director Kash Patel called it “a tremendous success,” and ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons pointed to the expansion of the 287(g) program — authorized by Executive Order 47 on Feb.  27 and operational within 20 hours — as a key driver of the early results. 
The VHSTF continues to pursue long-term investigations into narcotics trafficking, transnational organized crime, and gang-related activity across Virginia.
Meanwhile, immigration advocates say they are hearing of similar arrests in other parts of the state and are preparing for legal challenges.
Standing outside the courthouse in the aftermath of Wednesday’s protest, Pohl, Chesterfield’s Circuit Court clerk, said as the struggle continues, the nation’s constitutional credence must take precedence.
“We have to respect the rule of law in due process, and that’s not what’s happening here,” she said.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Efforts to redevelop the aging State Center Complex in Baltimore have spanned decades and seen governors and legal battles come and go. Now Gov. Wes Moore (D) wants to try his hand at fixing up the campus.
Moore on Thursday issued a request for proposals on how the state can best transform the aging state-owned complex into a “mixed-use, transit-oriented” development.
“This next chapter for State Center will expand our mission to create jobs, build housing that’s affordable, and create new pathways to work, wages, and wealth in all corners of the state,” Moore said in a written statement on the endeavor.
The 28-acre State Center complex is currently home to several state agencies, including the departments of General Services, Health and Labor.
Due to the decaying conditions at the State Center buildings and the expectation that the property would eventually be redeveloped, thousands of state workers have been moved to offices in other parts of Baltimore in recent years, with the Health Department becoming the latest to join the exodus.

It’s an involved project, with the departments of General Services and Transportation and the Maryland Economic Development Corp. (MEDCO) all involved in the request for proposals on the property. The agencies hope to land on a consultant this fall, who would spend the next two years on the project.
“The primary goal is to retain a qualified development partner that will implement the redevelopment vision, with a focus on maximizing the economic development and housing potential of the site,” according to the proposals request. “The proposed work schedule estimates a 2.5-year timeline to execute the necessary activities leading to a Master Developer Agreement (MDA) with a potential development partner.”
Talks on redeveloping the campus go back as far as 2005, during the administration of Gov. Bob Ehrlich (R). The Board of Public Works first approved a redevelopment project in 2009, under Gov. Martin O’Malley (D).
That project ultimately fell apart, and then-Gov. Larry Hogan (R) filed a lawsuit in 2016 to terminate the $1.5 billion project. The ex-developer countersued.
Last November, the Moore administration brought an end to the saga by agreeing to pay a $58.5 million settlement, hoping to create a fresh start on development efforts.
When asked during a briefing for reporters Thursday morning, DGS Secretary Atif Chaudhry said that new efforts to revamp the location won’t repeat past mistakes, but will be “more collaborative” and informed than previous attempts.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We’re going from a very structured process – we’re not starting from scratch,” Chaudhry said. “We’re taking older studies that have been done as early as 2024, some dating back to 2018 and before, and we’re looping all those in to make sure that we take all that as an informed process and map out the future that will be in the best interest of the community.”
He said that details such as a timeline for redevelopment and the price-tag for the overhaul project will not be known until they are further along in the consulting process. Part of the consultant’s assessment will include decisions on whether buildings will be reused or demolished, along with other factors that could sway the costs of redevelopment.
State and city officials hope to capitalize on State Center’s proximity to a Metro Subway station and a Light Rail stop in the redevelopment.

“Conveniently located between two transit stations, the State Center Complex is a prime site for transit-oriented development to create a vibrant, dense, walkable community that helps connect Baltimoreans to jobs, affordable housing and opportunities,” Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld said in a written statement.
Most of the campus’s buildings were developed in the late ’50s. The Fifth Regiment Armory building, the oldest building in the complex, dates to 1901. The consultant is expected to work with a qualified historic building consultant to assess the armory.
“Today marks a major turning point in how we imagine our State Center Campus,” Chaudhry told reporters, “no longer as an antiquated government complex, but more as the future. To be a walkable, transit-oriented, community-centered place that serves the people of Baltimore and Marylanders.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec3_statecenter4_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)About 60 Maryland landowners are looking to block a federal district court ruling that said workers for the proposed Piedmont power line could go on private property to survey for the project without the landowners’ permission.
In their appeal Tuesday to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the landowners said the ruling last last week by U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson has “sweeping provisions and consequences” that will affect landowners for the “months or years” it will take Maryland regulators to consider the power line proposal.
Abelson’s injunction should be stayed while the case is on appeal, the landowners asked the 4th Circuit
“This is about protecting our homes, our land, and our constitutional rights,” said a statement from Joanne Frederick, president of the advocacy group Stop MPRP Inc. and one of the sued landowners. “We support the landowners’ decision to appeal, and we urge the courts to halt PSEG’s actions before lasting damage is done.”
The landowners represent about half of the 117 property owners in the path of the proposed power line who were sued in April by PSEG, the project developer, after they refused to let surveyors on their property.
Abelson last Friday agreed with PSEG in an order that said landowners could not deny access to the surveyors as long as the workers posted notice at least 24 hours in advance of their intention to come on site to do the work.
Federal judge grants Piedmont power line company access to land for surveys

The appeal is the latest development of in what is likely the early stages of a legal battle over the proposed 67-mile Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project transmission line, which would stretch from Frederick County to northern Baltimore County, through thousands of acres of largely rural land.
Residents along the line’s proposed path have balked at its impact on their properties and the landscape. They argue that the overall project places an undue burden on Maryland, largely for the benefit of energy-hungry\ data centers in Northern Virginia.
“This appeal gives the courts a chance to restore fairness and rein in overreach,” Frederick said in her statement. “Marylanders should not be forced to surrender their land rights for a project that serves out-of-state corporate interests.”
But officials at PSEG and at PJM — the electric grid operator serving Maryland and 12 other states — say the MPRP is necessary not only because of a surge in demand from data centers, but from rising demand for electrical power generally at a time of declining supply, thanks to the retirement of older coal- and oil-fired power plants.
The Maryland Public Service Commission, which regulates state utilities and power projects, is only just beginning to consider the transmission project, and decide whether to issue a key certification.
In a directive issued Thursday, the PSC cited Abelson’s order allowing surveys to take place, and called for its staff to set a schedule in the case in the next 30 days.
In their appeal, the landowners argued that by getting the preliminary injunction, “PSEG has secured the ultimate relief it sought in this case,” but without all the procedures that would ordinarily take place prior to a final decision.
The injunction was “issued without the benefit of discovery or an evidentiary proceeding during which Respondents could test the factual underpinnings for PSEG’s positions and the Court could weigh the evidence,” read the property owner’s appeal.
Absent a stay in the case, PSEG will likely begin surveying properties, using Abelson’s orders, the residents argued.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“If the Fourth Circuit later rules in favor of Respondents, that ruling cannot undo the invasion of Respondents private property rights, which PSEG will infringe under the guise of a preliminary injunction,” the property owners wrote. “The damage will have been done.”
They also worry that PSEG will apply Abelson’s injunction as a justification to enter all of the affected tracts of land along the proposed route of the power line — an additional 292 landowners, according to their appeal.
In assessing PSEG’s application for environmental effects, the Maryland Power Plant Research Program determined that several things were missing, including field studies and information that would show “why route alternatives were rejected, including those with minimal environmental impacts, and why PSEG did not address rebuilding or using existing parallel transmission lines for the project,” the PSC said in a Thursday news release.
“In light of the federal court’s decision affirming PSEG’s right-of-access, the Commission has directed its Staff to facilitate between PSEG and PPRP regarding the time required to produce the field studies and the feasibility of proceeding without them,” read the news release.
The Commission will make the final call on the procedural schedule. The PSC also directed PSEG on Thursday to turn over information about the alternative routes that were not ultimately selected within 30 days.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/federalappealscourt-richmond-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)It could have been called a productive day in the office for the board overseeing the implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. But the Accountability and Implementation Board still doesn’t have an office.
After three years of mostly remote work, the board in March approved a 10-year lease on a 3,012-square-foot office on West Street in Annapolis, with hopes of moving the first 10 staffers in this fall.
But AIB Executive Director Rachel Hise told the board at its meeting Thursday that permit and construction delays could push a move-in date off until early next year.
“Once the permits are issued, then obviously the renovation [and] construction on the space will begin,” she said. “It would be great if we could get in there before the end of this current calendar year, but we don’t know how long it will take for the permits to be issued.”
A project summary says it could take 120 days to complete construction and renovations to the office, followed by a final inspection by the Department of General Services before AIB staff can move in.
The board voted unanimously to take $140,000 that had been set aside in this year’s budget for supplies, furniture and other equipment, and shift it into the budget for fiscal 2026, which begins Tuesday.
Maryland Board of Education approves agreement to clarify roles on Blueprint reform plan

Office or no, the board had a productive day Thursday, welcoming new staff, saying farewell to some board members, finalizing an agreement with the state Board of Education and broadening a contract for an outside assessment of the Blueprint’s progress.
Taking a closer look at career counseling
The contract originally called for the nonpartisan research organization NORC, at the University of Chicago, to conduct an interim evaluation on the overall 10-year Blueprint reform plan and report back to the board by Dec. 1, 2026. The board in January approved a $766,709 contract, out of a $1 million allocation, for the contract.
The board Thursday voted unanaimously to appropriate most of the rest of that $1 million, increasing the contract with NORC by as much as $223,209 because of new state requirements for the scope of the study.
The expanded contract requires a review of the career counseling program for middle and high school students. The additional work was mandated as part of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act that takes effect July 1, tweaking parts of the Blueprint.
That will include assessing whether counseling services are preparing students for post college and career readiness pathways, determining the percentage of students who completed a career readiness assessment and the number applying to postsecondary education, training programs or registered apprenticeship programs.
For high school students, NORC will also review long-term metrics such as how many students were employed in a field of interest or related industry within a year of graduation, and the number of students who may be unemployed or not participating in a postsecondary education program.
A report on the effectiveness of the career counseling program must be submitted to the governor and General Assembly by Jan. 1, 2027.
The board also voted unanimously to give final approval to a memorandum of understanding with the state Board of Education, clarifying roles and responsibilities of the two organzations on the implementation of the Blueprint plan.

The Board of Education approved the memo Tuesday. It comes three years into the Blueprint’s implementation, following years of constant frustration from local school systems who were never sure which board was in charge of what parts of the plan.
Staff hellos, board goodbyes
The board introduced three more full-time employees who started Wednesday — one day after Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced a state hiring freeze would take effect next week, part of a package of measures aimed at trimming $121 million in personnel costs from the fiscal 2026 budget.
Hise said board staff are still determining how the hiring freeze might affect the Blueprint board. Meanwhile, she said, staff are still looking to hire a policy analyst for the Blueprint’s college and career readiness priority, along with two administrative positions. The AIB also has two contractual employees.
“We’re still working through the details of that [hiring freeze] and the impact, but we’re hopeful that we will be able to still get fully staffed in the next few months,” she said. “We will talk more about that next month, as we move into the [new] fiscal year. At this time, we feel like it’s manageable.”
The employees who started Wednesday are Alex Baum, who worked with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ preschool program and will be a policy analyst focused on early childhood education — the first of five “pillars” in the Blueprint.
Liz Smith and Simone Hall come from District of Columbia Public Schools, where Smith handled strategic planning and Hall was a liaison to the District on school budgeting. Smith joins AIB as a policy analyst on governance and accountability, and Hall will work as a financial analyst.
Before the 2 1/2-hour meeting ended, two board members received a virtual “thank you” to Mara Doss and Laura Stapleton, whose final meeting was Thursday.

Stapleton’s term expires Tuesday, but she chose not to reapply. She chairs the Human Development and Quantitative Methodology Department at the University of Maryland, College Park.
Doss, a former associate vice president for teaching, learning and student success at Prince George’s Community College, plans to resign Monday, with a year left on her six-year term.
Both had been on the board since its first-ever meeting in November 2021.
“It is important for you to know how much I appreciate your time and your efforts,” said board chair Isiah “Ike” Leggett. “I think that you will be very proud of what you’ve done, what you’ve accomplished, not only for the individual student, but the state of Maryland.”
Board member Joseph Manko, an education program officer at the Abell Foundation, also has a term that expires Tuesday, but he has applied for reappointment for a second term.
The AIB nominating committee is scheduled to meet next month and send the governor at least two names for each of three board vacancies.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As the federal government considers transitioning from using a funding formula to dole out money to public schools nationwide to providing block grants instead, the proposition is stirring debate among Virginia lawmakers and education leaders. A House of Delegates committee and school leaders convened last week to talk about the possible shift in education funding and the continued impacts of federal funding cuts statewide.
Supporters of block grants, or large sums of federal funding, argue that they would give states more flexibility to address individual issues. Critics, meanwhile, are concerned about whether the block grants would be appropriately and equitably distributed, including to English learners and at-risk students from low-income families.
The grants could also help school divisions know months earlier in the state budget process how much federal funding they will receive.
Suffolk Public Schools Superintendent John Gordon III said after the meeting that if the federal government switches to the block grant concept, Virginia lawmakers and education leaders need to create an action plan for implementation in schools here, including webinars and presentations for all school divisions facing massive federal funding cuts.
“What I do like about the idea of a block grant is that it would give school divisions some flexibility, but there’s also going to need to be some parameters on specifically what the grant can be used for,” Gordon said in an interview following the meeting.
Gordon, along with other division leaders from Cumberland County and Newport News Public Schools, spoke last Friday to the House committee studying the impacts of the federal workforce and funding reductions at their meeting on the campus of Norfolk State University. 
In February, the committee was established as Virginia braces for broader effects on its federal workforce and potential funding reductions. These changes are a response to executive order by President Donald Trump and his administration’s actions aimed at eliminating what they consider “wasteful” government spending.

Friday’s discussion broached impacts to Virginia’s coastal resiliency efforts, emergency management programs, rental assistance programs and tariffs on port operations. 
The discussion on the impact on state and local K-12 funding rounded out the meeting.
According to the state superintendent’s report for the 2023-24 school year, Virginia schools received $2.4 billion in federal funds.
Dr. Denelle Wallace Alexander, dean of Norfolk State University’s School of Education, said that while state and local funding make up most of the funding for public schools, federal funding also plays a crucial role in maintaining programs and staffing, providing resources, and supporting vulnerable populations. To put the funding in perspective, state and local funds comprised about 75% of total funding during the 2023-24 school year. Federal funds make up 10%, with the rest being loans and bonds. 
Wallace Alexander also said two university programs, in particular, have been impacted, which have helped increase the pipeline for school counselors and teachers.
“Our support for education must be paramount because we know that education is the foundation for everything else,” she said. “We must educate in order to stay ahead. We must educate to stay innovative, and we must educate to make sure that the health of the commonwealth of Virginia continues to stay strong because its citizens are well educated and they are able to take us beyond the 21st Century.”
Superintendents Chip Jones, formerly from Cumberland Schools, Michelle Mitchell from Newport News, and Gordon also shared with lawmakers grim details of how the changes in Washington could impact their respective school divisions.


 Appeals for relief funds

The meeting also comes as the Virginia Department of Education and several school divisions wait for the U.S. Department to decide whether to release schools’ relief funds back to them. The deadline to spend all allocated funds was abruptly moved to March 28 of this year; the original deadline had been set for March 2026, leaving schools scrambling to make plans for the money. VDOE is seeking $8 million and the school divisions are in line for $25 million.


In Suffolk, Gordon said the school division is facing a $11.3 million loss, impacting 100 positions that provide services to socioeconomically challenged families and students, as well as 15% of students in special education and the JROTC program, which serves 400 students.
Cumberland schools also face a $1.7 million reduction, with special education, after-school programs and career and technical education taking a hit.
“The majority of my federal funding funds people,” Jones said, adding that “people are where you cut … and it’s very hard to sit across from someone and tell them you’re losing your job.”
In Newport News, Mitchell said an area of concern for the school division is the impact of furloughed employees at the shipyard.
“While that’s not directly related to the federal cuts, it adds to the economic concerns because the shipyard is our largest employer in our school division,” Mitchell said. “So the federal cuts, in general, impact the city, which, in turn, of course, impacts the city’s ability to support our schools.”
Newport News is expected to face a loss of $700,000 for an adult education program and grants for English Language Learners, Mitchell said.
Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, the committee chair, described the changes as a “double whammy” for lawmakers, as they will try to balance the prospect of fully funding public schools while also managing other areas impacted by cuts.
Lawmakers have worked to address the lack of state funding for schools, most notably after researchers for the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which conducts analysis and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, found that the state had been underfunding schools since the Great Recession started in 2007.
The committee has a meeting scheduled for Aug. 14 at the General Assembly Building.
“We are very cognizant that these cuts are going to affect our local school districts,” Bulova said. “We’re just getting our arms around what the order of magnitude of those cuts will be and so we’ve got to make sure that we don’t set back public education after we have worked really hard over the last couple years, based on the JLARC report, to be able to catch up with K-12 education.”

Shuttered Norfolk brewery at center of ‘woke mob’ controversy needs nearly $2 million in 20 days

The company’s board has been gutted with only Alan Beal, the chief executive officer, still present after closing its Norfolk brewery in early March. In recent emails to potential investors, Beal said he is pressing on, looking for a new home in Texas or Florida and negotiating with a contract brewer despite not raising the capital he said the company needed to continue. 
Beal told investors in April that the company needed to raise seven figures by the end of the month. 
He pledged that if the company did not raise at least $1.7 million by April 29 — or raised less and could not negotiate payment plans — that it would refund the new investments.
“If we fall short of this goal, we will likely be forced to completely reorganize the company, or even terminate operations,” he wrote in an April 14 fundraising email. “And remember, all funds are going to be held in escrow until we know we have raised sufficient funds to pay off or restructure the existing debt, and to relocate and to move forward with the new business plan.” 
That campaign raised only $268,000, according to an email from Beal. Some of that paid former employees, a claim confirmed by one former staffer.

In email after email since April, Beal has blamed the company’s failure on a “woke mob” that spoke out after the Armed Forces July 2023 purchase of the former O’Connor Brewing for $3 million. Opponents pointed to social media posts by Robert O’Neill, Armed Forces’ former brand ambassador, board member, and the SEAL Team 6 member who claims to have killed Osama bin Laden, as offensive and reason not to support the company. O’Neill’s social media posts criticized the Navy for using a drag queen in a recruitment ad and mocked transgender people. 
But former employees laid the company’s problems on Beal. Interviews with nine former employees and contractors for Armed Forces said the Norfolk taproom did not reach its revenue potential partly because of the controversy. Armed Forces suffered setbacks selling beer, notably losing market share after failing last year to pay Brew Hub, a Florida contract brewery it had been using since before the Norfolk purchase.
“The closing of AFBC had nothing to do with a “woke mob,” former mid-Atlantic sales manager Tim Labbe wrote on Facebook in March, saying he was part of a team growing sales in seven states. “We had great relationships with the major chain grocery stores in those states as well as big distributors. When Alan (Beal) stopped paying bills and stopped complying with the agreements in place that all dried up.”
Prior to the latest request for funders, the company raised about $8.5 million from more than 10,000 investors who contributed a minimum of $200. They were supposed to get rewards ranging from stickers to hats, but an April Securities and Exchange filing said the company may not be able to fulfill that promise. Armed Forces suffered a net loss of $1.76 million for the first six months of 2024. The company has failed to file its annual 2024 financial report to the SEC. 
The majority of cash from investors over two years covered operating losses.
Armed Forces and Ironbound, which owns the property on 24th Street, remain in arrears on other bills. The city’s website shows that Armed Forces has unpaid property, food, and beverage taxes for 2025, but does not reveal the amount. Ironbound AFBC, which owns the brewery, owes $13,500 in real estate taxes dating back to December. 
A city spokesman said the amount of the food, beverage, and property taxes owed is exempt from Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act. The city has padlocked the building with “a large amount of beer on the premises and in the tanks,” according to an April SEC filing. That means the company has no way to generate revenue fulfilling orders to distributors.

The SEC filing also reveals Armed Forces has liens against it for construction costs totaling nearly $110,000 and has been sued in Norfolk by two former employees for $15,800 over unpaid salaries. A filing by a lawyer from Oliveri & Larsen, a debt collection firm, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, seeks to recover a “large claim” owed Barnes Beverage Group, a consulting firm. A lawyer for the firm declined to comment. Armed Forces has also been threatened with lawsuits for failing to pay three lenders a total of more than $335,000, according to the filing. Beal personally guaranteed two of those loans totaling nearly $250,000. 
The three loans are in default and the filing says, “there is great uncertainty as to whether the Company will be able to pay off or pay down the loan.”
Beal has continued making promotional appearances on sympathetic, small-audience media, showing up on Real American Blue, a streaming webcast hosted by Robert “Curly” Flanagan, a retired Arizona Maricopa County sheriff and a forthcoming FloBilly Swamp Wear episode filmed in Florida.

The long-term health care industry is facing a double whammy from President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants and the GOP’s proposals to reduce Medicaid spending. The industry is highly dependent on foreign workers: More than 800,000 immigrants and naturalized citizens comprise 28% of direct care employees at home care agencies, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care companies.
But in January, the Trump administration rescinded former President Joe Biden’s 2021 policy that protected health care facilities from Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. The administration’s broad immigration crackdown threatens to drastically reduce the number of current and future workers for the industry. “People may be here on a green card, and they are afraid ICE is going to show up,” said Katie Smith Sloan, president of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofits that care for older adults.
Existing staffing shortages and quality-of-care problems would be compounded by other policies pushed by Trump and the Republican-led Congress, according to nursing home officials, resident advocates, and academic experts. Federal spending cuts under negotiation may strip nursing homes of some of their largest revenue sources by limiting ways states leverage Medicaid money and making it harder for new nursing home residents to retroactively qualify for Medicaid. Care for 6 in 10 residents is paid for by Medicaid, the state-federal health program for poor or disabled Americans.
“We are facing the collision of two policies here that could further erode staffing in nursing homes and present health outcome challenges,” said Eric Roberts, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

The industry hasn’t recovered from covid-19, which killed more than 200,000 long-term care facility residents and workers and led to massive staff attrition and turnover. Nursing homes have struggled to replace licensed nurses, who can find better-paying jobs at hospitals and doctors’ offices, as well as nursing assistants, who can earn more working at big-box stores or fast-food joints. Quality issues that preceded the pandemic have expanded: The percentage of nursing homes that federal health inspectors cited for putting residents in jeopardy of immediate harm or death has risen alarmingly from 17% in 2015 to 28% in 2024.
In addition to seeking to reduce Medicaid spending, congressional Republicans have proposed shelving the biggest nursing home reform in decades: a Biden-era rule mandating minimum staffing levels that would require most of the nation’s nearly 15,000 nursing homes to hire more workers.
The long-term care industry expects demand for direct care workers to burgeon with an influx of aging baby boomers needing professional care. The Census Bureau has projected the number of people 65 and older would grow from 63 million this year to 82 million in 2050.

In an email, Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency “is committed to supporting a strong, stable long-term care workforce” and “continues to work with states and providers to ensure quality care for older adults and individuals with disabilities.” In a separate email, Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said foreigners wanting to work as caregivers “need to do that by coming here the legal way” but did not address the effect on the long-term care workforce of deportations of classes of authorized immigrants.
Goodwin Living, a faith-based nonprofit, runs three retirement communities in northern Virginia for people who live independently, need a little assistance each day, have memory issues, or require the availability of around-the-clock nurses. It also operates a retirement community in Washington, D.C. Medicare rates Goodwin House Alexandria as one of the best-staffed nursing homes in the country. Forty percent of the organization’s 1,450 employees are foreign-born and are either seeking citizenship or are already naturalized, according to Lindsay Hutter, a Goodwin spokesperson.
“As an employer, we see they stay on with us, they have longer tenure, they are more committed to the organization,” said Rob Liebreich, Goodwin’s president and CEO.
Jackline Conteh spent much of her youth shuttling between Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana to avoid wars and tribal conflicts. Her mother was killed by a stray bullet in her home country of Liberia, Conteh said. “She was sitting outside,” Conteh, 56, recalled in an interview.

Conteh was working as a nurse in a hospital in Sierra Leone in 2009 when she learned of a lottery for visas to come to the United States. She won, though she couldn’t afford to bring her husband and two children along at the time. After she got a nursing assistant certification, Goodwin hired her in 2012.
Conteh said taking care of elders is embedded in the culture of African families. When she was 9, she helped feed and dress her grandmother, a job that rotated among her and her sisters. She washed her father when he was dying of prostate cancer. Her husband joined her in the United States in 2017; she cares for him because he has heart failure.
“Nearly every one of us from Africa, we know how to care for older adults,” she said.
Her daughter is now in the United States, while her son is still in Africa. Conteh said she sends money to him, her mother-in-law, and one of her sisters.
In the nursing home where Goodness and 89 other residents live, Conteh helps with daily tasks like dressing and eating, checks residents’ skin for signs of swelling or sores, and tries to help them avoid falling or getting disoriented. Of 102 employees in the building, broken up into eight residential wings called “small houses” and a wing for memory care, at least 72 were born abroad, Hutter said.
Donald Goodness grew up in Rochester, New York, and spent 25 years as rector of The Church of the Ascension in New York City, retiring in 1997. He and his late wife moved to Alexandria to be closer to their daughter, and in 2011 they moved into independent living at the Goodwin House. In 2023 he moved into one of the skilled nursing small houses, where Conteh started caring for him.
“I have a bad leg and I can’t stand on it very much, or I’d fall over,” he said. “She’s in there at 7:30 in the morning, and she helps me bathe.” Goodness said Conteh is exacting about cleanliness and will tell the housekeepers if his room is not kept properly.
  Grooming Goodness is one of Conteh’s daily tasks. (Photo by Alyssa Schukar for KFF Health News)
Conteh said Goodness was withdrawn when he first arrived. “He don’t want to come out, he want to eat in his room,” she said. “He don’t want to be with the other people in the dining room, so I start making friends with him.”
She showed him a photo of Sierra Leone on her phone and told him of the weather there. He told her about his work at the church and how his wife did laundry for the choir. The breakthrough, she said, came one day when he agreed to lunch with her in the dining room. Long out of his shell, Goodness now sits on the community’s resident council and enjoys distributing the mail to other residents on his floor.
“The people that work in my building become so important to us,” Goodness said.
While Trump’s 2024 election campaign focused on foreigners here without authorization, his administration has broadened to target those legally here, including refugees who fled countries beset by wars or natural disasters. This month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked the work permits for migrants and refugees from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who arrived under a Biden-era program.
“I’ve just spent my morning firing good, honest people because the federal government told us that we had to,” Rachel Blumberg, president of the Toby & Leon Cooperman Sinai Residences of Boca Raton, a Florida retirement community, said in a video posted on LinkedIn. “I am so sick of people saying that we are deporting people because they are criminals. Let me tell you, they are not all criminals.”
At Goodwin House, Conteh is fearful for her fellow immigrants. Foreign workers at Goodwin rarely talk about their backgrounds. “They’re scared,” she said. “Nobody trusts anybody.” Her neighbors in her apartment complex fled the U.S. in December and returned to Sierra Leone after Trump won the election, leaving their children with relatives.
“If all these people leave the United States, they go back to Africa or to their various countries, what will become of our residents?” Conteh asked. “What will become of our old people that we’re taking care of?”

Image: Legal Aid NCThe North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill that would impose a freeze on the use of a major legal aid fund for anything other than administrative fees Thursday. The measure would place a hold on millions of dollars used for public assistance until 2026.
The provision, included in three bills that passed the House Wednesday, was approved by the Senate on Thursday as part of Senate Bill 429, the “2025 Public Safety Act.” It stipulates that no money from the North Carolina Interest on Lawyers’ Trust Accounts (IOLTA) fund, established in 1983 to fund legal aid throughout the state, may be used to issue grants or other public assistance programs.
IOLTA operates by pooling funds that lawyers are required to hold in trust so that they may collectively generate interest, which is used to fund aid programs for individuals who cannot otherwise afford legal assistance. Since its inception, IOLTA has awarded $134 million in grants supporting these efforts, helping in areas such as education, healthcare access, and housing.
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) moved to remove the IOLTA restrictions from all three bills Wednesday, noting a lack of relevance to the subject matter of the bills. The IOLTA provision was added to all three bills the day prior to their vote on the House floor.
“This is private money that accrues interest on lawyers’ trust accounts, and what this amendment will do, it will freeze it,” Morey said. “All the grants that could be started in 2026 will be frozen. All of you in your districts benefit from many of the grants that the State Bar puts out.”
She cited the importance of grants for victims’ compensation, elder law, and foreclosure prevention, as well as numerous other civil matters. “On January 1, there will be no money coming into these organizations that have been helping people in civil matters.”
Though the Senate rejected two other bills containing the provision Thursday, it ultimately passed the Public Safety Act, which includes the IOLTA freeze alongside dozens of noncontroversial changes to criminal procedure, such as increased penalties for soliciting minors, greater access to protective orders for victims of domestic violence, and creating new criminal offenses for habitual domestic violence and exposing children to controlled substances.
The bill heads to Governor Josh Stein’s desk for his decision on whether to approve or veto it. Should it become law, IOLTA funds will be frozen from July 1, 2025 until June 30, 2026. Grants issued in 2025 would still be paid out, but none could be issued in 2026.
In a January press release, IOLTA announced it would disburse roughly $12 million in grants in 2025, including $5,325,000 to Legal Aid of North Carolina, $1,160,000 to Pisgah Legal Services,
$1,070,000 to the North Carolina Justice Center. Smaller grants were allocated to groups like the Home Defense Project, Disability Rights North Carolina, and the Council for Children’s Rights.
The funds have also proved invaluable in the past in funding legal aid services to people impacted by natural disasters, with $970,000 being issued in 2024 for legal aid to victims of Hurricane Helene, that went toward helping indigent North Carolinians navigate insurance claims and evade consumer fraud attempts.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Legal-Aid-NC-logo-1024x1024.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of last month, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.

Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.










Roofers are right out there where you can see them.


– Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance


Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”

In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

Between new rounds of redistricting and even more restrictive voting legislation, Republican state lawmakers seem poised to engineer an easier path for their party’s candidates, they say.
“I think Ohio has become something of a test subject state for seeing just how far a super majority can chip away at access to the ballot and our rights to direct democracy,” Kelley Dufour from Common Cause Ohio said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
With Republicans notching several wins in 2024, the “sensationalized” version of voter restriction rhetoric has taken something of a back seat, Dufour said.
“But forces are still working behind the scenes, right? At an administrative death by 1,000 cuts,” she said. “It’s a quieter process, but it’s significantly harmful to voters.”
One example is a sharp uptick in provisional voting.
In 2024, Dufour explained, 34,000 had to vote provisionally — roughly 40% more than in the last presidential election.
Meanwhile, Ohio lawmakers are considering new measures that would require proof of citizenship to register and open the door to challenging a voters’ citizenship status on Election Day itself.
Proof of citizenship would require voters gathering birth certificates, divorce records, name-change records, or other paperwork.
This has already presented difficulties, for instance, for some trying to obtain a National I.D. card for air travel.
How it plays out on the map
But the “cherry on top,” Dufour said, is redistricting. Ohio could see a major shakeup to its congressional map ahead of next year’s midterms because lawmakers here are legally required to draft a new map.
Right now, Ohio has 15 districts with five represented by Democrats and 10 represented by Republicans, or 33% to 66%.
Ohio U.S. Congressional redistricting is on the agenda for 2025, with advocates preparing

Midterm elections typically serve as a kind of referendum on a new presidential administration. Historically it has not been kind to the president’s party. That’s particularly concerning in the U.S. House, where Republicans are clinging to a thin 220-2012 majority.
Redistricting in GOP-controlled states like Ohio and Texas could turn that vulnerability into an advantage.
Common Cause Texas Executive Director Anthony Gutierrez explained, in his state, the governor has already announced a special session in July.
The governor hasn’t shared what will be on the agenda, but at a recent press conference the state’s lieutenant governor was enthusiastic about the idea.
“He was asked about redistricting, and he said that he does think that if there’s any opportunity for Republicans in Texas to pick up some seats, that he does think that they should do it,” Gutierrez said, “So, nothing confirmed, but senior Republicans who probably have some insight into what’s going on, have been giving indications that they do think this is going to happen.”
In Ohio, lawmakers have to come up with a new map because the last one was approved along party lines.
The General Assembly has until the end of September to come up with a map but has shown little inclination to do so thus far. If lawmakers don’t act, that would put the task back in the hands of the seven-member Ohio Redistricting Commission.
“Currently, we have five Democrats and 10 Republicans that Ohio sends to D.C.,” Dufour said. “The map-making process could eliminate a few Democratic-leaning districts.”
What that might look like in Ohio
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno is eager to see it happen. Moreno told Punchbowl News he thinks the GOP will pick up two additional seats and that Republicans controlling 12 of 15 districts — 80% of the delegation — “reflects the state.”
Moreno reasoned there’s “a recognition” that big cities like Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland will be represented by Democrats.
Moreno won his statewide race with just 50.09% of the vote, a far cry from the 80% share he thinks Republicans should control in the U.S. House. In addition to losing the three Cs, Moreno lost counties anchored by Toledo, Akron, Dayton, and Athens.
Sitting in the crosshairs of Ohio’s redistricting effort are Ohio Democratic U.S. Reps. Marcy Kaptur and Emilia Sykes. Kaptur’s Toledo-area district and Sykes’ Akron-based seat are the two most closely divided districts in the state.
Both lawmakers have drawn familiar challengers. Republican former State Rep. Derek Merrin has joined a crowded primary field for a rematch against Kaptur. State Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., has thrown his hat in the ring, too.
In Sykes’ district, her 2024 opponent, Republican former state Rep. Kevin Coughlin, is running to face her again, as well.
In both contests, even minor tweaks to the map could have a significant impact on the outcome. Sykes only beat Coughlin by about two points. Kaptur’s margin was even tighter. She beat Merrin by just 2,382 votes — less than a percentage point.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)NEW ORLEANS — This isn’t just any old list.
With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.











I mean, think about it: You're making money off of my brand, and I didn't even know about it.


– Louisiana Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert



The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.
“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.











We didn't make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.


– Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey



Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Steep fines in Iowa set off state-federal showdown over child labor laws

Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-27 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"Estimates show $190M more revenue, right after budget is adopted",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/27/ct-budget-legislative-session/,"Once again, Gov. Ned Lamont's administration found a big pile of money shortly after lawmakers closed the regular legislative session.","Once again, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration has identified a big pile of money, almost $190 million, shortly after legislators have adopted a new budget and closed their regular legislative session.
Leaders who’ve already watered down new investments in health care and special education while scrapping income tax relief for middle class families are getting frustrated.
Over the past seven years, Lamont’s budget office has upgraded revenue estimates an average of $285 million in the first 2 ½ months after lawmakers leave the Capitol.
In other words, there’s often considerably more money available than projected. And leaders from both parties this week said it’s time to reevaluate Connecticut’s forecasting process.
“It’s occurring year after year, said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven. It’s a pattern now.”
Connecticut lawmakers can’t invest in new programs, cut taxes or otherwise craft a new state budget without knowing what’s available to spend. But their most crucial forecast — delivered just 15 days after the mid-April income tax filing deadline — has being viewed by some as unreliable.
Gilchrest: ‘We need to have an honest conversation’
The $285 million average variance between what Lamont’s analysts reported in late April of the past seven years and what they projected by mid-July is more than three times the $92 million average gap lawmakers dealt with between 2011 and 2018 under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, according to state budget records.
The coronavirus pandemic may have inflated Lamont’s numbers somewhat. The traditional April 15 income tax filing deadline was pushed to July 15 in 2020 and to May 15 in 2021, severely limiting data for analysts to use in projections.
But even after excluding those two years, the average gap during Lamont’s tenure is almost $200 million.
And sometimes, legislators say, the timing on these changing projections is particularly hard to swallow.
The administration increased this year’s tax receipts estimate by $188 million on June 20, 16 days after the regular 2025 session ended and 18 days after lawmakers adopted a new state budget, which Lamont hadn’t even signed into law by Thursday night.
Surging revenues just before the fiscal year closes on June 30 typically translates into extra revenue in the next year or two.
“Had we been aware of the likelihood of that money,” Looney added, “clearly there would have been advocacy to fund some of our priorities at a higher level.”
Majority Democrats, already frustrated by budget controls that save aggressively at the expense of core programs, watered down several big initiatives. Administration officials note budget caps might have blocked more spending anyway, but lawmakers used several accounting maneuvers to work around those, often collaborating on them with the governor.
An Appropriations Committee proposal to add $84 million for special education grants next fiscal year became just $30 million, well below what local school districts need to meet rising costs.
Hopes for a new $600-per-child state income tax credit aimed at hundreds of thousands of households eventually became a flat $250 payment — and only to families making about $67,000 per year or less. It would distribute about 1/8th of the projected $300 million cost for a full child tax credit.
“When we find money like this, after the budget is done but before the end of the new fiscal year, it’s going to raise concerns among my members,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said of the administration’s new projections.
“We need to have an honest conversation about Connecticut’s revenue and our budget,” said Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee, who watched in disappointment as 80% of a planned $75 million increase in long-neglected Medicaid rates for doctors who treat the poor vanished from the first year of the new budget.
“People pay their taxes so that government can support them when they need that” help, Gilchrest said. “It’s just very frustrating.”
And with Congress and President Donald Trump debating massive cuts in state assistance for Medicaid and other human services programs, Connecticut can’t miss opportunities to bolster its safety net because of outdated revenue projections, said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of the progressive grassroots coalition Connecticut For All.
“This money needs to immediately be invested in many programs our communities are crying out for — housing, health care, education — to safeguard us from Trump’s cuts,” she said.
Republican leaders, who often are hoping for a revenue surge to finance tax relief, were equally annoyed.
The House and Senate minority leaders, Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford and Stephen Harding of Brookfield, said unsuccessful GOP efforts to block tax hikes on corporations would have been aided by the knowledge that revenues already were on the rise.
Under the new budget, corporations will pay an extra $213 million in taxes over the next two years combined due to changes in income reporting and other rules. And a corporate tax surcharge that was supposed to expire would be extended to 2028, raising another $128 million over the coming biennium.
“I think that this budgeting process has now become political rather than policy-oriented,” Candelora said, adding he fears Democratic efforts to circumvent budget caps have prompted Lamont to become hyper-conservative when projecting revenue.
“I think a siting governor has joined that chorus and is trying to outmaneuver the legislature,” Candelora said.
The Lamont administration irked many legislators earlier this year when the Connecticut Mirror disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars in interest earnings on federal COVID grants, dating back to 2021, weren’t deposited into the General Fund until January 2025.
The governor’s budget director, Jeffrey Beckham, said it stemmed from a misunderstanding with the treasurer’s office.
GOP lawmakers were frustrated in June 2022 when they pitched a plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in income, fuel and transportation taxes but were blocked by Lamont and Democrats, in part by arguments that revenues wouldn’t support the cuts.
By mid-July 2022, the administration identified an extra $568 million in tax revenues.
“I always believe in transparency,” Harding said. “I know the governor says he believes in transparency. … There’s something that’s not adding up.”
Revenue forecasting isn’t an exact science
But the Lamont administration noted that revenue forecasting is hardly an exact science, and receipts from the income tax — which generates more than $11 billion annually or roughly half of the resources for the General Fund — can vary significantly in a short period of time.
“These are estimates, and there has been significant international macroeconomic uncertainty over the past several years, including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, tariffs, and wars,” said Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee.
And given how much the income tax generates, he added, a variance of $285 million isn’t unusual.
The legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis recently confirmed revenue growth like what Lamont’s staff reported on June 20. 
Analysts for the governor and the General Assembly, working largely off data provided by the Executive Branch, jointly prepare an April 30 report, projecting revenues for the current fiscal year and the next three. Legislators chiefly rely on this forecast to craft new budgets and make any final adjustments to the outgoing one.
But many years that work isn’t finished until early June. And by then, the revenue numbers often seem to change.
Legislative leaders didn’t accuse the Lamont administration of intentionally withholding data on revenue growth, but they did say it’s time to revisit the process and ensure lawmakers have more up-to-date information before they make decisions.
Connecticut’s legislature meets for roughly three months, from early February to early May, in even-numbered years. But during the longer sessions, which run from early January to early June, legislators could receive an updated revenue projection entering the final week or two, Looney said.
“I think we need to find a way to adjust the calendar to gather as much information as we can,” he said.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the tax-writing Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, noted legislators imposed new reporting mandates this spring to better anticipate growth in program costs. 
A natural next step, she said, is better estimates on the revenues that can support new investments or finance additional tax relief.
“Obviously, as you negotiate a budget,” Ritter added, “this is pretty critical information to have.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_BudgetDay098-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-27 06:01:40.149307

Tax policy can be maddeningly complex and confusing. Indeed, keeping it that way is one tool the super-rich use to avoid paying their fair share.
As Alexandra Sirota of the nonpartisan North Carolina Budget and Tax Center recently observed, however, it doesn’t have to be that way.
As she notes, there’s a simple and commonsense solution that would dramatically improve our state’s regressive tax system and raise close to a billion dollars per year – a millionaire’s tax.
By raising the state personal income tax rate on annual incomes over a million dollars to seven percent – a rate that would still be lower than what millionaires paid as recently as 2013 – North Carolina would realize an annual boost in state revenue of around $980 million. That would be enough to help insulate the state from the massive cuts in federal dollars that are about to be enacted in Washington.
The bottom line: Right now, North Carolina taxes people of fabulous wealth and those living in poverty at the exact same rate. A simple millionaire’s tax would do much to cure this grave inequity.

(Photo by Tek Image/Science Photo Library via Getty Images)After years of pressure over lost or untested sexual assault kits, a growing number of states are adopting systems to track the kits — giving survivors a way to follow their evidence through the justice process.
But despite nearly $400 million in federal support since 2015, backlogs persist, and some states still lack basic oversight. And now, advocates fear such financial support is on shaky ground.
There are an estimated 49,248 untested kits across the country, according to data collected by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group. Although the exact number of backlogged kits nationwide is unknown, a 2022 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that summarized existing research found backlog estimates ranging from 90,000 to 400,000 kits.
After a sexual assault, a survivor may choose to undergo a forensic exam, during which a trained health care professional collects evidence over the course of several hours.
That evidence — which may include clothing, photos of injuries, blood, urine, and DNA samples — is compiled into what’s commonly known as a rape kit or sexual assault kit. The kit is then sent to a crime lab for further testing.
Test results are sometimes returned to investigators who check for DNA matches in national or state databases. A match could connect the case to other sexual assaults or link a suspect to another crime.
But processing a single kit can take days, months, or even years, depending on when they are submitted and how much other work crime labs have. In some states, there are no laws requiring law enforcement to send rape kits to a lab within a specific time frame or mandating how quickly those kits must be tested.
Survivors are often left in the dark. They may not know if their kit was tested, whether a suspect was identified, or if their case is moving forward.
That silence — the uncertainty about what happened to the kit — has long been the norm in many parts of the country.
“We have betrayed at least a generation of survivors in the way that the criminal justice system and the larger public have responded to sexual assault,” said Rachel Lovell, an associate professor of criminology and the director of the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland State University. Lovell has conducted extensive research on the impact of untested rape kits in Ohio.
The goal of tracking systems is straightforward: bring transparency to a process that for decades left survivors without answers. These systems allow victims to log in and track the status of their kits — from collection to testing to storage — and offer law enforcement agencies a tool to identify and prevent testing backlogs, and strengthen criminal investigations.
At least 37 states, including New Hampshire, have established or committed to establishing a rape kit tracking system, according to the End the Backlog website run by the Joyful Heart Foundation. The foundation supports survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse.
Two more states — New Jersey and Pennsylvania — announced plans this year to build their own tracking systems. In New Jersey, a new law gives the attorney general’s office until Aug. 1 to set up the tracking system. Pennsylvania officials are preparing to launch a statewide inventory of kits to better understand the scope of the backlog before developing their system.
A handful of other states have also enacted or are considering legislation to support their sexual assault kit tracking programs.
In Arizona, for example, Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May requiring all police departments in the state to use a system called “Track-Kit.” The new law primarily affects the Phoenix Police Department, which opted out of using the system in 2016. That department is expected to launch the platform later this year.
At the federal level, support for kit testing and tracking has often come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, or SAKI, which has awarded nearly $400 million to 96 grantees, including local and state agencies, across 44 states since 2015.
But the program’s future has not always been certain.
In January, the federal Office of Management and Budget had listed the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative as a program whose funding would be frozen, before walking back the widespread freeze amid legal challenges.
President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would maintain funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative at $51.5 million, according to a new report from the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
But a separate round of federal Department of Justice grant cuts in April has raised concerns about the stability of broader support services for survivors. That round of cuts affected a variety of grant programs, including domestic violence shelters, trauma counseling, legal assistance and hospital advocacy.
The timing is especially concerning, advocates say, as victims of crime face growing obstacles to accessing state-provided support. In many states, victims seeking financial compensation encounter long delays, burdensome paperwork, or are disqualified entirely by narrow eligibility rules.
Police investigations and funding
In jurisdictions that have worked to clear their backlogs, testing sexual assault kits has helped identify serial offenders, solve cold cases, and connect assaults or other crimes to the same perpetrator.
Nationwide, testing supported by the federal Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has contributed to at least 1,538 convictions. Still, these types of crimes are vastly underreported to police.
Rapes and sexual assaults are notoriously difficult to investigate and prosecute, said Lovell, of Cleveland State University. But testing all rape kits can reveal patterns of criminal behavior over time and provide deeper insight into how, when, and to whom these crimes are happening — ultimately helping improve support and case outcomes for survivors.
“By prosecuting sex offenders, you can also work to address violent crime more generally and solve past or future crimes with the addition of evidence and DNA,” Lovell told Stateline.
In her research on untested rape kits in Ohio, Lovell has found that since 2015 — when the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative launched — cases overseen by the Cleveland Police Department have been more likely to move forward in the investigative and prosecutorial process, with fewer being labeled as unfounded. Police reports, she said, also have become more detailed and trauma informed.
The initiative itself may not be the sole reason for these changes, Lovell said. Other factors, such as departmental policy changes or officer training, may also have played a role.
Although SAKI grants remain one of the primary sources of support for testing backlogged kits and building tracking systems, communities may face challenges sustaining progress once the federal dollars run out.
Capt. Tim Hegarty, division commander of the Office of Professional Standards at the Glynn County Police Department in Georgia, said local agencies must push through potential funding cuts.
“It falls back on agencies to do the job that they say they’re going to do, even when the money has dried up,” Hegarty said in an interview. “Doesn’t matter who’s in the [presidential] administration.”
Hegarty added that many departments across the country are still catching up when it comes to interviewing victims with sensitivity and investigating sex crimes.
“Law enforcement really has not advanced a great deal when it comes to dealing with these types of crimes,” Hegarty said. “It’s not the universal language when it comes to policing across the country.”
New statewide tracking systems
Other states are looking to strengthen existing programs through new oversight measures and stricter processing timelines.
Maine is one of the 11 states without a statewide rape kit tracking system. But state lawmakers are considering a bill that would create one and require law enforcement agencies and the state’s crime lab to inventory and test backlogged kits. The bill passed the House in mid-June and is currently under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in early June aimed at improving the state’s capacity to process sexual assault kits. The new law establishes the Colorado Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Evidence Review Board, which will evaluate the state’s medical, legal and criminal responses to sexual assault.
The governor and attorney general have until Aug. 1 to appoint board members. A preliminary report is due to lawmakers by Dec. 15.
The law also strengthens oversight of kit processing timelines. Law enforcement agencies must now provide survivors with updates on the status of their kits every 90 days. It also sets a new 60-day goal for crime labs to process forensic medical evidence, shortening the current 90-day goal.
As of May 31, 1,324 kits were backlogged, with an estimated testing turnaround time of about a year and a half, according to the state’s dashboard.
Alaska, which launched its statewide rape kit tracking system in 2023, considered a bill this year that would have expedited processing timelines for sexual assault kits. The bill passed the House without opposition but failed to advance through the Senate before the legislative session ended in May.
Although the number of untested kits has significantly declined since the state began inventorying them in 2017, 254 kits remained untested at the state’s crime lab in 2024 — up from 113 the previous year but well below the 3,484 recorded in 2017.
In Georgia, lawmakers considered a similar bill that would have established new rules for collecting, testing and tracking evidence from sexual assault kits. The bill did not advance before the legislature adjourned in April.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation reported in December that 2,298 kits were tested between July 2023 and June 2024, with 480 kits still awaiting testing. Another 1,612 older cases submitted before 1999 were flagged for DNA testing, of which 837 had been tested as of June 2024.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Compromise budget language hashed out this week by an Ohio House-Senate committee will make problems hurting Ohio pharmacies infinitely worse, the leader of a group that represents them said Thursday.
He added that the Ohio Chamber of Commerce — which advocated part of the legislation — seemed blind to the effect it would have on member businesses by making it more difficult for employees to access medicine.
As it works against a June 30 budget deadline, a House-Senate conference committee approved an amendment that keeps part of a bill meant to help ailing pharmacies but slashes another. 
The result, said Dave Burke, a pharmacist, former state senator, and executive director of the Ohio Pharmacists Association, will be that pharmacies will go from earning scant profits to none at all.
“It’s any pharmacist’s suicide bill,” he said Thursday.
Ohio pharmacies have been in trouble for years. 
They’ve complained of high fees and low reimbursements from huge middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. Last year, Ohio lost 215 pharmacies and their total number dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory, according to an online tracker launched by the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. 
As pharmacies disappear, they create a lack of access that is particularly hard on the poor, elderly and disabled. Not only do they get their medicine at what are often main-street businesses. They also get professional medical advice about chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure.
PBMs, the middlemen, decide which drugs are covered, and they use a non-transparent system to decide how much to reimburse pharmacies that dispense them. The three biggest control nearly 80% of the marketplace.
As pharmacies close, Ohio Chamber blasted for siding with middlemen

Each of those companies is part of a Fortune 15 health conglomerate that also owns a top-10 health insurer. CVS owns the largest retail pharmacy chain and all three own mail-order pharmacies.
So, when the big PBMs decide reimbursements, impose rules and charge fees, they’re doing so for their own pharmacies and their competitors. That’s a glaring conflict of interest, their critics say.
There have been abuses in Ohio. In 2018, the Ohio Department of Medicaid peeled back the curtain and learned that a year earlier CVS and UnitedHealth’s PBM, OptumRx, charged taxpayers $224 million more for drugs than they paid the pharmacies that had dispensed them. The Medicaid department fired the PBMs. 
In 2022 it got rid of their hidden, seemingly arbitrary system of reimbursement in which the same companies sometimes pay 500 different prices for the same drug. Instead, prices are determined by a public survey published by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — the National Drug Acquisition Cost, or NADAC. 
With pharmacies no longer losing money on some drugs and making it on others, the Medicaid department set a $10 per-prescription dispensing fee to cover pharmacies’ overhead. Even with the increased dispensing fees, an analysis said the state saved $140 million from the reforms.
Ohio state Rep. Tim Barhorst, R-Fort Laramie, this year proposed to use the same arrangement in many non-Medicaid transactions. That measure made it into the Ohio House budget, but then ran into opposition in the Ohio Senate, where the Ohio Chamber had been telling members the dispensing-fee requirement was a tax.
What emerged from the conference committee late Wednesday might have seemed like a compromise to its members. It kept the provision that drug reimbursements would be based on NADAC, the publicly available price list, but it got rid of dispensing fees.
To Burke and other Ohio pharmacists, it’s the worst of both worlds. Not only couldn’t they profit from over-reimbursements under the traditional, non-transparent system, they also couldn’t cover overhead from a fixed dispensing fee.
Of the measure agreed to by the conferees, Burke said, “That proposition only works with a second proposition — the dispensing fee. Because the bag, the bottle, the lid, the pharmacist, the tech, the lights, the heat and the air conditioning all have a cost. In any business model, whether it’s medications, pizzas or cars… you can’t buy ingredients for a dollar and sell pizzas for a dollar and stay in business.”
He predicted that if it becomes law, there will be a mass exodus from the already depleted ranks of Ohio pharmacies.
“If pharmacies can’t make any money — this legislation makes it so that you’re not making any money at all — it would probably force the closure of the overwhelming majority of pharmacies in this state,” Burke said. “Even a child mowing yards is not going to buy a dollar’s worth of gas and accept a dollar to mow your yard.”
Once conferees agree on a budget, Gov. Mike DeWine has the power to veto line-items in it. Burke said he hoped the governor would consider such a move.
“I think the governor’s office would be well placed to consider a veto and we will be expressing our concerns that the legislation is flawed, and that if he doesn’t, the amount of pharmacy closures in Ohio in the next weeks if not months will explode,” Burke said.
Dan Tierney, DeWine’s press secretary, was non-committal when asked about the matter.

“We have not received final budget language but will be reviewing the final language when received,” he said in an email Thursday.
Burke didn’t accuse any of his former colleagues of ill-intent in agreeing to the measure.
“I think they believed that if they stepped in and said we’ll make sure you get paid what you paid for the drug that will fix everything,” Burke said. “But this legislation takes everything you made a profit on and brings it to zero.”
However, he did say he was mystified about the Ohio Chamber’s reasons for intervening in the matter.
“I don’t know where the chamber adopted its stance from, but it’s hard for me, as an independent business owner, to understand why major employers would want to increase their employees’ difficulty getting medications.”
Burke was incensed that the Ohio Chamber would call dispensing fees — payments to cover overhead — a tax.
“It’s amazing to me that the chamber should take the position that business owners should not make a profit,” he said. “I thought the Ohio Chamber was all about profit, pro-business and competitive markets. But they’ve adopted the position that this particular sector of business owners should not make any money. They consider the dispensing fee to be a tax. So apparently, any profit that any business makes is a tax. Maybe they’ve gone socialist over there. I don’t understand. Maybe they’re not looking at their own pharmacy benefit with any understanding.”
The Ohio Chamber didn’t immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment. But earlier this week, Senior Vice President Rick Carfagna said the goal was to protect Ohio businesses from paying too much to underwrite employees’ drugs.
There are, however, questions about the body’s relationship with the giant conglomerates that own the PBMs. For example CVS Health was a “presenting sponsor”  of the Chamber’s 2024 Healthcare Summit, 
Among the questions the Ohio Chamber didn’t immediately respond to was how much CVS paid to sponsor the event — or how much the chamber had received from the big-three conglomerates over the past five years.
In earlier responses, Carfagna didn’t address the growing number of pharmacy deserts in Ohio, or that struggling independent and small-chain pharmacies are themselves small businesses that the Ohio Chamber says it wants to protect.
Burke said all the Ohio Chamber’s members will be harmed if the conference committee language becomes law and mass closures result. That would mean sicker employees with difficulties getting medicine.
“I hope the Chamber actually goes and speaks with the people they’re supposed to represent and see if this policy position is reflective of the way they want to treat their employees,” Burke said.

And in a time when LGBTQ+ rights are again under assault, he is looking to the future — of the queer rights movement and also his own.
 A journey to the Supreme Court

Obergefell’s journey to the Supreme Court was hardly destined. It began 12 years ago, on June 26, 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that prohibited the government from recognizing same-sex marriages.
Obergefell and Arthur had been together for 21 years at the time. The two had discussed getting married before. But they wanted it to be legal, and their home state of Ohio didn’t offer same-sex marriages.
Arthur was gravely ill with ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and he barely left his home hospice bed.
After the ruling, Obergefell leaned over to Arthur, hugged, then kissed him.
“Let’s get married,” he said.
Arthur agreed.
The logistics were not easy. Arthur was in no shape to travel, and the couple could not wed in Ohio. Obergefell researched and found that Maryland would let him get a marriage license even with only one of them present. But both would need to arrive in the state for the ceremony.


When friends and family learned about their predicament, they pooled together money to charter a medical jet for Arthur. The two flew to Baltimore. Over the course of 45 minutes, they exchanged vows on the tarmac before flying home.
“In the days that followed, we said the word ‘husband’ hundreds of times a day,” Obergefell said on the Decidedly Podcast in 2023.
But just five days later, their joy was muted when civil rights attorney Al Gerhardstein informed them that because of Ohio’s ban on same-sex marriage, Arthur would be listed as single in death.
Arthur and Obergefell were angry. The couple sued the state of Ohio in federal district court and won. Three months later, Arthur died.
The following year, Obergefell, still in mourning, lost on appeal. But he refused to believe he might lose altogether.
“I just kept going,” Obergefell said. “It was the right thing to do.”
On June 26, 2015, he won. For the country, the win was immensely practical. Many told Obergefell it gave them so much hope it saved their lives. For Obergefell, it meant a legacy for the man he loved.
“I made promises to John to love, honor and protect him, and I was going to keep doing that,” he said.
 Changing history

It’s difficult to overstate the impact of Obergefell’s case on the nation or the world. Since the 2015 ruling, the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates, 591,000 queer couples have wed, generating an estimated $5.9 billion in wedding spending for state and local economies.
It has also radically transformed Obergefell’s life. Introverted and unassuming, he has spent the last decade campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights. He helms Equality Vines, a wine company that donates its proceeds to advancing civil rights causes.
It’s a position that makes him deeply proud if not a little fatigued.
“I’m not tired of talking about it,” he said of the 10-year anniversary of the ruling. “I’m just physically tired from all of the interviews and the photographers and the speaking gigs and the events. Yes, I’m exhausted.”
For 12 years, Obergefell has kept Arthur alive through retelling their story countless times in courtrooms and for the media. That exercise, of telling and retelling, helped Obergefell process his profound loss.
But he has never recoupled. It wasn’t that Arthur didn’t want him to. In fact, Arthur told him regularly that he wanted him to find love again. He asked his friends and family to tell Obergefell that he wanted him to find love after he was gone.
“I know it was sincere, because he told me that he had other people tell me that,” Obergefell said.
It isn’t about the pressure he feels as the face of marriage equality, he said, though part of him wonders what it would be like to date after making history.
“I don’t know how to date,” he confessed. “I’m clueless when people flirt with me, and as much as I hate it, and I don’t go into any conversation or anything like this, but you know, there’s that part of me that sometimes wonders, you know, are they interested in me as a person, or are they interested in me as Jim Obergefell, named plaintiff?”
Obergefell’s name has become synonymous with marriage equality in the United States, an issue that has not always united the LGBTQ+ community. Some queer activists have argued that same-sex marriage was a misguided goal for the movement as queer youth continue to face high rates of homelessness and transgender people grapple with police violence and incarceration, among other issues.
 More work to do

Obergefell, too, is worried that the needs of the community’s most vulnerable have gone unmet. He has watched horror-struck over the last five years as state legislatures have moved to restrict transgender rights.
“We need to fight for every marginalized community, because the queer community includes every marginalized community, and equality for one is pointless without equality for all,” he said. “I didn’t go to the Supreme Court just so White, cisgender, gay men like me could get married.”
Despite all of the setbacks in LGBTQ+ rights, and even threats to Obergefell’s game-changing victory, he is hopeful — and feels stronger than ever. People assume his case was difficult for him. It was, but the path was also obvious, to him and to Arthur. They loved each other.
“If we weren’t willing to fight for each other and for what was right, then what’s the point?”

The group of forty travelers evacuated Israel after missile attacks earlier this month. (Submitted)Lydia Schwartz and Alexa Litwin point to the same moment.
The moment when their cultural trip to Israel this month shifted. The moment that separated a lighthearted, tourist trip from an impromptu war-time evacuation. The moment that triggered days of shattered travel plans, hours in bomb shelters and frantic text messages.
Schwartz, 22, and Litwin, 21, recent college graduates and Jewish Kansans, traveled to their religious homeland as the conflict between Iran and Israel escalated into rocket attacks. 
The moment that changed their trip arrived June 14 at — of all places — a Tel Aviv nightclub.
Litwin was partying at an outdoor club with her brother Sam, who had been in Israel on a separate trip for a month. She was a bit late for the tour group’s appointed curfew when an alert rang out on nearby phones warning of a missile threat. The notification came from an app that participants were asked to download when they arrived in Israel.
“I didn’t even download the app,” Litwin said. “I was like, ‘Yeah, this is stupid. Nothing’s gonna happen. I’m not downloading this dumb app. I don’t have storage on my phone.’ ”
The notification came as Litwin was waiting outdoors for an Uber ride with her brother. Neither had a place to shelter. The best they could do was press themselves against a nearby wall for cover.
When Litwin’s Uber ride eventually delivered them to the group’s lodgings, the Grand Beach Hotel, she saw the trip’s tour guide.
“He was so frantic,” Litwin said. “He’s waving us inside. I’m thinking I’m in trouble because I broke curfew. That’s why he’s waving the way he’s waving. We’re all like, ‘We’re about to get in trouble.’ ”
Instead, he was directing them to the hotel’s shelter. Litwin and her brother ran toward the hotel entrance. Moments later, in the stairwell of the 12-story hotel, Litwin, a little tipsy and very scared, was reunited with Schwartz.
“It was the biggest juxtaposition of all time,” Litwin said. “Here I am partying in one of the coolest cities I’ve ever been in, and then here I am in a bomb shelter with hundreds of other Jews from all over the world.
“And that’s why it’s crazy living in Israel. It’s sad and it’s awful, but that’s what they do. And that’s not going to change any time soon.”
Litwin called her mother in tears, surrounded by other young Jews on the trip who were hugging and comforting each other. Litwin and Schwartz remember telling their parents, “I’m going to die tonight.”
“I’m in the stairwell,” Litwin recalled during an interview this week. “There are missiles being shot out from the sky. I was like, ‘Oh my god, I’m gonna die, and it’s gonna happen in 10 seconds. And everything’s gonna be over, and I’m gonna have no idea that I just died like that.’
“And I couldn’t get that out of my mind. I could literally be dead at any second and not even know it. I was spiraling about that.” 
After hours of waiting, they returned safely to their rooms at 6 a.m.
“Everyone was definitely pretty freaked out,” Litwin said. “Just because it also was not only our first time in Israel having that happen, but our first time in all of our lives having something like that happen. So everyone was definitely on edge a little bit.”
Almost everyone in the stairwell, including Schwartz and Litwin, was in Israel on a Birthright trip, an effort to bind worldwide Jews to Israel. The original 10-day itinerary navigated to holy and scenic spots, while allowing the young people to meet fellow Jews among their group of 40 travelers. The conflict with Iran derailed the itinerary.
However, Litwin and Schwartz said the experience of visiting Israel while it was under attack bound them even more closely to Israel.
Now back in Kansas, they say that even a flawless 10 days in Israel — perfect weather, timely travel connections, amazing new friends, parties every night — couldn’t have strengthened their bond to the nation as well as this chaotic trip filled with sleepless nights, rocket launches and arduous travel.
“Looking back on this trip now, I think I place my Jewish identity on a higher pedestal than I did before walking into this,” Litwin said. “Maybe it’s because I’m just coming out of it, or maybe it’s just everything that happened in Israel. But now my Judaism is in a more important place of who I am than before.”

A community of two
Litwin and Schwartz, best friends who grew up together in the suburbs south of Kansas City, often finish each other’s sentences.
“She’s my No. 1 person for everything,” Schwartz said. “Literally everything.”
Their friendship was knitted together with childhood Jewish cultural and religious activities: church lessons on Sundays and Wednesdays, summers at Jewish sleep-away camps and local meetings of Jewish teens.
“Judaism and the Jewish community has always been a huge part of my life,” Schwartz said.
They attended Blue Valley High School in Overland Park together. This month, both graduated college, Schwartz with an undergraduate degree in clinical psychology from Indiana University and Litwin with a political science degree from the University of Wisconsin. Schwartz will attend law school in the fall.
They signed up for the trip together. Schwartz remembers the uncertainty of visiting a nation that has been in tumult since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that triggered widespread violence in the region.
Schwartz was reassured by a phone call with a woman who worked for the Birthright tour company. She remembers being told: “Israel is always in war. Birthright continues to happen every single year. Everyone is always safe. And if there’s a threat, there’s gonna be a quick pivot, and most of the time we won’t even know.”
The trip began festively. A flight from New York City gave Litwin and Schwartz time to meet other young Jews, mostly from the East Coast.
“We’re talking to our neighbors,” Schwartz recalls. “Everyone’s always up, talking to random people. And everyone’s excited. There just is that feeling of connection, getting on that plane knowing that everyone here is Jewish, and everyone’s going into this with the same intentions that you are.”
Once they landed in Israel, the tour aimed to take them to Tiberius, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and the coastal town of Eilat. Even with the missile attacks, their tour group would eventually reach Eilat, but not on the sightseeing itinerary they had saved on their phones.
The first few days, spent mostly in Tiberius, were what they anticipated from the trip. There was only one surprise: a fellow traveler left the group urgently. His father hastily arranged a flight to Dubai to remove him from Israel, fearing the potential attacks that would soon come. At the time, Litwin and Schwartz thought the father and son were overreacting.
Following the night of missile attacks in Tel Aviv, their tour guide gathered them to let them know that the remainder of the trip had been canceled. The goal now was to get them safely home.
 
Everything upside down
The upcoming days were a disorienting blur.
Schwartz described a pleasant dinner at a Jerusalem hotel on June 14. While they had planned to go to a restaurant, they gathered in what they thought was the hotel’s dining room.
“The sirens go off. And everyone’s like, ‘Just stay here. This is actually a bomb shelter,’ ” Schwartz recalls. “So we just continued to have a lovely Shabbat dinner. And I look around. No one’s panicking. And that was so strange, because everyone was panicking” earlier that day.
That feeling of calm was pierced in Eilat the next day. The sounds of missile launches at 4 a.m. woke Litwin from her sleep. They also startled Schwartz, who couldn’t sleep and was making ramen noodles. Their assigned roommate, Mika, was most scared.
“I saw Mika go flying across the room,” Litwin said. “I’ve never seen someone jump the way she jumped across the room. And then I heard it. It sounded like a plane was right next to our ears, but faster than a plane — like a jet.
The town of Eilat was also the port city where they would eventually board a cruise ship that would take them to safety in Cypress.
However, before boarding the ship they again received a threat alert. At the time, Litwin and Schwartz were sitting and listening to music on one of the many buses holding 1,500 young people being evacuated from their Birthright trips. The alerts forced them off the buses. Organizers told them to lie face down on the ground for safety.
Schwartz remembers one girl saying: “Cross your legs and cover your major arteries!”
“Yeah. She was not helping the situation,” Litwin said.
It had been much easier to feel secure in shelters than under a threatening sky, Schwartz said.
“When you’re laying on the ground with 1,500 kids, you just have to pray,” Schwartz said. “Everyone was taking it very seriously. And I think that was where (I realized) in these circumstances, you just have to hope you’re lucky.”
Arriving in Cypress, Schwartz and Litwin knew they had avoided the threat of missile attacks, but they were still far from home.
“I remember talking to my mom on the phone,” Schwartz said. “And I was like, ‘I just can’t be here for another day.’ And she was like, ‘Honestly, I’m not worried. You’re safe. I’m so sorry you’re still there and know how exhausted you are. But you are not in Israel anymore. That’s the most important thing.’ ”
The travel home was a maze of canceled and delayed flights.
“I was exhausted,” Litwin said. “On one part, because of sleep deprivation. On one part, just because you feel very helpless. I felt helpless. I felt like no one was listening.”
Litwin’s flights would take her from Cypress to Cologne, Frankfurt, two airports in New York City, plus Chicago before arriving in Kansas City. Despite fewer flights, Schwartz would arrive in Kansas City about 30 minutes after Litwin.
“You’re constantly not knowing what’s gonna happen,” Litwin said. “You just have so much adrenaline. And then the second I was home, it just depleted. And then I was just exhausted.”
Just days after returning to Kansas, the two friends sat together, reflecting.
“The trip didn’t go the way that it was planned,” Litwin said. “In a way though, I’m thankful for it too. I think it really changed me. It fundamentally reshaped me as a human being. I view things differently now. I appreciate things in a different way.”
Schwartz added: “We were there for this event which put things into perspective. All the little problems that you have on a daily basis don’t matter as much. That directly relates to pride and community. The only thing you have at this moment is your Jewish identity and your connection to the Jews around you. That’s the most important thing that you’re thinking about — that everyone in Israel is thinking about in times like these.”

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal). During the lame duck session of 2022, the Ohio legislature passed HB 507, a bill ostensibly about the sale of baby chicks, but loaded up with last-minute oil and gas amendments — including one that required fracking of Ohio state parks and public lands. 
Since then, the Oil and Gas Land Management Commission has sold out our ne public land after another for fracking — including thousands of acres of Ohio’s iconic Salt Fork State Park. Frack well pads are now beginning to surround the park.
Fracking has begun at Valley Run Wildlife Area, and slated to begin soon at Zepernick, Egypt Valley, Keen, Leesville, and Jockey Hollow wildlife areas.  
Flat tax and budget cuts
Shortly after Gov. Mike DeWine signed HB 507, then-Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman told the Ohio Oil and Gas Association that fracking our public lands is a “great revenue generator” for tax cuts. 
“We’re talking about a flat tax right now, perhaps eliminating it,” Huffman said. “Well, where’s that revenue going to come from?”
Now we know the answer.  
This week, a Conference Committee comprised of leaders from the House and Senate finance committees met at 10:30 p.m. — with only 19 minutes notice — to amend and pass HB 96, Ohio’s two-year operating budget bill. It contains a bevy of favors for the oil and gas industry — including fracking our state parks to fund tax cuts for the rich. 
During the final days of testimony in the months-long budget bill process, the Ohio Senate amended HB 96 to include a flat tax — cutting taxes for Ohioans making over $100,000 per year from 3.5% to 2.75% — then cutting agency budget lines to make up the difference. 
Among items on the chopping block is Fund 730321, the Parks and Recreation budget for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. This is money used to staff and maintain our state parks and wildlife areas. The Senate budget cut this fund in half for 2026 — from $55 million to $27.5 million. 
Where did the Senate tell ODNR to make up the difference? From Fund 5BJ1 ALI 7256A6, the State Park Land Royalties Fund — or money that ODNR gets from fracking.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Fracking revenue becomes operating revenue
Until now, fracking royalties have been used only for special projects that improve state parks. Now the money will be used for half the parks’ operating expenses — making ODNR even more dependent on fracking for basic revenue, and making the Oil and Gas Land Management Commission even more likely to approve fracking operations. 
This is folly. The oil and gas industry is notoriously boom and bust. Fracking revenue is not guaranteed, and production at frack wells often drops steeply within a few years. 
In addition, wells can be shut down on short notice. Accidents happen — public records show that an oil and gas incident in Ohio every 1.5 days. In addition, ODNR recently shut down a frack pad in Noble County because of increased earthquakes caused by high-pressurized fracking.
Further, fracking puts at risk an industry near our parks that reliably produces income: tourism. Who wants to compete with thousands of brine trucks on rural roads to visit a park surrounded by the noise, light, and pollution of the fracking industry?
Finally ,contrary to statements by state Sen. Jerry Cirino, the people of Ohio who own and use our public lands do not want to see these lands fracked. Public comments on nominations to frack public land routinely run 98% opposed. 
Even more oil and gas favors
Making our parks dependent on fracking isn’t the only favor to the oil and gas industry in the hastily approved state budget. Other fossil fuel goodies include: 

Lengthening fracking leases on public lands for up to 10 years, instead of the current three years.
Requiring ODNR to fast-track fracking leases in 30 days, rushing a process that is supposed to include multiple provisions to protect our public lands.
Prohibiting state agencies from requiring any additional fees beyond those specified in the lease, which could prevent fines for pollution or cleanup after an accident.
Allowing fracked gas projects, now defined by our legislature as “green energy,” to receive air quality revenue bonds, despite their methane pollution.
Cutting the Oil and Gas Well Fund responsible for plugging orphan wells by eliminating filing fees. 

Next steps for the state budget
HB 96 now goes to Gov. DeWine, who has until June 30 to sign it. Unlike for most bills, the governor has line-item veto power for anything budget related. In past budget years, DeWine has not hesitated to use his veto power. 
Will DeWine, who professes publicly to love our state parks, veto the items that will degrade and destroy them? Or will he blithely stand behind the supermajority legislature that favors fossil fuels over renewable energy like wind, solar, and geothermal?
One thing is clear: The people of Ohio own and use our state parks, wildlife areas, and public lands – and we do not want them to be fracked just to provide tax cuts for the rich.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Dallen Michael Greene still remembers the fear he felt when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1999.
“My heart literally sank to my knees and to my ankles,” he said.
That fear is what led the 56-year-old resident of Broward County, Florida, to become a mentor and patient guide for the newly diagnosed. He’s a clinical manager at Community Care Resources of Florida, a nonprofit that offers testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Greene said friends and patients feel some of that same panic and alarm as they worry whether federal action will hinder their access to treatments.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 requests significant reductions to HIV prevention and surveillance programs while preserving other parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, the nation’s HIV care and treatment safety net.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is considering Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” the giant tax and spending plan the U.S. House approved last month. Several of its provisions would affect HIV care, including one that bars clinics that provide abortions — which tend to be testing sites for sexually transmitted infections — from accepting Medicaid.
The bill also would impose work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks on many Medicaid recipients, potentially interrupting coverage for HIV patients who take medications to suppress the virus, which prevents them from infecting others.
At the same time, some state health departments say they have yet to receive official notice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that their federal HIV/AIDS grants will be renewed. Renewals are for prevention and surveillance grants through May 2026. That’s left county health agencies and nonprofits scrambling for funds to continue HIV/AIDS outreach and testing programs. Some already have laid off staff, including critical disease contact tracers.
For HIV patients and their health care providers, it all adds up to troubling uncertainty.
“People are feeling like they’re going to be totally by themselves, and that there’s no resources that are going to be available for them,” Greene said.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services insisted that HIV/AIDS programs are a high priority for the administration, and will continue under a proposed new agency that would be called the Administration for a Healthy America.
 Living longer

People with HIV are living longer because of new drug treatments. But annually, the U.S. sees nearly 32,000 new HIV infections. State and public health agencies rely on contact tracing and public education to try to limit new infections. But they are hindered by persistent stigma surrounding HIV, lack of access to care, homophobia and the fact that a disproportionate number of people with HIV are poor.
Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can contract HIV, but Black and Latino men with male partners and Black women and transgender women have disproportionately high infection rates. New infections are more prevalent in the South.










The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you're cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through.


– Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares


“The operable term is ‘safety net.’ And you’re cutting holes in it. The more holes, the more stuff falls through,” said Rob Renzi, chief executive officer of Big Bend Cares, a Tallahassee-based nonprofit that provides HIV services to the surrounding eight-county area of North Florida’s sprawling rural communities.
Three dozen North Florida HIV patients rely on housing assistance from the nonprofit, which receives federal funds through Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS — one of the initiatives that Trump’s budget proposal would eliminate. Without the funds, those residents could become homeless, Renzi said. Another 17 people housed through a separate federal grant the organization uses for previously incarcerated HIV patients could also lose housing.
“Taking an HIV pill is down on your list if you have no food or place to sleep,” Renzi said.
 Uncertain grants

Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, said Wednesday the CDC began rolling out the delayed grants. But the uncertainty has already caused damage.

Raynard Washington, director of the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department in North Carolina, said his agency laid off six workers — including five contact tracers — after it did not receive a grant renewal notice. Contact tracers ensure a person knows about their positive diagnosis and try to identify the patient’s partners so they can get care and testing, too.
“The quicker we can close the loop with the contact tracing, can notify partners to get partners tested [and] in treatment, the quicker that we’re able to actually stop transmission from happening in the community,” Washington said. He added that “the more people that we have accessing prevention services like PrEP, the less opportunity we have for new infections.”
Even if the agency receives a renewal notice, rehiring the workers would be costly, he said.
Dr. Thomas Dobbs, dean of population health at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and former state public health officer, said his state’s HIV infection rates have remained steady over the past decade. He worries federal cuts and delays will stall progress — and disproportionately hurt marginalized communities.
“People in Mississippi don’t have riskier sexual behaviors than people in California,” he said. Rather, “the system has not been adequately designed and resourced and engaged to treat them.” Dobbs described the cuts as “pretty shortsighted.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation in Corpus Christi, Texas, serves a 12-county area that includes many rural communities, said Chief Executive Officer Bill Hoelscher. He said his group relies on federal funds issued through the state for HIV testing and risk reduction.
But a letter from the Texas Department of State Health Services, dated May 30, instructed the nonprofit to refrain from incurring costs starting May 31, as the state hadn’t received grant renewal notices from the CDC.
The renewal period for the next grant cycle begins July 1. Hoelscher applied but hasn’t yet heard back.
“Usually, we have a renewal in place and we’re ready to go by. But we have not heard from them [the CDC],” he said. “If we don’t hear from them … then July 1, effectively, there will be no more government-funded HIV testing by us.”
In a June 13 letter to the CDC, Texas state health officials asked for a status update on the grants. But as of Wednesday, the state hadn’t received a response, said spokesperson Lara Anton.
“We have been writing furiously for emergency funds through other grants, foundations, trying to see if we can get some help toshore it up until we figure out what to do,” Hoelscher said.
 Skipping pills

In Maryland, many patients participate in a state program that helps pay for HIV medications. The uncertainty about federal money is causing alarm among some patients.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

“We have already received calls like, ‘Hey, should I start skipping pills? Should I start doing every other day? Do I need to build a war chest of medications?’” said Peter DeMartino, director of infectious disease prevention and health services at the Maryland Department of Health.
The CDC reportedly reinstated several HIV prevention staff that had been part of mass federal layoffs. But DeMartino and health officials in other states say their departments are still missing their federal partners.
DeMartino said one CDC assignee whose position was eliminated had worked at his office for nearly two decades.
Back in Broward County, nonprofits and clinics are struggling to keep programs going as they await federal notices.
“Will there be enough funds?” Greene said. “We’re not sure how much money we’re going to receive or when it’s going to come. So that’s a very scary thing.”
