(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Oh, those pesky social studies standards.
Nebraska’s once vaunted but now diminished rivalry with Oklahoma has come to a shuddering halt. What was born on the gridiron years ago has now expired, as those charged with educating children in the Sooner State have proposed an educational standard with no pedagogical foundation nor semblance of the truth.
If adopted, the state’s high school students, in their study of the presidential election results from 2020, would be required to “identify discrepancies” in the process. Except there weren’t any. 
Sure, some insisted the integrity of the election of Joe Biden was tainted. But no tangible, verifiable evidence was found nor exists today to prove that the election had “discrepancies.” Nor does wishing, hoping, believing or offering debunked conjecture to the contrary make it so. Or worse, make it part of the public school curriculum.
Nebraska wins
If the standard is accepted, Oklahoma students will be learning a lie. Game over. Huskers win.
That’s because to my knowledge, Nebraska’s social study standards entertain no such nonsense. Nevertheless, as we’ve seen before on other fronts, culture war creep is a thing, a reality that can show up anywhere, including Nebraska’s classrooms. See book banning for details.
The standard’s news was among a spate of happenings from the silly to the serious during the last week connected to social studies, history, economics, whatever social science is to your liking. Oklahoma’s potential capitulation, which raises conspiracy theories to the level of actual American history, was only part of the story.
A bill introduced in Congress would codify President Trump’s notion that the Gulf of Mexico hitherto be known as the Gulf of America. His executive order did as much early in his second term, but EOs do not carry the weight or the permanence of an actual law. As you know, laws are what Congress passes, although you’d be hard pressed to find an example of that with the current confab now meeting in the Capitol.
‘Gulf of America’
Enter H.R. 276, which would change the name of the Gulf of Mexico permanently and compel all federal agencies to update their maps and documents to reflect such an alteration. I imagine that would also require a rewrite of state social studies or geography standards. The bill’s sponsor is U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.
Oy, vey! Where to begin? Let’s start (and stop) with this: Why? Yeah, I can’t think of anything either. 
Nebraska U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., thought the entire episode was rather childish: “It just seems juvenile. We’re the United States of America. We’re not Kaiser Wilhelm’s Germany or Napoleon’s France. … We’re better than this. It just sounds like a sophomore thing to do.” Bacon’s nay in the name-change vote was a welcome development despite the measure passing the House. Perhaps Republican U.S. Reps. Mike Flood and Adrian Smith have an answer to why.
A better idea would have been to let the silliness languish, never to be heard from again. The House — and the rest of us — face more pressing matters, not the least of which is the looming crisis over whether or not we are a democratic republic that honors the principle of due process. Enshrined in two Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, due process is the bedrock on which a nation of laws is built.
Due process
Here’s a quick review of those details, all of which should be the social studies standard for anyone who calls America home: The Fifth Amendment says no one shall be “deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.” The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, uses the same eleven words, called the Due Process Clause, to describe a legal obligation of the states. Due process gives us legal procedures (processes), so the government cannot infringe on our individual rights.
More to the point in the current discussion is this: Due process applies to anyone — citizen or not — being adjudicated in the U.S., too, its language using “person” rather than citizen. 
Nevertheless, both the president and his Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sidestepped the due process question recently. That is, do they believe in it? Trump told NBC’s Kristin Welker he “didn’t know” because he isn’t an attorney. Noem simply would not answer the question during a congressional hearing. 
The nation’s history, like high school social studies, is replete with stories that essentially reveal who we are as a country, what we value — principles such as due process. They are the nation’s standards.
But when they get their corners knocked off, when we fail to live up to them, we no longer resemble ourselves. That’s a standard too far.

John McCosh/Georgia Recorder (file)A federal appellate court is set to hear a case Tuesday centered on a five-year debate over whether the national right-leaning group True the Vote used mass voter challenges to intimidate minority voters.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit will hear arguments in a case in which plaintiffs, including a voting rights group founded by Stacey Abrams, contend that the case has national implications. Attorneys from both sides will have 15 minutes to present their cases during Tuesday’s hearing.
Mass voter challenges have been a mainstay in Georgia since the 2020 presidential election, when Democrat Joe Biden narrowly defeated Republican Donald Trump by about 12,000 votes in the state.
According to the Abrams-founded Fair Fight Action and others who filed suit, True the Vote’s actions likely violated the Voting Rights Act by using inaccurate voter registration information and voter intimidation tactics such as posting citizen watchdogs to monitor people casting ballots.
This case stems from True the Vote’s efforts to challenge the voter eligibility of about 385,000 Georgia voters prior to the January 5, 2021 runoff election, when Democrats would take control of the U.S. Senate following historic wins by Georgia Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.
In January 2024, Gainesville U.S. District Court Judge Steve C. Jones concluded last year that Fair Fight did not prove True the Vote’s actions constituted voter intimidation prior to the dual Senate runoffs.
However, Jones criticized the conservative group’s “reckless” methods in compiling a list of voters.
Opponents of mass challenges claim that groups targeting Democratic-leaning counties are misusing the election law to challenge large numbers of voters as ineligible.

Many conservatives have argued that voter registration lists need to be purged of ineligible voters, while Democrats and progressive activists have alleged that mass voter challenges aim to intimidate and remove voters who should remain eligible.
Fair Fight alleges that True the Vote’s list in the 2021 runoff included a disproportionate number of Black, brown, and first-time voters who helped secure the 2020 presidential race for Biden. 
“The 385,000 mass challenge in the lead up to the January 5, 2021 runoff was the largest mass challenge ever filed in this way in the country,” Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo said. 
There’s been a debate over whether some new voting rules would improve voter confidence or if they are just attempts to appease Trump supporters who say he lost because of unfounded claims of widespread election fraud.
Georgia was at the center of the push to overturn the election results after Trump lost to Biden, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to lose in Georgia in three decades. Trump’s narrow loss was reaffirmed through three counts, including one recount that was done by hand. Multiple recounts and audits after the 2020 election confirmed it was not tainted by widespread fraud.

According to state law, county election boards must find sufficient probable cause to move forward with an investigation when a voter does not appear to reside at their registered address, lists a non-residential address on their registration, or has other reasons that could disqualify them.
True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht said her group will argue that their tactics promote fair elections when they return to Georgia court Tuesday.
“This isn’t just about one hearing — it’s about holding the line for election integrity and defending the voice of we the people,” she said in a statement. “Our legal team is locked in, sharpening every detail of our strategy. Our fight is to expose truth, uphold principle, and bring transparency to a process.”
Marc Elias, an attorney with Elias Law Firm and founder of left-leaning Democracy Docket, argues that the mass voter challenges in the True the Vote case are an egregious violation of Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which guarantees that voters will not face intimidation during the voting process.
“Now, courts have been chipping away against lots of the federal voting rights protections. I’m not going to sugarcoat that,” Elias said. “That has been true at the U.S. Supreme Court. It’s been true at the lower levels. But the fact is attempts to intimidate voters is still illegal, and 11 B is still goo valid law throughout the country.”

John Kennedy, who chaired the Senate Redistricting Committee, argued during a 2021 special session that the GOP-drawn maps are fair to all Georgians. In 2023, state lawmakers were directed by a federal judge to draw new maps. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWe’ve passed the halfway point between the 2020 U.S. Census and the 2030 U.S. Census, but the battle over redistricting maps based on the last national headcount is still underway in Georgia. On Thursday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments about whether or not to enact new maps. The dispute stems from a claim that the state Legislature drew up maps that violate the Voting Rights Act and dilute the votes of Black Georgians.
In late 2023, the district court struck down those Congressional and legislative maps, and lawmakers returned to the Capitol for another stab at them.
Marina Jenkins, executive director of the National Redistricting Foundation and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said Georgia’s population growth in the 2020 Census came from minority populations, especially Black Georgians, but she said the General Assembly’s maps didn’t reflect that and that lawmakers engaged in dirty tricks by eliminating majority-minority districts to draw new ones.
“The state of Georgia robbed Peter in order to pay Paul by enacting these maps,” she said. “These maps eliminated existing opportunity districts in order to draw so-called new opportunity districts, zeroing out black opportunity statewide. Black Georgia voters who were previously denied their right to equal representation continue to be denied that right, and others had that right revoked altogether on these new maps.”
Much of the debate over the maps came down to the state’s 7th Congressional District, previously represented by Democratic Congresswoman Lucy McBath, which was redrawn to favor a Republican. Republican Rich McCormick now represents the 7th District, while McBath was elected to the 6th District after defeating fellow incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux.
The old 7th’s population was not majority Black – the plurality of the population was white, but a combination of minority groups made up the majority. Of the district’s voting age population 27% were Black, 21% Hispanic, 15% Asian and about 33% white.
In a court document filed last year, attorneys for Georgia argued that the state was obligated to protect majority Black districts, not districts where a coalition of minorities make up the majority, and that efforts to overturn the maps are political sour grapes.
“Their argument proves only one thing: Plaintiffs are upset that the General Assembly eliminated a safe congressional district for Democrats when it created the required new majority-Black district. But the Voting Rights Act ‘is a balm for racial minorities, not political ones.’ It cannot be hijacked to settle partisan disputes that are fairly decided at the polls,” the state’s attorneys wrote.

Google the word “CT biotech” and the number of recent news articles about successful Connecticut startups, biotechs and biopharmaceutical companies is astounding. Just recently, Merck announced it would acquire Stamford-based SpringWorks Therapeutics for $3.9 billion.
The success of the CT bioscience industry has benefited patients with lifesaving treatments and cures, but it has also bolstered Connecticut’s fiscal outlook immensely.   Connecticut biotech has contributed to property tax rolls, created thousands of high paying jobs for Connecticut residents and has drawn talent from across the world to our state.
Gov. Ned Lamont recognized the value bioscience companies bring to the state earlier this legislative session by proposing an increase to the Research and Development tax credit in his budget. Since R&D so defines the biopharma industry —it takes $2.7 billion of R&D to bring a new medicine to pharmacy shelves— enhancing this tax credit makes great economic development sense.
Unfortunately, the governor has also introduced HB 6870, An Act Addressing Patients’ Prescription Drug Costs which, amongst other things, would implement price controls in the form of tying medicine prices to the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
It’s important to underscore that the essential goal of HB 6870 -–to lower patients’ healthcare costs— is laudable and something the Bioscience Growth Council and its members share.
In order to achieve that goal, however, we must recognize that drugs represent only a small part of the healthcare cost equation. Medicines account for only about 15% of what we in the U.S. spend on healthcare. That share of the healthcare dollar has been remarkably stable for 75 years.
To bring meaningful change and cost savings to healthcare it is critical to examine the other 85% of the equation —surgeries and hospital stays, MRIs and CT-scans, doctor’s visits, home healthcare assistance, insurance plan design, to name only a few.
It is also worth noting that this legislation is not occurring in a vacuum. The ongoing threat of tariffs at the federal level has already contributed to significant instability and concern for the bioscience industry (and many others).
The governor’s healthcare bill would limit price increases drug manufacturers can charge for generic and off-patent drugs to the CPI.
Nominally keeping generic and off-patent drug price increases in line with inflation as measured by the CPI may seem reasonable, but it ignores the fact that the CPI is an average of a broad spectrum of products. The CPI does not reflect the rate of inflation for any one specific product category. The overall January CPI, for example, was three percent, but for eggs it was 15.2%.
The components of the drug supply chain, including the supply chain for generic and off-patent drugs, are many and variable.  They are sourced from around the world. This is especially the case for the complex manufacturing applicable to injectable and infused biologics.
The price increases suppliers in the generic and off-patent drug supply chain charge for ingredients can often exceed the CPI.  Since many parts of and ingredients used in drug manufacturing are sourced from overseas, currency fluctuations can have a dramatic effect on prices significantly in excess of the CPI. At a time when actions in Washington have already significantly affected the supply chain, it is critical that Connecticut leaders take a pause before further upending the supply chain for Connecticut companies. Not only is this a financially smart decision it also helps to reduce the risk that Connecticut (and all) patients will no longer be able to access their medications should further supply disruptions occur.
It’s also important to recognize that tethering medicine prices to a rigid formula like the CPI is a form of price control and price controls never work. No matter the product—flour, machinery, medicines— price controls cause shortages, delay the introduction of new products and manufacturing capacity, give rise to black markets and incentivize high introduction prices.
A rigorous study —academic or otherwise— demonstrating the effectiveness of price controls does not exist.
Price controls didn’t work when Richard Nixon tried them, didn’t work in Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, and aren’t working in Venezuela or Zimbabwe.
When tried, all price controls have done is ratchet up the misery of empty store shelves and metastasizing inflation.  Applied to medicines, they would translate into shortages and slow, or non-existent, introduction of new, cutting-edge cures and therapies.
If the cost of ingredients for a medicine spike beyond the CPI and manufacturers can’t cover their costs, we certainly would not want government policy to be the cause of manufacturers leaving the market and consumers facing empty pharmacy shelves.

Others were advocating for those whose voices are often silenced, pushing back against an administration determined to strip us of our own. Some were even pushing individuals in wheeled chariots, those unable to run the race themselves, so they, too, could cross the finish line.

Grace Williams
As I watched, I began to cry. It started with a single tear escaping down my cheek, and before I knew it, I was sobbing. That’s when I realized – I was starved for kindness; for compassion; for the simple, profound reminder that humanity is still capable of showing up for one another.
Lately, it feels like I lose a little more faith each day in the values we were taught as children. The headlines are relentless: thousands losing their jobs overnight; mothers praised only if they bear six children, a cruel hallmark of this new “baby-booming” administration; a father torn from his family and deported to El Salvador, despite having every legal right to remain.
My parents raised me to believe in sharing, caring, loving, forgiveness, and respecting others. I still try to live by those principles. But more and more, I find myself asking, where has the compassion gone?
As a graduate student at Yale, I’m part of a group that puts these principles into action, our “Compassionate Dialogue Group.” It’s a space shared by students and faculty who come together, not to debate or to solve, but simply to be present. We gather to listen, deeply and respectfully. We talk about our worries, our joys, our lives. There’s no agenda. Just the quiet, powerful understanding that whatever is shared will be met with kindness. That here in this group, we are safe. Here, we are seen. Here, we are nourished by compassion and respect.
It sounds simple. But lately, practicing compassionate dialogue outside of that space has become harder than ever. People don’t want to listen, especially if your perspective challenges theirs. Sometimes they don’t want to listen at all. And yet, over the past year, I’ve found deep relief in the silence of our sessions, sitting quietly, listening to the stories of those around me, and being reminded that the values I was raised with still live in others. That they’re not just relics from childhood, but guiding truths that can still shape the world around us.
So, the question becomes: how do we spread this? How do we rebuild a culture of compassion, respect, and real listening, in our relationships, in our communities, in ourselves?
While I don’t have all the answers, I do have a few challenges for you.
I challenge you to talk to a stranger, not a deep conversation, just a compliment, a kind word. You never know how much it might mean. I challenge you to sit back during your next conversation and truly listen. Don’t speak unless your words add something meaningful. Silence holds incredible power. And finally, I challenge you to end each day reflecting on where you encountered compassion, whether it was something you received or something you gave.
Growing up, my dad and I would recite a list of words each morning before school. Those words still hang on a sign in my family’s living room:
Sharing. Caring. Loving.
Focus. Concentrate. Participate.
Give compliments. Leadership. Forgiveness. Respect.
These were more than just words, they were a blueprint for how to live and how to treat others. And I believe that if we truly practiced them, if we made space for each other with compassion and courage, so much of what feels broken could begin to heal.

(Photo by Yehyun Kim/ctmirror.org)The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed to push a May 19 strike deadline at 51 Connecticut nursing homes back until May 27, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday.
A spokesman for SEIU 1199NE confirmed the delay, which the Lamont administration sought.
“Earlier this week, I met with union leadership representing Connecticut’s nursing home and group home workers and expressed to them that I agree that their current wages do not match the value of the service they provide and that I join them in their effort to seek an increase in their compensation,” Lamont said. “Additionally, I informed them that I believe there is a consensus among legislative leaders who also feel the same and that we are working to negotiate a state budget that includes support for this workforce.”
The governor added that “Connecticut’s nursing home and group home workers do strenuous work on behalf of our most vulnerable residents, and my administration is committed to reaching a positive resolution on their behalf as soon as possible.”
Union president Rob Baril said Friday that “we had a couple of conversations with the governor’s office, and we were extremely clear” about wage and benefit concerns.
The union wants to boost starting pay for caregivers to $25 per hour and, over several years, elevate most employees to about $30 per hour. Most nursing home workers in the state currently earn between $18 and $22 per hour, a wage that leaves many members in poverty.
Though wage and benefit negotiations technically are between private sector nursing homes and their staff, the state often plays a role in resolving labor-management disputes in this industry.
That’s because, on average, more than 80% of nursing home revenue involves patients whose care is covered by federal and state Medicaid dollars.
Baril added the Lamont administration indicated it’s working hard to identify the resources necessary to bolster wages and benefits. “We are going to take them at their word,” Baril said.
Providing the type of raises the union seeks would require a major new public investment in nursing homes.
SEIU 1199NE estimates it would require an extra $550 million in Medicaid payments over the next two fiscal years combined, an annual average of $275 million, to fund the improved wages and benefits workers are seeking.
About 50% of Connecticut’s Medicaid expenses in most program areas are covered through federal reimbursement, which would make the effective annual cost to the state about $137.5 million.
Meanwhile, Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority are already struggling to develop a new state budget that complies with the constitutional cap that keeps most spending growth in line with household income and inflation. They hope to adopt a new two-year state budget before the regular 2025 session ends on June 4.
Earlier this month, the union set a May 19 strike deadline. The potential work stoppage would affect roughly 5,700 nursing home workers.
But this year’s state budget negotiations are far most complex than usual, given the uncertain future of Medicaid, a federal health care entitlement program run in cooperation with states.
Congress set a goal of achieving cuts to Medicaid and other programs worth $880 billion over the next decade. Lamont’s administration has modeled potential cuts, based on various proposals on Capitol Hill that could cost Connecticut anywhere from $186 million to $880 million per year.
Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, the state’s largest nursing home coalition, thanked state and union officials for their continuing efforts to avoid a strike.
“Separating nursing home residents from their caregivers causes real harm and trauma,” Barrett said. “Workforce development, including wage and benefit enhancements as an employee retention and recruitment policy for both union and non-union employees, is essential to addressing the care needs of Connecticut’s dramatically aging population.”

Baraka’s release capped off a wild day in Newark that started with him and three members of Congress — Democratic Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver, and Rob Menendez — appearing in Newark to visit Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed immigration detention center that Baraka has tried to prevent from opening, saying the jail’s owner has not obtained necessary city permits.
Baraka said he was with fire officials Friday attempting to gain entrance to the facility, and videos show he was warned by federal agents that he would be placed under arrest.
After immigration agents arrested Baraka, acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba claimed the mayor was trespassing. McIver and Menendez said Baraka was invited onto the jail’s property before he was arrested.
A scuffle broke out after protestors locked arms to protect Baraka, with Watson Coleman and McIver being pushed by immigration agents, videos show. Menendez was also seen yelling at officers not to arrest the mayor.
Baraka was walked away by masked agents and plainclothes officers.

The Department of Homeland Security characterized the incident as a “bizarre political stunt.” It claims the House members were “holed up in a guard shack” with protestors while a bus of detainees entered the security gate. It also denied claims that Delaney Hall does not have the proper permitting — allegations at the center of a lawsuit Newark filed against the jail’s owner, Geo Group — and said inspections and fire codes have been cleared.
Once protestors and officials found out Baraka was being held at an ICE facility on Frelinghuysen Avenue about 10 minutes away from Delaney Hall, the protest moved there — and grew. Hundreds of supporters and immigration activists stood in the pouring rain, relentlessly chanting for hours for federal officials to free the mayor.
State senators, county commissioners, local council members, and politicos from nearby New York also joined the protest. Meanwhile, statements of support poured in from other Democrats who are also running for governor, while Republicans used it as an opportunity to attack Baraka. Baraka’s campaign also sent out a fundraising text while he was detained.
During the protest, ICE agents peered through windows of the brick building where Baraka was being held, and a group of six agents stood in the parking lot, keeping watch on the crowd.
Watson Coleman told reporters that she had been “manhandled” during Baraka’s arrest. And Menendez called it an “act of intimidation” to keep the public from speaking about the Trump administration’s increasing immigration enforcement.
“The fact that they pushed, physically assaulted two female members of Congress, ask yourself if this is the beginning or if they’re going to change course,” Menendez said. “I have no faith that they’re going to change course, but we will continue to speak out against it.”
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said on social media that while he was happy to see Baraka released, “the bottom line is he never should have been detained in the first place.”
While walking with police officers down Frelinghuysen Avenue after his release, Baraka was asked what his next steps would be.
“See my children,” he said.

(Photo by Erick Doxey/InvestigateWest)An unexpected slash to a small corner of Washington’s state budget has civil legal aid organizations scrambling to plan for a future without financial support.
Both the House and Senate biannual budgets put forth by state lawmakers this year included around $5 million to support the legal aid organizations that are critical in helping to vacate unconstitutional drug convictions across the state. But after the two budgets were reconciled in the final days of the legislative session, the funding had disappeared. State lawmakers put forth a balanced $77.8 billion budget on April 27 after months of debate and amid an anticipated $16 billion budget shortfall. The final budget is now awaiting Gov. Bob Ferguson’s approval.
“It’s a gut punch,” said Camerina Zorrozua, the legal director and co-founder of The Way to Justice, a nonprofit legal aid organization based in Spokane that has relied on the funding since 2021. “The rug was just pulled out from under us.”
Since 2022, three Washington legal aid and advocacy organizations — Civil Survival, Living with Conviction, and The Way to Justice — have relied on state funding from the Office of Civil Legal Aid to help people vacate convictions on their criminal records that became constitutionally void after a 2021 Washington Supreme Court ruling known as State v. Blake.
The Supreme Court found the state’s simple drug possession law to be unconstitutional because it lacked language related to intent, the cornerstone of the U.S. legal system. The historic decision not only made Washington’s law void but also made hundreds of thousands of past misdemeanor and felony convictions dating as far back as 1971 eligible to be wiped from a person’s criminal record, and for any financial costs incurred eligible to be refunded by the state. ​​A new law criminalizing drug possession, coined the “Blake-fix,” went into effect in July 2023.
But the process to vacate the cases is not automatic and has to occur in the court where the conviction was made. While some courts have been proactive in identifying and vacating eligible cases, others have left it up to the impacted individuals to navigate the convoluted system and initiate the process independently. That’s where legal aid and reentry organizations have worked to fill in the gaps.
“These are unconstitutional convictions, and the state has an obligation to make people whole for unconstitutional convictions,” said Corey Guilmette, the co-executive director at Civil Survival. “Cutting the funding for the organizations that are doing that work is unacceptable.”
The cuts caught the Office of Civil Legal Aid — the state agency that has historically received the funding — by surprise.
“The first we heard of it was when the budget came out,” said Philippe Knab, the office’s reentry/eviction defense program director. “There was no warning, no opportunity to advocate for the work that the contractors are doing.”
While the $5 million that was cut from the Office of Civil Legal Aid’s budget is minuscule compared to the state’s overall budget, the impact of those cuts will be monumental to the legal aid organizations that run on shoestring budgets, Guilmette said.
“We’ll be reduced by just under $1.1 million of annual funding,” he added. “For an organization with a $2.7 million budget, that’s close to 40% of our funding that just got wiped out.”
It will be challenging to provide effective representation for their current clients given the cuts, Guilmette said.
“I don’t have money to pay our staff after July 1, and that’s what we are scrambling to do,” he said.
A long way to go
The cuts to State v. Blake funding come as there’s still a long way to go to vacate the eligible cases throughout the state. As of January 2025, the Washington State Patrol reported that about 18% — or 114,567 — of the estimated 600,000 eligible cases identified by the Administrative Office of the Courts had been vacated statewide. The vacate process can be complicated, time-consuming and varies widely from court to court.
Guilmette said that in March, his organization began representing nearly 150 new Blake-related cases, which still barely scratches the surface. The last time his organization opened its public-facing intake form on its website, it received two years’ worth of cases in only two months.
His team specifically focuses on helping clients obtain reimbursements for costs related to their illegal conviction, including attorney fees, drug treatment costs and other court fees.
He said that while the state is working to administratively vacate cases en masse through a recently established process by the Administrative Office of the Courts, that process doesn’t address people’s refunds. There is another state process for that called the Blake Refund Bureau, but for jurisdictions that aren’t taking a proactive approach to first vacate their cases — which is the first step in the process — legal aid organizations are necessary to help fill in the gaps.
“I understand it’s a difficult budget year, but this problem is not going away,” Guilmette said. “The state has to, one way or another, vacate these convictions.”
“So we can’t just kick the can down the road,” he added. “This is expertise that will vanish, and it will make it harder. It will cost more in the long run to be able to do this work.”
Ultimately, he fears that undocumented people who have unconstitutional convictions on their criminal record will be impacted the most since the conviction could be grounds for deportation.
“I think that’s tragic, and I think as a state, I don’t think you can say that you’re really protecting immigrant communities if you are knowingly cutting these resources,” he added.
Katrin Johnson, the deputy director for operations at the Washington Office of Public Defense, said her office, which helps lead State v. Blake efforts statewide and receives funding from lawmakers to do so, didn’t budget for having to support the three organizations previously funded by the Office of Civil Legal Aid. But she said their role is critical.
“We’re going to have to regroup and see what we can do, but we certainly aren’t going to have the flexibility to fund them at the same level they were funded before,” Johnson said. “We don’t even know that we can fund them.”
But she hopes the organizations can find funding given the unique role they play. “They are closer to the communities than we are,” Johnson said. “We’re a state agency.”
“Losing them in the Blake efforts is going to be a huge setback,” she added.
‘That feeling of justice’
When David Anderson got three of his four cases vacated under State v. Blake in 2024, he said he finally felt free. Since getting out of prison in 2001, he had been diligently paying $20 every month toward his court fines and fees.
“We leave incarceration, then you have these financial straps on you,” said 72-year-old Anderson. “And it’s these financial straps that keep people coming in and out of the system.”
In 2024, his court bill stopped coming. He panicked, thinking he would be arrested for nonpayment. When he went to talk to the county court in Spokane, he learned he was eligible to get his cases removed under State v. Blake — and potentially get his money refunded.
He was told that the court was inundated with cases and that it might take a while before his case could be looked at, so he was referred to the nonprofit The Way to Justice.
The legal aid organization helped him complete the necessary paperwork to get three of his four eligible cases vacated and removed from his criminal record. Then three months later, he received a refund check from the state of Washington in the mail, and the rest of his debt was swiftly eliminated.
He now keeps a framed copy of the vacate order and check hanging in his living room, surrounded by his artwork and photographs of his seven children and 14 grandchildren. As a thank you for their work, he donated $100 to The Way to Justice. Any chance he gets, he tells his friends and neighbors about State vs. Blake, even passing out flyers in the neighborhood to people who might be eligible for relief.
“I thought I’d have that chain on my neck for the rest of my life,” Anderson said. “If that clerk hadn’t passed me that pamphlet, I would have never known anything about the Blake program.”
Zorrozua, with The Way to Justice, said she’s determined to keep doing Blake work despite the funding cuts. She co-founded the organization in 2020 and was initially fiscally sponsored by the Martin Luther King Center in Spokane. “We had free office space in their old day care center that was originally a firehouse up on the South Hill, but we eventually got our own 501(c)(3) status,” Zorrozua said.

“It was the Blake case that gave us the ability and the funding and the resources to be able to take our work statewide,” she added. “That’s another reason why it hurts, because Blake was the door that opened legal aid to The Way to Justice, and helped us to grow to what we are today.”
She said it “stings” that Gov. Ferguson’s $100 million budget request to create a grant program to hire more local law enforcement was approved by state lawmakers, while the $5 million in funding to provide Blake support was cut.
“They’re building up this apparatus to criminalize folks and to put them through the (criminal justice) system, but at the same time removing the resources that we need on the back end of the system to help make people whole again,” she added.
Zorrozua said that getting to work with people like Anderson is what keeps her going.
“You can tell just by talking to someone like David what a weight is lifted and just that feeling of justice,” she said. “You can’t really describe it, but you know it when you see it.”
“He’s a perfect example of someone who historically was caught up in the war on drugs,” she said. “People were dismissed and stereotyped and forgotten. And the Blake case brought us back to reality. We have the opportunity to make it right and to humanize the people who are impacted.”

Advocates are calling on Michigan legislators to invest more state dollars into targeted funding for students living in poverty as the Trump administration’s efforts to slash federal education funding could have “devastating” impacts on the most vulnerable students.
An analysis released Thursday by the research and advocacy group Education Trust-Midwest found that Michigan still ranks among the lowest in the nation when it comes to equitably funding schools, despite new investments.
The need for more equitable school funding after years of underinvestment in the state is heightened now by threats to federal dollars and students continuing to fall further behind on academic assessments, according to advocates.
“I’ve never used the word catastrophic in my career, but this is the word that comes to mind right now in terms of the situation that I think high-poverty districts are facing,” said Amber Arellano, executive director of EdTrust-Midwest.
According to the group’s report, Michigan ranked 44th in the nation for fourth grade reading and 31st for eighth grade math on an assessment known as the “nation’s report card” in 2024.
Jen DeNeal, director of policy and research for EdTrust-Midwest, said Michigan did not have a solid foundation in teaching early literacy before COVID. After the pandemic, that foundation “crumbled,” she said.
The state’s average reading scores dropped nearly 10 points between 2003 and 2024, said DeNeal, and the bulk of the drop happened during pandemic years.
The Education Recovery Scorecard, which compares data on the national assessment to those administered in 2019 before the pandemic, placed Michigan in the bottom five of states for academic recovery.
The scorecard found Michigan third through eighth graders are on average about two-fifths of a grade level behind in math and three-quarters of a grade level behind in reading compared to student scores in the state before COVID.
The EdTrust-Midwest’s analysis found the trend held true in rural, suburban, and urban areas across the state.
“Some of the largest gaps are in suburbs and towns and rural areas where we see these big proficiency discrepancies pre-and post-pandemic,” said DeNeal.
Data from the state’s 2024 assessments, known as the M-STEP, show students from low-income families, Black and Latino students, multilingual learners, and students with disabilities fell at least 10 percentage points below state averages in third grade reading and seventh grade math.
 Michigan leaders worry about the impact of federal cuts

The prospect of federal funding rollbacks could be “devastating” to Michigan students who are still struggling to catch up, said Arellano, noting that research shows more funding for programs that assist students with higher needs can lead to better academic outcomes.
Last week, President Donald Trump proposed cutting nearly $6 billion in federal K-12 spending and consolidating 18 grant programs into a one funding stream states could spend without restrictions.
“One very clear message that we are getting from this proposed Trump budget is that public education for all students is not a priority,” said Arellano.
The proposal for the 2025-26 school year would eliminate programs for English language learners and children of migrant farm workers.
Michigan has long lagged behind other states when it comes to funding education initiatives for English language learners, though it has made some increases in recent years.
Trump’s budget would also cut money for the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which enforces anti-discrimination laws in schools, by more than a third.
Cuts that have already been made to the Office for Civil Rights have begun impacting Michigan students with disabilities, with many reporting their open cases have not moved since the Trump administration began its second term.
Title I funding, which is allocated to schools that serve students from low-income families, and dollars distributed under the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act are not slated to be cut under Trump’s plan.
Arellano said other federal proposed cuts could have negative impacts on Michigan students, such as a congressional Republican plan that would make it more difficult for schools to provide universal free school meals. According to the Michigan Department of Education, that plan could mean thousands of students in the state could lose free school meals.
 Advocates call for increased state funding

Just to stay stable with current funding levels for districts, the state will have to step in to cover shortfalls caused by potential federal cuts – particularly for students living in poverty, English language learners, and children with disabilities, Arellano said.
“The truth is that we’re already underfunding these groups of students,” she said.
Michigan first adopted a weighted funding system for students considered to be “at-risk” in 2023. The system, known as the “opportunity index,” assigns districts to one of six bands based on the percentage of students living in poverty. Each band determines how much additional funding a district will receive. Before that, Michigan allocated the same amount of per-pupil dollars to all students classified as at-risk.
For the 2024-25 school year, Michigan invested about $1 billion into the opportunity index.
The change came after years of advocates calling for a new system in response to the state being ranked among the worst states in the nation for its gaps in funding between districts in impoverished and wealthy communities.
The Michigan Department of Education determines whether students are at risk with a set of criteria that includes factors such as being from an economically disadvantaged family, learning English as a second language, being chronically absent from school, or experiencing homelessness.
EdTrust-Midwest’s new analysis found Michigan in the bottom 10 of states for weighted funding, despite historic investments in the opportunity index.
The group’s report calls for the state to invest an additional $2 billion in the opportunity index over the next five years to reverse the impact of years of underfunding.
The report also recommends more guardrails in place to ensure the weighted dollars are being spent on the students they are intended for.
Michigan is still early into its budget process for the next school year. In her February budget proposal, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer proposed increasing funding for at-risk students by more than 4%.
Last month, the Democratically-controlled state Senate approved a plan that would increase at-risk funds by 25%.
The Republican-controlled state House passed a bare-bones education budget proposal in March that only included dollars for special education, mental health, and school safety programs, an increase to the per-pupil foundation allowance, and allocations to the Michigan Public School Employee Retirement System.
Republicans said the proposal was passed to fund essential government functions in case negotiations with Democrats stall the process this summer.
“This is not the time for cutting funds for kids,” said Arellano. “Kids in our state are behind other states. This is the time when we need our leaders to lean in and support educators and students in our schools.”

Trust and respect for people's data isn't just ethical — it's crucial to the long-term success and sustainability of any business.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont small business owners: Vermont businesses must stand on the right side of history.","This letter is by five small business owners: Taryn Adamczyk of Sunnyside Coffee Company; Travis Noyes of Chapman’s General; Abby Copeland of Wrights Mountain Wellness Collective; Shelly Blodgett, a holistic energy healing practitioner; and Glynn Pellagrino of Glynn Pellagrino Acupuncture & Traditional Chinese Medicine.History is defined by moments when individuals, organizations and communities choose to take a stand — or choose silence. Today, Vermont faces one of these defining moments.Last month, more than 23,000 Vermonters took to the streets, protesting national leadership that threatens our legal systems, social infrastructure and the very foundations that sustain Vermont’s vibrant small business community. Central to these protests was a clear message against fascism, autocracy and unchecked power.History provides sobering lessons on the dangers of unchecked surveillance and data misuse. Authoritarian regimes throughout history have relied heavily on surveillance and personal data collection to control, manipulate and oppress individuals. Today, the widespread collection of personal data by corporations poses similar risks, creating vast digital profiles that can be easily misused by governments and bad actors alike.Europe’s rigorous privacy protections, known as General Data Protection Regulation, emerged directly from their experience with authoritarian regimes misusing personal information. Vermont now has a similar opportunity — and responsibility — to proactively safeguard our citizens’ privacy and dignity.Yet, certain Vermont trade associations have opposed strong data privacy legislation championed by our state representative, Monique Priestley. Some have aligned with Big Tech members and industry groups, signaling troubling support for practices that turn human identities into commodities.Experts warn us that surveillance and data collection efforts could increase significantly, targeting vulnerable groups such as immigrants, individuals seeking abortion services or those requiring gender-affirming health care. Even ordinary citizens can find their personal data weaponized against them by vigilantes or authoritarian regimes.We must critically ask ourselves as Vermonters and small business owners: Are these practices we wish to support?As rural small business owners deeply invested in Vermont’s future, we believe in an economy built on trust and respect for consumer privacy. Our customers deserve to know their information is secure, used only as necessary and protected from exploitation.Trust and respect for people’s data isn’t just ethical — it’s crucial to the long-term success and sustainability of any business. Customers return to businesses they trust, and in an increasingly digital world, data privacy is foundational to maintaining that trust.Vermont has proudly led the nation before as the first state to abolish slavery, legislatively pass marriage equality and require GMO labeling. We cherish community values over corporate interests. Now, we must confront big tech oligarchies intent on extracting profit at the expense of individual dignity and community integrity.Priestley, a dedicated advocate for Vermont’s small business community, understands these challenges intimately. As a business owner herself and a leader who has served on local chamber of commerce boards, business association boards, and as chair of Green Mountain Economic Development and Vital Communities, she has consistently supported Vermont entrepreneurs.She has provided technical assistance to hundreds of business owners and taught small business planning to empower Vermont entrepreneurs directly. With her extensive experience spanning technology, economic development, community finance and entrepreneurship, Priestley has courageously championed strong data privacy protections. Her bill upholds critical consumer rights enshrined in Vermont law since the 1960s — rights currently under threat.Businesses hold a responsibility — not merely to profit but to uphold ethical practices and social justice. By supporting strong privacy protections, Vermont businesses send a powerful message: We value people over profits. We champion trust over exploitation.We also call on consumers: Ask questions of the businesses you support. Check in with local owners and managers to understand where they stand. Your purchasing power is influential. Support businesses that prioritize your privacy and clearly align with protecting your rights.This is our moment to choose clarity over complacency, responsibility over silence. History is watching. Let Vermont’s businesses proudly stand on the right side of history by protecting our neighbors, customers and communities — today and always.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont small business owners: Vermont businesses must stand on the right side of history.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-11 10:00:12.801183

(Kelly Hertz, Yankton Press & Dakotan)Shelsey Klein was 33 weeks pregnant and crying when she stormed into the Winner Regional Health CEO’s office.
She found out through social media in December that the hospital planned to close its labor and delivery unit in February, a week before she was due to deliver her baby. She and her husband lectured the CEO about the stress the announcement put on their family and asked him what families like theirs were expected to do.
“You don’t tell a very heavy, pregnant woman who is emotional that all of a sudden her plans of where she’s having the baby will change,” Klein said.
Rural patients face tough choices when their hospitals stop delivering babies

She lives on a ranch outside of White River, a half hour’s drive away from the Winner hospital, and delivered her three other children there. She wanted the same experience for her fourth.
Would she be delivering her baby in the emergency room with a doctor who wasn’t trained in obstetrics?
Would they have the tools to ensure her comfort and safety in case things went awry?
Or would she establish care with a new obstetrician at a hospital more than a two-hour round trip away, taking time off from her teaching job to make appointments and juggling her children’s care and her husband’s work on the ranch?
That stress of making those choices is the reality for mothers across South Dakota as more rural hospitals close their labor and delivery units, creating maternal care deserts. Some providers worry proposed cuts to Medicaid will exacerbate the issue, forcing more rural hospitals to close their labor and delivery units or close entirely.
Winner Regional Hospital delayed its closure from Feb. 1 to the beginning of March, after receiving pushback from community members and patients like Klein. The 39-year-old delivered her baby girl at the hospital on Feb. 2.
Making the choice: Driving the distance
South Dakota reports the second highest infant mortality rate in the country, according to the latest data from the National Center for Health Statistics. It also reports the second highest percentage of counties identified as maternal care deserts, according to March of Dimes. Pregnancy-associated deaths in the state increased 146% in the last decade, according to the state Health Department.
Some providers identify lack of maternal care access as drivers of the state’s elevated maternal and infant risk. About 58% of South Dakota counties don’t have birthing facilities, according to March of Dimes, and most of those counties overlap with tribal communities. The state’s infant death rate in 2022 was 7.78 per 1,000 live births, and 20.5 per 1,000 births among Native Americans.
South Dakota has a women’s health care shortage. The abortion ban may worsen it, physicians say.

More than a hundred rural hospitals in the U.S. have stopped delivering babies since 2021, according to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, often due to physician shortages or finances. Seventeen of South Dakota’s 49 rural hospitals still provide labor and delivery services, according to the report. One unit is at risk of closing.
South Dakota hasn’t experienced a decline in its birth rate like other states, seeing an increase around 2% between 2023 and 2024. But fewer providers are trained in obstetrics, said Emma Bye, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Yankton Medical Clinic in southeastern South Dakota.
“It’s terrifying what we have going on in our state,” Bye said. “We’re at a precipice. It’s scary to be a provider.”
Winner is the only rural hospital in South Dakota to close its delivery ward so far this year. Sisseton’s Coteau des Prairies Health Care System in northeastern South Dakota, in a town of about 2,400 and caring for patients on the Lake Traverse Reservation and surrounding rural areas, stopped deliveries last year.
The Philip hospital in central South Dakota hasn’t delivered babies for over two decades. Most women in the area plan to deliver their children nearly an hour and a half drive away in Rapid City or Pierre, said Lacey Hamill, a stay-at-home mother of 3-year-old and 20-month-old girls.
Hamill’s family lives on a ranch about 35 miles north of Philip. She made her prenatal care appointments in Philip, but had to drive to Rapid City for ultrasound appointments since the local hospital doesn’t have the equipment. Once patients near their 36th week of gestation, they’re referred to an obstetrician in Rapid City or Pierre to develop a relationship before delivery.

The former nurse drove with her toddler to the first few appointments in her third trimester. But it was too much of a hassle.
“I asked, ‘Are you just going to check my blood pressure and tell me I’m doing fine? I can do that at home,’” Hamill said. “I have a fetal monitor checking device at home. I kept a log book. Driving four hours round trip with a toddler wasn’t in the books for me.”
Her second daughter was born hours before Hamill was scheduled to be induced. She and her husband had booked a hotel room 10 minutes from the Rapid City hospital. The baby was born within an hour of their arrival.
“Had we been home, I would have had her on the interstate,” Hamill said, adding that for rural South Dakotans pregnancy is “a lot of praying that you make it to where you need to be.”
Since the Winner hospital stopped delivering babies, average daily deliveries at the rural Cherry County Hospital in Valentine, Nebraska, doubled from 0.6 to 1.4, said Jesse Wint, chief nursing officer. The hospital is 10 miles from the South Dakota border and 74 miles from Winner.
For South Dakotans in counties west of Winner, it’s one of the closest options. Pierre is the next closest, and the Indian Health Service on the Pine Ridge Reservation has a delivery ward for tribal members. It is the only IHS facility in the state with an obstetrics ward, said Meghan Curry O’Connell, chief public health officer at the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board. 
A lack of choice: Delivering in the ER
For people who lack transportation, the distance from a hospital that delivers babies increases the likelihood of high risk pregnancies, Curry O’Connell said. People might be forced to deliver in an ambulance, in their car or in a hospital emergency room.
Winner Regional Health has delivered two babies in its emergency room since it closed its labor and delivery ward, said CEO Brian Williams. Before Hamill left her nursing job in Philip, she helped deliver twins in the emergency room.
The Wagner Community Hospital, amid the lands of the Yankton Sioux Tribe, delivers about six babies a year in its emergency room, said TiAnna Smith, an ER physician and chief medical officer at the hospital. 
Each time a pregnant patient enters the ER, Smith said, nurses and doctors are “scared.” Obstetrics aren’t emphasized in their training, patients can’t get an epidural, and the facility lacks surgeons or anesthesia if a cesarean section is needed or if there are severe complications.










It’s terrifying what we have going on in our state. We’re at a precipice. It’s scary to be a provider.


– Emma Bye, obstetrician-gynecologist at Yankton Medical Clinic


Bye often tries to coach staff over the phone, since she is one of the closest obstetricians in the area and holds a clinic each week at the Wagner IHS facility.
“It’s really difficult to streamline care when you have a lot of midlevel providers terrified of these situations coming to their doorstep,” Bye said.
About half of Wagner’s emergency deliveries involve active substance use, Smith said, which can lead to premature deliveries. Many patients deal with other complications that increase the risk, such as diabetes and hypertension. And many emergency deliveries occur among women who don’t have reliable transportation or haven’t regularly attended prenatal visits.
If they haven’t gone to prenatal care appointments, the doctors don’t have records of how far along they are or what complications they may have.
“Usually, as soon as mom hits the ER door we’re calling for a flight team,” Smith said.
Charles Mix County, which includes Wagner, is not considered a maternal care desert according to the March of Dimes or the state Department of Health. But a facility in Platte closed its labor and delivery ward about a decade ago. There’s a midwife in Platte who’s 50 miles away from Wagner and can’t intervene if surgery is needed.
“If we’re considered ‘full access,’ then that paints a lot of concern for areas that have even less access,” Smith said.
Talk of Medicaid cuts threaten maternal health, rural vitality
President Donald Trump and Republican members of Congress are considering major cuts to Medicaid funding. Bye expects South Dakota mothers and babies would feel the consequences within six months. Medicaid is a federal-state health insurance program for people with low income.
“You’re looking at a mom who is already poor and doesn’t have health insurance coverage from any other source, who lives in a rural setting and has to drive two and a half hours for an appointment that won’t be covered, who has to spend time away from her family or miss work. That’s an insurmountable barrier,” Bye said. “You’re not going to get those moms to come to their appointments.”
Congressional budget agency projects sweeping Medicaid cutbacks in states under GOP plans

Rural hospitals will start closing within a year or two of the decision, Bye expects, harming not just Medicaid patients but anyone living in a rural community.
Nearly a quarter of people in rural communities are covered by Medicaid, including 47% of all births, making the program a significant source of income for OB-GYNs. They would see their budgets decreased if patients lose access to the program. Rural hospitals that are able to stay open might have to cut some services they offer — like labor and delivery — to keep their accounts from going too far into the red.
“You have hospitals across the state that you may not know about, that haven’t been published about, but they’re operating in the red already,” Bye said. “If you add Medicaid cuts, it could be catastrophic.”
In addition to asking South Dakota’s congressional delegates to refrain from cutting Medicaid when she visited their offices in March, Bye advocated for the Rural Obstetrics Readiness Act. The bill, first introduced in 2024, would establish new federal grants for rural health care systems to purchase equipment for obstetrics and create a telecommunications pilot program.
The Wagner hospital relies heavily on telemedicine to supplement its care, including emergency and neonatal intensive care. Expanding that to obstetric telemedicine would improve the care they provide for ER deliveries, instead of relying on phone calls to OBs more than an hour away.

Williams, with Winner Regional Health, hopes to recruit OB-GYNs to reopen the labor and delivery ward, but cutting Medicaid would make that harder. About 80% of babies delivered at the hospital last year were on Medicaid.
The hospital is seeing more and more “government payers” in the health care system, Williams said, adding that he understands the cost of the federal government covering an increasing number of patients.
“If they were to disappear it’d make it difficult for us,” Williams said. He’s concerned about how Medicaid cuts will “affect us and our viability.”
The Winner hospital is the largest employer in Tripp County, Williams said. If it’s forced to close, that’ll impact surrounding counties. And once a main industry is lost, it’ll be hard to build it back.
“We talk about wanting a stronger economic powerhouse in the U.S.,” Williams said. “You can’t do that if you don’t have healthy people.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BYE_0016-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-05-11 10:00:12.801183

New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.


Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.
 

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.



A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing.


– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America


Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

For the sake of communities across the Commonwealth, we can’t allow cuts from Washington to be a fatal blow to crucial climate projects here.
The post We can’t let Trump cuts stop critical climate resilience projects   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN RECENT YEARS, extreme weather events and climate disasters—from severe storms and flooding, to damaging cold snaps and drought—have inflicted billions of dollars of damage on our state’s economy and communities. It will only get worse as climate change turbocharges extreme weather.  We can either abandon impacted communities to face the consequences and pick up the tab for expensive repairs again and again, or we can proactively invest in climate resilience projects that protect families, neighborhoods, and livelihoods, and save more money than they cost. Last month, a years-in-the-making collaborative effort to protect essential infrastructure in Chelsea and Everett became the latest local project to be impacted by the Trump administration’s funding cuts.  The shuttering of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program (BRIC) has led to the cancellation of a $50 million grant to support the Island End River Flood Resilience Project that is working to mitigate the region’s flood risks, which continue to grow each year, and protect infrastructure critical to New England and beyond. The loss of this grant deeply damages ongoing efforts to protect this region. But for the sake of communities across the Commonwealth, we can’t allow it to be a fatal blow. As the Trump administration continues to defund initiatives aimed at preparing communities and the economy to weather the impacts of climate change, we need to work together to step up and find alternate paths to fund urgent resilience projects that will safeguard our families, our infrastructure, and our future. The Island End River, nestled along the border of Chelsea and Everett, is a half-mile-long tributary of the Mystic River. It is surrounded by a 500-acre floodplain—about the size of 30 Gillette Stadiums—that includes former marshlands that were filled in for industrial use.  The area already floods often, threatening businesses that serve New England and the mid-Atlantic states, as well as homes and other infrastructure, and shutting down roads. The risk of a catastrophic flood—on the scale of Hurricane Sandy—looms large over Everett and Chelsea in the near future. By 2030, just five years away, a rare but extreme event could produce flooding more than seven feet deep in some areas. With climate change and sea level rise, flooding events that disrupt regional supply chains and commuter travel are projected to occur at least annually by 2050 and daily by 2070 based on the Massachusetts Coast Flood Risk Model. Within this highly vulnerable area is the New England Produce Center, which provides fruits and vegetables to more than eight million people throughout New England, regional highways, two MBTA commuter rail stations, a regional FBI headquarters, jobs for 11,000 workers, critical energy hubs, the MGH Chelsea health care facility, schools, a local Market Basket grocery store, and housing for 5,000 people in Chelsea and Everett. The essential infrastructure and services housed in this area are not only critical for the wellbeing of our local communities, but also the people throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic states that rely on these resources.    The Island End River Flood Resilience Project, spearheaded by the cities of Chelsea and Everett in close collaboration with community-based partners, residents, and a regional watershed organization, is a product of nearly a decade of regional collaboration and support among municipalities, community members, the private sector, and local, state, and federal leaders.  The project will build a new linear flood barrier along the river and an underground facility to help prevent and manage storm surges. It will also create new ways for the public to enjoy the waterfront, including an elevated riverwalk, a new Island End Park, and restored wetland habitats. The project would generate more than $30 in benefits for every dollar spent on construction and maintenance, and billions of dollars in present-day net benefits.  The loss in BRIC funding has put the project on life support; now it needs a new path forward. Everett and Chelsea, low-income communities already disproportionately burdened by environmental harms, simply do not have the money to build this regionally critical project by themselves. Instead, we need to embrace the opportunity to stand up, get creative, and set an example for protecting communities and infrastructure vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The data show that investments in resilience projects can make an enormous difference in our ability to withstand and reduce the economic impacts of climate change. A 2024 study by the US Chamber of Commerce found that for every $1 spent on disaster preparedness, $13 is saved in economic impacts, on average.  Initiatives like the state’s Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) Grant Program offer a potential state-driven solution to invest in these very efforts at the local level. MVP already helped fund planning and design phases of the Island End River project, and with additional resources, could offer an important pathway to ensuring that Island End River and similar vital projects across the Commonwealth can be constructed.  Communities across the Mystic River watershed and throughout the state are all facing serious risks from climate change, and we can’t afford to abandon essential projects that will meaningfully improve the lives of people throughout the region. By making strategic investments in data-driven resilience projects like the Island End River flood barrier, we can build a Massachusetts that is resilient, secure, and prepared for the challenges ahead. Sal DiDomenico is a Democratic state senator from Everett.

In ‘refined’ library plan, Vermont State University says it will keep more physical books

“Expanding nursing through the creation of labs and simulation space will really allow us to expand our nursing capacity here at Johnson and within the Lamoille County area,” Nolan said. “It would be a huge and positive byproduct in terms of just creating more nurses and contributing to the health care workforce in this part of the state.”The Johnson campus is building out a unique tiered nursing program, where students can work toward the most basic levels of nursing qualifications, beginning with practical nursing certifications and laddering through a registered nursing degree and eventually to some master’s degrees.Now, five years out since a warning by former Vermont State Colleges Chancellor Jeb Spaulding proposed the closure of several campuses, including the one in Johnson, amid financial distress, the state has invested millions in turning the beleaguered university system around.Part of the former state college system’s reorganization has included a reshuffling of its academic offerings. In 2023, the university announced consolidations and shifts in focus at its campuses, including the expansion of in-demand nursing programs at its Johnson and Williston campuses, while some fine arts programs at Johnson were either terminated or consolidated.Empty shelves on the second floor of the library at Vermont State University-Johnson. Photo by Aaron Calvin/News & CitizenThe university recently announced a 15% increase in new students, with the nursing program among those receiving the most interest, even as the program is being built.The university has also been assessing the unused buildings on its campuses and attempting to work with local communities to find new uses for them. For example, McClelland Hall on the Johnson campus is in the process of being transformed into affordable senior housing through previously apportioned federal funding.The second floor of the library was identified as the area best suited for this component of the nursing program.“It’s the one space that really would work well to build out the lab and simulation space,” Nolan said. “It would work really well for the students and for the program and would work in terms of just making the infrastructural changes that we would make we would need to make within the budgetary constraints that we have.”Empty shelves on the second floor of the library at Vermont State University-Johnson. Photo by Aaron Calvin/News & CitizenThe university’s libraries were the subject of contentious public debate in winter 2023, when then-Chancellor Parwinder Grewal attempted to enact a cost-reduction plan that would have closed libraries at campuses across Vermont, including the one in Johnson.That decision was rescinded and Grewal resigned following intense backlash from students and the public. According to Alejandra Naan, library director for the Vermont State Colleges System, the decision to give up the second floor of the Johnson library to the nursing program was out of her scope but would benefit the Johnson campus in general.“It’s about enriching the campus with another program, and essentially everyone benefits,” Naan said. “In terms of the library space, it’s being reorganized to make room for it.”The university libraries are still playing catch-up after the pandemic closures prevented them from enacting the regular weeding of their collections, the process through which materials that are out of date or see little use are removed from the collection. Catching up on weeding has allowed the Johnson campus to free up space on the library’s second floor, and Naan said the process was standard and evidence based.According to Naan, these changes will ultimately benefit the library.“Nurses are huge library advocates and library users, so if anything, it might bring more vibrancy to the library, which we’re really excited about,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont State University-Johnson swaps library space for nursing labs.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/vsu-johnson-2-20240626-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-11 09:01:09.011707

The Poor People’s Campaign arrived in Washington, D.C. A town called “Resurrection City” was erected as a tribute to the slain Martin Luther King Jr. 
King had conceived the campaign, which was led by his successor at the head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Ralph David Abernathy. Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson reached out to young Black men wanting vengeance for King’s assassination. 
“Jackson sat them down and said, ‘This is just not the way, brothers. It’s just not the way,”’ recalled Lenneal Henderson, then a student at the University of California at Berkeley. “He went further and said, ‘Look, you’ve got to pledge to me and to yourself that when you go back to wherever you live, before the year is out, you’re going to do two things to make a difference in your neighborhood.’ It was an impressive moment of leadership.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06120235/May11-FeaturedImage-180108-dr-martin-luther-king-jr-ac-1146p.jpg,,,2025-05-11 09:01:09.011707

Shirley Squires has collected $478,007 for the AIDS Project of Southern Vermont since her son, former Rep. Ronald Squires, died in 1993. This month she’s reaching for a new milestone: a half-million dollars.

Ronald Squires, D-Guilford, at the AIDS Project of Southern Vermont’s Walk for Life in 2014. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerMost matriarchs observe Mother’s Day on the second Sunday in May. But Guilford great-great-grandmother Shirley Squires has reason to wait until the AIDS Project of Southern Vermont’s annual Walk for Life fundraiser later this month.The 94-year-old didn’t know much about the human immunodeficiency virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when it struck her son, former state Rep. Ronald Squires, D-Guilford, some four decades ago.The lawmaker was the first in the Vermont Legislature to announce his homosexuality, doing so in the spring of 1992 to help pass a statute prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.“This bill is not about special privileges,” the representative told colleagues on the House floor, noting the legislation instead would give him and his peers “the same rights that you all have.”Nine months later on Jan. 8, 1993, the 41-year-old was hospitalized for AIDS-related viral meningitis when switchboard operators patched through a call from then President-elect Bill Clinton.“They thought it was a hoax,” his mother recently remembered. “I was dumbfounded.”Within the next hour, the legislator, taking his last breath, became the first Vermont public figure to lose his life to AIDS, the Associated Press reported nationwide.“Just before he died,” his mother recalled, “he said he didn’t know what he would do without the AIDS Project.”Shirley Squires knew little about the Brattleboro-based nonprofit, one of the state’s three AIDS service organizations — along with Vermont CARES and the Upper Valley’s HIV/HCV Resource Center — that provide support to people with HIV as well as community prevention and education programs.Squires nonetheless collected $1,000 from family members and friends for the organization’s 1993 Walk for Life, not knowing how far that first step would take her.When AIDS was initially identified in the 1980s, a diagnosis was a certain death sentence. The advent of testing and treatment in subsequent decades is now helping some 750 Vermonters live with the virus, according to the state Department of Health. But such advances have left succeeding generations less concerned and, as a result, less conscientious of a disease that still must be managed by ever-continuing and costly medications.Shirley Squires helps carry a banner for Brattleboro’s AIDS Walk for Life in 2017. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerAnd so the great-great-grandmother (yes, she has children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren, although she admits to losing count of how many) hasn’t stopped generating money and awareness.Squires, yet to miss a year of fundraising, reported a cumulative total of $52,000 upon her 10th anniversary walk in 2003, $235,000 upon her 20th in 2013 and $456,118 upon her 30th in 2023. By the start of 2025, her lifetime haul was up to $478,007 — just $21,993 shy of a half-million dollars. Anticipating her annual handwriting of solicitation letters to 500 regular contributors, Squires had a sure-fire pitch: If she can raise just $104 more than the $21,889 she reaped last year, she’ll hit the $500,000 milestone. But that isn’t what the matriarch penned to her mailing list that ranges from past and present state leaders to locals who visit her home at Christmastime to view her collection of more than 1,000 Nativity sets.“I am writing on behalf of Shirley, who recently broke her shoulder and is unable to write her usual personalized note,” someone else printed.Even so, Squires and the staff of the AIDS Project are forging forward.“Every single dollar Shirley brings in could potentially be replacing a chunk of funding that we might be losing,” said Samba Diallo, the service organization’s executive director.The AIDS Project, whose nine staffers serve 77 clients in Bennington and Windham counties, operates on an annual budget of about $600,000. Nearly 85% of that comes from federal and state funding, with the remaining 15% covered by local and private sources.Talk of government cuts is scaring the nonprofit, which already has seen financial aid shift from rural areas with fewer people and lower perceived risk to urban centers with larger populations.“There are so many challenges, but money is the biggest,” Diallo said. “How do we make sure we have stable funding?”The AIDS Project will start by holding its 38th annual Walk for Life on May 31 at 10 a.m. at Brattleboro’s Centre Congregational Church.Squires hopes people will contribute whatever they can.“I want to try to write everyone to thank them,” said the matriarch, who notes she no longer has to confine her shoulder to a sling.Diallo, for his part, is drafting his own wish list.

Tate Reeves does hold a good bit of power over lawmakers during a special session. But in reality, that special session power can be limited by lawmakers if they so choose.","The Mississippi Constitution gives the governor the sole authority to call a special session and to set the agenda.
It is one of the few powers granted to the governor by the Mississippi Constitution.
But in reality, the special session power the governor possesses can be limited by legislators if they so choose.
Granted, the Legislature cannot convene a special session. Once legislators end a regular session, they cannot return unless called by the governor or until the next regularly scheduled session. Lawmakers are dependent on the governor to call a special session to allow them to take up a state budget, which they remarkably were unable to pass during the regular session that ended in early April.
Many believe that the governor will have more authority over the budget in special session than in regular session. For instance, can the Legislature consider a bill to fund special projects throughout the state if Gov. Tate Reeves does not include what is known by many as the “Christmas tree bill” in the agenda? Debate over that special projects bill appears to be the major sticking point preventing a budget agreement between the House and Senate. The House wants a Christmas tree bill. The Senate does not.
In 2008, then-Republican Gov. Haley Barbour called the Legislature into special session to levy a tax on hospitals to fund a $90 million Medicaid deficit. House leaders instead tried to pass a “compromise” bill that levied a tax on cigarettes, combined with a smaller hospital tax.
Republicans screamed that the cigarette tax could not be considered because it was not part of Barbour’s call. Then-Speaker Billy McCoy ruled that the governor could set the agenda for the special session — to provide more funding for Medicaid — but could not dictate how that funding was derived.
The whole issue became moot because Democrats could not garner the votes to pass their proposal. Yet, they also were able to block the hospital tax increase.
The end result was that the special session ended without the Medicaid funding issue being resolved. The issue lingered for more than a year.
In the 82-day 2002 special session, then-Gov. Ronnie Musgrove placed on the agenda the issue of providing protection from lawsuits for medical providers. He said he would expand the agenda to allow lawsuit protection for all businesses after the medical provider bill reached his desk.
But the Senate leaders said the governor could not limit how they addressed lawsuit protection. They wanted to do it all in one bill.
But the House, not as set on what some called “tort reform,” said it could only address the issue of lawsuit protection for medical providers because of the agenda set by the governor.
For several days, the two chambers literally sat and stared at each other.
Finally, then-House Speaker Tim Ford asked for an official opinion from Attorney General Mike Moore on whether lawsuit protection could be considered for all businesses. Moore’s opinion said that only lawsuit protection for medical providers could be considered since that was the limit of the governor’s call.
The AG’s opinion did not carry the force of law. But the Senate leaders, who said they did not agree with the opinion, finally acquiesced and worked with the House to pass lawsuit protection for medical providers. And then, Musgrove, true to his word, expanded the call to give legislators the ability to consider additional protections for businesses.
The bottom line is that lawmakers have substantial leeway in a special session to interpret the governor’s call. By the same token, the governor can veto legislation if he thinks the Legislature exceeded his call or not sign the bill and ask the courts to block the legislative action.
But the Mississippi Supreme Court has been reluctant to get involved in the inner workings of the Legislature.
For instance, the state constitution gives any legislator the option to have a bill read before final passage. That provision has been used as a method to slow down the legislative process or as a form of protest. In recent years, the legislative leadership countered by using a computer application to have the bills read at a super high speed. The program, spitting out words at an incomprehensible speed, was dubbed the “demon chipmunk.”
The leadership was sued, claiming the demon chipmunk speed violated the state constitution.
The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the legislative leadership and the demon chipmunk.
The majority opinion read, “We hold the court lacks constitutional authority to interfere in the procedural workings of the Legislature, even when those procedures are constitutionally mandated.”
If Supreme Court justices are not going to strike down the demon chipmunk, would they get involved in a fight over the interpretation of the governor’s special session agenda?",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05020255/3X0A7300-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-11 08:00:48.214362

Vermont citizens have with some regularity concluded that the state’s agencies are not implementing critical laws adequately or accurately.For such situations the Vermont Legislature has provided a time-honored and dignified remedy, one that has proven essential, for example, in implementing our national clean air and water acts. Citizens are given access to impartial courts to hear their complaints and to decide the proper course forward in light of the law.There is now a mountain of academic literature documenting that these accountability provisions have worked well. Indeed, after more than a half-century there is no doubt that citizen suits under these laws have been central, indeed fundamental, in protecting America’s public health and environment.Now, an important disagreement has arisen under the state’s Global Warming Solutions Act, a landmark legislative enactment addressed to a most important issue.Although the Global Warming Solutions Act was adopted four years ago, one of our best environmental groups, the Conservation Law Foundation, believes the state has failed to accurately model Vermont emissions and adopt sufficient measures to ensure the achievement of the legally required pollution reduction targets.

(Governor's Office photo)Economic development officials in Louisiana want to place less emphasis on the number of new jobs major projects bring to the state and more on what they pay employees.
Their strategy calls for a new business incentive program to replace a popular existing one, but it could be a decade or longer before the state stops doling out both perks – potentially costing the public hundreds of millions of dollars annually.       
Last month, the House Committee on Commerce approved House Bill 507, by Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, which would create the Louisiana High Impact Job Program. It hopes to entice companies that offer jobs with above-average pay in the parish where they intend to invest. In return, the state will award the business a grant that will cover a portion of that salary – the more the company pays new hires, the higher the grant. 
Companies providing jobs that pay 125% of the parish average will receive a grant to cover 18% of each salary. The award goes up to 22% for salaries at 150% of the local level. 
For what the bill deems “distressed areas,” employers would have to clear lower hurdles. Their businesses would receive an 8% grant for salaries at 110% the average.

There are no limits in the bill on the number of new jobs a company can add to claim the benefit, though the bill gives state officials the right to update the program’s rules. There is a ceiling of $200,000 per year per job and $125 million in annual grant awards for the entire program.
Employers must offer health insurance coverage to qualify for a High Impact Jobs grant, and the new hires have to be full-time direct employees or work for a subsidiary named in the grant contract with the state. 
The bill allows remote jobs to qualify for the incentive, though they must be Louisiana “residents” as defined under state tax law.   
Money for the grants will come from state corporate income and franchise taxes, according to the bill, though lawmakers eliminated the franchise tax last year, effective Jan. 1, 2026. 
Legislative calculations attached to Emerson’s proposal peg the High Impact Job Program’s average cost to the state at $69.4 million annually over the next five years. 
Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois, who joined Emerson to present her bill to the committee, acknowledged the High Impact Job Program would overlap the incentive it’s intended to replace – the Quality Jobs program – for years to come. The Quality Jobs incentive gives companies a 6% rebate on their payroll expenses for 10 years. It also comes with either a state sales tax break on money the business spends on its job-creating project or a 1.5% rebate for facility expenses.
These project investment elements are not part of the High Impact incentive, which would be offered for a three-year period with an opportunity to renew for two more years. That would make it half the length of the 10-year Quality Jobs incentive.  
“Quality Jobs was really more about the number of jobs, where this [High Impact] program is far more about the wages for the jobs,” Bourgeois said in an interview after the bill was approved. 
The secretary told lawmakers the High Impact Job Program will also be open to small local businesses, as long as they create jobs with salaries above the parish average. 
Emerson’s bill, which gives the program a 10-year lifespan, goes next to the House Appropriations Committee for its financial impact on the state to be considered.

Businesses can swap incentives, but not double-dip
As part of their tax and budget special session last fall, legislators agreed to let multiple business incentives lapse once their statutory life expires. That deadline is the end of next month for most of the programs eliminated. This was paired with a package of business tax reductions, including a lower, flat corporate income tax rate and the end of a state franchise tax that its detractors called an unwarranted fee to do business in Louisiana.
All told, lawmakers agreed to end eight business incentive programs last year, effective June 30, which will remove $180 million to $225 million in state obligations from the state budget, according to Bourgeois. 
Jan Moller with Invest in Louisiana, a progressive fiscal policy watchdog group, told the Illuminator he expected the business-friendly legislature would eventually restore some of the incentives it targeted last year.  
“I’m not surprised that it happened,” Moller said. “I’m surprised that it’s happening four months after the ink dried on that tax bill.” 
Although Quality Jobs was among the incentive programs lawmakers eliminated, the state will continue to accept applications until its June 30 sunset date. Its actual payroll rebates aren’t issued until a qualifying company adds new jobs, and those hires can be made years after the incentive is approved. Only then does the 10-year clock on the incentive period start. 
For projects such as the Meta data center in northeast Louisiana, which isn’t expected to start hiring for another five years, the state could still be making good on its Quality Jobs promises in 2040, Bourgeois confirmed.
Quality Jobs recipients will be given the option to switch over to the High Impact program, but they won’t be able to double up on incentives, the secretary said. 
“If they have an existing [Quality Jobs] contract, then they can live out that contract,” Bourgeois said. “They can also choose to look at it and see if they would rather do it differently.”
Paperwork the Illuminator obtained through a public records request with Louisiana Economic Development shows 16 projects have applied for Quality Jobs rebates in 2025 as of the end of April. All told, they would create more than 1,500 direct jobs with a combined payroll of nearly $167 million once all new hires are made.
Ileana Ledet, LED’s chief economic competitiveness officer, told lawmakers the High Impact Job Program is modeled after similar incentive programs in Georgia, North Carolina and Texas that are considered successful.
“We’re looking at best practices and making our recommendations based on what other states are doing well in incentivizing those higher-wage jobs,” Ledet said.  
Moving the wage needle
Moller questions whether the High Impact Jobs Program will live up to its name. By linking the incentive to what’s already a below-average parish salary, companies won’t be required to move the needle significantly on living wages in his opinion, he said.    
“We are underwriting payroll of companies that we like, and they don’t even have to be particularly great jobs,” Moller said. “They just have to pay a little bit above average.”
The most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show average weekly wages in Louisiana during the first quarter of 2024 were $1,195, ranking 39th in the nation. The rate was lower than the state average in 47 out of 64 parishes, with Catahoula at the bottom with an average weekly wage of $710.    
The legislation gives Louisiana Economic Development the authority to carve out areas within a parish and declare them “distressed.” This is what’s planned for the Hyundai steel mill in Donaldsonville, Bourgeois said, where salaries significantly trail the Ascension Parish average. The typical weekly pay in Donaldsonville is $836, while the parish rate is $1,449, according to federal data.
Emma Wagner, LED’s communications director, said rules are still being hammered out to define what makes an area distressed. She expects they will include criteria such as the unemployment rate and whether the area qualifies for federal tax breaks targeting low-income communities. 
Moller acknowledged his outlook for the High Impact Jobs Program is shaded by the efficacy of the Quality Jobs incentive, which the Legislative Auditor determined in a 2020 report was a net loss for the state. That review also determined only a third of Quality Jobs investment spending went to Louisiana companies, and that the majority of household income those jobs created would have likely happened without the rebate program. 
“These kinds of subsidies end up becoming just lagniappe, but not the thing that brings a company into Louisiana,” Moller said.

This time, he took a train — but his message was the same.","Editor’s note: We are now offering an audio version of our Sunday features. To access, click on the player above.
William “Willie” Dellacamera wasn’t planning to come back to Washington, D.C., this soon.
In September, the Northford farmer made headlines when he drove his tractor from Connecticut to the U.S. Capitol after a hail storm ripped through his farm. His mission: to secure emergency federal funding for smaller farmers like him.
A week ago, as he walked by his fields — they’ll have ripe strawberries in about a month — he mused about another trip to the nation’s capital some time in the future, perhaps hoping to make a similar pitch. But when he heard the U.S. secretary of agriculture would testify in the upcoming week, he moved up the timeline and changed his plans.
It was going to rain in Connecticut anyway.

Dellacamera wanted to hear about the status of a $220 million federal block grant tailored for small- and medium-sized farmers who don’t typically benefit from federal programs as much as those in larger farming states. He figured his best chance to make the case was in person. He and other farmers need that disaster aid immediately.
He booked his trip last weekend and traveled to D.C. on Monday (this time by train). He didn’t know what to expect on his impromptu trip, except his plan to attend a pair of hearings. But it turned out that 48 hours after he got there, Dellacamera got face time with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and a lengthy shoutout during one of the hearings from his representative, Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District.
Congress passed the Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant Program in late December as part of its year-end spending package. That legislation also included $23 million in agriculture disaster and economic relief for Connecticut.
The block grant program, championed by DeLauro and inspired in part by Dellacamera, will go to those in New England, Hawaii and Alaska who sustained damages caused by severe weather in 2023 and 2024. That includes crop, timber and livestock losses. Farmers and producers can qualify whether or not they have crop insurance.
But farmers in Connecticut like Dellacamera are still waiting to see if they qualify. The funding has been in limbo as the U.S. Department of Agriculture and state agencies still need to finalize agreements and allocations for each of the eight participating states. But Rollins confirmed USDA is working to get the funds out soon — both the block grant and the larger $21 billion to cover agriculture losses caused by natural disasters.
As things stand, Connecticut doesn’t know how much it will get. In January, the state’s agriculture department submitted a request of $83 million. That includes $72 million in reported losses, a 2% administration fee and $10 million for resiliency projects.
Creating a new federal funding stream is difficult. Implementing one is even harder. But Dellacamera — and some of the New England lawmakers — wanted answers. For him and other farmers in Connecticut, they need the money to pay their bills.
“I texted some of my other farmer friends, and all they say is, ‘Do you think you’ll get anything from going down there? Like what are you wasting your time for?’ But I don’t see it as a waste of time,” Dellacamera said.
“It was just a perfect alignment,” he said about the hearings and Rollins’ appearances at them. “Let me just go down there. I got nothing to lose at this point. So I was able to put a face to the story.”

From Connecticut to Washington, D.C.
Dellacamera didn’t come to D.C. as part of a group or a coordinated effort. He made the trip as a self-described “lone wolf.”
The first hearing on Tuesday was the bigger question mark. He showed up not knowing whether the block grant program would come up or if Rollins would stop to talk.
Rollins came to Capitol Hill to testify before House and Senate committees about President Donald J. Trump’s budget request. Trump proposed cutting USDA’s budget by 18% as 15,000 employees at the agency took deferred resignations that would place them on paid leave through September. Some employees in key offices won’t have their resignations accepted, and Rollins testified they are looking to fill some of these roles.
Her first stop was at a Senate appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday. About 20 people watched her testimony from the wood-paneled hearing room. Dellacamera took a seat behind her a few rows back and was visible in the livestream.
She fielded questions for over an hour about Trump’s budget proposal, workforce reductions, USDA funding cuts and office relocation plans. U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire specifically asked about the status of the $220 million block grant.
When the hearing wrapped, Dellacamera introduced himself to Rollins at the door. She listened intently as he told her about the hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses that culminated after a 13-minute hail storm in August — and the creditors who have not stopped calling since.
Rollins told him to hang in there and relay to the creditors that a piece of the $220 million is coming his way soon.

A USDA staffer assured him they are working on the program and noted that DeLauro is working with them to get it implemented. He exchanged numbers with her staff.
Dellacamera was pleasantly surprised by the interaction. He said he was not expecting the response he got on Capitol Hill or for Rollins to stop and speak with him. He left the interaction feeling that she was honest and earnest about wanting to help. Though he added that “the ball’s in her court.”
As he weaved through crowded hallways, more people took notice of his shirt that read “No farmers, no food, no future.” He easily stood out in a sea of suits.He was hundreds of miles from Northford but was instantly recognizable to those who know him. He was in a Senate office building when someone called out “Willie.” It was U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who was on his way to go vote.
They shook hands and talked about his brief encounter with Rollins. Dellacamera joked that the interaction was different from the contentious one he had with Blumenthal when the senator visited his farm after last year’s hail storm. Tuesday’s exchange was cordial and light-hearted.
A couple of hours later, he met with DeLauro’s staff in her office to talk through the hearing the next day. As the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, the congresswoman would get the opportunity to mention him by name during her opening statement.

The two have worked together closely in the past and again after the hail damaged his farm. Dellacamera’s story was one of the reasons DeLauro and Connecticut’s congressional delegation helped create the farm relief block grant in December.
“When I went to D.C. [last year], I didn’t know what I was going to get, and I figured whatever I get is a blessing,” Dellacamera said last week from Cecarelli’s Harrison Hill Farm. “That’s called a Christmas present. I had no expectations of it even being like that.”
“It wasn’t only for me. It was for everybody in the state of Connecticut that doesn’t have insurance, that can’t get insurance, that can’t afford insurance, that is barred from insurance,” he continued. Dellacamera has crop insurance and got a small payout after the hail storm. But many specialty crop farmers in the state don’t have it.
He felt confident DeLauro would advocate for faster implementation of the program at the next hearing. And after his conversation with Rollins on Tuesday, Dellacamera was hopeful he would get more face time with the U.S. agriculture secretary the next day.
At Wednesday’s hearing over on the House side, Dellacamera wasn’t the only person in the audience from Connecticut. Representatives with the New England Farmers Union were in the room along with another farmer from the state, Robert Chang. Connecticut Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt already had plans to be in D.C. for the day and stopped by the hearing.
Sitting next to Dellacamera was David Senter, who was part of the 1979 Tractorcade, when thousands of farmers drove tractors to D.C. in protest of rising interest rates, falling crop prices and foreclosures. Senter, as part of the American Agriculture Movement, drove his tractor from Texas for days until he reached Washington.

When it was DeLauro’s turn to deliver her opening statement, she put the spotlight on the Connecticut farmers in the room. Dellacamera was sitting right behind Rollins, and she turned around to shake his hand.
“I will work with you to make sure that this support gets out as the Congress intended. To date, Willie Dellacamera has not received one dime,” DeLauro said to Rollins at the hearing.
When it was her turn to ask questions, DeLauro got heated when asking Rollins about the status of the block grant program.
Rollins vowed to get that money out and urged patience, given that she took the helm of USDA three months ago and the program was created two months before that. She cautioned that the need from all eight states will likely exceed what has been appropriated by Congress.
“We’ll do everything we can. It’s my understanding it may not be enough. That in fact, the losses are bigger than the $220 million,” Rollins said.
DeLauro interjected, continuing to press her if USDA is committed to the program.
“Ma’am, it was three months ago. The last administration took more than a year. This is extremely complicated,” Rollins said in response as DeLauro continued to interject. “Your ag commissioner is coming in today to talk about it, so I think I’ve given a lot of confidence that we’re working really hard on that and doing everything we can.”
The back-and-forth ended with a commitment from Rollins: “For the 10th time since I started 40 minutes ago, it will begin to flow by the end of the month.”
When asked about the exchange after the hearing, DeLauro said she wanted to get a concrete answer that the program wouldn’t end up on the chopping block given the cuts and frozen funds at USDA and across the federal government the past few months.
“They’re monkeying around with so many of the programs, but I wanted to know that the commitment held firm on the $220 million, and now she said the money was going out at the end of the month, so we will hold her to that,” DeLauro said. “I take that as a commitment not to mess with the program and to get the money out.”

But the other parties involved in the block grant program are skeptical of that quick timeframe.
Dellacamera said it is possible Connecticut and other states could finish up their contracts by the end of the month. But getting money into farmers’ pockets will likely take longer.
Hurlburt also said the end of May deadline would be a tough schedule. The agriculture commissioner spoke with USDA staff earlier in the week as part of their standing weekly meeting. He said they reviewed the three frameworks for the program that he proposed in January.
But those initial steps have hit some delays. March was the original timeline he received for finalizing contracts with states. He is still looking for clarity on how much each state will receive and the application process for farmers who are about to be in a busy season.
Hurlburt said he’s working to get things sorted out between federal and state partners, “but it’s going to be a very aggressive timeline to meet any sort of May deadline if we don’t have a contract or an allocation or an understanding of the program.”
“Depending on how complicated they want to make it and what the paperwork requirements would be for individual farmers is going to be determining how quickly we can move,” he said.
Once the state secures a formal agreement with USDA, the next steps entail an open comment period where impacted farmers can weigh in on the program, followed by formalizing an application, keeping that application period open for 30 days and then verifying applicants to make sure they’re eligible. Then they will disburse the funds.
Because he showed up to the hearings, Dellacamera was invited to attend USDA’s press conference later Wednesday. There was a small hiccup when he arrived. He was flagged in the system as a known person of interest — likely from when he drove down to D.C. and parked his tractor in front of the building — but it got quickly resolved. He said he got another shoutout when discussing the rollout of federal disaster aid.

Pending federal assistance
Dellacamera believes some progress was made and felt the trip was worth his time. But he remains skeptical about the timeline laid out and said he will keep pushing to ensure the direct aid for farmers gets doled out sooner rather than later. 
Meanwhile, as he waits to see what kind of federal aid he’ll receive, Cecarelli’s Harrison Hill Farm is planting and preparing for upcoming harvests and food programs.
A week ago, workers were planting lettuce on a humid and overcast day. The nearby flowering plants started to show tiny yellow strawberries that will be ready with fruit in the next 25 to 30 days. The strawberries got hit hard by the hail storm, but Dellacamera said “they came back to life” based on the stage they were in at the time.
Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant and basil are currently growing in the greenhouses. Behind them sits the tractor that Dellacamera drove on state roads to get to D.C.
There are reminders of the 13-minute hail storm that hit last August all around the farm — including dents in buildings, the greenhouses and the sign that sits at the edge of the road. Dellacamera farms on a total of 120 acres in the area.
In mid-June, the farm will restart its Community Supported Agriculture, or CSA. On top of that, he will finish up his work of sending boxes to food banks before a federal initiative that provides communities with local, healthy food ends in October.
Cecarelli’s was also one of the first farms that was part of the Local Food Purchase Assistance program, which the Trump administration cancelled on March 7. The farm delivered 600 boxes of food a week to a church in West Haven.

The 2025 LFPA agreement awarded the Connecticut Department of Agriculture with $3.7 million that would run through 2027. But that future funding was terminated, and the current money will run out for Dellacamera and other participating farmers in October.
The state agency said by the end of last year, 516 distribution locations provided food to communities coming from 131 producers across Connecticut. With those pots of money, schools and food banks could supply healthier food to those in need with the mutual benefit of sourcing from local farmers and producers.
The cancellation of the LFPA and the Local Food for Schools program came up during the hearings. Rollins testified they are COVID-era programs that were not intended to run long term and would be unfair to taxpayers. She noted that many states still have money left to spend. Dellacamera and other participants and supporters of the programs rebuff that argument.
The loss of that funding is a double whammy for Dellacamera.
“I need the block grant to pay my bills off, but I know I’m losing the food box money, so it’s severely going to impact what goes on there,” he said.
It is unclear whether Dellacamera will get assistance through the block grant or the $21 billion of natural disaster money for farmers that also passed at the end of last year. Rollins said Tuesday that farmers will be able to access a portal in the next several weeks so they can apply for the latter grant.

For him, the channel doesn’t matter as long as he can pay his bills.
“I might not get a big chunk of that $220 [million] because I’m already going to get it from the $21 billion. But I’m fine with that, because I think it’s more money for my other farmer friends that didn’t get money,” he said. “As long as I get X, Y, Z I’m supposed to get, I don’t care which pot it comes from.”
But without access to any of those emergency dollars, Dellacamera wonders how long he and others will be able to keep up operations — or even want to — with the specter of future disasters that threaten their farmland.
“But why … will any of us farmers want to keep going when that’s the support we get? Why would I or any other farmer want to have to even keep farming, right?” he said. “If that’s what it’s going to be, year after year, disaster after disaster.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4682-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-11 05:01:19.704718

(U.S. Air Force)When did the Vietnam War end?
For Gregory Hankamer and Robert Weldon it came at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, May 13, 1975, on a CH-53 helicopter with the call sign Knife 13. The helicopter was part of a massive and hastily organized effort to rescue the crew of the Mayaguez, an American merchant ship seized the day before by the Khmer Rouge in disputed waters off Cambodia.
Knife 13 crashed, killing all 23 aboard.
It was two weeks after the fall of Saigon and a week after President Gerald R. Ford declared, at a speech at Tulane University, that American involvement in Vietnam had ended.
The Mayaguez incident was the bloody and chaotic last chapter of American military involvement in Vietnam. A rushed operation plagued by intelligence failures and bad luck, it serves as a reminder of the heavy price to be paid by those doing the fighting when impractical or even impossible orders are given. Although lauded as a clear military victory with few American casualties at the time, today some of the family members of those killed on Knife 13 question the official account of events.
The Khmer Rouge, the popular name for members of the Communist Party of Kampuchea, had been fighting Vietnamese forces for contested islands in the Gulf of Thailand and harassing merchant ships. On May 12, seven Khmer Rouge soldiers boarded the container ship Mayaguez after shooting a rocket-propelled grenade across its bow and took the 39-member crew captive. The ship’s radio operator managed a desperate SOS.
Alarmed by the prospect of another human and propaganda debacle like the 1968 capture of the spy ship U.S.S. Pueblo, in which North Korea held its crew hostage for 11 months, the White House wanted to resolve the crisis quickly.
“The scheme involved using a force made up of the local 656th Air Force Security Police Squadron (stationed in Thailand),” according to aviation archaeologist Ralph Wetterhahn in his 2001 book, “The Last Battle.” Seventy-five military police volunteers were to be landed atop the cargo containers on the deck of the Mayaguez. Neither the military cops nor the helicopter pilots were trained in such an assault, Wetterhahn noted.
Knife 13 lifted off from Nahkhon Phanom Royal Thai Navy Airfield, one of several CH-53 heavy lift helicopters en route to a staging area at the U.S. base at U-Tapao, Thailand. Officially, the helicopter was on a training mission. On board were 18 military policemen and five crew members.
Sgt. Greg Hankamer, born in Garden City and who had lived as a child with his family in Deerfield, was a 21-year-old Air Force security specialist on Knife 13.
Robert P. Weldon was a flight engineer and part of the helicopter crew.
An Airman First Class, 19-year-old Weldon was a resident of Kansas City, Kansas, and attended Turner High School. The Kansas City Times noted that upon hearing of the death of her son, Mrs. Dean Weldon expressed bitterness toward the United States.
“There’ve been one too many killings over there,” the paper quoted her as saying.
About a month before Knife 13 took off on its rescue mission, Hankamer wrote a letter to the editor of the News-Pilot of San Pedro, California, where his parents were living.
“I believe with all my heart that the people of South Vietnam have suffered much more than any other group of people in history,” Hankamer wrote. “Furthermore, if we can sit back with a clear conscience and watch and listen to hundreds of thousands of free people being killed and suppressed by the Communists” then Americans should be prepared for the fall of the Eastern portion of the world.
Hankamer said he was expressing his personal opinion, and not that of the military or the Air Force, but that many service members and civilians felt the same way he did and did not speak out for fear of “being looked down upon.”
A few minutes into the flight, Knife 13 plunged from the sky and burst into flames on impact with the ground. All 23 passengers and crew perished, along with three military police dogs. Although helicopters were scrambled for a recovery effort, according to Wetterhahn, the intensity of the fire and the exploding munitions aboard Knife 13 dashed hopes of any survivors.
The official cause of the crash was rotor system failure.
Hankamer was due to return to the states but had extended his tour by six months, according to his brother, Luther Hankamer II. There had been a mix-up at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok with obtaining visas for Greg Hankamer’s wife, Sumalee, a Thai national, and their 1-year-old daughter, Sondra.
Luther Hankamer, a retired Air Force master sergeant who lives in Fort Worth, was stationed at the Royal Thai Air Force Base from 1972 to 1974. Luther told me that when he learned of Greg’s death from an Air Force mortuary officer, he had no idea that his little brother had been on a mission to rescue the crew of the Mayaguez.
“I was more or less in shock when I learned he had been killed,” Luther said. “It hit my whole family hard.”
Luther told me Greg was an easygoing person, somebody who seldom lost his temper, and a talented musician. Greg played the trumpet, just like Luther, and was first chair in high school. When he outgrew his school-issued instrument, Luther gave his brother his own Martin Concertmaster, an instrument Greg brought with him to Thailand.
After the crash of Knife 13, the mission to rescue the Mayaguez crew continued, but was evolving. The plan to deploy Air Force security forces by landing helicopters on the container boxes on the ship was abandoned because Pentagon officials realized the boxes would be crushed beneath the weight of the helicopters, according to Wetterhahn. Also, new intelligence indicated the crew had been removed from the ship and taken to Koh Tang island. Further complicating the crisis was that the U.S. had no diplomatic ties with the Khmer Rouge, which had taken the Cambodian capital of Phnom Pen on April 17, 1975.
The new plan was to retake the Mayaguez and to assault Koh Tang.
The mission was supported by aircraft from the U.S.S. Coral Sea, which had been diverted to the area, and several smaller Navy ships. A brigade-strength amphibious Marine landing force was assembled. As part of the response to the Mayaguez incident, the U.S. also bombed Cambodian ports and targets on the mainland.
On May 15, the assault on Koh Tang began.
But U.S. intelligence had badly underestimated the strength of the Khmer Rouge on Koh Tang, and the Mayaguez crew had already been transferred elsewhere. The container ship was recaptured by U.S. forces. On the island, Marines met a few hundred Khmer Rouge fighters who were already dug in, having prepared to battle the Vietnamese.
The Khmer Rouge shot down four U.S. helicopters and killed 14 Americans during the first assault, according to the national museum of the Air Force. During the fighting, a fishing trawler flying a white flag approached the U.S. destroyer Wilson.
On board the trawler was the entire crew of the Mayaguez, unharmed.
President Ford called an end to the offensive, and reinforcements were moved in to extract more than 230 Marines who had become trapped on the island. The battle that followed was chaotic, confused and filled with horror and heroism. For a detailed account, I refer you to Wetterhahn’s book.
The tragic coda to the Mayaguez incident is that in the confusion a three-man M-60 machine gun crew was left behind on Koh Tang, awaiting a rescue that never came. The loss of the three was in contradiction to Marine Corps doctrine of leaving no one behind. The three were likely captured and executed by the Khmer Rouge. These Marines were Danny Marshall, Gary Lee Hall and Joseph Hargrove.
Lauded as a U.S. victory at the time, the human toll of the operation was at first downplayed. A Pentagon spokesman told the Associated Press there were only a handful of casualties and that no servicemen had been left on the island. The dead aboard Knife 13 also weren’t counted among the casualties and U.S. authorities initially denied the helicopter was involved in the Mayaguez rescue operation. But the truth, eventually, would come out.
In all, 41 Americans died during the Mayaguez incident.
They are the last of the 58,281 names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, which lists American service members killed in chronological order.
Sumalee and Sondra, Greg Hankamer’s wife and daughter, received their visas soon after his death. Luther Hankamer says Sumalee eventually remarried, and both remain in the United States.
“As far as we’re concerned,” Luther said, speaking for himself and Greg’s circle of friends, “it was an unnecessary mission. It was a screw-up on intelligence because the crew of the Mayaguez was already being released when the attack on the island took place to rescue them. And intelligence also said the island was lightly defended, with only company-level strength. When they got there, they found almost a regiment of the Khmer Rouge army.”
He is concerned that the official story about mechanical failure bringing Knife 13 down might not be accurate. He referred me to Jennifer Stelling, the niece of Sgt. Jimmy Black, an Air Force military policeman who died on the helicopter. She’s been researching the crash for years.
“I believe the helicopter was likely shot down rather than suffering a mechanical failure,” Stelling told me. “Several key details support this: the presence of active Communist factions in the area known for targeting U.S. aircraft, intelligence reports noting hostiles nearby, and the unusual fact that a flight surgeon on the scene was immediately issued an M-16 rifle for personal protection — an uncommon measure unless enemy contact was expected.”
In addition, Stelling said, records indicate ongoing enemy ground engagements in the area and the fact that other aircraft had been targeted in similar circumstances. Stelling, who lives in Alabama, said she was born after her uncle’s death but became intrigued by the Knife 13 story.
“These factors collectively suggest a hostile environment where the likelihood of ground fire was significant and cannot be dismissed,” she said.
Luther doesn’t know what became of the trumpet he gave his little brother. It wasn’t among the effects returned to the family.
Luther came home in December 1974.
“I just wish that Greg had been able to be on that freedom bird when I left,” he said.
The Vietnam War did not end when Saigon fell, or when Ford declared it was over, or even when remains of some of the Marine dead from Koh Tang were recovered and buried in 2013 at Arlington National Cemetery. For those like Luther Hankamer, who lost brothers and friends or other loved ones, the war lives on. When Luther talks about his brother, he describes an energetic and enthusiastic young man, and one who remains vibrant in memory. The tragedy of Knife 13 is a wound that is ever fresh.
Greg Hankamer’s body was recovered after the crash and buried in California.
Robert P. Weldon is buried in Alabama.
The gun team left behind on Koh Tang has not officially been recovered. The Defense MIA/POW Accounting Agency lists Hall, Hargrove, and Marshall as “unaccounted for.”

And while much of those noxious gases drift our way from New Jersey and New York City,  a large part of our pollution is home-grown. It’s due to heavy volumes of traffic, especially diesel trucks, which emit nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) —key ingredients in ozone formation.


Yes:  I-95 is hazardous to your health.
And all of this gets worse in the summer due to the heat which increases ozone production, often trapping it over our heads due to temperature inversions. By one estimate, almost 200 Connecticut residents die each year due to our air quality.
We will all remember back to June of 2023 when our sky turned orange due to smoke from Canadian wildfires.  That created truly hazardous conditions that literally made breathing bad for you.  With global warming, we’ll see things like this happening again.
So, what does any of this have to do with transportation?  Mother nature’s pains (like the Canadian wildfires) notwithstanding, it is transportation’s pollution that is the No. 1 source in our state, EPA blaming it for half of all our bad air.
Trucks: These are the vehicles responsible for most of our air pollution.  While medium to large trucks represent only 6% of traffic they cause 53% of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, 45% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), linked to respiratory and cardiovascular health issues, and 25% of greenhouse gas emissions.
Better air filters may help as does burning biodiesel and enforcing no-idling rules. But the real solution will be electric-powered trucks.  However, the Trump administration has slashed tax credits for new buyers and frozen plans for the rollout of charging stations.
Take the train:  Riding Metro-North is five to six times more fuel efficient than driving.  Those electric trains’ power-generation gives them the equivalent of 125-160 mpg.  And that’s improved further by the trains’ regenerative braking which means that, even when stopping, they generate more power.
Getting more folks on the train also reduces highway traffic, making those vehicles more fuel efficient because they’re not spewing exhaust in stop-and-go traffic.
But our diesel locomotives (which run on the Danbury, Waterbury and Hartford lines) are a different matter.  For their runs in Connecticut they are big polluters, just like trucks.  The World Health Organization and EPA call diesel exhaust a Class 1 carcinogen, right up there with tobacco and asbestos.  New locomotives that are on order will improve that with battery operation and improved filtration.
Ships: Yes, both commercial and pleasure craft contribute to air (and in this case noise and water) pollution, again because of their diesel engines.  It’s not by chance that wind-powered sailors refer to powerboaters as “stink potters” and “blow boaters.”  There are some electric-powered boats under development, but they’re more expensive and don’t offer the same range.
So, whether your travels take you on the open waters or (hopefully) open roads, remember that there’s more to the cost of your trip than fuel: there’s the cost to our shared environment.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Traffic-jam-CTDOT.jpg,,,2025-05-11 05:01:19.704718

Now 88, he said his thoughts floated back to when he arrived in the city as a young airman from Texas. There were maybe a couple of Mexican restaurants on South Omaha’s main corridor, he recalled. No panaderías. No paleterías.

He’d soon marry a local girl, immerse himself in community activism and help establish the local Chicano Awareness Center.
As Hernandez waved Saturday to the thousands of parade-goers packing the business strip now dominated by Spanish-named merchants and retailers, he figured many would not know his story or his name. 
“But at least they’ll know we’re still here,” he said. “And the fact they’re here tells me they also want to keep the culture alive. The whole thing made me happy, proud.”
This year’s South Omaha Cinco de Mayo celebration marks 105 years of fiestas, organizers said, and honored grand marshals like Hernandez with deep roots over those decades. Activities kicked off with a Friday night concert and will continue through Sunday with live performances, music, food, games and other festivities.
 Omaha’s largest and most diverse 

Saturday’s parade — described by organizers as Omaha’s largest and most diverse — lasted three hours, featuring more than 100 parade entries ranging from low-rider cars to show horses, traditional folklorico dancers to high school bands.
Political teams were on display, this being the final weekend before Omaha city elections.
Mayoral candidate John Ewing’s campaign was among the earliest at the parade grounds, staking out a good spot. Ewing, currently the Douglas County treasurer, greeted participants as they lined up.
Mayor Jean Stothert arrived just before the parade started and took a place toward the front, after Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes.
Not far behind was City Councilman Ron Hug, accompanied by a troupe of bouncing cars riding low. His opponent Andrew Adams also had a sizable sign-toting team.
Businesses, nonprofits, neighborhood groups, the public sector, bands and vaqueros on horseback participated in the nine-block parade.

Itzel Lopez, who volunteers to help the annual event organized by Casa de Cultura, said it continues to draw people and vendors from all races and cultures and from other Midwestern states, including Colorado, Oklahoma and Illinois. She said she spoke with a merchant whose roots are in Ecuador.
But what stood out to her this year, she said, was Latinos looking forward to the opportunity to celebrate together. In these “uncertain times” for immigrants and amidst fear instilled by the Trump Administration, Lopez said that some thought the group should not hold the celebration.
She disagreed. “Why should we be scared? This is the best time to show up and show our economic impact.” 
As of Saturday evening, Lopez said: “People are showing up.”	

Cinco de Mayo
Historically, Cinco de Mayo marks when a small but mighty Mexican army triumphed over invading French troops in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. Though France later would occupy Mexico, that victory galvanized Mexican forces, and May 5 grew to stir feelings of pride and resilience.
Today in the United States, Cinco de Mayo is often observed with parades, parties, margaritas. It has become an occasion for Latinos to celebrate and share their heritage.
South Omaha held its event a week after typical Cinco de Mayo celebrations largely to avoid conflict with the annual Berkshire Hathaway stockholders meeting, which requires many public resources also used during the fiesta.



Among them was Mary Berumen, who brought three daughters ranging in age 7 years to 11 months to the parade. While a member of South High’s cheer squad, she used to walk in Cinco de Mayo parades and was excited for her girls to feel the “energy, the vibes.” 
She said she also wants Analiese, Audrey and Iris to stay connected and appreciate their heritage.
“I want them to be proud they’re American but also not to lose their Mexican Hispanic culture,” she said.

Bryan Jaime, standing by wife Irais, carried their four-year-old son on his shoulders to watch the parade as it turned onto the last stretch near L Street. 
“This is his first time coming,” Irais said of their little boy, Mattheo. “We’re celebrating Hispanic culture and enjoying seeing it through our son’s experience.”
Meanwhile, some of the grand marshals, all longtime residents of the Omaha metro area Latino community, said they were a bit taken aback by how large the event had grown.
Linda Garcia, 79, was on the front line of watching the local Spanish-speaking population swell. She is a retired South Omaha librarian who brought bilingual books and story times into city programming. She is often approached by people who thank her for helping their families better connect to the area.
Still, Garcia said she was “shocked” to see the crowd on Saturday. Today an artist and storyteller, Garcia wore traditional Mexican garb and rode on a colorful float decorated with papel picado, flowers, cactus and American and Mexican flags.
“It took my breath away,” said Garcia, whose husband Jose, co-founder of the South Omaha Immigrant History Museum, also was a grand marshal. “All the little girls that were waving. Little ones with mothers and fathers, I didn’t know them, but they were waving like crazy.”

In addition to Abelardo and his wife, Dolores and the Garcias, other grand marshals were Manuel and Annie Gonzalez, Theresa Barron-McKeagney and Jorge Nila.
Like Hernandez, Jose Garcia remembers arriving from Kansas City to Omaha and finding no tortillerías. “That really puzzled me.”
Like Hernandez and Gonzalez, who also originated from Texas, Garcia did find a lifelong mate in a growing Latino community. Today, more than 15% of Nebraska’s largest city identifies as Hispanic.
The population has diversified, as evidenced by the change of the Chicano Awareness Center to Latino Center of the Midlands. Area restaurants and retailers feature Guatemalan, Salvadoran and Colombian goods.
While Cinco de Mayo is rooted in a Mexican event, Lopez said the annual celebration in South Omaha also is a time to appreciate diversity and new and old immigrants.
On the younger end of this year’s grand marshals was Jorge Nila, a well-known area jazz musician who said his dad was one of the founding fathers of the G.I. Forum, a longtime veterans-rooted club and restaurant in South Omaha.
During the parade, he cruised in a red sporty convertible.
“I felt unity,” he said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)An international student in western South Dakota overcame Kristi Noem’s attempt to stop her from graduating Saturday, while hundreds of people protested on the other side of the state where Noem received an honorary degree and delivered a commencement speech.
The international student is Priya Saxena, from India. She received two degrees from South Dakota Mines in Rapid City: a doctorate in chemical and biological engineering and a master’s degree in chemical engineering.
Noem’s U.S. Department of Homeland Security — which she has led since resigning as South Dakota governor in January — has been trying to deport Saxena since last month, asserting that Saxena’s permission to stay in the country should be revoked because she was convicted four years ago of failing to move over for flashing yellow lights, a misdemeanor. The action is part of a broader immigration crackdown by the Trump administration.

Saxena’s student visa is not scheduled to expire until 2027, and if allowed to stay in the country, she could apply for an extension to work in fields related to her degrees.
Saxena and her attorney, Jim Leach, of Rapid City, sued and won a temporary restraining order that assured Saxena’s graduation and will halt the government’s action against her until at least next week, when she has a hearing on her request for a court order to stop her deportation while the lawsuit proceeds. Saxena and her attorney have said in court filings that she has not committed a deportable offense, and have called the government’s actions “lawless.”
Saxena’s graduation went smoothly Saturday as she crossed the stage and received applause from the audience at Summit Arena in Rapid City. Her attorney and a university spokeswoman said Saxena preferred not to make any public comments.
Meanwhile in Madison
About 350 miles to the east at Dakota State University in Madison, Noem’s speech and her acceptance of an honorary doctorate in public service went off without a hitch inside the university fieldhouse, where she did not reference the protesters or make any comments about her official duties.
Outside, she was loudly opposed.
Students and community members lined the sidewalks chanting phrases including “no honor for Noem” and “due process.” Protesters said they were spotlighting Noem’s “cruel” immigration policies and the university’s decision to invite her to graduation.
“One thing that immediately came to my brain when I heard she was coming here was I was genuinely scared for the massive amounts of international students that we have on campus,” said student Maya Plummer. “That’s something we take pride in.”

The ceremony in Madison included foreign students from countries such as Vietnam and India.
Noem’s department has pursued enforcement actions against more than 1,000 international students. It has also removed temporary protected status for immigrants who fled danger in their home country, wrongly deported a Maryland man to a notorious prison in El Salvador, aired TV ads warning migrants to self-deport or avoid coming to the United States, and launched an initiative to provide up to $1,000 in “travel assistance” to immigrants without legal authorization who self-deport, among other actions.
This week, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, accused Noem of running a department that’s “out of control,” saying it’s at risk of spending all of its $65 billion in funding before the end of the fiscal year.
The Dakota State University student senate and general faculty both voted against the honorary degree for Noem, citing concerns over Noem’s policies and the message her recognition would send to international students and marginalized communities.
University spokespeople said they extended the invitation for Noem to speak and receive the honorary degree while she was still governor of South Dakota. The invite was based on her longstanding support of the university’s nationally recognized cybersecurity programs.
Dakota State President José-Marie Griffiths said in her speech that Noem is among “a number of individuals who were instrumental in changing the trajectory of this institution” in recent decades. She said the university was transformed from one that was losing enrollment to one that’s thriving as a flagship institution for computer technology.
“And by the way, there were protests for that decision, too,” Griffiths said.
Noem gave students a five-point bullet list of advice during her approximately 10-minute speech.
She told students their education is important, “But I will tell you that the world still revolves on relationships. People will be successful based on the people that they know and the people that they spend time with.”
Her other advice for students included, “You believed in Santa Claus for many years, at least believe in yourself for five minutes.”
Attendees react
Among attendees, there were conflicting views about the protest. Some family members of graduates expressed frustration that the controversy overshadowed the event.
“Honestly, it’s shocking because I feel like we should be here just celebrating the graduates,” said Anico David of Sioux Falls, whose sister graduated. “People are making it bigger than it should be with all this protesting. In my opinion, it’s kind of out of pocket and unnecessary.”
Max Lerchen, who earned a master’s degree, said honoring Noem “does not reflect the values that are held by the university,” such as inclusion. He said university officials should have expected opposition, and protesters should not be blamed for pushing back.
“They knew it was going to be an unpopular decision to begin with,” he said. “I think that’s similar to being picked on by a bully, and you decide to fight back, and then people go, ‘Why did you fight back?’”
Andrew Sogn, a spokesman for Dakota State University, said the institution hoped for “a celebratory atmosphere, and recognition of the graduates and their hard work.”
When asked about the students and faculty who opposed Noem’s honorary degree and speech, he said it was welcome, “because I think that we encourage open conversation and freedom of expression.”

(Photo by Amie Wambach for Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Current took home seven awards — including first place for Best Website, General News Photo and Headline Writing — at the annual Rhode Island Press Association Editorial Awards Banquet on Friday, May 9.
The banquet at the Quonset “O” Club in North Kingstown recognized the best work produced by Rhode Island news organizations in 2024 across 45 categories, including photography, writing and design. This year’s contest drew a total of 463 entries.
Rhode Island Current, an affiliate of States Newsroom that launched in 2023, joined the association last year after the board voted to open membership to digital news outlets.
The Best Website category recognizes a news website that showcases an outlet’s depth of work with emphasis on presentation, strength of content and use of digital tools and storytelling techniques. After Rhode Island Current took first place, second place went to The Boston Globe Rhode Island and third place to The Providence Journal.
Reporter Alexander Castro won first place in the General News Photo for his candid photo of a young girl about to drop her ballot into a voting box at the Providence Children’s Museum last October as part of a civics education program geared for kids. 
Editor-in-Chief Janine L. Weisman earned first place in the headline writing category, which required the submission of three headlines. Weisman entered: 
“Whitehouse going for gold in Olympic ad spending with his U.S. Senate reelection campaign” 
“Schoolkids already have enough on their plate. Will legislators take brown rice off it?”
“So many accusations in Providence House Democratic primary contest, so little time to investigate”
Reporter Christopher Shea took second place for Government Reporting for his story on a last-minute intervention in Rhode Island’s U.S. Senate race by an unknown super PAC on behalf of GOP candidate Patricia Morgan, who lost her bid to unseat Democratic incumbent Sheldon Whitehouse.
The second place award for General Election Coverage went to Rhode Island Current’s four-person staff for their coverage of all ballot questions, General Assembly contests, a U.S. Senate race and the Cranston mayoral race in the November 2024 election.
Senior Reporter Nancy Lavin won third place for Reporting on the Environment for her story on the offshore wind industry’s struggles to overcome misinformation and negative public perception.
Castro also won a third place writing award in the Single Topic Series category for five stories he wrote last December on the RIBridges data breach as the personal data of 59% of Rhode Island’s population burgled from the state’s public benefits system started making its way onto the dark web.
Friday’s awards banquet honored three inductees into the Rhode Island Journalism Hall of Fame: Providence Journal photographer Kris Craig; Marta V. Martínez, a community oral historian and executive director of Rhode Island Latino Arts; and Providence Journal columnist Mark Patinkin.

(Photo by Ryan Hagerty/USFWS)A Washington state-based conservation group filed a lawsuit this week in an effort to speed up the federal government’s review of a proposal to list king salmon as threatened or endangered across the Gulf of Alaska.
The Wild Fish Conservancy filed its lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., saying that the National Marine Fisheries Service had missed a 12-month deadline under the Endangered Species Act to decide on the conservancy’s proposal to list Gulf of Alaska king salmon.
The conservancy, in its 17-page complaint, said it formally asked the service to list the king salmon in a petition Jan. 11, 2024, which gave the agency until Jan. 11, 2025, to respond. The lawsuit asks a judge to order the service to “promptly issue” its decision on the petition by a specific date.
“With the crisis facing Alaskan chinook, we are out of time and options,” Emma Helverson, Wild Fish Conservancy’s executive director, said in a prepared statement, using another name for king salmon. She added: “The Endangered Species Act sets clear deadlines for a reason, to evaluate the risk of extinction and trigger action while recovery is still possible.”
The conservancy’s press release announcing the lawsuit points to other listing proposals that the fisheries service had failed to act on within 12 months and described “systemic dysfunction” at the agency.
A top Alaska official at the fisheries service, Jon Kurland, said in a brief email Friday that the agency is “continuing to review the petition and to develop the required 12-month finding.”
The lawsuit to force action from the fisheries service is “fairly routine,” said Doug Vincent-Lang, fish and game commissioner for the state of Alaska, which has opposed the conservancy’s proposal and numerous other efforts to list species as endangered in Alaska.
Vincent-Lang said that the fisheries service is “working through the process” — if, perhaps, slowed by the change in presidential administrations — and that two state scientists have been given access to a team reviewing the petition, though they’re not voting members.
“I understand they’re getting closer to a decision,” he said. “I’d much rather have them take their time and have a deliberative process than to rush to a decision because of a statutory timeline.”
The conservancy has taken multiple actions in Alaska in recent years that have drawn sharp rebukes from the state’s elected officials and commercial fishermen.
 
Lawsuit targets Southeast Alaska salmon fishery to save 73 orcas

	Another lawsuit filed by the group with the intent of preserving salmon as prey for endangered Pacific Northwest orca whale populations threatened to close down Southeast Alaska’s small-boat troll fishery. 
And Vincent-Lang has expressed concerns that, if the Endangered Species Act listing of Gulf of Alaska king salmon is approved, it could lead to sharp restrictions on harvests of the fish, as well as in other salmon fisheries that accidentally hook or harvest kings.
The conservancy says that Alaska king salmon are threatened by accidental harvest in trawl fisheries, and by fish hatcheries, habitat destruction, climate change and overfishing.

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Intriguing match-ups in the fall elections emerged Friday as Democrats look to retain control of several seats in the Washington state Legislature.
Two Senate contests should provide a test of voters’ views on new laws, higher taxes and spending decisions pushed through by the majority Democrats over the objections of Republicans.
Races for two other legislative seats will showcase strains within the Democratic Party between its progressive and moderate factions.
Three appointed Democratic lawmakers are breathing easy. They drew no challengers before the filing window closed Friday.
This all but assures the trio — state Sens. Tina Orwall of Des Moines and Emily Alvarado of Seattle, and Rep. Brianna Thomas of West Seattle — will retain their seats for the 2026 session.
Here’s where things stood Friday. Candidates have until Monday to formally withdraw from any of the races.
Senate
26th District: This looms as the must-watch contest of the year.
Sen. Deb Krishnadasan, a Gig Harbor Democrat, is looking to keep the seat she was appointed to after the district’s former state senator, Emily Randall, was elected to Congress. She faces Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier, also of Gig Harbor. She was first elected to the House in 2014 and re-elected in November with nearly 55% of the vote.
The winner will represent the legislative district which encompasses parts of Kitsap and Pierce counties and includes Bremerton, Port Orchard, Purdy and Gig Harbor. They will need to run again in 2026.
Caldier enters with backing from most of the Senate Republican Caucus. She is expected to focus on what GOP legislative leaders say has been Democrats’ overreach with passage of a $9.4 billion package of tax increases to balance the budget and another $3.2 billion for transportation, anchored by a 6-cent per gallon gas tax hike.
Krishnadasan, who served six years on the Peninsula School District Board of Directors, was among the vulnerable Democrats voting against their party’s major tax bills and transportation revenue package. She’ll be pressed to make that clear in the coming campaign.
5th District: This race is to fill the vacancy created by the death of Democratic state Sen. Bill Ramos in April. Whoever wins will serve the remaining three years of the term.
Rep. Victoria Hunt, D-Issaquah, a scientist and former Issaquah City Council member, won her House seat in November with 54% of the vote. She formally entered the race Monday and is backed by her seatmate, Rep. Lisa Callan, D-Issaquah. 
“While this was not a campaign I wanted to run, I am honored to build upon the legacy of leadership and spirit of selfless service exemplified by Bill Ramos, while continuing to rely on my experience in Olympia and local government,” Hunt said in her announcement.
Republican Chad Magendanz, a former two-term state representative for the district, is opposing her. He ran for Senate last year, losing to Ramos by 3,400 votes. In 2022, Magendanz lost to Callan for the House seat.
In his announcement, he targeted Hunt’s support of “billions in new, unnecessary, and regressive taxes” and called the election “our opportunity to correct course.”
48th District: Sen. Vandana Slatter, D-Bellevue, and Rep. Amy Walen, D-Kirkland, are squaring off in what will be a litmus test for some of the party’s priorities and the district voters’ allegiances.
Slatter had served in the state House since 2017 until being appointed to replace Patty Kuderer, following her election as Washington’s insurance commissioner. Walen won her seat in 2018 and also sought the appointment. The district covers communities in Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland.
Both opposed the largest piece of the Democrats’ $9.4 billion tax package, a sweeping bill containing an across-the-board increase in the business tax and surcharges on the state’s largest corporations and financial institutions. And both supported another key component, extending the retail sales tax to some services.
Slatter voted for the gas tax increase. Walen did not. They differed on some high-profile policies, too. For example, Walen opposed the new rent increase cap and Slatter voted for it.
This will be a costly contest. As of Thursday, Walen had raised nearly $320,000 to Slatter’s $107,000, according to filings with the state Public Disclosure Commission.
House
33rd District: Rep. Edwin Obras, D-SeaTac, who was appointed to fill Orwall’s House seat, is being challenged by Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling, a Democrat, and Darryl Jones, a Republican and Kent resident. The two with the most votes in the August primary will advance to the general election. The district includes Burien, Normandy Park, Des Moines, SeaTac, and much of Kent.
Obras formerly worked for the city of Seattle’s Human Services Department. This will be his first election campaign for a public office. “We need someone in Olympia who will fight for the diverse communities in South King County and not settle for or slide back into the status quo,” he said in his announcement.
Schilling was elected to the Burien City Council in 2019 and reelected in 2023. He’s been mayor since last year. He is the government affairs director for the Washington State Dental Association and former political director for retired congressman Derek Kilmer. Schilling did not seek the appointment to the post.
“The government of the state of Washington is not doing things differently to solve the problems that need to be solved,” he said. He said he wants to bring new approaches to addressing homelessness, housing, and public safety based on his experience as mayor.
Jones, who filed Friday, made an unsuccessful run for a Kent City Council seat in 2023.
As of Friday, Schilling had raised $83,100. Obras, who could not raise money during the session, had not reported any contributions yet on the state Public Disclosure Commission website.
41st District: Rep. Janice Zahn, D-Bellevue, who was chosen to replace Tana Senn when she left to lead a state agency, will face two opponents – Democrat Vinita Kak of Newcastle and Republican John Whitney of Bellevue. The top two finishers in the primary will face-off in November to represent the district that includes Mercer Island, Newcastle and part of Bellevue.
Zahn is a former Bellevue City Council member and chief engineer at the Port of Seattle. She’s formally endorsed by more than 40 members of the House Democratic Caucus, along with Gov. Bob Ferguson. Kak is a member of the planning commission for the city of Newcastle. 
48th District: Rep. Osman Salahuddin, D-Redmond, who serves on the Redmond City Council and was chosen to replace Slatter in the House, drew two challengers Friday afternoon – Ranga Bondada and Dennis Ellis. 
Bondada, a Democrat, lives in Bellevue and owns two small businesses. This is his first campaign. Ellis, a Republican, lives in Redmond and has worked at Boeing.

DemasWith U.S. Reps. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) and John James (R-Shelby Twp.) reintroducing the Grand River Bands of Ottawa Indians Restoration Act on Thursday, members of the bands are cheering the policy, which would grant them federal recognition. 
The Grand River Bands have advocated for federal recognition for more than 30 years using the process laid out by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Office of Federal Acknowledgement. While the tribe completed a petition for federal recognition in 2000, and received a potential finding from the Bureau in 2023, recognition is still many years away. 
The United States government recognizes 574 tribes, including 12 in Michigan. If the Grand River Bands receive recognition, members would be able to access federal resources, including social services, education, housing, elder care and the ability to exercise treaty rights and weigh in on legislation that impacts tribes.
“On behalf of the Grand River Bands, I thank the lead sponsors of this legislation, Reps. Scholten and James, and others from the Michigan Congressional delegation for advocating for justice for our tribal members,” Ron Yob, chairman of the Grand River Bands, said in a statement. “After more than three decades of advocacy for federal recognition, I am hopeful our tribal members will soon have access to the resources they deserve, and which have eluded generations of tribal members.”
According to a statement, the Grand River Bands signed five separate treaties between 1795 and 1855 reaffirming their constitutional sovereignty. They are the last treaty tribe east of the Mississippi River without federal recognition. 
“For generations, the Grand River Bands have made meaningful contributions to our state and country – and yet, they have remained unjustly excluded from the federal recognition they deserve. Without federal recognition, they are denied access to the same opportunities available to other federally recognized tribes including health care, housing assistance, and educational support. This bill fixes that and I’m honored to support it,” James said.
The Grand River Bands are based along the Grand River and other waterways in southwest Michigan, with most current members residing in Kent, Muskegon and Oceana counties. 
“The Grand River Bands are a central part of our state’s history, culture, and community, and it’s long overdue that we officially recognize them as a sovereign tribe,” Scholten said. “They are foundational to the identity of West Michigan, and for nearly 30 years, the Grand River Bands have been advocating for federal recognition. I’m committed to ensuring they get the resources and respect they deserve.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_6398-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-10 12:09:36.780825

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Locomotive engineers at NJ Transit and the agency’s management remain at odds as stalled contract negotiations at an impasse over wages threaten to boil over into a disruptive strike in less than a week.
NJ Transit has argued that engineers are seeking extravagant salary hikes. But NJ Transit Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers General Chairman Tom Haas told reporters in Newark Friday that the agency has overstated engineers’ pay and inflated the figures included in the union’s latest contract proposal by listing other forms of compensation as salary.
“It’s not been true, good faith negotiations on their part, and I think you see that with some of the PR they’ve done over the last couple weeks,” said Mark Wallace, the union’s national president, who would be the one to call a strike Friday.
In a separate press conference held across the street, NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri impugned Haas’s mental health and maintained the agency would not depart from an earlier contract offer agreed to by both bargaining teams but overwhelmingly rejected at a vote by union members last month.
“I’m worried about his health. I’m worried about his mental health,” Kolluri said of Haas.
When asked about those comments, Kolluri said he “was merely questioning his memory.”
NJ Transit’s locomotive engineers have been working under an expired contract since 2019, and years of bargaining have exhausted the extensive federal process for railway strikes.
The union could launch a job action after 11:59 p.m. May 15. A strike by engineers would effectively stop all agency trains on one of the country’s busiest commuter rail lines.
NJ Transit’s contingency plan for such a strike would see additional buses launched from four park-and-ride lots, but that plan would only capture about 20% of its daily riders, and at a cost of about $4 million per day, the agency has said.
On Friday, Haas said the difference between the two sides’ wage proposals was just over $4 million per year. He said the union asked for increases that are two percentage points higher than those in the deal rejected in April’s vote, from an average of 2.65% in eight increases over seven years to 4.625%.
“That means over the course of a week, should New Jersey Transit cause a work stoppage that lasts a week, that would exceed the cost difference between our proposal and theirs,” Haas said. “So, New Jersey Transit is, again, being a little cagey with the numbers here.”
  NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri speaks to reporters at Newark Penn Station on May 6, 2025. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)
Anthony Greco, senior vice president of communications and customer experience at NJ Transit, said the union had requested three additional 5% increases in 2028, 2029, and 2030, years not covered under the rejected proposal.
When asked Friday about the difference in cost between the two proposals, Kolluri said $1.3 billion before acknowledging that figure includes pay for other workers and assumes the agency’s other unions would obtain similar increases.
NJ Transit’s proposed total spending on labor in the fiscal year that begins July 1 is $984.2 million, according to budget documents.
Greco later said the union’s proposal, including the three extra years, would on average annually cost $11.8 million more than the rejected deal.
More than once Friday, Kolluri said he would not entertain proposals apart from the one the union’s members have already rejected.
“I will not be party to any deal other than the one that’s on the table,” he said.
A larger offer would spur NJ Transit’s 14 other unions to seek larger raises, Kolluri said.
The CEO argued the agency’s proposal would bring hourly pay for NJ Transit engineers to $49.82, about on par with rates at the Long Island Rail Road. But that figure includes one-time retroactive payments and non-salary compensation like overtime. Engineers at LIRR have been working under an expired contract since 2022.
The NJ Transit engineers union argued that figures the agency gave for their salaries are inaccurate.
Agency officials have said engineers are paid $135,402 on average and on Friday proffered payroll documents to support the figure. The documents list gross pay for 238 locomotive engineers (NJ Transit has about 420 engineers on staff). Agency staff said roughly 200 others had been excluded because they did not work at least 40 hours each week in 2024. Salaries for locomotive engineers listed across two categories on the state’s transparency website averaged to $113,853.
Haas said he would accept a contract that brought average base salaries — not total compensation — to $172,000.
“I’ll come upstairs and sign it right now. I will walk over to their building and avert a strike. If you’re willing to do $172,000 a year average earnings for engineers, we’ve got a deal,” Haas said.
Officials still have a path to avert a strike. Congress and President Donald Trump could act to avert a strike by passing and signing legislation to impose a tentative contract, as happened in December 2022, when President Joe Biden signed a bill to block a national rail strike over a sick leave dispute.
The National Mediation Board, which oversaw bargaining between the parties for more than four years, is holding a public interest meeting at which the two sides are to deliver statements on Monday (the board’s formal role as a mediator ended last June).
But sharp rhetoric and apparently growing animosity between the two camps could make an amicable resolution unlikely.
“He somehow thinks there is a better pot at the end of the rainbow,” Kolluri said, referring to Haas. “Let me be crystal clear: This is the deal that was offered, that he shook my hands on, that he negotiated, and now he has to live with his consequences. Let me tell you what that means: We are about to spend $4 million a day. That is the number that’s coming off their contract every day they’re on strike.”

(Photo courtesy of Sorrell Redford)On Friday, April 25, Sorrell Redford, education director for Montezuma School to Farm Project, heard that their AmeriCorps funding through Serve Colorado would run out following abrupt cuts from the federal government. The agency bought themselves a few extra days by cobbling together two weeks-worth of funds to help ease the transition and possibly, to tide them over until a court reversal.
Near the end of April, DOGE cut more than 1,000 AmeriCorps grants totalling nearly $400 million across the United States. Many of these programs provided pivotal social services for rural communities that do not have the resources to fill these gaps without federal funding.
In Cortez, Colorado, Montezuma School to Farm Project depends on AmeriCorps members to keep the organization going. The nonprofit teaches garden classes in local public schools and also grows food for the food pantry, Good Samaritans. Redford said they have a goal to produce 6,000 pounds of food this year.
Redford said the organization only pays $300 for each AmeriCorps member right now and the government subsidizes the rest.
“Without that, we could not afford to employ them,” she said.
She hopes that they will be able to pay for their current members until the end of their terms in July, but it will cost the organization an extra $5,300 a month — a lot for a small nonprofit.
On April 29, 24 states and the District of Columbia, including Colorado and Kentucky, filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration’s cuts to AmeriCorps funding, calling it unconstitutional because it “usurps Congress’s power of the purse” and does not allow the agency to serve its mission and purpose.
While Redford hopes the lawsuit will restore funding for their programs, it could come too late for both the current members and next year’s AmeriCorps members, who would start in August. Redford has already made an offer to a member for next year but now that is up in the air. Without AmeriCorps starting in late summer, the harvest season will fall entirely to Redford, currently Montezuma School to Farm Project’s  only full-time employee.
“There’s a whole trickle down effect, if we can’t grow the food, we can’t get it to the food bank, they won’t have fresh food to give out,” Redford said.
The pantry is already hurting due to USDA grant cuts that fund local purchases for food pantries and schools. The AmeriCorps also work as volunteers in the pantry distributing food. Adding insult to injury, AmeriCorps’ absence in Montezuma would halt garden classes, hurting both teachers and students.
In Colorado, 27 out of 37 AmeriCorps programs were cut, said Colorado Lieutenant Governor, Dianne Primavera. Seventeen of those were in rural areas. Serve Colorado, the state agency that manages Colorado AmeriCorps, is under the office of the Lieutenant Governor. Primavera said that Colorado lost about $12 million of funding for rural areas alone.
“AmeriCorps members’ service is the only support system in many rural towns, so losing these programs isn’t just a budget issue, it’s a community resilience issue,” Primavera said in an interview with the Daily Yonder.
Primavera emphasized that AmeriCorps is a workforce development program – many AmeriCorps members go on to become teachers, mental health professionals, firefighters and other vital community professions, based on their experiences in AmeriCorps.
“This isn’t a time to cut AmeriCorps. It’s a time really, to double down on services, not dismantle it,” said Primavera.
  History of AmeriCorps 

AmeriCorps programs have been around, under various names, since the 1960s, when the Volunteers in Service to America, or VISTA, program was established as part of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Even before that, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. It was later used as a model for conservation corps programs that still exist today, many of which are funded through AmeriCorps grants.
While AmeriCorps does operate some direct programs like the National Civilian Community Corps, most of the funding through the program goes directly to city and county governments, nonprofits, and other organizations doing work on the ground in communities.
Service members receive a small stipend for their service term which can last from a few months to more than a year. At the end of the term, members are eligible to receive an education award of around $7,000 that can be applied towards future education opportunities or towards student loans. For any AmeriCorps member affected by grant cuts, education awards stopped accruing and will be prorated as of April 25, 2025, violating contracts signed by these members at the beginning of their service terms.
  Eastern Kentucky 

On Saturday, April 26, Josh Mullins received a call from Serve Kentucky that Hindman Settlement School’s AmeriCorps funding – more than a million dollars – had been cut by the Trump Administration.
Hindman Settlement School in Eastern Kentucky had two AmeriCorps grants to fund 52 service members across five different counties in seven school districts, providing math and reading tutoring for K-3rd grade students.
Mullins, the director of operations for Hindman Settlement School, said that the organization had been an AmeriCorps grantee for the past five years and they shouldn’t have had to reapply for funding until next year for their ReadingCorps program, and two years from now for their Math Corps program.
“The school systems rely on these services to help their most at-risk students,” Mullins said in a Daily Yonder interview. “The schools do not have the staffing to provide one on one intervention,” he said. AmeriCorps members directly fill these gaps, providing tutoring to students falling behind in math and reading.
In Kentucky, 21 out of 28 AmeriCorps programs were cut – $9 million dollars of funding – affecting the service terms of 691 volunteers. While called volunteers, AmeriCorps members are full time (sometimes more than full time) employees, and for many, it is their primary employment, despite being paid a near-poverty-wage stipend.
Mullins said that Hindman Settlement School is committed to funding their service members until the end of their terms in July. They are currently fundraising to fill the gap left by the AmeriCorps funding cuts.
“If we don’t win the lawsuit, everything will stop immediately. There’ll be some not for profits, that will have to shut their doors,” said Lt. Governor Primavera.

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.
“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.










To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.


– Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree


A bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
Funding to help victims recover
Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.
In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
Underreported to police
Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.
Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)This week is National Small Business Week, a time to celebrate the entrepreneurs who keep our communities vibrant and full of opportunity. In Anchorage, we’re lucky we don’t have to look far to see that spirit in action.
Just last  week, a room full of small business owners, proud families, and community members gathered in Spenard to celebrate the newest graduates of Anchorage Community Land Trust’s Set Up Shop and Indigenous Peoples Set Up Shop programs. These programs help entrepreneurs in underserved communities launch and grow their businesses, creating a ripple effect of community revitalization and generational wealth. 
But just as we mark this week meant to honor small businesses, the future of this work is in jeopardy. Recently, the federal government terminated congressionally approved grants that fund these very programs. That means Set Up Shop — a proven path to self-sufficiency for underserved entrepreneurs — may not continue in its current form.
And let’s be clear. This isn’t about government waste or bloated bureaucracy. It’s about breaking a contract. 
Imagine hiring a contractor to paint your home. They buy the paint, prep the walls, schedule a crew, and then you cancel the job halfway through and refuse to pay. Most people would agree that’s unethical, and certainly indefensible. Yet that’s exactly what’s happening to nonprofits like ACLT, who were asked to do a job, only to see the funding pulled midstream. The work still needs to be done, but the government has walked away.
We’re not just talking about line items in a budget. We’re talking about hard- working Alaskans who have done everything right. They’ve taken business classes, written plans, earned certifications, and opened storefronts, and are now left with fewer tools and less support than they were promised. When we don’t invest in our own people, we pay the price in other ways, with lost jobs, empty buildings, and neighborhoods full of untapped potential.
When an entrepreneur opens a new business in Anchorage they hire locally. They spend locally. They transform vacant lots into thriving storefronts. The economic return goes far beyond the individual business owner and it makes our city a better place to live. 
Set Up Shop has helped more than 500 entrepreneurs turn ideas into realities, and side hustles into fully fledged businesses. These businesses hire locally, pay taxes, and invest in their neighborhoods. That’s not charity. That’s economic infrastructure  built from the ground up.
We will continue to do this work, with or without the original funding. That’s what it means to serve your community. But we could benefit from you being with us. If you believe in the promise of local business and the power of neighborhood-led change, we invite you to consider supporting ACLT and, most importantly, supporting these entrepreneurs. You could visit their businesses, share their stories and help us keep the momentum alive.
Because when we invest in our neighbors, we all win — and that’s just good business.

(Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)Maryland Democrats reacted swiftly, and angrily, Friday to news that President Donald Trump had fired the librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, a former director of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore who drew raves for her work there.
White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Friday that President Donald Trump fired Hayden Thursday night because of “quite concerning things that she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.”
“We don’t believe that she was serving the interest of the American taxpayer well so she has been removed from her position and the president is well within his rights to do that,” Leavitt said.
Rep. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd said late Thursday that Trump’s “callous dismissal of Carla Hayden is a disgraceful disservice to all Americans.”
“We must call this out for what it is: an attack on our democratic norms and yet another effort to replace dedicated public servants with MAGA allies,” Olszewski said in a statement.

When she was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2016, Hayden was the 14th librarian of Congress but the first woman and the firs African American in the job, which has a term of 10 years.
Her term included the four years of Trump’s first term in office.
“Dr. Hayden deserves to serve out the remainder of her 10-year term and the country will be better off for it,” Olszewski said. “Congress must demand answers and be ready to fight for her reinstatement.”
Prior to her federal appointment, Hayden was CEO of the Enoch Pratt Library, a position she had held since 1993, according to her official Library of Congress biography.
Del. Samuel I. “Sandy” Rosenberg (D-Baltimore), who called Hayden’s termination a “Trumpian tragedy,” recalled her insistence on keeping the library open during the height of the unrest in Baltimore over Freddie Gray.
“The epicenter of the disturbances after Freddie Gray’s funeral was Pennsylvania and North Avenue,” Rosenberg said. “The library branch at that corner was kept open by Carla Hayden.”
Rosenberg said Hayden’s efforts “so impressed” then-House Speaker Michael Busch that he backed legislation mandating additional funding to the system for extended hours.
The bill, passed by the General Assembly, was vetoed by then-Gov. Larry Hogan, but that veto was susseqently overriden by lawmakers.
Roddy re-retires in Baltimore County
Patrick Roddy, a long-time Annapolis lobbyist, who retired in 2021 and then rejoined Baltimore County government this year, will re-retire at the end of the month.
A spokesperson for County Executive Kathy Klausmeier confirmed Roddy will retire from his position as director of government relations effective June 1. Roddy spent two decades in Baltimore County government as director of legislative affairs liaison and an assistant county attorney before joining Rifkin Weiner Livingston in 2003.
Roddy did not respond to a request for comment. In previous interviews, the former Annapolis lobbyist said he did not see his return to county government as permanent.
Klausmeier — the 15th Baltimore County executive and first woman to hold the position — tapped Roddy and his wife Valerie to join her administration just days after she was named to fill the vacancy created when Johnny Olszewski Jr. was elected to Congress. Both Roddys were initially named senior advisers, with Patrick moving into the county’s lobbying shop — a job he’d held previously. Valerie Roddy became deputy chief of staff.
The county spokesperson said Valerie Roddy will continue in her position. And while rumors of potential replacements for Patrick Roddy circulate, the spokesperson said a search is ongoing.
Five Maryland sites added to National Underground Railroad Network
Five Maryland sites have been added to the National Underground Railroad Network of Freedom Program.
The new sites join more than 90 others in the state as part of a National Park Service program aimed at promoting preservation and research of sites related to the Underground Railroad — part of an abolitionist effort that helped enslaved people escape.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“By adding five historical sites here in Maryland to the National Park Service’s National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Program, we are honoring the legacy and lives of the courageous men and women who escaped slavery through the Underground Railroad. At a time when this Administration is actively trying to erase American history, we in Maryland will never back down from this simple truth: our history makes us stronger, more resilient, and more prepared to never let the evils of our past repeat,” Maryland U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks said in a joint statement from the Maryland delegation.
The five Maryland sites are:

Goshen Farm in Annapolis.
Issac Mason Escape Site in Chestertown.
St. Augustine Church in Chesapeake.
Rich Hill in Bel Alton.
Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal, Susquehanna State Park in Havre de Grace.

“I commend the preservation efforts of the National Underground Railroad Network. Three of the new historic sites – Isaac Mason Escape Site, St. Augustine Church and Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal – are located in the First Congressional District. The addition of these sites preserve the legacy and bravery of Marylanders who sacrificed their safety for the freedom of others,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) said in the joint statement from the Maryland delegation.
The five sites in Maryland are part of 31 additions to the National Park Service Program. Currently there are 800 sites in 41 states.
Group calls for veto of “Earned wage” bill
More than three dozen advocates, including the NAACP Maryland State Conference, are calling on Gov. Wes Moore to veto a bill meant to regulate so-called “earned wage access” loans.
In a letter sent to Moore, advocates said House Bill 1294 exempts app-based lenders from state laws that “prohibit lending that is discriminatory, is deceptive, or carries extremely high interest rates.”
“The NAACP is particularly concerned that certain companies have written themselves out of the anti-discrimination protections embedded in the small-dollar lending statute,” NAACP Maryland State Conference Political Action Chair Ricarra Jones, said in a statement. “At a time when the federal government is openly working to dismantle hard-won laws and policies that protect people of color, these industry-proposed rollbacks are especially harmful for the people of Maryland. We call on Governor Moore to stand firm in defense of civil rights and equal protection under the law.”
Earned wage access programs typically come in two versions – one offered by employers to their employees and another offered by private companies directly to workers. Both versions are intended to give early access to a portion of wages earned but not yet paid. The amount is then paid back typically through automatic deductions, usually with a fee or “tip.”
Jones and opponents of the House bill say those tips amount to finance charges that often can exceed 300% interest, higher than the state’s 33% limit. Allowing the bill to become law “removes the last and best defense against predatory lending in the state,” the group said in its letter to Moore.
House Republicans want Schiraldi fired
House Republicans are calling on Gov. Wes Moore to fire embattled Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi in the wake of a troubling new audit.
A convicted criminal worked with children at Maryland facility, audit finds

The 75-page report from the Office of Legislative Audits found scores of issues with the agency that is responsible for incarcerating minors. Included in the findings was a lack of criminal background checks by contractors on their employees. One contractor, who auditors said was convicted of second-degree assault and possession of a dangerous weapon with the intent to injure, was still working for a DJS vendor as recently as January.
It’s the second time in less than a year that Republicans have called on Moore to fire Schiraldi. House Minority Leader Del. Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) called the audit “yet another troubling, but not surprising, example” of the department’s failure to protect  children in its care.”
“This agency has a record of constant failure in its basic duties, and they have not once been held accountable,” Buckel said in a statement released by the House Republican Caucus. “With the hundreds of accusations of historic abuse being lodged at the DJS, one would think they would have a laser focus on those who were working directly with the children under their supervision, but again, this is not the case.”
In its reply to auditors, the department said it is working to correct the deficiencies cited in the audit — which, it noted, includes only one year of Moore’s term in office, and almost three years under the previous administration.
“This evaluation took place almost entirely during the previous administration and highlights the state of disrepair the department was in when Governor Moore assumed office,” Carter Elliott, a spokesperson for the governor, said in a statement. “Secretary Schiraldi and the Department of Juvenile Services have spent the last two years addressing deficiencies left by the previous administration and this is just the latest example.”
Even so, it has become another flash point for the secretary.
“Governor Moore’s all-of-the-above approach to public safety is seeing results across the state,” Elliott said. “Juvenile crime numbers in murder, auto theft, carjacking and other areas continue to drop because of the work the administration is doing in partnership with the general assembly, state attorneys, local leaders, and advocates.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LibraryofCongress-2_20250509_JED-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-10 09:04:30.402003

(Photo by Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters)A three-judge panel of the Maryland Court of Appeals has ruled that individual donations to a political fund are private financial information and must be protected from public identification.
The May 2 opinion, by Judge Kathryn Grill Graeff, said that public interest in government transparency and uncovering corruption do not outweigh plain language of the Maryland Public Information Act, which prohibits the disclosure of an individual’s financial activity, no matter how small.
The ruling came in response to separate lawsuits by the Baltimore Sun and the Baltimore Brew, which had filed Maryland Public Information Act requests with the city for records relating to a legal defense fund set up in 2021 by Council President Nick Mosby for himself and his then-wife, Marilyn, who was Baltimore City State’s Attorney at the time.
The city Ethics Board ruled in May 2022 that Nick Mosby had violated ethics law by soliciting and accepting monies from donors and by failing to disclose his interest in “the Mosby Trust,” the fund set up to collect donations. (A circuit court later found that Mosby had not accepted gifts from donors, but upheld the finding that he solicited the donations and failed to disclose his interest in the fund.)
Along with its ruling, the board included a spreadsheet that listed the amount, date and method of payment for each donation to the Mosby Trust, but it redacted names, addresses and email addresses of the donors. The board said was required to redact the names under the PIA, which prohibits release of records that include information about the “finances of an individual, including assets, income, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, financial history or activities, or creditworthiness.”
The Sun and the Brew appealed to the Maryland Public Information Act Compliance Board, arguing that donations to a legal defense fund do not reveal personal financial information about that donor and are not subject to protection under the PIA exception on releasing personal information.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The compliance board agreed with the news outlets, ruling in September 2023 that merely listing a donation to a campaign does not reveal the “assets, income, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, financial history or activities, or creditworthiness.” To the extent that such a listing might be an intrusion on someone’s personal privacy, “on balance it does not seem like an unwarranted one given the public’s interest in election integrity and detecting political corruption.”
“Campaign finance activity, for example, is not ordinarily protected financial information. We think that donations like these—donations that are made to support elected officials in their political capacities—are much more akin to that sort of financial activity, which is commonly accepted as disclosable,” the board’s ruling said.
But that finding was overturned in March 2024 by a circuit court, which said the long list of things covered by the exemption clearly meant that “financial information” should be construed broadly. Even though “single donations, some in small amounts, ‘show little about any person’s overall financial position,'” it still qualifies as financial information and must be withheld from the public.
In their appeal to the Maryland Court of Appeals, the news organizations argued that a “single payment also does not constitute a ‘financial history or activities,’ which denotes a [series] of transactions over time from which one might glean some qualitative information about the payer’s assets, income, liabilities, net worth, bank balances, or creditworthiness.” And donors cannot have expected that their “donations to elected officials in their political capacities” are private, any more than donations to political campaign are private.
The Board of Ethics argued that the PIA law does not concern itself with where a donation is directed, and to argue that “a donation is not financial activity is patently absurd.” The state-held record “shows that a person had a certain amount of money (an asset) and that they transferred that money to another person or entity,” which is “plainly information about these individuals’ financial activity” — and, as such, must be withheld from the public.
The appeals court agreed with the Ethics Board, and upheld the circuit court ruling.
“Here, the language of the statues is clear and unambiguous,” Graeff wrote in the 23-page opinion. “We conclude that the names and addresses of donors to a legal defense fund do fall in the same category as the items listed in the statute” that are prohibited from disclosure.
While the news organizations may argue that the public interest demands that donors to political interests should be revealed, Graeff said that’s not what the law says, and changing the law is the job of the legislature, not the courts.
An attempt to reach editors at the Brew and the Sun were unsuccessful.
Nick Mosby lost his bid for re-election to as council president in 2024. Gov. Wes Moore (D) appointed him this year to a seat on the Maryland State Lottery and Gaming Control Commission.
Marilyn Mosby was under indictment when she ran for reelection in 2022, for lying on an application to improperly withdraw funds from her city pension account. She lost her reelection bid that year and was later convicted year of two counts of perjury and one count of mortgage fraud in connection with financial maneuvers related to the purchase of a home in Florida.

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.

“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.

A bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
Funding to help victims recover
Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.

In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
Underreported to police
Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.

Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

An Alabama grand jury indicted former state trooper James Bonard Fowler for the Feb. 18, 1965, killing of Jimmie Lee Jackson, who was trying to protect his mother from being beaten at Mack’s Café. 
At Jackson’s funeral, Martin Luther King Jr. called him “a martyred hero of a holy crusade for freedom and human dignity.” As a society, he said, “we must be concerned not merely about who murdered him, but about the system, the way of life, the philosophy which produced the murderer.” 
Authorities reopened the case after journalist John Fleming of the Anniston Star published an interview with Fowler in which he admitted, despite his claim of self-defense, that he had shot Jackson multiple times. And Fleming uncovered Fowler’s killing of another Black man, Nathan Johnson. In 2010, Fowler pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter in Jackson’s death and was sentenced to six months behind bars. In the 1990s, he served five years in prison in Thailand for heroin trafficking.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)After losing their bid to unionize the Amazon warehouse in Garner by a three-to-one margin in February, labor organizers with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment are challenging the election results, arguing Amazon coerced employees into voting against the union campaign.
In a filing with the National Labor Relations Board on Feb. 24, CAUSE alleges that Amazon misled workers into believing that they would lose existing benefits and wages if they voted in favor of the union, brought in a speaker who said the union would deport workers, and targeted pro-union workers for discipline throughout the election period.
“The Employer engaged in improper surveillance of employees, created the impression of surveillance, and interrogated employees regarding their Union support and Union activity,” the CAUSE objection reads. “The Employer selectively enforced workplace rules regarding performance standards and appearance, targeting known Union supporters for discipline and enforcement while ignoring similar violations by workers who were not known Union supporters.”
Though more than 30% of workers comprising the bargaining unit signed union cards in 2024 — representing the support of more than 1,000 warehouse associates — fewer ultimately voted in favor of the union, with just 829 voting in favor and 2,447 voting against, according to the NLRB. That left the union campaign far short of the majority vote necessary to win the right to bargain on behalf of the warehouse staff.
Eileen Hards, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment on CAUSE’s allegations of coercion, surveillance, and selective discipline, but expressed satisfaction with the result of the election.
“Our team in Garner overwhelmingly chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,” Hards wrote in an emailed statement. “We look forward to continuing to make RDU1 a great place to work together, and to supporting our teammates as they build their futures with us.”
In March, the NLRB placed the union campaign’s challenge on hold while complaints around the company’s conduct during the election period are vetted. Meanwhile, labor activists are gearing up for renewed efforts at Garner’s RDU1 warehouse as well as additional facilities throughout the Carolinas.
‘We desperately need the protection of the NLRB’
Since 2022, CAUSE has brought more than a dozen unfair labor practice complaints against Amazon, largely focusing on employee terminations, discipline of union organizers, and a general climate of surveillance.
The first of these complaints, coming in June 2022, soon after the union campaign’s formation, cited warehouse rules forbidding discussion of wages, hours, and other working conditions as an illegal prohibition on union activity. It also pointed to the end of site-specific COVID-19 updates, restrictions on the company’s internal discussion board, and the removal of a “web clock punch” feature on the employee app as impediments to protected labor activities.

The most extensive labor litigation pursued by the union surrounded disciplinary action against its co-founder, Rev. Ryan Brown, who alleged in 2022 that his complaints about warehouse conditions and racial discrimination were met with retaliation from supervisors, including a “final written warning.”
In a May 2024 response to the complaint, Amazon conceded that it issued the warning but denied that “such discipline was issued for any unlawful purpose” and was instead purely due to violation of company policy.
Arguing that the complaint should be dismissed, attorneys for Amazon went further than the facts of the individual case: they claimed the NLRB’s adjudicative procedures themselves are inherently unconstitutional, as board administrators are “improperly insulated from the President’s removal power.”
“The Complaint should be dismissed because the agency procedures through which the Complaint will be resolved violate Article II of the United States Constitution,” attorneys for Amazon wrote. “The National Labor Relations Board’s concurrent exercise of legislative, executive, and judicial power in this proceeding violates the separation of powers established by the United States Constitution and the guarantee of due process found in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”
Though Amazon was ordered in September 2024 — nearly two years after the initial complaint — to produce documents relating to policy complaints and allegations of discrimination that Brown and other employees voiced, the union withdrew its complaint the following month, due to the time and expense of the lengthy appeals process.
CAUSE has alleged that several employees have lost their jobs as a result of union organizing leading up to and during the election period, including Brown and Duke professor Orin Starn. Those terminations have continued in the wake of the election, organizers say, including that of Diedre King in March. According to CAUSE, she worked at the Garner warehouse for four years with an unblemished disciplinary record and was an “active, dedicated, and visible” member of the union organizing committee before she was accused of slapping a coworker during the election period, a claim she denies.
King said in the wake of her termination, she has received “amazing” support from other members of CAUSE. Organizers set up a fundraiser that has raised more than $5,500 for her as of Friday, and she said she also received a flood of calls offering support, even from colleagues she did not know before. “They call, they check up on me and see what I’m doing, get me out, get me involved in stuff — and not want me to sit at home and, like, be really depressed.”
Starn, the Duke professor, pointed to King’s termination and that of another employee afterwards as evidence of a “mass purge” targeting union organizers. A worker on the warehouse’s loading dock and an active organizer with the union, Starn was let go in December 2023 after a social media post in which he toasted the union effort with a sip of rum in the parking lot after work.

While the company cited its drug and alcohol policy as grounds for the dismissal, Starn wrote in an October 2024 NLRB appeal letter that he was instead let go for the “real and illegal reason” of openly campaigning for the union, one of just three workers doing so at the time.
“My firing damaged our effort by keeping me out of the facility and the chance to mobilize workers there, although we are making strong progress in our card collection nonetheless,” he wrote. “We desperately need the protection of the NLRB in supporting rightful complaints like mine to keep a powerful company from getting away with demoralizing illegal tactics in trying to suppress worker efforts to have a voice in the workplace.”
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, wrote in a statement that Starn’s termination was not related to his union activities and disputed his characterization of selective enforcement of the company’s drug and alcohol policy.
“The decision to terminate Mr. Starn was unrelated to whether he supported any particular cause or group. Mr. Starn was terminated for violating Amazon’s drug and alcohol policy, a violation that has resulted in several other terminations at RDU1 in the past,” she wrote. “We expect all of our employees to follow our policies, and we take appropriate action when those policies are violated.”
Ultimately, of the 13 labor complaints brought by CAUSE organizers, all but two have been dismissed or withdrawn — the most recent of those complaints, an expansive Feb. 7 complaint alleging a campaign of surveillance, intimidation, and retaliation by Amazon throughout the election period, remains open, as does a Jan. 15 complaint citing the arrest of CAUSE supporters on warehouse property in December. A Feb. 12 complaint that Amazon brought against the union over the removal of company posters is also still active.
A resolution to CAUSE’s election objections will come only after their prior complaints are adjudicated. “I have determined to postpone the objections hearing until I determine the merits of the related pending unfair labor practice allegations and whether consolidation of the pending objections with an unfair labor practice proceeding before an administrative law judge is warranted,” NLRB regional director Michael Turner wrote in March.
With President Donald Trump’s election, however, it appears CAUSE’s claims may well face an uphill battle with the NLRB. In March, Trump nominated Crystal Carey as the board’s next general counsel — a management-side labor lawyer whose firm has represented Amazon in labor disputes and advanced the claim that the board itself is unconstitutional.
Union supporters allege ‘a total fear campaign’
At the center of the ongoing dispute over the labor election results is the conduct of Amazon and the union campaign during the election period, from late 2024 to early 2025.
Organizers say Amazon carried out a campaign of intimidation and union-busting, culminating in the arrest of CAUSE supporters on warehouse property, while the company says the campaign went too far in its efforts to reach workers on the premises and counter company messaging, accusing them of trespassing and vandalism.
In their Feb. 24 election challenge, lawyers for CAUSE wrote that the thrust of Amazon’s messaging campaign was that unionizing would be “futile” and was likely to lead to the rollback of higher wages, benefits like volunteer and unpaid time off, and other employment protections that the company had granted in the absence of organized representation.
“[Amazon] threatened employees with the loss of benefits and/or pay if workers voted in favor of being represented by the Union,” the attorneys wrote. “[They] solicited employees to participate in the production of anti-Union marketing materials, and took video footage of employees to use in anti-Union videos without the employees’ knowledge or consent.”

Italo Medelius, a CAUSE organizer who worked the warehouse’s shipping dock, said managers and employee relations consultants would walk the warehouse floor, soliciting workers and discouraging them from joining the union. This was paired with a “Vote No” promotional video that aired on repeat on televisions across the facility’s lobbies and break rooms, which he said featured a former Teamster making the case that union representation would only harm the workers. “So just a total fear campaign, 24/7 inside of that warehouse,” he said.
According to a report by LaborLab, a pro-union nonprofit corporate watchdog, Amazon paid management-side consulting firm Road Warrior Productions more than $366,000 over the span of roughly a month to create anti-union materials used in the election, which the organization condemned as “union-busting services.”
“Amazon is one of the greatest union busters in the history of the world,” said Medelius. “They cover every single inch of that warehouse in some way, shape, or form with anti-union propaganda.”
Hards, the Amazon spokesperson, cited the extensive organizing efforts across Amazon facilities throughout the U.S. as necessitating the use of labor consulting firms. She pointed to “tens of billions of dollars in benefits” including health care, a 401K program with a company match, and pre-paid college tuition as evidence that investments in workers vastly outweigh the use of those services.
“We also know that there are outside organizations working hard and spending heavily to spread inaccurate information about us to our teams. Which is also why we work to ensure our employees are fully informed about their rights and how decisions about outside representation could impact their day-to-day lives working at Amazon,” Hards wrote in a statement.
Medelius also described an anti-union persuasion campaign that he said targeted Spanish-speaking workers specifically, which he said invoked racial stereotypes in an attempt to divide workers. Medelius, who is bilingual, said he was individually banned from Amazon’s Spanish-language informational meetings after speaking out against these tactics. He added that on one occasion, he was required to report for a random drug test minutes after speaking out at one of these meetings, an experience he said other organizers reported as well.

“The crazy thing is that we’ve been fighting for translation in Human Resources. So, if somebody that’s a Spanish speaker has an issue that needs to be resolved by HR, I have to go with them to translate for them,” Medelius said. “But when it comes to union busting, everything is in Spanish, so it’s kind of a little bit dystopian there.”
Starn recounted a town hall meeting in which a manager sought to associate CAUSE with immigrant deportation efforts to “raise fear and uncertainty” among workers and scare them out of supporting the union effort.
“At one of the town hall meetings, one of the mangers says, you know, ‘We’ve been hearing that CAUSE is telling people that if they vote no, they’ll be deported, and we don’t think anybody should be deported,’” Starn said. “This is a completely outlandish charge, but it’s the kind of thing Amazon does.”
This incident was also detailed in the election challenge, with attorneys for the union campaign writing that Amazon “coerced and intimidated employees into voting against Union representation by falsely accusing the Union of suggesting workers could be deported for voting no” and themselves “suggesting that workers’ immigration status could be impacted by the results of the election.”
According to Hards, employees came forward with complaints that union organizers told them if they did not vote in favor of the union, they could face deportation, and the comments during the informational session were intended to rebut those claims.
The complaint also alleges that Amazon took action against specific employees to prevent them from voting in favor of the union, including delaying a known union supporter’s return-to-work date until after the election had concluded. And it details a culture of surveillance in which workers’ social media accounts were allegedly monitored for statements about the campaign and where workers were “interrogated” about support for the union.
Many of these allegations were also the subject of a Feb. 7 unfair labor practice complaint filed by CAUSE that remains open, including a claim that workers were explicitly asked to report union activity to management and that Amazon selectively targeted known union supporters for disciplinary action.

These claims have been a persistent subject of CAUSE’s labor complaints long before the union card campaign concluded, with their attorneys writing in a May 2023 unfair labor practice complaint that Amazon was “instructing its employees to file internal complaints against supporters of [CAUSE]” and launching investigations against organizers to search for cause to terminate them.
The union alleges that interference with the election effort came to a head on Dec. 7, 2024, when three organizers not employed by Amazon were arrested by Garner Police on trespassing charges as they sought to pass out food and collect union cards outside the warehouse. Days later, Amazon also terminated Brown, the union co-founder, citing inflammatory remarks likening company management to slaveholders and labeling a defender of the company an “Uncle Tom.”
Hards declined to comment on the broader allegations of coercion and surveillance, but wrote that the company was within its rights to seek the removal of non-employees from its property during the Dec. 7 incident.
“Last December, several individuals who aren’t Amazon employees or partners came on to our property and refused multiple requests to leave,” Hards wrote. “After repeated attempts to remedy the situation and consistent with our standard protocols, we engaged law enforcement for assistance. Those individuals were eventually arrested after refusing to follow the police officer’s orders.”
She also condemned Brown for what she described as efforts to “push misinformation to the media” on his arrest and said his dismissal was the result of “repeated misconduct” including the use of “derogatory and racist language,” which the company had previously investigated. “His most recent violation resulted in his termination because we don’t tolerate that type of inappropriate behavior at Amazon.”

During this same period, Amazon alleges that union supporters tore down posters encouraging workers to vote no, labeling the actions as “acts of property damage.” CAUSE contends in its own complaint that scores of pro-union posters and signage from inside and outside the facility were destroyed — including signs posted in the break room and banners supporting the union hanging on the public sidewalk outside the warehouse.
Despite these setbacks, the card campaign succeeded in January after organizers collected signatures from more than 30% of workers comprising the prospective bargaining unit. But in February, they lost by a roughly three-to-one margin, a result that indicated there had been a falloff of support in the critical month leading up to the election — a result that Medelius said came as “a blow” in the moment.
“Ultimately, just looking at it, we knew that historically and logically we were facing an uphill battle from the very beginning,” Medelius said. “Everybody that’s a professional labor organizer has told us, you’re never gonna win the first time.”
‘This election hasn’t stopped the train’
On Friday, organizers with CAUSE once again set up their tents outside RDU1 — their first demonstration on-site since the election. As they renewed their pitch to workers, the company began work on a new eight-foot fence along the property line.
“My biggest fear leading up to the election was if there is a loss, or if there is a big loss with a big margin like what happened, that we would just collapse — that’s what Amazon pretty much hopes, right?” Medelius said. “But with us, I mean, the next day we had a meeting, that Sunday, and it was one of our most attended meetings. There were even people that voted no that were there and trying to figure out how we can build a better union.”

He described a mood of “optimism and hope” among organizers as the fight moves forward and called the 829 supporters in the warehouse a strong foothold to come back and succeed in the next effort. According to NLRB rules, a union campaign can file for a new election 12 months after the conclusion of the previous one. That means organizers could give Amazon “another Christmas present this year” with a renewed card authorization campaign, Medelius said.
King said she has heard from workers who voted no and who have had a change of heart since, pointing to issues like a wave of terminations after the election and excessive enforcement of policies like cell phone restrictions and “time off task” discipline.
“That’s why we’re out here today, to let people know that we’re still here,” she said on Friday, sitting under one of the tents to meet and persuade former coworkers. “We’re not going anywhere, and we have your back, but we need y’all to have ours as well.”
After the first election effort, Medelius said, organizers now have firsthand experience with the company’s anti-union tactics, giving them a better chance at countering their messaging among workers.
“Now we know the rules, we know what we’ve got to do, and we can come in with a better strategy,” Medelius said. “It’s kind of like a boxing match, right? You lose one round, but then you jump back and win the next three, so we’re very excited to do that.”

In particular, he outlined plans to strengthen CAUSE’s Hispanic Organizing Committee and day shift and night shift organizing committees, and to begin collecting authorization cards year-round. He added that organizers had been in contact with workers at the RDU5 and DRT8 warehouses in Durham as well as facilities in South Carolina who want to begin their own efforts, but declined to offer specific information about potential future campaigns, citing the need for secrecy around organizing strategies.
Benny Koval, chair of CAUSE’s night shift organizing committee, said the immediate priority was “what we can do on the shop floor,” pushing back on issues like excessive temperatures in the facility, post-holiday rush layoffs, and mandatory overtime days — one of which was slated to be on Mother’s Day before the company backtracked after employee outcries, Koval said.
“I feel like they’re just stepping on us to see how much we’ll take to a certain extent,” Koval said.
Meanwhile, efforts to unionize Amazon continue throughout the U.S., particularly across the South. In Louisville, Kentucky, workers at the company’s KCVG Air Hub are seeking to organize through the Teamsters, and in Bessemer, Alabama, labor officials have ordered Amazon to hold a third union election after finding unlawful interference in previous attempts.
Abraham Walker, a sociology professor at Fayetteville State University, said the South poses some structural obstacles for union campaigns. Every state in the region is a “right-to-work” state, meaning that workplaces cannot make union membership compulsory and all workers are entitled to the same benefits regardless of union affiliation, creating what Walker called a “free rider problem” in which workers reap the rewards of union-bargained contracts without paying dues to support organizing efforts. And because of the low rates of union membership throughout the South, many workers do not know anyone who is a member of a union, leaving them susceptible to misinformation about union impacts, Walker said.
  Labor groups from across the South came together to support the CAUSE campaign. Fayetteville State University professor Abraham Walker pointed to these ties as a source of strength for the union going forward. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
He noted that in Chattanooga, Tennessee, it took three elections before workers at the city’s Volkswagen plant voted to unionize the facility in 2024. Walker said a benefit of CAUSE’s status as an independent grassroots campaign is that “they’re not going anywhere.” He cited “very strong coalitions” the organizers built across the Research Triangle as a source of structural support that will allow the union to renew its efforts going forward.
“Despite the final tally, I see a lot of promise in CAUSE’s future,” Walker said. “There’s going to be a process of reassessment, I think, going forward. They will in all likelihood try to do this again — it might not be a year, it might be a few years from now, but one of the things about Amazon warehouses, which is both challenging and potentially an advantage, is the turnover’s high.”
The New York Times reported in 2021 that Amazon sees a roughly 150% turnover rate among its hourly associates each year. Medelius said this was a source of difficulty in this year’s election because many of those who signed authorization cards were already gone from the warehouse by February. But that fact can also be turned to the union campaign’s advantage, he said: many, if not most, of the 2,447 who voted against the union will no longer be with at RDU1 in a year’s time, giving organizers “a brand-new warehouse” for its next effort.
“All we’ve gotta do is keep our supporters, make sure that we keep telling them our motto, ‘Don’t quit, organize,’ and that’s the way that we’re going to out-organize them, so the plan right now is keep calling for an election — if we lose, do it again,” Medelius said.
“We’re going to organize as if we had won the election, we’re going to continue building our movement, and we’re gonna continue not just within RDU1, but all across the Carolinas,” he added. “This election hasn’t stopped the train.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P2080246-scaled-e1741104680670-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-10 08:04:14.162335

Capitol News Illinois (CNI), a nonprofit news service, is proud to announce three of its reporters were nominated in four categories for the prestigious Lisagor Awards. These awards celebrate journalistic excellence across Illinois and northwest Indiana, spanning print, digital and broadcast media. CNI's Beth Hundsdorfer was selected as winner in the Best Public Service category for her investigative reporting on funeral home licensing in Illinois.

The winners were announced on Friday, May 9, at the 48th Annual Peter Lisagor Awards ceremony hosted by Chicago Headline Club at the Union League Club of Chicago.

Capitol News Illinois reporters and their nominations include:

Beth Hundsdorfer:
WINNER: Best Public Service
“Funeral Home”
Investigative reporter Beth Hundsdorfer lead an investigation into funeral home licensing in Illinois. This was sparked by news reports of a Carlinville-based funeral home mishandling human remains. The investigation has since expanded to other parts of the state.

Hannah Meisel:
NOMINATED: Best Deadline Reporting (Small or Medium Print/Online Category)
“Corruption trial and bizarre pre-trial arrest of polarizing ex-lawmaker Sam McCann”

In 2021, Springfield-area lawmaker Sam McCann was indicted on charges of fraud, money laundering and tax evasion related to his alleged use of campaign funds for personal expenses. McCann would eventually reverse his position of innocence and in February 2024 plead guilty on all counts.

NOMINATED: Best Reporting on Crime and Justice (Small or Medium Print/Online Category)
“Reporting on the trial of former House Speaker Mike Madigan”

Meisel provided detailed coverage of the corruption trial of ex-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan from the Dirksen Federal Courthouse in Chicago. The former speaker faced 23 counts of racketeering, bribery, extortion and wire fraud. Jurors convicted him on 10 counts and acquitted him on seven. Six others ended in a mistrial.

Molly Parker & Beth Hundsdorfer:
NOMINATED: Best Education Reporting (Large Print/Online Category)
“No-Schoolers”
Illinois has virtually no regulations on homeschooling, allowing parents to pull vulnerable children from public schools and then not provide any education for them. Officials call them “no schoolers.”  Hundsdorfer and Parker have been investigating the issue for over a year.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State health and labor officials hope that new workplace regulations will help workers avoid overheating on the job, as Maryland enters the annual heat season on the heels of a deadly 2024 summer.
The Maryland Occupational Safety and Health division of the Department of Labor finalized new heat illness prevention standards in September, at the tail end of a 2024 heat season that saw 27 fatalities and more than 1,200 emergency room visits related to high temperatures.
Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu said there was already “a general duty to protect workers from dangerous conditions, but I think the heat-stress standard provides some really specific guidance to employers.” She said her department has been educating workplaces to get them “up to speed” on the new regulations ahead of the 2025 season.
“We have done a ton of outreach in both public and private sectors — industries like construction, tree care, warehousing, agriculture, restaurants, commercial kitchens, laundries,” Wu said.
Anticipation for the new regulations rose last year following the death of Ronald Silver II, who died Aug. 2 from a heat-related illness while working at his job with the Baltimore City Department of Public Works’ Bureau of Solid Waste.
The new heat stress prevention regulations require workplaces to have plans when the heat index begins to rise to above 90 and 100 degrees. The new regulations also prompt employers to ensure that workers have ample access to water and cool locations while allowing for frequent break times at high temperatures.
Workplace heat-illness standards finalized as deadly ‘heat season’ comes to an end

Wu admits that the new regulations are somewhat “common sense,” but said that the regulations ensure employers have an established course of action when temperatures rise this summer.
“I tend to think about it as ‘rest, break, shade, ease-in,’” Wu said.
She noted that the state is emphasizing what’s called “acclimatization,” which is a process to help new employees get used to working in hot conditions for up to the first two weeks of employment.
“People who have been working in hot conditions for days, weeks, months on end, their bodies are more used to it,” Wu said. “Somebody who started yesterday and it’s 95 degrees today … they need some time to get used to it.”
“That’s where we see the accidents happen,” Wu said. “We often have a situation where a supervisor may not be experienced in on-boarding new employees — construction is a good example.”
Acclimatization can also apply to experienced workers when temperatures spike suddenly, she said.
Workplace standards can only do so much, since many victims of heat stress may not be on the job – in fact, half of the fatalities from last year were of people aged 65 years and older.
Clifford S. Mitchell, director of the Environmental Health Bureau in the Maryland Department of Health, said that temperatures are trending higher and for longer periods, leaving those who are medically vulnerable more at risk for longer stretches.
“There are earlier hot days, there are more frequent hot days, and there are longer periods of hot days. And more importantly, we are not seeing the same degree of cooling in the evenings that we used to see, because of the greenhouse gas effects,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Because recovery time is also important, one of the things that we are seeing now is people who are in hot environments in the day and are not getting relief at night,” he added. “And that is a problem for people who are vulnerable, particularly those who are vulnerable medically.”
The change in federal administrations may also complicate the state’s efforts to reduce heat-related illnesses, as President Donald Trump (R) and his administration reduce the federal workforce at weather-related agencies.
“We rely very, very much on our federal partners in the National Weather Service and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) for high-quality forecasting, modeling and ability to understand exactly what is happening,” Mitchell said, noting that accurate forecasts help the health department plan and anticipate periods of extreme heat.
From a state perspective, he said the Department of Health will be “better prepared through actions like the new MOSH standards for employers,” which will add “structure and guidance for what to do when things are getting hot.”
“That makes it easier for all of us, because there are more people who are following those guidelines,” Mitchell said.


The 2025 heat season runs roughly from May through the end of September. Already, 22 people have landed in emergency rooms or urgent care, according to the health department’s Heat-related Illness Surveillance Report for the week of April 27 through May 3. The department will release weekly updates during the season on Wednesdays.
Ahead of summer, Mitchell urged Marylanders to adhere to standard heat precautions: take frequent breaks, stay hydrated and act quickly if someone starts showing signs of heat illness.
“If you start to feel your heart racing, if you start to get a little confused, anything that doesn’t feel right, you want to get out of the heat as soon as possible,” he said. He also urged folks to check-in on their neighbors in periods of prolonged heat, and to never leave a child or pet in the car.
“I say it every year, and unfortunately every year we see examples – never, ever leave children or pets in a closed vehicle,” he said. “We see completely preventable deaths in those settings.”
Generally speaking, Mitchell urged that “outdoor workers, student athletes, and everybody” should “take it easy in the heat” this summer.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024_march28_baltimore-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-05-10 08:04:14.162335
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-10 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Even in red America, clean energy is booming. But now, huge renewable projects are dead.","Ames Alexander, Floodlight",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/10/even-in-red-america-clean-energy-is-booming-but-now-huge-renewable-projects-are-dead/,"Political uncertainty under Trump has dampened the clean energy market, with nearly $8 billion in projects scrapped or cut back already this year.","This story was originally published by Floodlight.
Renewable energy in the United States has surged to unprecedented levels, with the combined power generated by solar, wind and geothermal more than tripling over the past decade, according to a new report by a network of state environmental groups.
The growth has slashed harmful greenhouse gas emissions, made the nation’s energy system more resilient and prevented thousands of premature deaths from power plant pollution, according to the report by Environment America.
But this progress faces increasing resistance as President Donald Trump in his first 15 weeks in office has begun to dismantle federal policies and spending aimed at slowing climate change.
It’s all happening at a time of heightened concern among environmentalists. Despite an international accord to lower greenhouse gas emissions, the atmosphere now contains record levels of heat-trapping gasses. All 50 states have warmed since the first Earth Day in 1970, according to a new analysis by Climate Central, an independent nonprofit group that researches and disseminates information about climate change and its effects.

Among the highlights of the Environment America report:

The amount of solar energy produced in 2024 — enough to power 28 million homes — was nearly eight times higher than a decade earlier. Solar power production increased 27% from 2023 to 2024.


Wind produced even more energy — enough to power 42 million homes in 2024. The amount of power from wind has more than doubled over the past decade.


Wind, solar and geothermal energy accounted for 19% of all retail sales of electricity last year, according to the federal data used to produce the report.


The amount of utility-scale battery storage in the United States grew 63% from 2023 to 2024 — and a more than 80-fold increase over the past decade.


Nearly 3.3 million electric vehicles were on U.S. roads at the end of 2023 – a 25-fold increase from 2014. The number of electric vehicle charging ports, meanwhile, grew to more than 218,000 at the end of 2024 – six times more than 2015 and a 24% increase from just the year before.

More than 1.5 million plug-in electric vehicles were sold in 2024, an increase of more than 7% over the previous year, according to Argonne National Laboratory. Nearly 300,000 new electric vehicles were sold in the United States during the first quarter of 2025 — an 11% increase over the same period last year, Kelley Blue Book data shows.
“The growth of these clean energy technologies is now clearly benefiting people in all 50 states, and they’re really providing the building blocks of a clean energy system free from dirty and inefficient fuels,” said Johanna Neumann, senior director of the Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy, which is led by Environment America. “And the more that we can accelerate the progress that we’ve seen, the better it’ll be for our health and for our environment.” 
Most of the states that have seen the biggest percentage increases in wind, solar and geothermal energy over the past decade are in the South — and most are Republican states, according to a Floodlight analysis of the federal data used in the Environment America report. 
Some of those states, including Mississippi and Alabama, still rank low in the total amount of renewable energy produced. But other right-leaning Southern states, including Florida and North Carolina, now rank above most others in terms of the total renewable energy generated.

Billions in clean-energy projects canceled 
For those concerned about climate change, however, a new analysis points to a more worrisome sign: Almost $8 billion in investments — including 16 large-scale factories and other projects — were canceled, closed or downsized in the first three months of 2025, according to the report by E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for sound environmental policies.
Likely contributing to the cancellations: market uncertainty and the debate in Congress over repealing tax credits and other incentives for clean energy projects. The $7.9 billion in investments withdrawn this year are more than three times the amount canceled over the previous two years, the E2 report notes.
“Clean energy companies still want to invest in America, but uncertainty over Trump administration policies and the future of critical clean energy tax credits are taking a clear toll,” E2 spokesman Michael Timberlake said in a statement.
The Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s massive climate law, extended renewable energy tax credits until at least 2032. Whether the Republican-controlled Congress will eliminate those tax credits is unclear.
“I think that market certainty has been stripped away for many of these technologies right now, and they’re feeling uneasy,” Neumann said. “And so it’s not surprising to me that we’re seeing a retraction in investment.”

A state education official tempered what he implied were exaggerated claims about investments in public education during a post-legislative tour stop in Pocatello Thursday. 
The Legislature did increase funding this year for public education — but debate over the amount continues between politicians, education stakeholders and the Idaho Department of Education (IDE).  
IDE staff directly countered Rep. Wendy Horman’s touting of $400 million in new public education investments, and watered down Gov. Brad Little’s showcasing of $50 million for rural school facilities. 
Some Idaho education groups concerned with state’s new public schools budgets, operations funding

Gideon Tolman, the IDE’S chief financial officer, did not mention Horman by name, but said claims of a new $400 million investment were “misleading at best.”
Public education’s financial gains were few but appreciated, IDE leaders said, during a 2025 legislative session that had moments ranging from surprising to heartbreaking. From a failed $3 million request for high-needs students to the state’s first private school choice tax credit, the repercussions led to a sense of gloom among the district leaders and superintendents who gathered at Idaho State University for a recap of the session. 
As politicians and educators scramble to craft the narrative over what the session meant for public education, Little held his own press event Thursday, where he said “it’s both our constitutional and our moral obligation to the next generation that we increase funding, and more importantly, have better outcomes for public schools.”

 The debate over Horman and Little’s claims

In a column for EdNews, Horman wrote that “public education received $400 million in new funding.”

That sparked frustration among education stakeholders who said the public schools budget provides no new additional state funding for anything other than pay increases and benefits for school staff, as Clark Corbin of the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
In response, Horman told Corbin that just $100 million in new general fund dollars will go to pay and benefits. The other $300 million is located outside public school budgets in the form of tax cuts and facilities payments sent to districts to pay down levies and bonds. 

IDE staff publicly chimed in Thursday. 
Tolman said there was a $100 million increase for pay and benefits — a fact stakeholders and politicians seem to be able to agree on. 
The other $300 million is not accessible to charter schools, Tolman said. For traditional school districts, this funding is either “very restricted or has been repurposed” — meaning it was already in education coffers, but got moved from one account to another. 
For example, Little has touted a $50 million investment for rural school facilities, a promise he outlined in his state of the state address. 
But that $50 million isn’t as new or accessible as it seems, Tolman said. 
Half of it had been sitting in a facilities cooperative fund, “which has been on the books for about 20 years,” Tolman said. To access it, a district had to run a failed bond or levy, and document a health and safety concern in the building.
Over the 20 years, only two districts have been able to use the fund — Plummer-Worley to build a new school, and Salmon to replace a roof.  School districts that meet those conditions can apply for and receive the funds, but would have to pay back the funds with state dollars they received for paying down bonds and levies, if possible, Tolman said. But, if the money isn’t repaid within 20 years, it will be forgiven. 
The second half of the $50 million comes from a preexisting bond levy equalization fund, which was discontinued in the 2024 session — but the cash remained. So this year, legislators moved those dollars into this new fund. 
That, Tolman said, helps illustrate why the $400 million claim is misleading — “because it’s repurposing funding that either was given to you and taken away and now given back to you, or was already in the account, or that doesn’t apply to charters.”
At a separate event held the same day, hours later, Little touted “an additional $50 million for rural school facilities.”

He also cited $85 million for increased teacher pay, and “additional literacy investments. 
While Little’s claims about public education investments were more modest than Horman’s, he seemed to defend her thinking when asked about the $400 million. “If a district receives money to pay for facilities, pay for maintenance, that’s money they can use elsewhere,” Little said. 
 Denied special education funding puts it at top of list for next year

Facing an $82 million special education funding gap, state superintendent Debbie Critchfield pushed to shore up funding in two ways — a new, student-weighted funding formula and a $3 million funding request for high-needs students. Both failed. 
The fate of the funding formula rewrite — a long sought-after change that legislators have previously pursued, without success — was likely not a shock. 
But IDE staff were “surprised” that the relatively small, $3 million ask “ended up being a fiscal hangup for some,” said Greg Wilson, Critchfield’s chief of staff. “It goes back to how these requests, however minuscule, require a high bar in order to get them across the finish line.”
Wilson said he knew the $3 million “isn’t a lot,” but said it seemed a “reasonable amount to get it through the (legislative) process and get something in place.”
Scott Muir, superintendent of Soda Springs School District, asked IDE leaders why legislators oppose additional special education funding. 
“As we see the rise in special education, and we cannot meet the needs, now we’re going to see advocates and lawyers stepping into the process and school districts are going to suffer for that,” he said. 
Tolman said some legislators are not aware of the $82 million gap between what the federal government provides and what schools need. 
“Other comments we have heard are, ‘Why are you educating special education students at all? Why are they part of the public school system?’” Tolman said. “There is a real lack of understanding or an unwillingness to learn more about the problem.”
“It kind of breaks your heart when you listen to the comments some of the legislators made regarding the students that we not only want to serve but are required federally to serve,” said Spencer Barzee, the IDE’s deputy superintendent for eastern Idaho.
Some legislators were also surprised by the high costs associated with students who might need a one-on-one aide, or who have feeding tubes or are nonverbal, Tolman said, adding that the $400 million in tax cuts may also have made it difficult to approve even small asks.
Wilson said increased special education funding will be a priority in the next legislative session. 
Little said special education funding is also a priority for him. But there’s a caveat — the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education could lead to increased uncertainty, and require a wait-and-see approach, he said.  
Little took a similar tack when addressing private school choice. 
When asked whether he planned to push for more oversight and accountability for the program, and whether he would advocate to keep its $50 million cap in place, Little was noncommittal. 
“We’ll see how the implementation goes,” he said. “We’ll obviously work with our legislative partners for next year. Anything is relative to what the budget looks like next year.” 
“All of those issues will be on the table,” he continued. “But public education will continue to be the top priority.”

(Photo by Getty Images)On Gov.Wes Moore’s desk sits House Bill 1294, which would give predatory, app-based payday lenders a legal green light to exploit Marylanders. If signed into law, it would exempt these lenders from Maryland’s hard-won protections against usury, deceptive practices, and discrimination based on race or sex. The governor should veto this bill.
HB1294 opens a loophole that would allow new, app-based payday lenders to bypass Maryland’s 33% annual interest rate cap. These digital lenders already operate in the state, often illegally, offering small-dollar loans with effective annual interest rates that regularly exceed 100% — way higher than even the most expensive credit cards. The Maryland General Assembly, instead of cracking down on these scofflaw payday lenders, chose to legalize and protect their harmful practices.
Entrenching these extractive companies in Maryland will financially devastate families. These lenders rely on repeat borrowing to make a profit. Borrowers are typically advanced just a small amount, usually less than $100, and charged high fees each time. These fees are sometimes disguised as “tips” or voluntary payments. The goal is to keep borrowers returning again and again.
We’ve seen this playbook before. In 2003, I founded the Mississippi Center for Justice to fight the systemic forces keeping people in poverty. One of our first and longest battles was against storefront payday lenders. These companies blanketed low-income neighborhoods with high-interest loans, trapping people in debt and blocking pathways to economic security.

We saw families struggle to repay one loan, only to be forced to take out another. We watched predatory lenders siphon away financial resources from communities, especially Black communities. These practices helped keep Mississippi at the bottom of nearly every measure of economic health.
Unlike Mississippi, Maryland has historically stood firm against payday lenders. But HB 1294 would unravel that legacy. It establishes a haven for predatory lenders to firmly establish themselves in our state and wreck the finances of our residents. By exempting app-based payday lenders from key consumer protections, the bill makes it more likely Marylanders will get trapped in debt, scammed, or targeted with an unaffordable loan because of the color of their skin.
Data from the Center for Responsible Lending paints a troubling picture. Over 25% of Marylanders using these apps take out 25 or more advances per year. Nearly half use two or more apps simultaneously. These are the same debt-trap patterns we saw with storefront payday lending.
The bill would also shield app-based lenders from Maryland’s ban on misleading or deceptive statements about loan terms. That means they could continue to obscure the true costs of borrowing behind confusing terms and hidden fees, all with the state’s blessing.
Perhaps most alarmingly, the bill exempts these lenders from Maryland’s anti-discrimination laws. That means app-based lenders wouldn’t be held accountable if they discriminated based on race or sex, an especially dangerous move given persistent disparities in access to fair credit.
At a time when federal consumer protections have weakened, especially under the Trump administration, which gutted enforcement at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), state laws are more important than ever. The CFPB has abandoned actions against payday lending apps accused of deception and against mortgage lenders accused of racial discrimination. Without strong state protections, Marylanders will be left vulnerable.
HB1294 lets an industry built on exploiting financial hardship break the rules. Friendly branding and smartphone apps don’t change the underlying business model: pushing borrowers into a cycle of debt.
I’ve seen what happens when predatory lenders are allowed to flourish — how they target vulnerable communities, make false promises, and leave people worse off than before. I’ve been fighting these practices for decades, and I can say with confidence that this legislation would give a free pass for abusive payday lending in Maryland.
Gov. Moore has the opportunity to stand with consumers, protect vulnerable families, and uphold Maryland’s tradition of strong financial protections. He should veto HB1294.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/money-1024x6781692353379-1.jpg,,,2025-05-10 07:00:29.336913

Sign up for their newsletter here.
For two years, Ember McCoy has been researching air quality and the gaps in data collection in neighborhoods in Southwest Detroit where mostly Black and Latino residents live. The project, part of McCoy’s doctorate work at University of Michigan, is suddenly at risk.
The National Science Foundation, a major funder across the world for basic research, was ordered by the Trump administration in recent weeks to stop funding and awarding grants.
“I knew that things were happening at the NSF. I knew that future grants were at risk. I think it was more unexpected that they would terminate existing grants,” McCoy said. McCoy, 33, has received $10,000 of a $15,000 grant and was notified April 21 by email that the rest of the grant was in limbo. McCoy is just one of the hundreds of researchers whose work has been targeted as a result of an executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion programs funded by the federal government.
The Trump administration, across federal agencies, in the past months and weeks has stopped paying out millions of federal dollars for programs and research  linked to environmental justice and racial inequity.
NSF director Sethuraman Panchanathan resigned on April 24 amid the most recent round of notices. “I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time for me to pass the baton to new leadership,” he said in an email to agency staff obtained by Science magazine.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on April 22, the celebration of Earth Day, that nearly 300 employees who work on environmental justice and civil rights issues would be laid off.


McCoy’s academic advisor said professors and students across campus in Ann Arbor were grappling with uncertainty while trying to continue their work. “We’re kind of in this sort of strange time where so much is happening, but also we don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Shobita Parthasarathy, director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program at the University of Michigan.
“The government, of course, isn’t just funding things. It’s also setting priorities,” Pathasarathy said. “And so you know, the private sector isn’t going to obviously do research like this.”
McCoy’s work included interviews with residents about current air monitoring techniques and when and how monitors failed to capture pollutants—including volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide—in their neighborhoods in southwest Detroit. Residents live near several industrial facilities in the area yet air monitors installed by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, which were updated in 2022 after requests from community members, don’t capture the extent of the community’s pollution burden, according to McCoy.


“That area is where there’s over 50 industrial facilities within three miles. … There’s a Marathon Oil facility. There used to be a coal plant,” said McCoy. “Those types of communities exist everywhere.”
She added: “They face really high rates of air pollution, or at least air pollution related health experiences like asthma, cancer or conditions.”
McCoy has worked or studied at University of Michigan since 2015. She said her current research aims to gather data and share information among the affected communities about pollution levels and risk. The email she received “did not say [why the grant was canceled]. It just said that it no longer fit the priorities of the staff,” McCoy said.
She wasn’t totally surprised. Earlier this year, she was startled to find her grant on a list compiled by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas of so-called “Woke DEI” grants.
She later surmised, from reading government websites, that the wording of her application may have been a trigger. She had cited “environmental justice” in her abstract
“It was clear on the FAQ page,” she said. ”They remanded grants that are associated with diversity, equity and inclusion.”
“I know they are keywords that are under scrutiny by the administration and so I imagine that they searched abstracts for those words and those that fit them were on the chopping block,” McCoy said.
Longtime environmental justice advocate Dolores Leonard has known McCoy for years. McCoy worked with residents in the area throughout her undergraduate and masters’ degrees study, Leonard said. “I was devastated for her. Devastated because I understood the amount of work that she had put in, 10 years approximately.”


“I felt her pain,” Leonard said. “Not only her personal pain, but all the work that she did to benefit the community, the people.”
Leonard lives near the Marathon Oil Refinery, an area where 80 percent of the residents are Black, 12 percent are Hispanic and 40 percent live in poverty, according to a Harvard Business School study from 2022. The residents in that zip code area, the study said, have higher rates of asthma, heart disease and lung cancer than in most other zip code areas of Michigan.
A resident for nearly 60 years in Detroit, Leonard said she suffers respiratory problems and McCoy has been instrumental in documenting the health risks for people who live near the polluters.“Of all the students I’ve met, I am most proud of Ember,” Leonard said.
McCoy noted that the Trump administration’s actions will likely have a chilling effect on researchers’ efforts. But environmental justice has a long history of perseverance, she said.


“This type of research, this type of activism and organizing around environmental justice has been happening for decades, long before this type of work was properly funded,” she said. “I know [it] will continue.”
McCoy’s advisor said the loss of funding will affect what future generations know about their environments and potential health risks. Funding—and this broadside of federal cuts—will change research tracks for graduate students and curriculums, Parthasarathy said.
“On some level, that is what current policymakers want, what the current administration wants,” Parthasarathy said. “But it is at the expense of better science and technology and public policy.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023.079_Michigan-Chapter-Visit_Heather-Wilson-04-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-10 06:05:29.133339

She reportedly collected more than $125,000 through the fraud scheme and used the money for luxury purchases, according to Attorney General Liz Murrill.
Priscilla Jackson, 40, of Prairieville was arrested Thursday and booked into East Baton Rouge Parish Jail. The Louisiana Bureau of Investigation started a probe in November 2022 after the agency was forwarded fraud allegations from the Louisiana Department of Health. 
An internal LDH audit discovered Jackson had underreported her household income, didn’t disclose she was married and failed to include financial support she received from her husband on her applications for Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits from the state Department of Children and Family Services, the attorney general’s office said.
The money Jackson received from the fraudulent applications totaled more than $107,000 from the health department and $19,665 from DCFS, according to Murrill’s office.
Arrest records the attorney general referenced indicate Jackson’s household bought a Cadillac Escalade for more than $110,000 and paid for a $70,000 pool installation during the time she allegedly obtained the benefits through fraud. Jackson and her children did not qualify for Medicaid from 2018-25, the records also noted.
The felony charges against Jackson include one count each of unauthorized use of SNAP benefits, theft over $25,000 and government benefits fraud.
There was no response to messages sent to two phone numbers listed under Jackson’s address.
Jackson’s bond was set at $100,000. Information was not immediately available on whether she had posted bail.

(AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)When 69-year-old Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost appeared on the main balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica for the first time as Pope Leo XIV on May 8, he was cheered loudly by the huge crowd of pilgrims, tourists, local Catholics and other onlookers who had waited hours for the first sign of white smoke and the official announcement.
As a specialist in Catholic history and ritual, I know how important this moment was for Catholics and others all over the world. A new pope brings with him a sense of excitement often mixed with uncertainty.
But the choice of the College of Cardinals came as a surprise to some. Prevost is the first pope from the United States, and, traditionally, the European-dominated College of Cardinals has had reservations about choosing a cardinal from the U.S. for fear of too much American influence in the church.
So, who is Prevost, and what might have influenced the cardinals’ vote?
 
Early experiences
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Prevost joined a Catholic religious order at the age of 20: the Order of St. Augustine, called Augustinians, founded in the 13th century. Instead of withdrawing from the world in isolated monasteries, members of this order travel as mendicants to aid the poor as well as serve as missionaries and teachers.
Prevost studied theology in the U.S. and Rome, and as a newly ordained priest he spent a year in Peru. After a short return to the U.S. as an official of the Augustinian order in Illinois, he returned to Peru as a seminary professor to teach canon law, the legal structure of the Catholic Church. He would stay in Peru for the next 10 years.
In 1999, he became the prior — that is, the head — of the local Augustinian province in Chicago and was later elected prior of the worldwide Augustinian order. This gave him a truly global experience, since the Augustinians had some 50 communities spread across every continent.
In 2015, Pope Francis appointed him bishop for the Diocese of Chiclayo in Peru. In 2019, Francis appointed him a member of several important Vatican dicasteries, or departments, where he became familiar with the central church administration. Most importantly, he served as prefect, or chairman, on the Dicastery for Bishops.
In fact, because of his lengthy pastoral experience in Peru and service at the Vatican, some commentators had noted before Prevost was chosen that if the cardinals were to elect an American pope, it would be him. His service on the Dicastery for Bishops was considered especially important, since members play a key role in selecting new bishops.
 
Global church
During the 20th century, especially after the Second Vatican Council — a series of meetings of the world’s bishops to modernize the church, ending in 1965 — the popes began to name cardinals from other parts of the world that were previously considered to be on the periphery of the Catholic Church.
This led to popes being chosen from outside of Italy for the first time in centuries. Pope St. John Paul II was Polish and the first non-Italian pope since the 16th century. Pope Benedict XVI was another non-Italian, born in Germany, who had served as a Vatican official. Pope Francis was born in South America to parents who were Italian-born immigrants to Argentina.
The College of Cardinals, which had few representatives from other continents until recently, is now much more international. Some 80% of the cardinal electors were named by Francis, many from countries that had never before had a cardinal.
In reviewing his record, the cardinal electors might have taken a number of factors into account. Prevost would be an effective administrator as head of the church and was an expert in church canon law. He had decades of experience doing pastoral work in South America, as well as in North America. And as prior general of the entire Augustinian order, he would likely have traveled widely to visit many of the communities he supervised.
 
Papacy under Leo
The new pope appeared on the Vatican balcony wearing the traditional papal garments: white cassock, short red cape, decorated red and gold stole, and golden cross hanging around his neck. Francis, on the other hand, had appeared dressed in the plain white cassock of a pope.
Certainly, he had not chosen the simplicity of Francis. Was this a sign that he would be more of a traditionalist?
His choice of a papal name, I believe, could indicate a different point of view. Pope Leo XIII wrote a groundbreaking encyclical in 1891, “Rerum Novarum,” subtitled “On Dignity and Labor.” In this he stressed the rights of workers to unionize and criticized the conditions in which they worked and lived. He also championed other rights the ordinary worker deserved from their bosses and from their government.

In his first remarks from the balcony, offering a glimpse into the direction of his papacy, Leo XIV stressed the role of Catholics and the church as peacemakers and bridge-builders, in dialogue with other religious traditions and cultures. His first words were “Peace be with you all,” describing this peace as “a disarmed peace, a disarming peace.” He further urged Catholics to act together “without fear … united with one another … to build bridges” through dialogue and outreach — to bring peace to the world.
He may not follow exactly in Francis’ footsteps, but he will likely continue walking in the same direction.

(Photo by Steve Hillebrand/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Alaska’s state-owned investment bank could get permission to start oil exploration work in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as soon as the third quarter of this year, according to court documents filed Friday in Anchorage.
In a status report on a series of lawsuits seeking to block oil development in the refuge, attorneys representing the U.S. Department of the Interior say the agency intends to issue a new document known as a “record of decision” that would cover oil and gas leases sold by the agency in 2020.
The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, the state’s publicly owned investment bank, was the leading bidder on several oil and gas tracts during that 2020 lease sale.
The Biden administration suspended, then canceled the results of that sale, held in the last days of the first Trump administration, but a U.S. District Court judge overturned that cancellation.
The leases remain suspended, but the status report — and a second one filed by AIDEA attorneys — shows the second Trump administration planning to reverse that suspension and reinstate the leases.
“Federal Defendants indicate that they are considering lifting the suspension, which could result in activities taking place pursuant to the leases in the near future,” wrote attorneys representing the plaintiffs, several environmental and Alaska Native groups that have filed suit to block development. “Given the President’s and Secretary’s direction concerning resource development on the Coastal Plain, lifting the suspension is likely.”
That would clear a path for AIDEA to begin seismic testing and other work necessary before oil drilling. 
On Alaska’s North Slope, most exploration activities take place in winter, when the region’s tundra is frozen and travel is easier. Federal action by this fall could permit work in the winter of 2025-2026.
Attorneys for the federal government and AIDEA have asked the U.S. District Court to place a hold legal on proceedings through Sept. 30. 
Plaintiffs, meanwhile, are asking for a prompt trial, where they will attempt to prove that the federal government acted incorrectly by opening the refuge to oil and gas leasing in 2020.

(National Park Service photo)The Alaska Department of Fish and Game said Friday it will resume its predator control this weekend in Western Alaska, despite a court ruling two days earlier that determined the program remains in violation of the state constitution.
The program, which is using aircraft to kill bears in the area used by the ailing Mulchatna Caribou Herd, will resume on Saturday, the department said in a statement.
In its statement, the Department of Fish and Game said Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin’s decision against issuing a restraining order that was sought by an environmental organization, the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, allows predator control to be carried out, as authorized by the Board of Game in March.
“The court order did not prohibit these activities or invalidate emergency regulations adopted by the Alaska Board of Game on March 27, 2025,” the statement said.
The program is needed to improve calf survival so that the herd size can grow enough to support hunting, the department’s statement said. “During the peak, this herd provided as many as 4,770 caribou for the subsistence needs of more than 48 local communities, as well as hunting opportunities for all Alaskans and nonresidents,” the statement said.
While Rankin declined to issue a restraining order sought by the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, she ruled that the need for such an order was moot. Her ruling, issued Wednesday, said the state remained bound by an earlier decision, issued on March 14 by Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi, which found that the program was unconstitutional. The Board of Game’s action two weeks later failed to address the deficiencies that Guidi identified, she said.
The Mulchatna predator control program was initially authorized in 2022. It started in 2023. Through it, 180 bears and 19 wolves have been killed, according to the department.
The program has been carried out during spring and early summer, the time of year when the caribou are giving birth to their calves that department officials say are vulnerable to being killed by bears.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance on Friday before the state announcement already had filed a new application for a restraining order to prevent the startup of this year’s predator control, along with additional information providing evidence that the state was gearing up to kill bears.
Joe Geldhof, an attorney for the alliance, accused the state of violating the judge’s order.
“This is so wrong on so many levels. And it’s now turning into a constitutional fight,” he said late Friday, after the department announced that its predator control will resume.

(File photo/Lex Treinen, Chilkat Valley News)Critics of a mining project that’s long stirred political debate in the Southeast Alaska town of Haines are celebrating an announcement that the development is on the market — just months after its owner acquired it.
A small, Vancouver-based company, American Pacific Mining Corp., assumed full ownership of the Palmer Project late last year. At the time, company executives and major investors touted it as an exciting deal that would provide a clear path forward for the project.
Now, in what mine opponents view as a stunning about-face, American Pacific’s executives are saying they intend to “transact on” the project and focus on advancing another development that the company owns, in Montana. 
The Southeast Alaska project is “outside of our wheelhouse, if we’re completely honest,” American Pacific’s chief executive, Warwick Smith, said in a call with analysts last month. 
The company notified state regulators this spring that it does not intend to do any exploratory drilling this year, marking the first summer the project will sit idle in several years. 
Palmer is now in a “state of transition,” the company said in its notice to the state. American Pacific officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Mineral exploration is a famously speculative industry, and it’s common for deposits to change hands, often several times, before a developer comes in and builds a mine.
But Palmer opponents still say American Pacific’s apparent desire to back away from the project signals a dimming of its potential.
“It’s a remarkable turnaround,” said Gershon Cohen, a longtime Haines resident and clean water advocate who’s concerned about the impacts of mining. “The project appears to be fading away.”
“This is a huge step toward protecting this valley,” he added, noting the Chilkat Valley’s wild salmon runs and huge bald eagle population. 
Other Haines residents have supported the copper and zinc project because it could bring high-paying jobs to the region. Gov. Mike Dunleavy toured the development several years ago. 
For years, Palmer’s owners have been drilling holes and studying its geology to determine whether a mine would be profitable. Some permits face legal challenges from a local tribe and conservation groups, and a mine would require additional permits from the federal government before it could be built.
The apparent setback for one of Alaska’s more advanced exploratory mines comes at a surprising time, when miners around the state are expecting boosts from high metal prices and the Trump administration’s pledges to accelerate resource extraction and permitting. 
Even amid their decision to sell the project, American Pacific executives have been advertising increased copper demand and the Trump administration’s particular focus on Alaska as potential tailwinds for Palmer.
Companies have been trying to advance the project for well over a decade. American Pacific bought a minority stake in the project in 2022. 
Development seemed poised to leap forward a few years ago, when the project had access to the deep pockets of part-owner Dowa Metals and Mining, a Japanese smelting giant. 
Dowa and American Pacific built a camp to house dozens of workers and initially appeared intent on drilling a mile-long tunnel under a glacier to access more ore — a step that observers said could boost the chances that developers would build a mine. 
But the tunnel still hasn’t been built. And Dowa, which spent some $20 million on the project over the past two summers, pulled away last fall, leaving American Pacific with full ownership of the project.
The Canadian company also received $10 million from Dowa, in exchange for an option to buy half the zinc produced at a Palmer mine if one is ever built.

	Palmer sits above the salmon-bearing Chilkat River some 15 miles from the Tlingit village of Klukwan and about 40 miles from Haines.  For years, the project has fueled political division in Haines, a small town renowned for both its rugged beauty and ideological rifts. 
Some residents see a mine as an economic lifeline for the Chilkat Valley’s rural population of 2,500, while others — including the leaders of Klukwan — view it as a threat to the valley’s wild salmon and subsistence culture.
American Pacific has not announced any potential buyers but is in the midst of negotiations, Smith, its chief executive, said on the April call. The company aims to sell the project to a company based in the state. “We think that there are better groups that are more well-suited towards Alaska than we are,” Smith said. 
The company expects to receive about $25 million in a transaction, he added.

NEWARK — Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested Friday and accused of trespassing at an immigration detention center, was released from custody hours after his detainment to cheers from hundreds of supporters.
Baraka, a Democrat, walked out of the federal building where he was being held just before 8 p.m. to the strains of “Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now” by McFadden & Whitehead blaring through speakers that had been set up by protestors.
The mayor, one of six Democrats running for governor in the June 10 primary, said he “didn’t do anything wrong.” 
“I didn’t know this morning when I woke up that I would be in this facility here, that I would end up incarcerated for something that I believe is my democratic right to show up and speak out against what I think was happening here, a violation of city and state laws,” he said.
He was ordered to be released by U.S. District Court Judge Andre M. Espinosa at roughly 7:30 p.m. Baraka said he was charged with trespassing and will have to appear in court May 15. He said Department of Homeland Security agents treated him “very nicely.”

Baraka’s release capped off a wild day in Newark that started with him and three members of Congress — Democratic Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver, and Rob Menendez — appearing in Newark to visit Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed immigration detention center that Baraka has tried to prevent from opening, saying the jail’s owner has not obtained necessary city permits.
Baraka said he was with fire officials Friday attempting to gain entrance to the facility, and videos show he was warned by federal agents that he would be placed under arrest. 
After immigration agents arrested Baraka, acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba claimed the mayor was trespassing. McIver and Menendez said Baraka was invited onto the jail’s property before he was arrested.
A scuffle broke out after protestors locked arms to protect Baraka, with Watson Coleman and McIver being pushed by immigration agents, videos show. Menendez was also seen yelling at officers not to arrest the mayor. 
Baraka was walked away by masked agents and plainclothes officers.

The Department of Homeland Security characterized the incident as a “bizarre political stunt.” It claims the House members were “holed up in a guard shack” with protestors while a bus of detainees entered the security gate. It also denied claims that Delaney Hall does not have the proper permitting — allegations at the center of a lawsuit Newark filed against the jail’s owner, Geo Group — and said inspections and fire codes have been cleared.  
Once protestors and officials found out Baraka was being held at an ICE facility on Frelinghuysen Avenue about 10 minutes away from Delaney Hall, the protest moved there — and grew. Hundreds of supporters and immigration activists stood in the pouring rain, relentlessly chanting for hours for federal officials to free the mayor. 
State senators, county commissioners, local council members, and politicos from nearby New York also joined the protest. Meanwhile, statements of support poured in from other Democrats who are also running for governor, while Republicans used it as an opportunity to attack Baraka. Baraka’s campaign also sent out a fundraising text while he was detained. 
During the protest, ICE agents peered through windows of the brick building where Baraka was being held, and a group of six agents stood in the parking lot, keeping watch on the crowd. 
Watson Coleman told reporters that she had been “manhandled” during Baraka’s arrest. And Menendez called it an “act of intimidation” to keep the public from speaking about the Trump administration’s increasing immigration enforcement.
“The fact that they pushed, physically assaulted two female members of Congress, ask yourself if this is the beginning or if they’re going to change course,” Menendez said. “I have no faith that they’re going to change course, but we will continue to speak out against it.”
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said on social media that while he was happy to see Baraka released, “the bottom line is he never should have been detained in the first place.” 
While walking with police officers down Frelinghuysen Avenue after his release, Baraka was asked what his next steps would be.
“See my children,” he said.

(TIm Bommel/Missouri House Communications)Missouri House Republicans unexpectedly refused to allow a vote Friday on a $513 million spending bill for construction projects, citing a desire to control spending for a move that was kept secret from Democrats in the chamber and members of the state Senate.
The move sank funding for major projects around the state, including national guard facilities, Boys and Girls clubs, and community health centers, to name a few. And it could seriously damage relations within the House and between chambers.
Up to the moment the House adjourned without passing the bill, this year’s process for deciding the budget had resembled years in the past where even major disagreements over spending priorities was resolved in time to meet the Constitution’s deadline for passing appropriation bills. 
House and Senate conference committees hammered out the details of the $49.8 billion budget for day-to-day operations over two days of meetings this week. Last year, no public negotiations at all occurred because factional Republican warfare in the Senate delayed spending bills in that chamber.
The major new spending items in the operating bills going to Kehoe’s desk include:

A $300 million increase for the foundation formula, the state’s basic aid program for public schools.
$107 million to revamp the child care payment system so providers receive their money at the beginning of each month for the children enrolled in their center.
$50 million to expand the number of children served by the MOScholars program, which helps parents pay tuition at private and parochial schools.
A state employee pay raise plan based on longevity, with raises up to 10%, plus pay increases for Department of Corrections officers who work in high-security and administrative segregation areas.

Only once, since the early deadline for spending bills was enacted in 1988, have lawmakers failed to pass any of the operating budget bills. Failure to enact those bills means they must meet in special session before the fiscal year begins on July 1.
There is no similar urgency for the construction bill, except for the organizations and agencies planning the projects it would fund. Gov. Mike Kehoe could call a special session to consider construction spending or let the projects wait a year to receive money.
There was no advance notice that the capital projects bill would not receive a vote. The final votes on the 13 operating budget bills came, for the most part, rapid fire. Only the bill that included the $50 million for the MOScholars program received extended debate in the House and it passed by the narrowest margin, 84-55, on a roll call that required 82 votes to pass.
Along with the operating budget bills, three capital appropriation bills were pending when the day began. One bill authorized $171 million for maintenance and repair needs, the second allocated $513 million to new construction and a third bill has $2.6 billion of state and federal tax money to continue projects first included two years ago.
The Senate voted on the capital appropriation bills first as it waited for word that the House had passed several of the operating bills. The Senate voted on each bill as it arrived from the House, sending the entire set to Kehoe’s desk.
The Senate was already adjourned for the day when the House finally debated the maintenance and repair funding and the bill to continue ongoing projects late Friday afternoon, just hours before the constitutional deadline. 
Only when the House itself adjourned without taking up the construction bill was it clear that the bill would die. The Constitution forbids lawmakers to consider spending bills in the final week of their regular session.
 House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton of Noel, left, speaks privately with Majority Leader Alex Riley of Springfield, during debate (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Noel Republican, said at a news conference that he made the decision after consultation with House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit and Majority Leader Alex Riley of Springfield. He said he did not inform Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican, of his decision. House Democrats said they were not told, either.
It was a purely financial decision, Deaton said. The House-passed budget, he said, projected the state would use about $600 million of what the governor’s budget plan projected will be a $2.5 billion unencumbered general revenue surplus at the end of the current year. Kehoe’s budget used about $1.1 billion of the surplus, but when the operating budget negotiations ended, the projection showed that about $1.6 billion would be spent.
During negotiations on the nearly 600 budget lines with differences between the House and Senate, Hough held the Senate position on more than 350, while the House version was chosen about 185 times. For several dozen, a compromise amount between the chambers was included.
On the majority of lines where differences occurred, the conference committee chose the higher spending amount.
“We had many things in there that we thought were good and worthy of doing and would have liked to have seen done,” Deaton said. “But considering what we spent in the operating (budget), I just felt like we couldn’t move forward at this time.”
The decision to shelve the construction bill was not because the House perceived it had lost in budget negotiations, Patterson said.
“We don’t think about Senate positions and House positions,” he said. “We think about positions from Missouri, I think probably had more to do with we sent them the bill on the 17th and then we received the bill back with about six hours left.”
Lawmakers have one more week before the session ends. There are major bills awaiting final action, including GOP priorities to roll back the abortion rights and the sick leave law approved by voters in November.
Patterson said he didn’t see any reason why refusing to vote on the construction bill would change whether those other bills pass.
“I have nothing but great things to say about how the Senate has been working this year,” he said. “I think they’ll continue to work like that.”
After passing the operating budget, the House recessed and Republicans met in caucus. That is when the decision was made, Deaton said.
“They had great concerns that I would try to be fair to them and not ask them to have to vote on something that they hadn’t had an opportunity to review and have input on,” Deaton said.
 State Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, speaks Friday at a news conference about the budget, surrounded by other members of the Democratic caucus (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
The action hurts communities across the state that were anticipating projects that ranged from hospitals and new National Guard facilities to major research buildings, said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
“My members and I worked very hard to fund vital services to Missourians in House Bill 19,” Fogle said. “I would like to deliver the promise and the effort that we made. And I know a lot of the majority party feels the same way. Looking through this list, there were members that worked very hard to bring dollars back home to our communities.”
Hough confirmed in an interview with The Independent Friday eventing that he was not informed by Deaton that the bill would not receive a vote.
“Am I frustrated with them taking no action and essentially then killing the (capital improvements) bill? Absolutely.” Hough said. “That’s frustrating for everyone.”
The Independent tracks earmarks — special items added to the budget proposed by Kehoe — and of just over 300 in the budget, 60 were in the capital bill that did not pass. Of those 60, 42 were in the bill when the House approved it.
“Disproportionately, they hurt their own members,” Hough said. “The majority of the things in that bill were added for House members, so that just doesn’t make any sense.”
As proposed by Kehoe, the construction bill used about $139 million of general revenue and about $186 million of federal funds and other money. The projects included $50 million to support a new research reactor at the University of Missouri, $55 million for projects on the State Fairgrounds in Sedalia and $52 million for National Guard facilities.
In the House-passed version, the general revenue was bumped to $216 million and new projects included $20 million for a parking garage adjacent to a convention center in Jefferson City, $11 million for a redevelopment project in Cape Girardeau and $6.8 million for a hospital in Salem. The smallest project added in the House was $60,000 for a county maintenance building in Dallas County.
The Senate accepted all of those projects and added 18 more of its own, with items like $10 million for a community health center in Barry County, $8 million for Boys & Girls Clubs statewide and $1 million for improvements at an airport in Washington County.
Because of the tight timeline for passing budget bills and House rules that make conference meetings impossible when the deadline is near, Hough had anticipated that by keeping everything in the bill when he received it, the House would accept it.
He said at the Wednesday committee meeting that approved it that he had assurances from Deaton that was the case.
“The trust has been eroded with the lack of communication from the House,” Hough said.
Deaton said he had not given Hough any assurance that the package would be acceptable.
“There was never any agreement, and certainly not one that we would just take anything if our insertions were not taken out,” Deaton said.
House Democrats, who had praised Deaton for running a more bipartisan budget process where they received a share of the earmarked items, said the goodwill of that work has been damaged.
“What Rep. Fogle was mentioning,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune of Kansas City, “about having not been clued in that this was on the table for the majority party, is a huge breach of trust between the caucuses.”

The two sides have been negotiating a new teachers’ contract for 18 months. In a Friday afternoon meeting, the Rutland Board of School Commissioners decided to impose terms for this and the next school year on the teachers’ union, the board announced. “The board has a fiduciary responsibility to make a fair contract that is sustainable,” Board Commissioner Charlene Seward told VTDigger Friday morning. “We don’t want taxes to go up, and that’s what will happen.

Rutland teachers vote to strike

May 8, 2025, 5:43 pmMay 8, 2025, 6:53 pm 



The union’s leadership objected to the school board’s vote, saying in a press release that imposing terms for two years — and not just one — defies Vermont law. They cited a primer of labor law provided by the Vermont Labor Relations Board.Seward said the board released two separate contracts (one for each year) to comply. She added that because Rutland’s voters approved an education budget for the 2025-26 school year, the board believes it can create a contract for that year.The school board and union had been expecting to continue working through the details after school Friday. But the board now says the imposition of contract terms puts an end to those talks.The teachers’ union’s statement said leaders still hope to negotiate and avoid a strike starting May 14. The union posted a photo of their negotiators waiting to begin Friday evening talks with the board, even though the board said the talks would no longer be happening. It is unclear when they will resume.Seward said the board tabled Friday’s talks after not receiving a response from union representatives to an email about timing. “Today(‘s decision not to meet) was not on a contentious basis,” she said. “We definitely want to keep talking, hopefully soon.”The negotiations have exhausted the tools for mediation set out in state law, which concluded with an independent fact finder whose report was delivered to each side last month. For the union, that meant the next step was deciding whether to strike. For the board, it was imposing contract terms for a period of one year. Each tactic is designed to force an agreement. The board’s new terms include a salary increase of 4.8% for the first year and 4% in the second year. It’s a step back down from the offer the board made earlier this week: 5% increases in base salaries for both school years, on the condition that a strike is avoided. They are also offering one additional sick day, rather than the fact finder’s recommended two.The union is asking for larger salary increases to keep teachers’ pay in line with their peers across the state, and in line with a living wage for Rutland. The union has agreed to the terms outlined by the independent fact-finder. The primary dispute comes down to what those salary increases include. The union is asking for a percentage increase over and above the annual step up in wages that would occur each year. The board is offering a percentage increase that includes the step increases. The board’s terms also outline deeper restructuring to these salary grid steps for incoming teachers. “Our hope is that they reverse course,” union president Sue Tanen said in the press release. “Otherwise, we will do what we promised – begin our strike on Wednesday.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rutland school board imposes contract as teachers prepare to strike.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rutland-High-School_Natalie-Williams-1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-09 20:05:19.630067

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House of Representatives has issued messages honoring high school sports teams, Olympic gold medalists, farmers, anniversaries, and even notable animals.
In an unusual move on Friday, it declined to bestow honors on conservative political commentator Suzanne Downing. 
In a 21-17 vote, the House tabled a citation from Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River that praised Downing.
Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage, led the vote to turn down the citation. 
“I have not objected to dozens of citations for people who had views strongly opposed to mine … I objected to this citation because there is a long record of outright dishonesty with this particular person, and it’s caustic in our discourse,” he said on the House floor.
When it became clear that there were enough votes to vote down the citation altogether, members who supported Downing asked that it be tabled out of courtesy.
Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, was the lone member of the House’s Republican minority who voted for the tabling motion. 
“I think that was the way to go, to not go down the road of rejecting a citation,” he said.
Downing, who has a background in journalism and Republican politics, founded the website Must Read Alaska in 2016 to spread conservative news and commentary, mostly in support of conservative members of the Alaska Republican Party.
In 2023, she sold the website to Jon Faulkner, a prominent Republican donor and owner of the Land’s End Resort in Homer.
Allard said in a text that Downing deserved the recognition.
“There’s an entire page in the U.S. Congressional Record dedicated to Suzanne Downing and her many extraordinary contributions to the state of Alaska,” Allard said. “She has obviously moved the needle, much to the irritation of a few Democrats. Zack Fields has been the target of some of her criticism over the years, and so naturally he is taking this quite personally. Sad!”
Legislators present on the House floor Friday said they couldn’t recall the last time the House failed to approve a citation for someone. 
In 1994, as an April Fool’s Day joke, a lawmaker submitted a citation praising conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, entitled “Honoring Excellence in Broadcasting.”
Several House members, including multiple Democrats, cosponsored the citation before realizing it was about Limbaugh, then voted it down.
“I’d rather see his very ample butt flossed with barbed wire,” said then-Rep. Joe Sitton, D-Fairbanks, before voting against it.
After Limbaugh’s death, the House did eventually vote to honor him with a citation.
On Monday, Fields noted that he voted for that citation as well as another posthumous honor for conservative radio talk show host Dan Fagan.
“Someone who’s willfully and repeatedly dishonest, I just I’m not going to vote for that, and I don’t think it’s appropriate for the Legislature to commend them for being willfully dishonest,” he said.
While individual legislators have occasionally voted against particular citations, it is extraordinarily unusual for a legislative body to vote them down collectively, even when the person being honored has been convicted of crimes.
In 1994, legislators censured Sen. George Jacko for sexually harassing a legislative page. On Jacko’s last day in office, they passed a citation that praised Jacko for having “a great sense of humor as well as the esteem of his staff and colleagues.”
Former state Rep. Tom Anderson was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the VECO corruption scandal. Last year, after Anderson’s death, the Legislature unanimously passed a citation honoring his life.
Legislative citations have occasionally drawn ire, too.
In 2008, legislators issued a citation praising attorney Wayne Anthony Ross. The following year, they rejected Gov. Sarah Palin’s decision to name him attorney general, marking the first time the Legislature had ever turned down a cabinet appointment.
“The hypocrisy there is quite glaring. I believe they need to be called out on that,” Palin said at the time.

(Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)Hilcorp has bought out one of the last small independent natural gas operators in the Cook Inlet basin outside of Anchorage — furthering consolidation among the companies that supply urban Alaska with the fuel needed for home heating and electricity generation.
Subsidiaries of Gardes Holdings, a Louisiana-based oil business, had operated the North Fork unit on the Kenai Peninsula — a small development that produces some 2 million cubic feet of gas a day, or a little more than 1% of the demand of Enstar, urban Alaska’s fuel supplier.
Gardes had said it was struggling to raise money to drill new wells, and its subsidiary, Vision Resources, sold its leases to Hilcorp in a transaction approved last week, according to documents posted by the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas. Hilcorp affiliates have also acquired a 7-mile pipeline associated with the North Fork unit.
A Gardes official, Mark Landt, referred questions to Hilcorp.
In a prepared statement, Hilcorp spokesman Matt Shuckerow said the company is looking to drill new wells as soon as this winter.
“Hilcorp is excited about the opportunity to further develop the North Fork Unit — a field that is largely undeveloped but shows potential for new production,” Shuckerow said. “Hilcorp is optimistic about bringing additional natural gas to market to help meet the energy needs of Southcentral Alaska families, homes, and businesses.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) “Shame, shame, shame,” a red-shirted group chanted from a Senate gallery after a full day waiting for senators to debate a bill impacting carbon sequestration pipelines. 
A group of landowners has been pushing lawmakers to take up the issue around property rights for four years. They, along with farmers and union workers in favor of the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, showed up to the Capitol in droves Friday, expecting to hear debate on House File 639. 
After breaking for a closed-door caucus after almost every action on the floor, senators decided to adjourn until Monday, without having debated the eminent domain bill or budgets. 
“You’re disrespecting our time,” a landowner yelled from the gallery following the pound of the gavel.

HF 639 would set requirements for pipeline insurance and permit limits and change the definitions of common carrier in the state to require hazardous liquid pipeline operators prove they will transport commodities owned by shippers not affiliated with the carrier. 
The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which was granted eminent domain by the Iowa Utilities Commission in June, would connect to nearly 60 ethanol facilities and stretch around 2,500 across Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska. The pipeline would transport sequestered carbon dioxide from the facilities to  underground storage in North Dakota.
Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, proposed a major amendment to the bill in committee, and an additional amendment Friday that removes many parts of the version passed from the House. 
Under Bousselot’s amendment, which must be approved on the floor, projects could seek voluntary easements from outside of the project corridor, which he said would allow them to avoid using eminent domain.

His amendment also requires the project operators to repair damaged land for the lifetime of the project. The Iowa Utilities Commission would have to make a decision on permit applications within one year and members would have to be present at hearings under the amendment, which would apply to all projects seeking eminent domain.
Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, proposed a strikethrough amendment Friday that instead added language similar to House File 943, to ban the use of eminent domain for pipelines carrying liquified carbon dioxide. 
“I guess four years and another day is what we will be doing again next Monday,” Sherri Webb, a landowner opposed to the pipeline said following the adjournment. “We’re just gonna have to wait another day, and it’s not right.” 
Farmer support
Farmers and biofuel advocates who gathered in the Capitol rotunda earlier in the day said the carbon sequestration capabilities offered by the pipeline would open the door to expanded biofuel markets, like sustainable aviation fuel. 
A number of farmers were among the more than 1,300 landowners who have already signed easement agreements with Summit. 
Kelly Nieuwenhuis, a signed landowner and corn farmer in O’Brien County, said he signed easement agreements with Summit for nearly three miles of pipeline through his property.
“We need to get this project done for a positive future for not only farmers, but the biofuels industry and good-paying jobs for rural America,” Nieuwenhuis said. 
Farmers pointed to low corn prices from lack of market demand as a strong reason for the pipeline, as it would make it easier for ethanol producers in Iowa to enter the ultra-low carbon ethanol market.

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association earlier this week published a study highlighting the same issue. While the ethanol industry had another good year in 2024, the study said the associated economic effects of biofuels were diminished by the “stagnant” corn market.
“This project, hooking these plants onto it, is going to change and open up markets,” Mark Wigans, a signed landowner and an ethanol plant president, said at the rally. “Agriculture’s in terrible shape right now, and we need change and this is going to give it to us.” 
Also in attendance were members from several union locals, in favor of the pipeline for the construction jobs it would supply.
Other business
The 110-day legislative session was scheduled to end May 2, marking the end to some per diem payments to lawmakers. The failure to bring an eminent domain bill to the Senate floor likely sets back efforts to end the session early next week.
Though the Senate did not vote on the eminent domain bill Friday, lawmakers did approve one measure, House File 856, a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion activities and offices in state agencies and community colleges. The Senate amended the bill to remove private colleges from the measure and returned it to the House. 
The chamber also voted along party lines to confirm three of the governor’s appointees – Cheryl Elsloo to the Iowa State Civil Rights Commission, Christine Hensley to the Iowa Board of Regents and Whitney Smith McIntosh to the state’s Human Rights Board.
However, there were several other measures on the calendar – including budget bills – that were not brought up for debate. Senate File 645, the economic development budget, Senate File 646, the agriculture and natural resources budget and Senate File 647, the education budget were not brought up before the chamber adjourned Friday.
There were amendments filed on these three bills to reflect the budget compromise reached with House Republicans Thursday. While these amendments are spending figures that represent an agreement between House and Senate Republicans, the majority caucuses in both chambers, the Senate would not be able to pass these or other budget bills before getting the support of the 12 GOP senators who pledged to vote against appropriations bills until the eminent domain legislation is brought to the floor.
Most of the spending bills for fiscal year 2026 have not yet been approved in either chamber. The House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to meet Monday, May 12 to discuss four budget bills. The Senate Appropriations Committee also still must hold a meeting to approve standings appropriations bill that includes the State Supplemental Aid (SSA) per-pupil funding for Iowa’s K-12 system, the House priority of $14 million for paraeducator pay, and other various state spending obligations.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)“Generational” April storms that brought historic rainfall and a record number of tornadoes to states in the Central Mississippi river valley like Arkansas were made 40% more likely due to the warming climate, according to a new report from an international coalition of climate researchers.
The analysis, published Thursday by World Weather Attribution, which is housed under Imperial College London, says the rainfall was “the worst ever recorded in this region,” with economic damages estimated between $80 and $90 million across the affected states. The vast majority occurred in Arkansas, which had roughly $78 million in agricultural damages.
Researchers, who analyzed weather data and climate models for the study, told reporters during a briefing Tuesday that it would cost Arkansas farmers $42 million to replant.
Meanwhile, the University of Arkansas System, which was not part of the study, came to similar conclusions. Ryan McGeeney, a communications specialist for the University of Arkansas System’s Division of Agriculture, said they estimated there were roughly $79 million in agricultural damages, mainly as a result of flooding.
The timing of the flooding mitigated the impact, McGeeney said. Winter wheat crops in the affected areas were a total loss, he said, while corn also suffered damage but could be replanted. The soybean crop was rebounding, but the jury was still out on whether the rice crop would be affected, he added.
In the grand scheme of things, McGeeney said, $79 million is a drop in the bucket compared to the economic impact of agriculture as a whole in Arkansas — $24.3 billion.
Bernadette Woods Placky, the chief meteorologist for Climate Central, which participated in the research, credited the National Weather Service for accurate and early warnings that likely saved numerous lives.
“Staff in local National Weather Service offices worked around the clock to provide life-saving information and services,” Woods Placky wrote. “This is an example of how critical these employees are and why recent workforce cuts risk undermining their ability to keep people safe.”
Multiple experts have raised alarms in recent months about proposals to cut funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — of which the NWS is a part — fearing that cuts to NOAA will hamstring the weather office’s ability to make accurate forecasts. 
Many local NWS offices are already understaffed, and a hiring freeze that has been in place since the start of the second Trump administration has left the service unable to hire the specialized technicians needed to repair its radar systems or to fill open forecasting positions.
According to the analysis, the similar extreme rainfall events are “relatively rare, expected to occur in today’s climate only once every 90-240 years.” However, in a cooler climate, the analysis found, “extreme rainfall such as observed would be even rarer.”
“Fossil fuel warming is clearly driving more intense, and increasingly costly, extreme weather across the US,” said Ben Clarke of the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London.
  Storm formation 

The April storm event was significant for a number of reasons, said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist and a weather and climate engagement specialist for Climate Central. Not only was it one of the most intense spring rain events ever recorded for the region; by the end of the day on April 2, the NWS had issued 728 severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings — the third-most ever.
The region saw “relentless” rounds of storms April 3-6, dumping more than a foot of rain on some areas, Winkley said. These persistent storms were part of what is called a mesoscale convective system — a massive storm that is larger than an individual thunderstorm, but smaller than an extratropical cyclone.
While storms in Arkansas and the southeast tend to move west to east, a persistent “ridge” of near-record-high pressure settled east of Arkansas and the other affected states. According to Winkley, this high pressure area forced a low pressure system (thunderstorms, like tropical storms, are often associated with low pressure systems) to stall over Arkansas and the other states instead of continuing to move eastward.
The high pressure ridge caused warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to be drawn into the lower levels of the storm, providing most of the fuel needed for the storms to continue to dump torrential rainfall for days, the analysis found.
The area where the high pressure and low pressure met — the “stalled front” — became the pathway that the rounds of storms travelled along, continually dumping rain on the same area for days because the front was stuck in place, he said.
Meanwhile, researchers said that while the states impacted by the rainfall event were not coastal states, the storm itself was helped along by historically warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, which increased the amount of moisture in the atmosphere and drove the storms. 
Arkansas town hit hard by tornado making progress

According to Climate Central, the average temperature in Arkansas last month was 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer, compared to its 30-year average. Rainfall, comparatively, was nearly 250% higher than average for the month.
Warmer temperatures and Gulf waters are contributing to more convective available potential energy (CAPE) days where there is sufficient instability and moisture in the atmosphere to spawn severe weather conditions, Winkley said. Northeast Arkansas, where the worst flooding occurred last month, in particular is seeing this trend, he said. 
An increase in CAPE days doesn’t necessarily mean there would be an increase in severe thunderstorms or tornadoes, just that the potential for those storms to form was occurring more frequently.
He did, however, say that when storms did form, they tended to be much more severe.
Arkansas has been hammered by severe weather in recent years. Numerous tornadoes devastated communities in 2023, 2024 and 2025, including in Little Rock, while severe river and flash flooding has occurred on multiple occasions in the last 12 months. June 2023 saw weeks of persistent severe weather, with damaging straight-line winds and hailstorms that dropped hailstones as large as four inches. 
While some federal assistance to respond to last month’s flooding was approved, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is appealing the Trump administration’s denial of assistance for those affected by an earlier round of storms in March. That line of storms spawned multiple violent tornadoes that tore through Cave City and other, smaller towns in the region. 
The denial of federal aid comes as the Trump administration debates eliminating FEMA, which has disbursed billions of federal aid in the wake of natural disasters to affected communities. Meanwhile, the administration announced Thursday that it would stop tracking the costs of the most expensive natural disasters.

The recommendation would allow 20 libraries currently ineligible for state funds to receive the money.

Board member Lupe Peña de Martinez listens. (Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas State Library Board members on Friday voted to recommend a 10.39% across-the-board cut in state aid to public libraries in fiscal 2026, which starts July 1.
The recommendation would allow 20 libraries currently ineligible for state funds to receive the money. State Librarian Jennifer Chilcoat presented the proposal as one option for complying with a 2023 state appropriation bill that called for new eligibility criteria to be adopted by July 1, 2024. The current State Library appropriation act now calls for the new rules to be adopted by July 1, but the rulemaking process has been stalled for more than a year.
The board also approved $1,386,177 in fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter state aid payments to currently eligible libraries.
Friday marked the last meeting of the Library Board’s current members, and it will be up to a new seven-member board to decide this summer whether to follow the recommended reduction in funds. The cut is necessary to stay within the State Library’s fiscal 2026 appropriation, Chilcoat said.
Act 903 of 2025 ends the terms of the current board members and requires Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appoint new members in August.
The board’s next quarterly meeting would fall in August, which would also be when the board typically awards the first-quarter state aid payments to eligible libraries.
Current eligibility standards for state aid require public libraries to be supported by a one-mill county or city property tax. Language in the 2023 State Library appropriation bill, and each subsequent year’s appropriation, calls on the board to establish new rules that “allow a public library to adequately demonstrate a source of revenue in lieu of the requirement to maintain a one-mill county or city property tax.”
Chilcoat told board members Friday that her proposal would allow the agency to comply with that language in the absence of the new eligibility rules and stay within its $5,641,919 appropriation for fiscal 2026. The 10.39% cut would be a one-time distribution formula, she said, totaling $5,641,180.
Some Arkansas libraries still waiting new state funding rules now a year overdue

Chilcoat also presented another proposal, which would eliminate the $18,000 awarded to library directors who hold master’s of library science degrees, but said she preferred the across-the-board cut as “more fair” to everyone, especially smaller libraries.
Either proposal would include 20 libraries not currently eligible for state aid, 11 of them in Benton County, where libraries tend to be local and supported by their local governments, Chilcoat said.
Another library on that list is the one in Ash Flat. Republican Sen. John Payton of Wilburn specifically mentioned that library when he proposed adding language to the 2023 State Library appropriation bill to revamp the eligibility rules.
Payton said he wanted to help constituents in Ash Flat, which has a population of just over 1,100 and a library funded by the city government.
“We want [libraries] to receive local support,” Payton told a Joint Budget subcommittee at the time. “We don’t want them dependent on the grants and aid that might come through the State Library system, but it’s impossible for them to pass and maintain one mill if they’re a city of less than 5,000.”
Eligibility for state aid would also allow the Ash Flat Library to apply for state and federal grants it currently cannot access, Terry Hill, chairman of the library’s governing board, told the Advocate.
Five of the board’s seven members attended Friday’s meeting virtually: Chairwoman Deborah Knox of Mountain Home, Jo Ann Campbell of Fort Smith, Pamela Meridith of Cherokee Village, Shari Bales of Hot Springs and Sydney McKenzie of Rogers. Only Lupe Peña de Martinez of Mabelvale attended in person.
The board’s most controversial member, former state senator Jason Rapert, was not present. Rapert, founder of a national Christian organization of state legislators, has repeatedly called for depriving funds to libraries that have “sexually explicit” books where children can see them as well as libraries affiliated with the American Library Association. He’s also called for defunding libraries that sued the state over Act 372 of 2023.
Rapert supported legislative efforts this year to change or eliminate the State Library Board.

But the arts institute is the oldest and expects to welcome about 190 high school students this summer.The arts funding is now gone, said Binginot, who works as the outreach and communications manager for the institute that published a public appeal for donations on Thursday.From local libraries and community theater to summer camps, performing arts and the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, letters from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities announcing federal rollbacks have struck a rude blow to statewide programming.The cuts have a serious impact across Vermont and across the nation, said Susan Evans McClure, executive director of the Vermont Arts Council, who moderated a discussion with a call to action hosted by U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., at the Chandler Center for the Arts in Randolph Friday afternoon.U.S. Rep.

In his first term, President Donald Trump tried to close the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.The loss of critical federal grant funding has left organizations across Vermont reeling since they received the funding termination notices.Affected organizations include Acorn Youth Crafts, the Fletcher Free Library and the Flynn in Burlington, Shelburne Museum, Henry Sheldon Museum in Middlebury, Vermont Works for Women, Vermont Folklife and the Vermont Symphony Orchestra.People visit the grounds of the Shelburne Museum including the Colchester Reef Lighthouse on Aug. 6, 2020. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont Humanities, which relies on federal funding for about 42% of its annual budget, has lost about $800,000 for the rest of the year, according to Executive Director Christopher Kaufman Ilstrup, who represented the organization Friday in Randolph.The group has lost two full-time positions and is revising its budget, looking for other sources and matches for an emergency federal fund that has since emerged, he said.“It’s very discouraging to have this attack happen on federal funding,” he said. “We do know that Vermonters care deeply about the arts and humanities and they are stepping up, but there’s no way to replace that federal funding with resources from within our community, which is why we’re having to change our budget.”Funding for three of the Flynn’s dance performances, two of which have already taken place, has been scrapped, according to the letter they received last week, said Executive Director Jay Wahl, who put out an advocacy appeal on social media soon after.“The NEA is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President. Consequently, we are terminating awards that fall outside these new priorities,” the letter he received stated, rescinding $25,000 that supported the 2024-25 season’s October performances of Ballet Hispanic, the April 15 Complexions Contemporary Ballet show, and the upcoming May 27 Agathe and Adrien performance called “N.Ormes.”The nonprofit typically receives between $20,000 and $30,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts annually.“It is alarming to me that our commitment to support dance and the human body in all its forms no longer aligns with the goals of this administration,” Wahl said. “It’s not going to stop our commitment to audiences and artists, that’s just who we are. We’ll just figure it out.”The letter was a complete surprise for Miranda Miller, director of Acorn Youth Arts, based in East Corinth. The $10,000 National Endowment for the Humanities grant it had secured would have helped create a literary arts program for youth in Orange and Washington counties and across Vermont.“We had created our promotional materials and were in the process of sending them out to school principals to recruit youth when we got the notice. So that just sort of stopped everything in our tracks,” she said.The Fletcher Free Library in Burlington in 2020.

The rollback has caused chaos as officials scramble to find alternate funding, Binginot said.“Terminating federal funding for arts and culture organizations, with little or no notice, has a negative impact on our state’s creative economy and means that Vermonters will have less access to the arts at a time when we need them the most,” Evans McClure said in an email.The Vermont Arts Council has grant funding available, and she encouraged arts organizations to apply.Despite the recent cuts and rollbacks, speakers at the meeting in Randolph remained hopeful and called for public action on the arts and humanities in the face of ongoing threats and defunding by the Trump administration.Leaders of organizations discussed the recent loss of federal funding with a call to action to support the arts and humanities in Vermont at a conversation hosted by U.S. Rep.

Kaufman Ilstrup said he expects to see more opposition to the cutbacks and more organizing for the arts and the humanities in Vermont and beyond.“People are fired up.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — God and religion “may” have a new path into Nebraska’s public schools after the Education Committee on Friday sent a package to the legislative floor that includes a revamped “release time” proposal.
The package’s most controversial part was its inclusion of State Sen. Loren Lippincott’s Legislative Bill 550, which would let students be excused during the school day for off-site religious instruction and coursework.
Religion in schools
Christian education organization Lifewise Academy, with ties to the populist right, is lobbying for similar bills in conservative-led states nationally. Lippincott has acknowledged the group’s influence on the issue.

He was pleased that the bill made it out of committee Friday with “a few minor changes” and said he hoped lawmakers would give it a chance. Amendments adopted Friday essentially watered it down to existing law.
“We’ll see what happens once it gets on the floor,” said Lippincott, of Central City.
Committee members had battled back and forth for weeks on whether to include Lippincott’s proposal in a bill largely built around Omaha State Sen. Ashlei Spivey’s former LB 440 to boost paid leave for teachers.
Spivey’s bill
The Spivey bill would give teachers up to three weeks of paid leave to deal with significant life events and pay for it using a new payroll fee on teacher salaries to cover the costs of paying long-term substitutes. The fee also would help pay for special education teacher recruitment and retention.
The importance of that underlying bill to teachers, now in LB 306, put the Nebraska State Education Association on the same side as some of the Legislature’s members who want more Christianity in schools. Also part of the deal was the Legislature’s Retirement Systems Committee.

Tim Royers, president of the NSEA, had no immediate comment on the bill’s advancement. He had said earlier Friday that his union was only willing to accept Lippincott’s “release time” bill if allowing students to leave school for religious instruction was optional, not required.
As such, the committee amended Lippincott’s part of the package to change its “shall” language to a “may” on the requirement that schools let students leave. Other changes clarified that they had to leave for at least 42 minutes and that they couldn’t miss core classes.
Proposal aimed at getting more religion in Nebraska schools sidetracks Ed Committee

The three amendments to Lippincott’s proposal are a big reason why the bill secured at least six votes to get out of committee — and might get a seventh. It needed five to advance to the legislative floor.
Republican State Sens. Dave Murman of Glenvil, the chair, Jana Hughes of Seward, the vice chair, Dan Lonowski of Hastings, Glen Meyer of Pender and Rita Sanders of Bellevue all voted to advance the package.
Progressive split
Democratic State Sen. Margo Juarez of South Omaha voted yes as well. The lone no vote came from progressive nonpartisan State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who warned about the door to more religious bills in schools.

Hunt acknowledged that Lippincott’s bill does not change the process for students leaving under current law — parents can sign a kid out for any reason — but the proposal endorses what she called “missionary work.”
She said the organization behind the bill, Lifewise, brings a bus for students and entices them with a popcorn party or other incentives to grow membership. Students left behind feel pressured, she said.
Lonowski said he didn’t see Lifewise getting involved in Nebraska, but that he might be wrong. Hunt said he was wrong. Jesse Vohwinkel, LifeWise Academy’s Vice President of Growth, testified in favor of Lippincott’s bill during its public hearing in February. 
GOP senator calls proposal pragmatic
Lonowski said the bill was pragmatic, as public schools are losing students when families want religion. Murman said it gives parents and school boards “a little bit of cover” to get the programs off the ground.

Juarez said if other religions were not allowed, she would oppose the bill. She noted Satanists have already said they would use provisions of Lippincott’s original bill if it required schools to open doors to groups.
Given the time constraints of budget bills and the likelihood of the education bill facing a filibuster, Speaker John Arch will have to decide whether scheduling the bill is worth the floor time. 
Arch said late Friday that he would need to wait until the bill is officially reported out of committee and he has a chance to review it to determine whether to schedule it. The committee was holding open its vote until Monday to let State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln weigh in.

Sen. Chuck Grassley and Rep. Ashley Hinson, both Republicans, helped introduced the “More Opportunities for Moms to Succeed” (MOMS) Act in the Senate and House respectively, legislation that they said would help provide more services and support for expecting and new mothers.
The legislation would create a grant system for nonprofit entities that provide support and assistance for prenatal and postpartum care, as well as support during early childhood, with a focus on providing funding for support and equipment for prenatal care options in rural areas, including telehealth options.

Grassley said the measure would help encourage and aid parents both before and after the birth of their child.
“Parenthood is a blessing, and it’s critical that women have the support they need during this crucial time,” Grassley said in a statement. “Our legislation would expand access for moms looking for resources and services in their area. I’m proud to be pro-life, pro-mother and pro-family.”
The proposal is similar to the MOMS program approved by the Iowa Legislature and Gov. Kim Reynolds in 2022 that provides funding for maternal care nonprofits that encourage alternatives to abortion. This state program has faced criticism from Democrats and reproductive care advocates who said state money is going to “crisis pregnancy centers,” nonprofit entities that some former patients have said shared inaccurate information and misrepresented themselves as licensed medical providers.
Democrats in U.S. Congress have criticized previous attempts to make a federal MOMS program along similar lines, with a group of female Democratic senators saying in a 2024 statement the proposal would encourage pregnant women “to register their pregnancies with the government in order to push them toward anti-abortion propaganda and dangerous crisis pregnancy centers.”
The 2025 bill is backed by several anti-abortion groups, including Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, the March for Life Action, and the National Right to Life Committee, according to a news release by Grassley on the bill.
Hinson said in a statement that she supported the measure as a way to “save moms and babies and help advance a culture of life of America.”
“When a woman finds out she is pregnant, she should be surrounded with resources and support, and feel confident in her access to care,” Hinson said. “I’m proud to co-lead the MOMS Act to help more women choose life, have a healthy pregnancy, and create the foundation for strong families.”
Nunn tours MercyOne Medical Center, promotes protection for Medicaid, SNAP
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, representing Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, introduced a resolution May 2 that he said will help protect Medicaid and SNAP benefits for some individuals during upcoming budget negotiations.
The proposed “Defending Medicaid and SNAP Resolution” would prohibit consideration of budget reconciliation bills that reduce Medicaid or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits or enrollment for people age 19 or younger, age 65 or older, pregnant women and individuals with disabilities. The rule would apply to budget reconciliation bills and related amendments and reports during the current term of Congress.
Nunn said this provision would help ensure people in the most need of assistance retain access to these public benefit programs while still allowing Congress to “address abuse, reduce improper payments, and enhance program integrity,” according to a news release on the proposal.
The Iowa Republican said the bill will provide some protections for Iowans receiving assistance through SNAP and Medicaid, but would allow Republicans to move forward with efforts they say will help address fraud and abuse of these public programs.
In a news release on the resolution, Nunn cited two figures — a Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimate that between $233 billion and $521 billion was lost to fraud in programs including Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and Social Security between fiscal years 2018 and 2022, and a report from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of an improper payment rate of 5.09% for Medicaid in fiscal year 2024 — as evidence that there was a need for Congress to address abuse in these systems.
“Every dollar lost to an improper payment or a criminal scamming the system takes resources away from Iowans who need these programs to put food on the table or access healthcare,” Nunn said in a statement. “The mission we have in front of us in the budget process is to find and eliminate fraud while protecting benefits for those who deserve them. President Trump has endorsed this vision, and I’m proud to fight for it in Congress.”
Nunn, and many other Republicans in Congress, have faced heavy criticism over cuts to federal programs and proposed reductions in federal spending on programs, including Medicaid.
However, Nunn said he supports continuing to provide Medicaid and SNAP for Iowans who are in need. He visited MercyOne Medical Center in Des Moines on May 2 and published a video speaking with Drs. Hijinio Carreon and Mustafa Eldadah at the facility. He said he was committed to making sure funding for these programs was being used in a way that “truly helps those most in need — those families, those with urgent need and those who are vulnerable members of our society, from birth through death.”
Eldadah, a pediatrician at MercyOne, said he serves many families in the Des Moines metro who would not be able access needed services without Medicaid.
“We have many families that rely on Medicaid as their source of medical coverage, and we appreciate that service,” Eldadah said. “And we always feel like those patients cannot be taken care of without that benefit or coverage — so definitely, we appreciate any efforts to maintain that service to our patients.”
Nunn said in a statement his conversations with doctors and patients showed “why defending these critical programs is so important, and how my legislation will ensure D.C. cuts do not impact vulnerable Iowans.”
However, Democrats criticized Nunn, saying this provision will not prevent cuts for Medicaid and SNAP coverage for Iowans. Justin Chermol, a spokesperson with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized the resolution in light of Nunn’s support for Republican budgets.
“If Zach Nunn really wanted to save Medicaid and SNAP, he should have voted ‘NO’ on the Republican budget that cuts both,” Chermol said. “No matter how hard he tries to run away from it, Zach Nunn’s vote to rip away health care and take food off the table of working families will cost him his job next year.”

Crackdown proposed on cross-border bottle redemptions
Ever since Connecticut doubled its refund on bottles and cans to 10 cents last year, beverage distributors have been raising the alarm about a nagging problem: people driving in from out of state with bags full of recyclables seeking a pay day.
Distributors — who collect deposits from stores and handle refunds — say the issue amounts to fraud, with a single truck full of containers purchased without deposits potentially worth up to $150,000.
A proposed solution, Senate Bill 1115, continued its way through the legislature this week with the endorsement of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
The bill would place more reporting requirements on redemption centers, while also offering compensation to distributors who end up paying out more deposits than they take in from the sale of eligible drinks.
Despite the support of the beverage industry, the bill has drawn opposition from redemption center owners who describe its additional reporting requirements as a burden to their business.
The committee passed the bill without any objections on Monday.

Loans for the wrongfully incarcerated
The Senate voted unanimously Wednesday to pass a bill that would require the banking commissioner to report on complaints made against companies that offer loans to individuals who were wrongfully incarcerated, with the expectation of receiving part of a settlement at the end of a lawsuit against the state.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said that some of the stories he’d heard were “horrifying.”
“Historically it’s been pretty easy to convict someone wrongfully but very difficult to make up for that,” he said, adding that he wanted to make sure the state’s money was going to the correct person.
Amanda Wallwin, state policy advocate with the Innocence Project, wrote in testimony on the bill that people who were exonerated and released often find themselves unable to pay for health care, housing or transportation.
Some of those people will take out loans at rates that Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, referred to as “usurious.”
“Certainly in my heart of hearts I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be able to limit the interest and the terms on these loans to that, that we allow for the highest participants in our marketplace,” said Kissel.

Two AI bills pass to the floor
The Judiciary Committee moved two artificial intelligence bills to the floor on Tuesday afternoon. S.B. 2, proposed by Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford, seeks to regulate generative AI including deep fakes, and provide state educational resources.
Sens. John Kissel, R-Enfield, Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven, and Melissa Osborne, D-Simsbury, spoke in opposition to the bill, emphasizing that AI is still a developing technology and legislation could ward off business from Connecticut. Opposition cited the previous reservations of Dan O’Keefe, Gov. Ned Lamont’s chief innovation officer, and compared upcoming changes brought about by AI to the Industrial Revolution. Kissel also spoke of the Trump administration’s policy priority in this area. The bill passed committee 16-6.
S.B. 1484 seeks to prevent the electronic monitoring and algorithmic discrimination of employees. The bill was originally referred to the committee of Labor and Public Employees before passing to the Judiciary Committee. The bill passed committee 13-5.

NAACP Youth Day
Members of the Connecticut NAACP Youth and College Division on Wednesday gathered at the state Capitol for a legislative day, speaking to lawmakers about four bills they want to see passed.
The bills deal with food insecurity, early educator pay, student loan reimbursements and funding for programs for disconnected youth.
Young people from Connecticut colleges, universities and high schools across the state spoke about the bills at the Legislative Office Building and actions they want lawmakers to take to make their futures better. Kellie Taylor, president of the Connecticut NAACP Youth and College, said the desire for a day to interact with legislators came in part from national politics. Members wanted to know their lawmakers, to be able to interact with them.
“So the overall purpose of today was that a lot of youth, especially Black and brown youth, they feel they’re out of touch from legislation,” Taylor said. “With the recent Trump administration, they’ve heard a lot of news. They’re wondering, ‘What can we do?’”

Street takeovers
The Senate voted 35-1 Wednesday to pass a bill putting in further measures and penalties to prevent street takeovers and punish the people who participate.
The bill allows municipalities to destroy all-terrain vehicles, dirt bikes and mini-motorcycles used in street takeovers if the owner doesn’t pick them up within 30 days. It also allows towns and cities to adopt ordinances to fine people participating in street takeovers up to $1,000 for a first violation, $1,500 for a second violation and $2,000 for a third violation, as well as impounding their cars. Participants may also have their licenses suspended for 45 days or revoked after a third offense.
“Turn on the news or you open up some social media, and you see a scene that you would think is out of a movie. People are lighting fires in the middle of the road, and cars are doing doughnuts around the fire,” said Sen. Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven.
Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, brought up the provision in the bill that allowed municipalities to destroy ATVs and motor scooters, saying this would prevent them from ending up back in the hands of the perpetrators after being seized.
But Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, said he was concerned someone might steal a vehicle to use in a street takeover, that vehicle might be seized and the true owner never notified. Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said the bill said a city or town had to notify the owner of a vehicle before they were allowed to destroy it.

Transgender athletes in women’s sports
Peyton McNabb of Murphy, North Carolina, stood at the State Capitol on Thursday listing the injuries she received while playing in a high school volleyball game against a transgender athlete: a concussion, brain bleed, permanent whiplash, partial paralysis on the right side, visual impairment and cognitive difficulties.
“ I don’t know if I ever will be the same, and it should have never happened,” she said.
McNabb spoke at a press conference alongside Republican legislators and advocates from groups like the Family Institute of CT and CT Catholic Public Affairs Conference to protest allowing transgender athletes to participate in women’s sports.
Republicans criticized their Democratic counterparts for voting down an amendment in the House of Representatives that would have prohibited transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports in Connecticut.
Also present was Christine Mitchell, a parent whose daughter, Chelsea, competed against transgender athletes as a track and field runner at Canton High School.
“Over the course of Chelsea’s high school career, she had to race against these two boys in nearly every major championship she went to,” Mitchell said, referring to the transgender women who competed in the track meets. “She raced them dozens of times over and over again, and on four occasions, Chelsea was the girl that would’ve had the state championship title if the boys had not been in the race.”
Mitchell and several other parents filed a lawsuit in 2020 against the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference, claiming that the organization’s policy of allowing transgender females to compete in girl’s high school competitions had deprived several girls from winning state level championships or being able to advance to the next stage of competition.
The lawsuit was initially dismissed, but the same judge who originally heard the case later revoked the dismissal, allowing it to proceed. Mitchell said the case is currently in federal court.

(Photo by David Houseknecht/United States Geological Survey)Anchorage financial firm McKinley Alaska Private Investment made an effort to take over the Alaska liquefied natural gas export project — a bid that the state agency leading the development ultimately “tossed aside,” said McKinley’s chief executive, Rob Gillam, in favor of another company.
Gillam wrote to the board members of the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corp., or AGDC, in early March. His message said he was seeking an opportunity “to share my firm’s fully funded offer” to acquire a majority of the AGDC subsidiary holding the $44 billion LNG project’s assets, according to a copy of his message obtained by Northern Journal.
In his message, Gillam said that his company spent the past year conducting research on a “potential bid” for the project before being instructed by AGDC in December to “stand down and do no further work on our nearly finished proposal.”
Up until that point, Gillam said, “we were not told of any impending deadline or given any heads-up that the significant time and financial resources my firm was spending in due diligence would be tossed aside and our proposal not even considered by AGDC.”
AGDC subsequently announced that it had reached an agreement with another company, Glenfarne, to take over the project’s development.
A spokesperson for McKinley, Stacia Gillam, declined to comment. A spokesman for AGDC said that the agency had responded to Rob Gillam but declined to share a copy of its message.
“AGDC closely examined all documented and written proposals that we received,” said the AGDC spokesman, Tim Fitzpatrick. “Once Glenfarne stepped forward, interest in the project greatly accelerated. A project of Alaska LNG’s size will have ample opportunity for investors to get involved.”
McKinley is one of Alaska’s few homegrown finance firms. It manages a chunk of the Alaska Permanent Fund’s portfolio, though one of its biggest investments as part of that initiative, in  processing company Peter Pan Seafood, ended catastrophically, with plants sold and shuttered.

The new executive order renews a previous mandate prohibiting permitted burns in central and western Nebraska that was set to end at midnight on May 10.

Burns remain prohibited where the National Weather Service has issued an active red flag warning.
‘We need Mother Nature’: Pillen enacts burn ban amid raging fire in north-central Nebraska

On May 1, Pillen granted fire chiefs discretion in granting burn permits to irrigation districts to clear vegetation from ditches, which remains in effect. Burning must be supervised on-site by the permitting authority.
The initial burn ban came after a prescribed fire got out of control April 21 in the Plum Creek area near Johnstown in Brown County.
The entire state is in “abnormally dry” to “extreme drought” conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The burn ban runs south along U.S. Highway 81 from the South Dakota border to Highway 92. It then goes west to U.S. Highway 281 and runs south to the Kansas border.
A total of 62 counties are in the burn ban, 10 of which face partial bans (denoted by asterisks): Adams*, Antelope, Arthur, Banner, Blaine, Boone, Box Butte, Boyd, Brown, Buffalo, Cedar*, Chase, Cherry, Cheyenne, Custer, Dawes, Dawson, Deuel, Dundy, Franklin, Frontier, Furnas, Garden, Garfield, Gosper, Grant, Greeley, Hall*, Harlan, Hayes, Hitchcock, Holt, Hooker, Howard*, Kearney, Keith, Keya Paha, Kimball, Knox, Lincoln, Logan, Loup, Madison*, McPherson, Merrick*, Morrill, Nance, Perkins, Phelps, Pierce*, Platte*, Polk*, Red Willow, Rock, Scotts Bluff, Sheridan, Sherman, Sioux, Thomas, Valley, Webster* and Wheeler.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The U.S. Senate voted to expand motorized access in Utah’s Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, passing a resolution on Thursday to overturn a Biden-era policy that closed a handful of roads to certain off-road vehicles. 
If signed by President Donald Trump, the resolution would open up some of the more remote regions of the recreation area to dirtbikes, side-by-sides and other off-road vehicles, the latest development in nearly two decades of controversy over motorized access in the area. 
Under the Biden administration’s rule, 25 roads amounting to roughly 26 miles would be off limits to specific vehicles — conventional vehicles like trucks or SUVs are still allowed to travel the routes. 
But specialized off-road vehicles like dirtbikes, ATVs or side-by-sides are restricted. Environmental groups, along with lawmakers opposed to the resolution, say these vehicles have potential to cause severe damage to the region’s most sensitive and pristine environments. Republicans, as well as motorized recreation activists, have called it another example of federal overreach that ignores the will of locals. 
Last week, the U.S. House passed companion legislation sponsored by Utah GOP Rep. Celeste Maloy. Both resolutions state the Biden administration’s rule “shall have no force or effect,” invoking the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to review and overturn federal rules.

Managed by the National Park Service, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was formed in 1972 and borders multiple national parks and monuments, like Bears Ears, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands. The area’s biggest draw is Lake Powell, the country’s second-largest reservoir, which attracted more than 4.7 million visits in 2025, according to National Park Service data. 
For years, environmental groups have criticized the National Park Service over what they say is a loose regulation of off-road vehicles around the recreation area. And in 2005, groups sued the park service over its lack of enforcement — in 2008, the service settled and agreed to create an off-road vehicle management plan. 
Then in 2021, the first Trump administration released a new plan that opened up much of the recreation area to all kinds of motorized use. 
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance sued two years later, arguing the administration’s plan failed to take all of the environmental impacts into consideration — the National Park Service settled again, agreeing to close the Lake Powell shoreline to motorized use, unless water levels were “sustainable” and put restrictions on ATV and side-by-side use in certain areas.
In January, the rule was finalized. It affects a small section of the recreation area, preventing off-road vehicles and ATVs on segments of the Poison Spring Loop and a section of the Flint Trail, remote and challenging, yet popular, motorized routes in the recreation area. About 4,930 acres of shoreline were also covered. 
For members of the Utah congressional delegation, the rule was antithetical to the concept of a recreation area.  
“If it says, ‘National Recreation Area’ on the map, people should be able to recreate there,” said Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in a statement, calling environmentalists’ push for a management plan “a classic case of sue-and-settle policymaking where bureaucrats caved to activists and cut Americans out of the process.”

Sen. John Curtis, also a Republican, said the resolution will help ensure public lands are more accessible. 
“Utahns have responsibly accessed Glen Canyon for decades, and Washington’s one-size-fits-all restrictions threatened not only that access but also the livelihoods and traditions of rural communities. This legislation restores the balance between conservation and responsible recreation — something Utahns have always led on,” Curtis said in a statement. 
The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance pointed out that more than 250 miles of roads within the recreation area still remain open to all vehicles, and the group criticized Republicans for chipping away at National Park Service protections. 
“Congressional Republicans, who have previously said that the National Park Service was immune from their destructive agenda, made it clear: they lied. Led by the Utah delegation, they voted to undermine the Park Service and instead bowed to extreme motorized recreation in some of the most remote and wild parts of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area,” said Hanna Larsen, a staff attorney for the alliance. “Today’s action means that Orange Cliffs, Gunsight Butte, and Canyonlands National Park’s Maze District will be impaired by noisy, destructive off-highway vehicles. It’s a dark day for all who love Southern Utah and Glen Canyon’s wild places.’’

(Photo courtesy of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman)Democrats seeking the governorship this year quickly condemned fellow candidate Newark Mayor Ras Baraka’s arrest by federal immigration officials Friday, while Republican candidates blasted Baraka’s actions as “shameful” and praised agents for arresting him.
Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said in a statement that Baraka had “committed trespass” at Delaney Hall, a private 1,100-bed immigrant detention center in Newark. Baraka, who alleges the building’s owner opened it without obtaining required city permits first, has been protesting outside the facility this week and making failed attempts to enter and inspect the building.
Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, a Democrat, called the arrest “wrong” and said it sets a “dangerous precedent.”
“Regardless of your views on ICE, the law is the law — and any facility operating in a New Jersey municipality must follow it. If Delaney Hall doesn’t have proper local authorization, Mayor Baraka had every reason to be there, and every right to demand accountability.”
Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat, demanded Baraka’s immediate release.
“It’s absurd that he’s being held. As I’ve said before, the Trump Administration should not be using Delaney Hall, a crowded private prison, as an immigrant jail. It’s an environment ripe with mistreatment and abuse,” Gottheimer said.
Baraka is reportedly being held at a separate ICE facility in Newark. On Friday afternoon, dozens of his supporters gathered outside it, chanting for his release.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, in a statement called Baraka’s arrest “an absolute outrage.”
“The Trump administration’s decision to reopen Delaney Hall, a private, for-profit prison to detain immigrants won’t make New Jerseyans safer, and it won’t fix our broken immigration system,” Sherrill said.
Sean Spiller, a Democrat and the president of the statewide teachers union, said he will appear outside Delaney Hall Saturday morning to protest Baraka’s arrest and he called on his opponents to join him.
“What we saw at Delaney Hall goes beyond politics. It’s about right and wrong, and what I saw was wrong. To see Mayor Baraka taken out in cuffs because he wants to see with his own eyes, as the mayor of Newark, the conditions in Delaney Hall, that was wrong,” Spiller said in a video posted to social media.
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, said he has always known Baraka to “stand up and fight for what he believes in.”
“Donald Trump’s disregard for the rule of law was on full display this afternoon,” he said. “The Mayor has every right to enforce the laws of his city and should be released immediately.”
There are five Republicans running in the June 10 primary for the party’s nod for governor. Two of them fired their criticism at Baraka.
“In Newark, the airport is in the midst of an unprecedented & dangerous meltdown, the public schools are failing students & families, and there is crime in the streets every day. And yet its Mayor and leading Democrat candidate for Governor,  @rasjbaraka, is busy shilling for illegal Immigrants at an ICE detention center with a cheap publicity stunt. Shameful,” former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli said.
Bill Spadea, a Republican former radio talk show host, thanked Habba for “ensuring that the rule of law can continue.”
“All of the other candidates should join me in condemning Ras Baraka and stand in solidarity with ICE, Tom Homan, Alina Habba and everyone working to enforce the law and end illegal immigration in New Jersey,” Spadea said.
Three Republican candidates — State Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union), former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, and contractor Justin Barbera — did not immediately issue statements on Baraka’s arrest.

Bob Ferguson to veto a bill that would limit health insurance reimbursement rates for state workers and public school employees.
The bill is designed to reduce health care costs for the state. But the Washington State Hospital Association says it shifts the burden to care providers and that hospitals could lose around $100 million per year if the change becomes law.
“Just because [the state is] paying less doesn’t mean it costs less to provide the care,” said Ashlen Strong, vice president of government affairs at the association. 
Reducing payments to hospitals for state and school employees would likely increase the cost of care for others because hospitals would negotiate with other insurers to make up the difference, according to the hospital association. If those negotiations aren’t successful, hospitals could look at reducing jobs or services.
Supporters of the policy argue that health care is unaffordable and that this bill would help reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients. They also say that hospitals could lower executive pay before turning to layoffs and service reductions. 
Independent rural hospitals would be exempt under the bill. In Washington, two hospitals were recently found to have negative operating margins in Chelan and Clallam counties, according to reports published by the state auditor in May. 
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, health care systems were “completely upended,” said Chelene Whiteaker, senior vice president of the association. And with costs for labor, supplies and equipment increasing, hospitals say they have been struggling financially. 
Hospitals would also be subject to higher business and occupation tax rates that the Legislature approved, which would be around $60 million in taxes every year, according to industry estimates.

,DC,2025-05-09 22:47:10+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump again tries to defund NPR and PBS, sparking a new congressional battle",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-again-tries-defund-npr-and-pbs-sparking-new-congressional-battle-0,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump urged Congress to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting during his first term, but was largely unsuccessful.Now, in his second go-around, Trump is once again asking lawmakers to scrap federal spending on the private, nonprofit corporation that Congress established in the 1960s.The Corporation for Public Broadcasting allocates funding to National Public Radio, or NPR, and the Public Broadcasting Service, or PBS, as well as more than 1,500 local radio and television stations throughout the country.Trump’s renewed focus on public media — in his budget proposal, an executive order and an expected rescissions request — has led the organizations that benefit from the CPB to start talking more than they have in recent years about their funding and their journalism.Katherine Maher, president and CEO of NPR, rejected the idea that ending funding for the CPB would have a significant impact on the federal ledger, since the “appropriation for public broadcasting, including NPR and PBS, represents less than 0.0001% of the federal budget.”Maher also opposed what she viewed as the Trump administration seeking to influence journalists and news organizations.“The President's order is an affront to the First Amendment rights of NPR and locally owned and operated stations throughout America to produce and air programming that meets the needs of their communities,” Maher wrote in a statement. “It is also an affront to the First Amendment rights of station listeners and donors who support independent news and information.”Paula Kerger, CEO and president at PBS, also defended the CBP as well as the news programs that receive its funding.“There’s nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,” Kerger said. “This public-private partnership allows us to help prepare millions of children for success in school and in life and also supports enriching and inspiring programs of the highest quality.”NPR receives about 1% of its direct funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, while PBS receives about 15%. Those numbers fluctuate for the local stations, which tend to get more, but not all, of their operating budgets from CPB funding.Senate likely to balkHouse Republicans, who have sought to zero out funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in recent appropriations bills, are likely to get on board. But senators, who write broadly bipartisan bills, haven’t taken that step and appear unlikely to do so this year — possibly helping public media resist Trump’s cutback attempts, as it did during his first term.The differences between the House and Senate will lead to heated debate for months to come about future spending on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as the dozens of other programs Trump told lawmakers to stop funding in his budget request.Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, ranking member on the panel that funds CPB, told States Newsroom during a brief interview she hopes lawmakers “can effectively fight back against that proposed budget.”“I find that some of my Republican colleagues, especially those from rural states, hear from their constituents that they are reliant on public broadcasting, especially radio for local information, news, etcetera,” Baldwin said. “And there's not a lot of other radio resources out there. But I think the same can be said about the public television offerings.”Opinions among Republicans vary, though.Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy, who sits on the spending panel, said funding for CPB “may have made sense at one time, but the American taxpayer has no business spending half a billion dollars a year subsidizing media.”Kennedy said he doesn’t expect rural residents will lose access to local television and radio programming should Congress eliminate the funding.""Rural communities have the same access as everybody else to cable, to streaming, to getting their news off of this thing,"" Kennedy said, pointing to his cell phone. ""It's just an argument by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to hold on to a government subsidy.”Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, pushed back against defunding.She wrote in an op-ed published in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner that while she shares “the desire to reduce government spending, defunding the CPB, and particularly the essential reporting it allows locally owned radio and television stations to provide in Alaska, is not the place to start.”Alaska’s local stations received $12 million last year from CPB, which made up between 30% and 70% of their total budget, in addition to individual donation and state funding, according to the op-ed.“Not only would a large portion of Alaska communities lose their local programming, but warning systems for natural disasters, power outages, boil water advisories, and other alerts would be severely hampered,” Murkowski wrote. “What may seem like a frivolous expense to some has proven to be an invaluable resource that saves lives in Alaska.”CPB has a state-by-state breakdown on its website detailing how much it provided during each of the past six years. The individual profiles show what portion of each state’s funding went to different programs, like the Next Generation Warning System, radio programming, Ready to Learn and Television Community Service Grants.Public media among multiple Trump targetsTrump’s skinny budget request, released last week, calls on Congress to cease funding the CPB as well as dozens of other organizations, including the National Endowment for Democracy and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.The section on CPB says the request is “consistent with the President’s efforts to decrease the size of the Federal Government to enhance accountability, reduce waste, and reduce unnecessary governmental entities.”Trump has also signed an executive order directing the CPB Board of Directors as well as executive departments and agencies to halt funding NPR and PBS.The order stated that the “viewpoints NPR and PBS promote does not matter. What does matter is that neither entity presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, wrote in a statement responding to the executive order that Trump didn’t have the authority he was trying to wield.“CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President’s authority,” Harrison wrote. “Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.“In creating CPB, Congress expressly forbade ‘any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over [CPB] or any of its grantees or contractors…’ 47 U.S.C. § 398(c).”There are also several news reports that the Trump administration will send a rescissions request to Capitol Hill, asking lawmakers to pull back funding already approved for CPB. But the Office of Management and Budget hasn’t yet taken that step.The Corporation for Public Broadcasting received steady funding from Congress starting at its founding, before the last Trump administration asked lawmakers to phase out its appropriation.The last Trump administration’s first budget request called on lawmakers to “conduct an orderly closeout” by providing $30 million for CPB that would have gone toward salaries, rent and other costs.The proposal argued that “private fundraising has proven durable, negating the need for continued Federal subsidies.”“Services such as PBS and NPR, which receive funding from the CPB, could make up the shortfall by increasing revenues from corporate sponsors, foundations, and members. In addition, alternatives to PBS and NPR programming have grown substantially since CPB was first established in 1967, greatly reducing the need for publicly funded programming options.”Funding increased despite TrumpCongress didn’t go along with the fiscal 2018 budget request for the CPB, and it wouldn't for the rest of Trump’s first term.In March 2018, lawmakers approved $445 million, followed by the same amount in the next year’s bill. Congress then lifted spending to $465 million in December 2019 and then again just before Trump left office for a total funding level of $475 million.Those allocations continued rising during the Biden administration, reaching a $535 million appropriation in March 2024, the last full-year spending law enacted before Trump returned to the Oval Office. House Republicans did, however, try to phase out funding for CPB during the second half of President Joe Biden’s term. The House GOP provided a two-year advanced appropriation until 2023, when Republicans announced they wanted “the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to compete with other programs in the bill for annual funding.”Those efforts didn’t work and the final spending bill, which became law in March 2024, included funding for CPB.Senate Democrats wrote after negotiating the bipartisan agreement that it “protects funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to support more than 1,500 locally owned TV and radio stations nationwide—rejecting House Republicans’ proposal to zero out funding and weaken Americans’ access to local reporting.“The bill maintains a critical investment of $60 million for digital interconnection and $535 million as a two-year advance appropriation, of which roughly 70% is provided directly to local public TV and radio stations.”Final resolution far offCongress is expected to begin work on its dozen annual appropriations bills sometime this summer, which collectively total about $1.8 trillion and make up about one-third of all federal spending. The House Appropriations Committee will likely propose phasing out CPB funding, or at least its advanced appropriation, in its bill.The Senate Appropriations Committee tends to write more bipartisan bills, so as long as several of the panel’s members advocate for CPB in its funding measure, the program will likely receive its advanced funding in that bill.Final agreement between the House and Senate is supposed to come before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1. But that rarely happens and lawmakers often use a stopgap spending bill to push off final negotiations until mid-December.That’s likely the earliest this year the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and those who rely on it will learn if Congress will reduce or eliminate its funding. That is, unless lawmakers fail to reach agreement on that particular funding bill.Congress would then have to use a stopgap spending bill, which mostly keeps funding levels on autopilot, until it can enact a full-year bill.",,,,2025-05-09 19:04:56.568197

But that’s not the case for the many tourists, from near and from far, who also traverse the halls under the Golden Dome each year.It got us thinking: what do these people, with eyes clear and hearts full, really think about the place? To find out, we turned to a reliable, and highly scientific, source: reviews of the building published on Google Maps.Most visitors seem to have had a great time. With some 160 ratings published as of Friday, the Statehouse scores an average of 4.7 stars out of 5. Many reviewers commend the building’s rich history, forested backdrop and ease of access compared with capitols in other states.“This is one of the coolest places I have ever been to,” wrote one reviewer who, accordingly, afforded the building a full five stars. “Besides the history, we mostly enjoyed the elegant furnishings,” said another five-star rating, which would surely delight the State Curator’s Office.“Very nice place. Have some words for the representatives inside but that’s another matter,” says another five-star review, leaving readers on a tantalizing cliffhanger.Some reviewers seem to have dropped stars from their reviews as a result of situations that, frankly, seem to reflect their own decisions or lack of planning, but not the building itself. “Dropped my ice cream walking up the stairs. Cried,” writes one review, with two stars. Wrote one three-star-rater: “When I visited the location, construction was going on. Didn’t have a good view of the location. Also, the town is very small.” (What were you expecting, Boston?)One four-star review — which, to be sure, could be a joke — detailed some real user error. “We kinda ended up here by accident at night, kiddo misread the signs and thought we were going to ‘Vermont STEAK House.’ Came hungry, left hungrier,” the review says, before going on to critique a “beat-up and overflowing garbage can” located nearby.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office has received a $100,000 grant to combat human trafficking in Arkansas, he announced Thursday. 
Griffin secured the grant while attending a bipartisan attorney general conference in Rome and Vatican City that was organized by the Attorney General Alliance and focused on fighting human trafficking worldwide, according to a press release from the AG’s office. 
“We are the most effective in our fight against international human trafficking right here in Arkansas when we are maximizing relationships, sharing information and learning best practices,” Griffin said. 
During the trip, which was “at no cost to taxpayers,” Griffin said he met with experts who specialize in “illicit massage parlors” and invited some of them to conduct trainings and share insights in Arkansas. 
Arkansas police announce human trafficking resource in line with governor’s legislative goals

In January 2023, Griffin announced the creation of a statewide group to combat human trafficking called Statewide Tactical Operations Partnership (STOP) that was to be composed of representatives from federal, state and local law enforcement. 
More recently, Griffin announced in January that four suspected human trafficking perpetrators were taken into custody following a statewide raid called “Operation Obscured Vision.” The initiative focused on a dozen “illicit massage parlors” in Jonesboro, Russellville, Hot Springs, Rogers, Harrison and a Little Rock hotel. Officials identified 17 purported trafficking victims who were 29-65 years old, and 16 accepted services from medical staff and advocacy groups that partnered with the operation, Griffin said.
Also in January, just days after the governor cited public safety as one of her priorities for the 2025 legislative session, Arkansas State Police announced a new website that provides human trafficking victims with county-level resources. 
Legislators approved a number of laws related to human trafficking during the legislative session that adjourned Monday, including one that would require information about the National Human Trafficking Hotline to be posted in a nail salon or massage business licensed by the Arkansas Department of Health.
Other new laws create enhanced penalties for recruiting trafficked people from certain places, and require those convicted of violating the Human Trafficking Act of 2013 to pay mandatory restitution to victims, among other things.

[…]","Newark Mayor Ras Baraka being taken into custody by federal agents at Delaney Hall, an immigrant jail in Newark, on May 9, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman)Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey and one of six Democrats running to be the state’s next governor, was arrested and detained by federal immigration agents Friday, according to his campaign.
This comes just over a week after the migrant jail, Delaney Hall, opened its doors as the largest detention center on the east coast. Baraka, whose city filed a lawsuit challenging whether the facility’s owner secured proper city permits before opening, has spent the week protesting outside the jail and attempting to gain entry, to no avail.
A photo taken by Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, who was also at Delaney Hall Friday, shows a handcuffed Baraka being led away from the facility in handcuffs. It’s unclear whether he has been charged with any crime. He was taken to a Department of Homeland Security Investigations office on Frelinghuysen Avenue in Newark, said Kabir Moss, a Baraka spokesman.
Acting U.S. Attorney of New Jersey Alina Habba said on social media that Baraka “committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center.”
“He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody,” said Habba.
Habba, a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, said in April that she is investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state ban on local law enforcement assisting in civil immigration enforcement. Under a 2018 attorney general directive, state, county, and local cops are barred from aiding federal agencies in civil immigration arrests or providing access to state or local resources and databases.
In February, private prison firm The GEO Group announced it had secured a 15-year contract with ICE to use Delaney Hall as a 1,100-bed detention center amid ramped-up immigration enforcement. Trump has made mass detention and deportation of immigrants — including some here legally — a pillar of his second term in office.
Delaney Hall, which held immigrant detainees from 2011 to 2017, reopened May 1, despite Newark officials’ attempts to block the opening through the lawsuit. ICE officials have confirmed that detainees are being held there, but have not said how many.
Murphy called Baraka’s arrest unjust and demanded his release. He noted that Baraka was among throngs of people and politicians who have protested outside Delaney Hall in recent months.
“Four years ago, I was proud to sign a law banning private immigration detention centers in New Jersey. And just last week, my Administration was leading the fight to defend that law before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals,” Murphy said in a statement. “Mayor Baraka is an exemplary public servant who has always stood up for our most vulnerable neighbors. I am calling for his immediate release by federal law enforcement.”
About 200 people gathered under the pouring rain outside Delaney Hall late Friday afternoon chanted: “Free Mayor Baraka!” and “No justice, no peace!” Some vowed they would not leave until he is released. The Attorney General’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Courtesy photo)Right now, the City of Billings MET Transit buses can’t serve nearby Lockwood because of a 1973 law.
Legislation awaiting a decision by Gov. Greg Gianforte would change that, as well as an issue regarding transportation districts highlighted during the past few years in Bozeman. If signed, House Bill 764 would make changes to Montana’s urban transportation districts and bus systems. 
Under current law, transit systems owned by a municipality can’t serve communities outside the city limits. Legislators also used the bill as an opportunity to revisit laws surrounding urban transportation districts.
The new law would open up cities with larger transportation systems — like Billings — to expand their reach outside town. Rusty Logan, an assistant director with the City of Billings who leads MET Transit, said the legislation could potentially lead to new routes.
“It allows the city to more openly negotiate inter-local agreements to provide regional transit service,” said Logan, who is also the president of the Montana Transit Association. “As far as the urban transportation districts goes, the intention of the bill was to make it easier to establish an urban transportation district; and in saying ‘easier,’ just easier to get the vote on the ballot so that the voters could decide.”
Currently, municipal bus routes can’t go further than eight miles from city limits. The bill adds language allowing municipalities to exceed that mileage if funded by another state, federal or non-profit source.
The bill was brought by Rep. Brian Close, a Bozeman Democrat, whose community was part of the reason the legislation was brought in the first place. 
“It’s been 50 years since you looked at these statutes,” Close said during a House hearing on the bill on March 4. “And I think the statutes need just a small amount of reform.”
The 2020 census put the Bozeman population at more than 50,000 people, an important milestone as they were now federally required to create a Metropolitan Planning Organization. It also opens up the city for increased federal funding, including for transportation.
While the Bozeman area already had some transit services run by a non-profit, a new funding structure had to be created in order to continue receiving federal funding. 
Gallatin Valley Urban Transportation District was formed in the wake of the changes to Bozeman’s population. Creation of the district required 20% of all registered voters in the boundaries of the proposed district to sign a petition to get it on the ballot. It was a drawn out process, said Sunshine Ross, who is the transit director at Gallatin Valley Urban Transportation District.
“A lot of effort, a lot of time, but it really did pay off,” Ross said.
Gallatin County voters approved the district, with 79% voting yes. HB 764 will simplify the process by allowing a county commission to put creation of a transportation district directly on the ballot. 
“It eliminates this really onerous threshold,” said Jordan Hess, who is the CEO of Mountain Line and a former city council member in Missoula.
Gallatin Valley was the fifth transportation district in the state, which includes larger cities like Missoula and smaller ones like Glendive, which is served by Dawson Urban Transit.
The bill also gave a clear definition of “direct transportation service,” saying it was 1.5 miles from the nearest route used by “a vehicle that provides general or special service to the public on a regular and continuing basis.”
Clarity was needed in cases where a property owner wanted to get out of the boundaries of the transportation district, which can be used to generate funding through taxes.
“Our board has had to essentially define the term in statute by policy, since it is not defined in statute,” Hess said. “We’re happy to be in a situation. We’re happy to be in an environment where that’s clarified and we’re not having to interpret unclear statutes.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/exterior_electric_3.jpg,,,2025-05-09 19:04:56.568197

Another amendment, also passed, clarified definitions listed in the bill.

Senate Democrats opposed the legislation, saying it limits academic freedom and freedom of speech. Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, said during debate those restrictions are “completely contradictory to our constitutional mandate and our democratic principles of the United States.”
Echoing previous comments on other DEI-focused legislation, Quirmbach said eliminating the ability for agencies like law enforcement and school districts to use a DEI practice like recruiting from certain communities will have negative consequences, as staff won’t be as well-equipped to understand other cultures.
Sens. Molly Donahue and Sarah Trone Garriott said the legislation would harm higher education institutions working to graduate well-rounded students who are prepared for the workforce and world.
Iowa is a state without enough people to work in it, Trone Garriott said, and DEI programs and practices help keep young people in the state and attract new residents to it.
“Policies like this are already hurting Iowa, and we can see it as employers are struggling to attract workers, and our young people move away and don’t come back, and our colleges and universities are having a very hard time attracting students, and our economic growth is lagging behind other states,” Trone Garriott said. “This is moving in the wrong direction.”
Rozenboom said in closing comments he heard “a lot of fearmongering, a lot of exaggeration, hyperbole and that sort of thing” from those opposing the bill, when in reality what it serves to do is show that state entities “do not exist to promote politically divisive ideologies.”
“I think House File 856 is required because of the directions some have gone, in the extreme, to push DEI initiatives in our state institutions,” Rozenboom said.

Free.,Treasury advises Congress must deal with debt limit before August or face default,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/treasury-advises-congress-must-deal-debt-limit-august-or-face-default,,"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department announced Friday that Congress must address the debt limit before August, setting a firm deadline for Republicans to wrap up work on the “big, beautiful bill” that will raise the nation’s borrowing limit by up to $5 trillion.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote in a letter to congressional leaders that “there is a reasonable probability that the federal government's cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted in August while Congress is scheduled to be in recess.“Therefore, I respectfully urge Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit by mid-July, before its scheduled break, to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.”The projection marks the first time the Trump administration has weighed in publicly on when the government will likely reach default since the last suspension expired in January. In the months since then, the Treasury Department has used accounting maneuvers known as extraordinary measures to pay all of the country’s bills in full and on time.Treasury’s projection is similar to a report the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released in March predicting the country would reach default in August or September unless Congress acted before then.Reconciliation packageRepublicans are hoping to lift the debt limit without having to negotiate a bipartisan agreement with Democrats, which is typically how lawmakers have addressed the debt limit during the past couple decades.GOP leaders plan to raise the debt limit by between $4 trillion and $5 trillion in the 11-bill reconciliation package they’re using to address tax law, overhaul higher education aid and cut federal spending.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., expects his chamber will vote on that legislation before the end of May, though Senate leaders haven’t put a timeline on when they’d bring the bill to the floor in that chamber.GOP senators are likely to propose several amendments to the package, and any changes by the Senate would require the bill to get a final sign-off in the House before it could head to President Donald Trump’s desk.The Treasury Department’s projection that a debt limit default will likely take place if no action is taken before August puts a firm deadline on when Republicans will need to reach final agreement.Caution against waitingBessent also cautioned lawmakers against waiting until the last minute to get their work done.“Prior episodes have shown that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can have serious adverse consequences for financial markets, businesses, and the federal government, harm businesses and consumer confidence, and raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers,” he wrote. “A failure to suspend or increase the debt limit would wreak havoc on our financial system and diminish America’s security and global leadership position.”A default on the country’s debt would limit the federal government to spending only the money it has on hand, likely leading to delayed, incomplete, or nonexistent payments on thousands of programs, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, troop pay, veterans benefits and nutrition programs, among many others.It would also lead to a downturn in the global economy with a recession being among the better scenarios.A default is vastly different from a partial government shutdown and would lead to more significant consequences for federal spending and the economy.",,,,2025-05-09 19:04:56.568197

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Two state lawmakers who work in health care want Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden’s help to ban sugary drinks, candy and “other non-nutritious items” from a nutrition program for low-income people.
Sen. Sydney Davis, R-Burbank, and Rep. Taylor Rehfedt, R-Sioux Falls, sent Rhoden a letter this week asking him to seek a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to prohibit families on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) from purchasing the items.
“This policy reform is about promoting healthier outcomes, encouraging smarter choices, and protecting the integrity of a program by ensuring responsible use of taxpayer dollars,” the letter read. “South Dakota should align its policies with common sense and nutritional science.”

At least four other states had asked the USDA to let them ban some foods from the assistance program as of late April: Iowa, Nebraska, Arkansas and Indiana, according to Reuters. President Donald Trump’s administration has called on states to request such waivers, and said it’ll work to approve them in a push to “Make America Healthy Again.”
Forty-one million people nationwide use the program in a typical month. Over 37,600 South Dakota households participated in the program in March, according to the state Department of Social Services, which includes 33,675 children. The average household received $395.38 through the program, costing about $14.9 million in federal funds. States pay for about half of administrative costs.
Critics of the waivers and bans on “unhealthy” food say the restrictions stigmatize low-income people and could create inefficiencies in implementing and tracking the program because states spend more administrative time establishing, monitoring and updating the list of restricted food items. Research from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that increases in monthly SNAP benefits increase nutritious food consumption, such as vegetables and healthy proteins, among participants while reducing food insecurity and fast-food consumption.
Some rural South Dakotans live in areas with limited access to supermarkets, where gas stations fill the void with more expensive but less nutritious food options, according to a 2008 South Dakota State University report on food deserts in the state. At that time, nearly half of South Dakota counties were considered food deserts.
In an emailed statement to South Dakota Searchlight, Rhoden’s spokesperson Josie Harms said the governor is “grateful” for the federal administration’s initiative, but did not say whether he will seek a waiver.
“Our state will continue to review our SNAP eligible items to ensure that nutritious options are available to our families,” Harms said.

Davis said Rhoden’s administration responded to the letter with a request to further discuss how a waiver might be implemented in the state. She hopes to work with the state government and other retailers and stakeholders to walk through the implementation process, identify what items to ban and to hear what the department projects as “additional implementation costs.”
“We shouldn’t let the fears of a difficult implementation stop us from trying to implement good policy,” Davis told South Dakota Searchlight. “At the heart of this request is looking out for the health and betterment of South Dakotans, kids and families that are financially vulnerable.”
As a certified registered nurse anesthetist at the Sanford Vermillion Medical Center, Davis said she’s seen the impact a sugary diet can have on children’s health, which leads to costly health care bills for families — or the government if the children are on Medicaid. For example, she’s anesthetized children for dental work, she said, because of “Mountain Dew put in their baby bottles.”
“Whether or not that Mountain Dew or whatever was purchased with SNAP benefits, it’s hard to say,” Davis said, adding that if the SNAP ban on such items is implemented, “then I guess we’ll know.”
Davis said it’s “not uncommon for government programs to have guardrails in place.” She said she doesn’t know what the timeline would be to request a waiver and implement a ban.

Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) as part of the New Mexico Stand Up for Science outreach on the last day of spring semester classes. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)On the last day of classes for the spring semester, organizers for the New Mexico Stand Up for Science tabled at the University of New Mexico, asking more students to join efforts to protest White House efforts to dismantle funding mechanisms for science research.
“The intent really is to make sure that people don’t lose steam throughout the summer,” said Nina Christie, a post-doctoral researcher studying substance use.
The group is part of a national movement seeking an expansion of research science funding  and reinstating research cuts under anti-diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility.
UNM could face $20 million in lost funding under NIH rule

The cuts, led by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, have impacted billions of dollars in research — including a UNM neuroscience researcher studying impacts of repeated traumatic brain injuries, who spoke at an earlier protest at the New Mexico Legislature.
About two dozen students stopped by over the course of 45 minutes. Some UNM employees also visited, including undergraduate advisors Madison Castiellano-Donovan and Dylan Velez. Velez told Source NM some of the psychology students whom they advise are expressing uncertainty in finding future jobs, wanting to graduate early or “considering switching majors altogether” due to the cuts to higher education.

Matison McCool, a post-doctoral researcher in substance abuse research, said lost funding will close doors for upcoming students.
“Without general training grants in place, without that infrastructure, there simply won’t be pathways to get into science anymore, for people who want to do that,” he said.
McCool said he also hoped the effort to organize will push the university to further protect funding.
“I want to hear concrete steps the administration is going to take and plan on taking to help continue funding researchers who lost their grants, and finding the resources for funding science,” he said.
McCool said the recent 2026 Budget Request from the White House proposes Congress halve the National Science Foundation by more than $4.7 billion, and cut the National Institutes of Health budget by more than $17 billion dollars.
“That will devastate cancer trial research, substance trial use research — that is a fact,” he said. “We cannot fund these studies that are solving these problems, people will die if these studies don’t exist.”
His own five-year research grant hasn’t been impacted yet, but he’s concerned that research will only get more limited, and he worries the grant could be rescinded at any time.
“The hardest part is looking at these White House proposed budgets and thinking ‘I don’t have a job in five years,’” he said. “This may be the only science I ever get to do.”

File photo by James M. Patterson/Valley News A Vermont judge has sided with VTDigger and ordered the Vermont Department of Public Safety to release state police audio and video recordings of the arrest more than a year ago of Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos on a drunken driving charge.Judge Timothy Tomasi, presiding in Washington County Superior civil court in Montpelier, where the lawsuit seeking the recordings was filed, issued the decision Friday. Vermont Journalism Trust, VTDigger’s parent organization, filed the lawsuit against the state Department of Public Safety after VTDigger had been denied access by the Vermont State Police to video recordings from Vekos’ arrest in January 2024.Tomasi in his 13-page ruling, granted summary judgment to the Vermont Journalism Trust and denied a summary judgement request from the state Department of Public Safety, effectively ruling in VTDigger’s favor as a matter of law. The judge also stated in his decision that the Vermont Department of Public Safety “shall produce all withheld records to VTDigger within 10 days.”VTDigger submitted a request for the withheld records later Friday afternoon, but did not immediately receive any of the recordings.Adam Silverman, a state police spokesperson, stated in an email Friday afternoon, “The Department of Public Safety is aware of the decision and is in the process of reviewing it.”The news organization’s legal team included Heather Murray and Jared Carter of the Cornell First Amendment Clinic in Ithaca, New York, and attorney Timothy Cornell of Cornell Dolan, P.C in Boston.“Releasing body cam footage promotes transparency and holds officers and the public official arrested in the case responsible for their actions,” Murray said Friday. The state Department of Public Safety was represented by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, which is also prosecuting the criminal case against Vekos.The state Department of Public Safety had argued, in part, that releasing the recordings of Vekos’ arrest to the nonprofit news organization ahead of any trial could unfairly impede the state’s attorney’s ability to obtain a fair and impartial jury to hear the case. VTDigger, meanwhile, contended that the withheld recordings should be publicly released pursuant to the state’s Public Records Act.Following extensive briefing and oral arguments in the case, Tomasi ultimately ruled in VTDigger’s favor. “There is no allegation whatsoever to the effect that disclosure will make the selection of a fair and unbiased jury impossible or unreasonably onerous,” Tomasi wrote in his decision. “The videos include the audio and visual aspects to what interested members of the public already know.”Charging documents publicly filed in the case referred in text to the audio and video images captured by the police recordings. Vekos was arrested on the night of Jan. 25, 2024, on the drunken driving charge after she allegedly drove impaired to the scene of a suspicious death investigation in Bridport.According to charging documents, she refused state police requests to perform field sobriety tests or to take a breath test. Also, the documents stated, she would not agree to be photographed or fingerprinted once at the state police barracks in New Haven, where she was processed for the charge of driving under the influence.She has since pleaded not guilty to the charge, which remains pending. A hearing in the case is set for later this month.Vekos has continued to serve as the state’s attorney in Addison County while the case has been pending.David Sleigh, an attorney for Vekos, said Friday afternoon he had “taken no position” on the public records lawsuit.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont judge rules in VTDigger’s favor, orders release of police video and audio of prosecutor’s arrest.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Timothy-Tomasi.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA Colchester man is facing a charge of first-degree murder for allegedly stabbing to death a woman on Thursday afternoon who, he told police, he had met online earlier in the day.Elijah Compagna, 27, pleaded not guilty late Friday morning to the murder charge during his arraignment in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington. The woman he was charged with killing was referred to in charging documents only as “Jane Doe.”Police said in a release that the identity of the woman was being withheld pending confirmation of her identification and notification of her relatives. During Friday’s hearing, Judge Timothy Doherty granted the prosecution’s request to hold Compagna without bail pending a further hearing in the case.In addition to the first-degree murder charge, Compagna was also accused of violating his probation stemming from an earlier simple assault conviction. Colchester Police Detective Sgt. Jesse Treier wrote in an affidavit in support of the murder charge that around 5:20 p.m. Thursday police received a call about a woman screaming at a residence on Florence Lane. Officers responding to the residence reported they spoke to Tony Tsiba Kanga and Compagna and one of them said there was a woman inside who needed help, the affidavit stated. Inside a second-story bedroom police found an unresponsive woman with duct tape over her mouth and blood on her neck, Treier wrote. Police also found a “switch knife” on a counter in the bedroom, the charging document stated. A paramedic arrived at the scene and pronounced the woman dead.Kanga told a different Colchester police officer that he was Compagna’s caregiver. “Tony said that Eli is allowed to be alone for up to 30 hours at a time and is considered independent,” the affidavit stated Kanga told that officer. “Tony advised he primarily does Eli’s grocery shopping but Eli cooks his own meals. Tony was not able to tell me the reason he is Eli’s caregiver due to HIPAA reasons.”Ring camera footage showed a woman arriving at the residence at about 4:45 p.m. Thursday, and Kanga told police he heard fighting and banging shortly after 5 p.m., the affidavit stated.Kanga said he ran upstairs to where the noise was coming from but the bedroom door was locked, according to the charging document. “Tony said he ran downstairs to try to get something to open the door and then ran back upstairs to try to get in again,” the affidavit stated, and that Compagna came out of the room soon after. Kanga told police he then texted his wife to call 911 and stayed with Compagna downstairs until police arrived.“Tony advised me that EIi has a violent past but has never been violent towards him,” the charging document stated. According to the affidavit, Kanga had lived at the Florence Lane residence with Compagna since April 11. “Tony reported that Eli has had family members come and pick him up to bring him places but today was the first day that he had anyone over.”Compagna, when later questioned by police, told them his shared living arrangement had been set up by the Howard Center, and Kanga was a shared living provider, the charging document stated. Howard Center, in a statement Friday, said that for the organization “the health, safety, and well-being of our clients, staff, and community are at the heart of our values and are our highest priorities.”The statement added, “We are deeply saddened by the tragic incident that occurred in Colchester and recognize the profound impact it has on our community. The organization also said in the statement that due to state and federal privacy statutes they are not able to “share protected health information or identify individuals who have or are receiving services through Howard Center.”Compagna admitted to police that he attacked the woman, striking and stabbing her several times, according to the affidavit. He also reported meeting the woman earlier in the day online, the filing stated.The affidavit also stated Compagna told police, “I did it, it’s wrong,” and “I shouldn’t have done it.” If convicted of the offense, Compagna faces a sentence of 35 years to life in prison.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Colchester man pleads not guilty to first-degree murder in stabbing death of woman.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/costello-courthouse-1-20230725.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

Ned Lamont to cap the amount residents pay for out-of-network medical care is facing strong pushback from providers and hospital administrators who say the bill will result in reduced access for patients, financial burdens for providers and increased leverage for an already-powerful insurance industry.   
The measure, which has received support from health care advocates across the state, would restrict providers from charging more than 240% of Medicare rates for out of network care.
“It’s a way to make sure that you as a patient have a little more control over the cost of these things,” Lamont told reporters following an event at the Capitol on Wednesday, adding that he is open to negotiating. “We’re trying to bring down the overall cost of health care. I thought this was one reasonable way we could do that.” 
Providers say the cap would squeeze revenues for an industry that already faces financial pressures, like rising costs, workforce shortages and inadequate Medicaid reimbursement The measure could lead to closures of physician practices, emergency departments and entire hospitals, as well as make it harder for Connecticut to retain and recruit physicians, said several physicians who spoke out against the proposal during a press conference at the Capitol this week. 
“The result for Connecticut residents will be longer wait times, fewer specialists and reduced access to care,” said Khuram Ghumman, president of the Connecticut State Medical Society. “Make no mistake: These caps do not protect patients.” 
The Connecticut Hospital Association estimated that the cap could lead to more than $700 million annually in reduced payments to hospitals. 
“Hospitals and health systems cannot sustain the robust health care delivery system that Connecticut residents enjoy if they cannot cover their costs,” stated CHA in written testimony opposing the bill. 
Ghumman, a family medicine physician in East Granby, also said the proposal gives even more leverage to an insurance industry “that already undermines patient care by denying treatments, restricting medications and imposing burdensome prior authorizations.” 
Susan Halpin, executive director for the CT Association of Health Plans, supported the cap in written testimony, calling it an “important first step” towards ensuring a balanced and competitive health care landscape. Halpin did, however, request “continued discussion” on whether 240% of Medicare is where the cap should be set. 
The out-of-network cap is one of a handful of legislative efforts by Lamont this session to curb health care costs, which continue to burden families across the country. In Connecticut, total health care expenditures per capita grew 7.8% between 2022 and 2023, more than double the target growth set by the state of 2.9%. 
In 2021, hospital inpatient prices in Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport were 27%, 42% and 43% greater than the national median for hospital inpatient prices in U.S. metro areas, respectively, according to a report by the Office of Health Strategy. In comparison, Boston’s hospital inpatient prices were 9% higher than the national median. 
Lamont has also proposed several provisions aimed at tackling the high cost of prescription drugs, including one that would limit price increases for generic and off-patent drugs to the annual rate of inflation. 
Medicaid reimbursement rates
Some legislators and providers who oppose the out-of-network cap said the state should instead focus on increasing the reimbursement rates that it pays providers to treat Medicaid patients. 
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said that, because the state underpays providers to treat patients with Medicaid, those same providers have to charge private payers higher rates to subsidize the gap. If the state increased Medicaid rates, it might drive costs down for private payers. 
“The first thing the state needs to do is look at where our reimbursement rates are and bring them to where they should be. And that should alleviate some pressure off of our health care system so that private provider rates could come down,” Candelora said in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror. 
Legislators and physicians for years have been sounding the alarm that the prevailing reimbursement rates are too low, making it unaffordable for providers to treat patients with Medicaid coverage, thus decreasing access to care for those residents. 
In 2007, Connecticut set the Medicaid reimbursement rates for most physician services at 57.5% of the Medicare rate at the time. The rates have not been broadly adjusted since, meaning many practitioners in the state receive Medicaid payments that are pegged to Medicare rates from 18 years ago — though certain providers, including primary care physicians and OBGYNs, have received rate increases.
In his budget, Lamont proposed an increase of $35.4 million in state funding for Medicaid reimbursement to providers over the FY 2026-2027 biennium. The Appropriations Committee adopted a budget that would add $15.4 million next fiscal year and $30 million in the following. 
A group of Democratic legislators have proposed bringing rates up to at least 75% of Medicare over 3 years, which would require a much more significant increase than either Lamont or the Appropriations Committee has proposed. 
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said she and other legislators on the committee are pushing for the state to invest $30 million in FY 26 and perhaps an additional $50 million in FY 27 to ensure Medicaid rates can meaningfully increase.
“[That funding] gets us on the path of a three year phase-in,” Gilchrest said. 
House Republicans proposed a budget that would invest $137.5 million over the biennium to boost reimbursement rates, a figure Candelora said is based off of a rate study finalized by the Department of Social Services earlier this year.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doctors-anwar-gordon-presser-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

Rob Perry speaks during the Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting in Burlington on Wednesday, May 8. Photo by Corey McDonaldShawn Burke has been Burlington’s interim chief of police for just over a month. Two weeks into the job, he had to use Narcan, the life-saving treatment that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, for the first time in 10 years.Driving around Orchard Terrace early in the morning, he witnessed a man he thought was sleeping and went to check on him. As he tried to wake him up, Burke realized the man was overdosing and ran back to his vehicle to retrieve a dose of Narcan.“It’s sad,” he said, speaking to a crowded conference room at City Hall Wednesday night. “People have made decisions in life, but I really believe that ultimately, they never envisioned this.”Burke’s experience, recalled during the packed Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting, underscored what has become a new normal in the city of Burlington. At the meeting, more than three dozen people gathered with various city officials to discuss the city’s newly approved plan for an overdose prevention center and, more broadly, the overwhelming substance use crisis that has plagued the city’s downtown core.Burlington Police Chief Shawn Burke speaks during the Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting in Burlington on Wednesday. Photo by Corey McDonaldOn April 28, the Burlington City Council unanimously approved preliminary plans for the center, green lighting the project’s planning phase, which is expected to take nine to 12 months. It’s seen by many as a crucial development to curbing the city’s staggering overdose and substance use crisis.“This is a hugely important step on this journey that we’ve been undergoing here as a community,” Council President Ben Traverse said at last week’s council meeting. “I think every one of us has either been directly impacted by the loss of someone to this crisis, or if not us individually, we certainly know someone who has lost a loved one to this crisis.”Now the question becomes where to put it. Finding a location for the center could quickly become a major hurdle.City officials and others close to the project say it makes little sense to site the facility anywhere other than downtown, which officials have called the epicenter of the substance use crisis in Burlington.“This won’t work if it’s not somewhere downtown,” said City Councilor Evan Litwin, who represents Ward 7 — outside the downtown core — before voting on the center’s approval last week. “It’s not going to work if it’s in an area that isn’t accessible and near the folks who need the services.”“All the studies around OPCs that are operating in other parts of the world … (show) it has to be where the activity is,” Central District City Councilor Melo Grant echoed at the neighborhood meeting for Ward 3, which is part of the Central District and includes the downtown core. “The Central District is the epicenter of the epidemic, not only in Burlington, but in Chittenden County and probably Vermont, given the number of incidents,” Grant said.Melo Grant speaks during the Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting in Burlington on Wednesday.

There is one run by the Howard Center’s Safe Recovery program on Clarke Street and one run by Vermont CARES on Bank Street.The Ward 3 neighborhood group approved a resolution that “vigorously opposes” the center’s establishment in the downtown core. The resolution calls for the city to place it near a medical facility, instead.“This is for us to draw our line in the sand,” said Zach Cummings, a member of the neighborhood group. “Ward 3 residents and downtown residents cannot take anymore pressure from unaccountable … social services.”‘It can save lives’The idea of an overdose prevention center has been a dream of advocates for years, before newer synthetic drugs like fentanyl and xylazine started mixing into the local drug supply.While fatal overdoses statewide have begun to decline for the first time since 2019, overdose deaths remain well over levels in years past. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that overdose deaths in the state have soared, from 78 in 2015 to 257 in 2023.The idea came closer to a reality last year, when lawmakers established a legal framework and funding needed for the facility. Lawmakers overrode Gov. Phil Scott’s veto in June to pass that law.The bill allocated $1.1 million from settlements with pharmaceutical companies that produced and sold opioids to fund the center in fiscal year 2025. The bill’s language also states that the funding for the project should continue to be available through at least 2028.The center will be operated in partnership with Vermonters for Criminal Justice Reform, a Burlington-based provider of harm-reduction treatment and recovery services. Visitors will be allowed to smoke or inject pre-obtained illegal substances there while being observed by trained staff equipped to respond to overdoses and other emergencies. Sterile syringes will be kept in-house at the overdose prevention center for people to access.“Somebody is there, physically present, able to reverse an overdose,” Tom Dalton, the group’s executive director, said in an interview. “That’s part of what excites me, is knowing that people are going to have an option that can help them survive.”The center will also host a number of other services, said Theresa Vezina, the city’s special assistant on overdose prevention center implementation, including wound care and other medical services and substance use treatment options. Case managers will be on hand to direct those utilizing the center to mental health services, housing support and other social services, she said.Vezina said the goal is to eventually have food, showers and laundry available, to create a place that can function as a one-stop shop for harm-reduction and treatment services.“We know that this can make a difference,” she said. “It can save lives.”Theresa Vezina speaks at the Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting in Burlington on Wednesday, May 8, 2025. Photo by Corey McDonaldBut concerns and questions remain about its location, which will need City Council approval. Litwin said he expects it to be “a tough conversation.”“There is not necessarily going to be broad agreement on the council about where to put it,” he said in an interview. “I also think we’re going to run into NIMBYism. I think some of that NIMBYism will be misplaced, and some of it will be very well placed.”‘We already have crime’The question of location, and community opposition to its placement downtown, represents perhaps the last major roadblock to the center’s opening.Vezina, at the neighborhood meeting, said the new law requires the city to conduct a comprehensive service assessment for its location, with a robust public engagement process before any site decision is made.While Vezina anticipates the center will eventually be placed somewhere downtown, she said city officials are still months away from finding a location. A major part of the planning phase, she said, will be finding a suitable building that can be retrofitted to meet the needs of the center.She told residents that the city would prioritize engaging with the community, and noted “past mistakes” the city has made, referring to the process for locating an emergency shelter on Elmwood Avenue, known as the “pods.”“Public discourse is going to be really important,” she said. “We don’t all have to agree. I think that there are absolutely concerns that people have that are valid. We want to make sure that we are hearing your concerns, otherwise we won’t be able to address them.”Residents at the neighborhood meeting, however, pointed to Clarke Street, where “things have gotten worse,” Amy Kimmel, who owns property on the residential block with her partner Rob Perry, wrote in an email to city councilors. “There is constant loitering and open drug use on the Howard Center property everyday, throughout the day.”Perry said neighbors have been at a loggerhead with the Howard Center for months over what they describe as negligence. The Howard Center has not prevented bad behavior from spilling out onto neighboring properties, nor has the center reined in syringe litter in the neighborhood, Perry said.Perry has since garnered more than 200 signatures on a petition calling for the removal of the needle distribution program from Clarke Street.“You talk about the drug user being the only victim,” Perry said to Burke at the Ward 3 meeting Wednesday night. “I don’t think that’s true. I think the neighborhood, the people who are around, are also victims of very clear abuse.”The organization has operated the needle exchange program on Clarke Street for more than 20 years, “playing a vital role in advancing public health,” said Mike Glod, a senior development and communications director with the Howard Center, in a written response to VTDigger.Glod said the site has seen a significant rise in need in the past two years and acknowledged the site has “has not been immune” to the quality of life issues, an “unfortunate reflection of the broader crisis gripping our city.”He added that the Howard Center is committed to being a good neighbor and said they were taking steps “to safeguard both those seeking our services and the surrounding neighborhood.”The situation on Clarke Street has drawn criticism from city officials, including both councilors Litwin and Grant.The Ward 3 Neighborhood Planning Assembly meeting in Burlington on Wednesday, May 8, 2025. Photo by Corey McDonaldLitwin, who commissioned a Board of Health report that calls for enhanced efforts to collect syringe litter, said, “If they’re not going to be able to operate by a standard of being a good neighbor, I don’t know how long they can operate there.”Grant, the Central District councilor, in an interview, agreed that the Howard Center should be doing more to prevent issues on the block that affect neighbors’ quality of life.“As a provider, they need to move people along,” she said. “Things like shopping carts and things like that, that’s not OK. As a provider, you need to take more responsibility for that space.”But Grant noted removing the program would lead to an even more devastating health emergency. Syringe service programs have been shown to prevent the spread of diseases like HIV or Hepatitis C, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Drawing similarities to the debate over the overdose prevention center, she also pushed back against the logic that the needle exchange is causing the problem, rather than the drug epidemic itself.“This idea that we’re going to have more crime — we already have crime,” Grant said in an interview. “We already have quality of life issues that already exist. The idea that this will make it worse is simply not true.”‘Expectation setting’Vezina stressed in an interview the importance of following research when searching for a location.“We all know there are going to be community concerns, but we’re going to be following the data,” she said. “We’re going to be utilizing the hot spot data about where overdoses are happening.”City officials have offered the prevention center as a solution not just to the overdose crisis, but also to broader issues such as syringe litter, the strain on the city’s emergency services, as well as on harm-reduction service providers.“I don’t think anybody wants to stand up an overdose prevention center in their community, because at the end of the day, it means we have a serious overdose problem,” Litwin said. “But what I have tried to impress upon people is that they will benefit from this in many ways.”Vezina said issues raised by residents could be addressed by the new facility.“Some of these behaviors and things that are happening at other service providers’ locations, hopefully they won’t happen there anymore, because there will be an OPC,” she said.That may not be convincing enough for residents. Christopher Haessly, a downtown resident and member of the Ward 3 neighborhood group, said the resolution the group passed Wednesday “seeks to strike a balance between those in favor of the OPC and those opposed.”While he understands the importance and need for the overdose prevention center, Haessly said a downtown location will “adversely impact the Church Street Marketplace.”READ MORE

During the meeting, Elmwood Avenue resident Trudy Richmond asked Burke for his thoughts on putting “that shoot-up site” downtown “that’s going to draw more people, unsavory folks to our area.”Burke said there are “a lot of friction points here in Burlington because we are the hub for all the social services, regardless of what neighborhood we might be in.”“If we’re going to incentivize and resource folks for success, what in turn should the community expect from the people?” he said. “That’s a bigger question than location, and more about expectation setting.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Burlington’s overdose prevention center has City Council approval.

(Photo by Andrew Roth)U.S. Senator Elissa Slotkin says legislation she co-sponsored seeks to prevent President Donald Trump from “lining his pockets” with money from cryptocurrency assets.
The End Crypto Corruption Act would prohibit the president, vice president, senior executive branch officials, members of Congress, and their immediate families from issuing, endorsing, or profiting from digital assets. That includes cryptocurrencies, which are traded on peer-to-peer networks and exist outside of traditional financial institutions, not overseen by third parties or government regulators.
The legislation comes after Trump launched his own meme coin cryptocurrency in January, and plans to hold an event May 22 at his golf club in Virginia for more than 200 of the largest investors, with the 25 highest holders gaining admission for a private reception. Bloomberg reports the majority of those top holders used foreign exchanges that bar users from the United States, “suggesting many purchasers are based abroad.”
“To be honest, I don’t even think that this should be a partisan issue,” Slotkin told the Michigan Advance. “No matter who the president is, they shouldn’t be allowed to create a marketplace and what amounts to direct payments to the president and his family.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Slotkin, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, says it is an unprecedented situation.
“You’re talking about folks with foreign interests, foreign businesses, foreign assets, buying themselves a seat close to the president. You’re not just talking about him lining his pockets, you’re talking about the threat of foreign influence on the president of the United States,” Slotkin said.
Trump has said through a White House spokesperson that his children are managing his assets through a trust, so there is no conflict for him.
Introduced Wednesday, the legislation only has Democratic sponsors, and Slotkin says even in a GOP-controlled Senate, bills like this should find at least some support from across the aisle.
But to date they have not.
“I have not seen that type of behavior from my Republican colleagues in the hundred-plus days we’ve been in this Senate,” Slotkin said. “I think [Alaska’s Republican U.S. Sen.] Lisa Murkowski said the quiet part out loud, that they’re scared of [Trump] putting a spotlight on them, and I think it’s up to the Democrats to highlight these issues of corruption at the highest levels.”
Slotkin said while there does seem to be bipartisan interest in creating some form of regulation to cryptocurrencies in general, the End Crypto Corruption Act needs to be a priority.
“We’ve got a more immediate crocodile closer to the boat, and that’s the president of the United States, selling his own currency and marketing his own currency and using it as a form of payment to line his pockets,” Slotkin said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AMR_0302-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

“Sixth generation Iowan David Barker has a proven 40-year track record as a successful entrepreneur and led the fight on the Iowa Board of Regents to undo restrictive COVID-19 mandates on students,” Ernst said in the release.
Barker, who has served on the board of regents since 2019, was confirmed by the Iowa Senate to continue his tenure on the board in late April. His term is set to expire in 2031.
He also works as a partner in Barker Companies, which oversees and develops real estate, and was previously an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to his board of regents biography.
In response to whether Barker is planning to step down from the board, board of regents spokesperson Josh Lehman said in an email he is still a member. Sherry Bates, president of the board of regents, congratulated Barker for the nomination in a statement.
“He will bring his tremendous knowledge, expertise and passion to that role,” Bates said. “It’s great that a fellow Iowan has been selected for this position, and we wish him well.”

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.

“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.










To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.


– Kelsey Morgan, EverFree CEO and co-founder


A bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
Funding to help victims recover
Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.

In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
Underreported to police
Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.

Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

Lobbyists reported spending nearly $1 million so far in 2025, the highest total in at least five years even though the year is far from over.
State law requires lobbyists to disclose their expenditures by May 7 of this year, covering the period including the 2025 legislative session. Lobbyists must disclose costs for things like meals, entertainment, advertisements or other items of value they procure to influence lawmakers. 
As of Friday morning, about 70 of roughly 665 registered New Mexico lobbyists had not yet filed their legally required disclosures, according to Alex Curtas, spokesperson for the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office.
So far this year, lobbyists spent a little more than $965,000, according to the latest filings. They are required to disclose expenditures again in October and then in January 2026. 
The biggest spender, by far, this year was Missi Currier, CEO of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association. According to her latest spending report, she paid the McGuire Woods Consulting firm for multiple campaigns against various “anti-industry” bills, often costing several thousands dollars at a time. She also disclosed a $166,000 payment to a consulting firm for a paid advertisement campaign. 
NM Governor nixes new license plates, state bread, lobbying disclosure

In total, according to Secretary of State records, Currier paid more than $360,000 to influence lawmakers this year. That’s more than one-third of the total lobbyist spending so far this year. 
Notably, Currier voluntarily disclosed some of the bill numbers she was lobbying against during the 60-day legislative session. 
They are House Bill 34, which would have required new environmental and health reviews to the state Oil Conservation Division’s review process; Senate Bill 48, which creates a community benefit fund to tackle climate change; House Bill 35, which would prohibit oil and gas operations within a mile of schools; and Senate Bill 4, the Clear Horizons Act.
All but Senate Bill 48 failed in the Legislature. 
Lawmakers this year tried to enact requirements for lobbyists to disclose what bills they were lobbying on, along with their employers’ positions on those bills. National government transparency group Open Secrets recently ranked New Mexico near the bottom of the list nationally when it comes to lobbyist transparency.
60 days later, Cicero Institute’s reason for NM lobbying still hidden from public

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham earlier this year vetoed House Bill 143, the lobbyist disclosure bill. She wrote that, while she supported the bill’s intent, it would impose “an onerous requirement” on lobbyists and their employers and that some of its provisions were unclear. 
Without the requirement, much of the spending disclosed this week was categorized with vague descriptions such as “dinner for lawmakers,” or “lunch for Governor’s staff.”
New Mexico law also does not require lobbyists to disclose how much they’re being paid. That means that, even as the number of disclosed lobbyist spending is increasing, it’s still just the “tip of the iceberg,” said Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-NM), a cosponsor of the lobbyist disclosure bill. 
“As eye popping as those numbers may be,” Steinborn told Source NM on Friday, “I would submit it dwarfs what is being spent to hire the lobbyists themselves.”
Mason Graham, spokesperson for good government group Common Cause, said the increase in lobbyist spending is disturbing given how little lobbyists are required to disclose and also reflects the sheer amount of power lobbyists have over a volunteer Legislature.
“Something that we continue to advocate for is increasing the length of the legislative session and for legislators to receive a salary,” he said. “Without those two things, legislators are really kind of reliant on lobbyists.”

Lessons include how to effectively communicate with each other and members of the public and how policing relates to civil rights issues, according to its website.
The program’s second cohort of officers graduated Friday, bringing the total graduates in the pilot program to 31. The first cohort of 16 officers finished the course in March.
Staff at the university’s law school, in talking to state law enforcement officials, realized police had few professional development opportunities focused on what it takes to be a great leader, said William Hubbard, dean of the university’s law school.
So, they decided to fill in those gaps, he said.
The course was open to officers who are already in a leadership position at their agency or aspire to be in one and have the skills necessary. By cultivating great leaders, the program aims to encourage more people to become police officers and stay in the profession, Hubbard said.
“That’s what we’ve sought to do,” Hubbard said.
Unlike other professional development courses, professors give students real-world scenarios to solve using what they learned about best practices and how their actions affect everyone involved, Catoe said.
“A lot of times, you like to live in black and white, very ordered and structured,” Catoe said. “Every once in a while, you have to go outside of that to find a solution that’s beneficial to the person, not violating their rights and that supports law enforcement’s objective.”
The program consisted of seven weeklong courses, spread out over the course of 17 months.
Along with teaching leadership skills, staff also offered help in writing grants for departments and other resources for officers.
“It’s really a treasure trove for law enforcement,” Catoe said.
Among the topics covered are what drives people to commit crimes, how mental health and community trust can affect people’s interactions with police officers and the history of racial profiling, according to the program’s website.
Many of the courses were eye-opening, Catoe said.
For instance, one week, officers learned how to use social media to connect with their communities. They used the university’s social media lab to see which posts did well and which didn’t, which Catoe hadn’t considered previously.
“Sometimes we have to adapt on the fly and do something,” Catoe said he learned. “When we find what works, we continue to use it.”
Filling in those gaps, including teaching leaders how to work together, is essential, said Gov. Henry McMaster.
He recalled a major drug bust he led as the state’s U.S. attorney in the 1980s that came together only when different agencies figured out how to collaborate instead of working parallel to one another.
Operation Jackpot, as the bust was known, led to the conviction of more than 100 people who were smuggling drugs into the country.
“You’ve got to make the ends meet,” said McMaster, the keynote speaker for Friday’s graduation. “There can’t be gaps.”
The program was meant to test curriculum for a master’s degree in public safety executive leadership, with the university plans to start offering this fall, according to an application the university submitted to its board of trustees.
The master’s course will use officers’ feedback from the pilot program to develop its curriculum, broadening it to twice as many people in the coming years, according to the application.
“I truly believe that as this program is pushed out across the state, it is going to be monumental for our officers,” said Aiken Lieutenant Jennifer Hayes, one of Friday’s graduates.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2284-scaled-e1746825127400-1024x728.jpeg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

In January 2022, the Iowa Board of Nursing revoked the practical nurse’s license it had granted to Enome Massango of West Des Moines in 2018, as well as the registered nurse’s license it had granted him in 2021.
According to board records, Massango later admitted he had paid a man named Musa Bangura for transcripts and diplomas as a “short cut” to completing his education at schools that federal officials likened to a diploma mill.
According to the board, Massango acknowledged his educational program as a licensed practical nurse consisted of a single-day “review course.” Board records indicate Massango had to take the LPN exam twice, and the RN exam four times, before passing the tests. After obtaining his nursing license in Iowa, Massango spent four years working at various locations, including Valley View Village, an assisted living center and nursing home located in Des Moines.
The board concluded Massango had engaged in fraud when he knowingly purchased fraudulent documents in order to qualify for licensure in Iowa, adding that his case was “particularly egregious.” Massango, the board said, “received little to no classroom instruction and did not undergo any clinical training.”
When the board revoked Massango’s license in 2022, it stipulated that before he could apply for relicensure, he’d have to obtain the proper educational credentials and appear “before the board for a reinstatement hearing” to establish that his licensure was in the public interest.
Board records show that on April 11, 2024, the board voted to grant Massango a new registered nurse’s license authorizing him to resume practicing in Iowa. Massango said Friday he did not have to appear before the board and argue his case before the new license was issued.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Board2-1024x459.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/09/ct-1199-nursing-home-strike-deadline/,The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed to push a May 19 strike deadline at 51 Connecticut nursing homes back until May 27.,"The state’s largest health care workers’ union agreed to push a May 19 strike deadline at 51 Connecticut nursing homes back until May 27, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday.
A spokesman for SEIU 1199NE confirmed the delay, which the Lamont administration sought. 
“Earlier this week, I met with union leadership representing Connecticut’s nursing home and group home workers and expressed to them that I agree that their current wages do not match the value of the service they provide and that I join them in their effort to seek an increase in their compensation,” Lamont said. “Additionally, I informed them that I believe there is a consensus among legislative leaders who also feel the same and that we are working to negotiate a state budget that includes support for this workforce.”
The governor added that “Connecticut’s nursing home and group home workers do strenuous work on behalf of our most vulnerable residents, and my administration is committed to reaching a positive resolution on their behalf as soon as possible.”
Union president Rob Baril said Friday that “we had a couple of conversations with the governor’s office, and we were extremely clear” about wage and benefit concerns.
The union wants to boost starting pay for caregivers to $25 per hour and, over several years, elevate most employees to about $30 per hour. Most nursing home workers in the state currently earn between $18 and $22 per hour, a wage that leaves many members in poverty.
Though wage and benefit negotiations technically are between private sector nursing homes and their staff, the state often plays a role in resolving labor-management disputes in this industry.
That’s because, on average, more than 80% of nursing home revenue involves patients whose care is covered by federal and state Medicaid dollars. 
Baril added the Lamont administration indicated it’s working hard to identify the resources necessary to bolster wages and benefits. “We are going to take them at their word,” Baril said.
Providing the type of raises the union seeks would require a major new public investment in nursing homes.
SEIU 1199NE estimates it would require an extra $550 million in Medicaid payments over the next two fiscal years combined, an annual average of $275 million, to fund the improved wages and benefits workers are seeking.
About 50% of Connecticut’s Medicaid expenses in most program areas are covered through federal reimbursement, which would make the effective annual cost to the state about $137.5 million.
Meanwhile, Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly’s majority are already struggling to develop a new state budget that complies with the constitutional cap that keeps most spending growth in line with household income and inflation. They hope to adopt a new two-year state budget before the regular 2025 session ends on June 4.
Earlier this month, the union set a May 19 strike deadline. The potential work stoppage would affect roughly 5,700 nursing home workers.
But this year’s state budget negotiations are far most complex than usual, given the uncertain future of Medicaid, a federal health care entitlement program run in cooperation with states.
Congress set a goal of achieving cuts to Medicaid and other programs worth $880 billion over the next decade. Lamont’s administration has modeled potential cuts, based on various proposals on Capitol Hill that could cost Connecticut anywhere from $186 million to $880 million per year.
Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, the state’s largest nursing home coalition, thanked state and union officials for their continuing efforts to avoid a strike.
“Separating nursing home residents from their caregivers causes real harm and trauma,” Barrett said. “Workforce development, including wage and benefit enhancements as an employee retention and recruitment policy for both union and non-union employees, is essential to addressing the care needs of Connecticut’s dramatically aging population.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210310_1199Rally_Hartford_YK_007.jpg,,,2025-05-09 18:07:54.236686

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Bands from Minot middle schools have canceled their planned trip to the Williston Band Day parade Saturday due the measles outbreak, according to a message sent to Minot-area parents from school administrators.
“We understand this news may be disappointing for our young musicians who were looking forward to this event,” the message states. “We share in their disappointment and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly. It was made out of an abundance of caution to protect the health of our students and families.”
As of Friday afternoon, North Dakota’s confirmed measles case total remains at nine, all of which are in Williams County.
The first confirmed case of measles in North Dakota was reported May 2, with three additional cases confirmed over the weekend. That total increased to nine cases Tuesday, including potential measles exposures to three Williams County schools. All nine cases are people who were not vaccinated. 
Williston Basin School District 7 required about 180 unvaccinated students to quarantine for 21 days. That number has dropped to 150 after some parents provided proof of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine for their children, said Paula Lankford, spokesperson for the district. Those students will be allowed to return to in-person instruction.
No new confirmed measles cases over the last three days is a good thing, said Molly Howell, immunization director for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services, but it does not mean the state is out of the woods yet.
About 180 students under quarantine amid measles outbreak in Williams County

“The incubation period for measles, the time period from when you were exposed to when you develop the disease, can be as long as 21 days,” Howell said.
Howell said to declare an outbreak officially over, two full incubation periods must pass with no new cases, which for measles would be 42 days.
Lankford said the annual Band Day Parade on Saturday will continue as scheduled with more than a dozen bands from across the state and the drum line for the New York Giants participating in the event.
“At this point, as a city or school district, nothing is being canceled, postponed or held back in any of the plans,” she said. Lankford added that high school sports and other afterschool activities were not affected by the quarantine.
In a notice posted to its website, the city of Williston shared North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services guidance that recommends “all residents and travelers to Williams County ensure they are vaccinated against measles.”
Residents wishing to not attend the parade and remain home due to safety concerns can watch a livestream of Saturday’s Williston Band Day parade through the Williston Convention and Visitors Bureau Facebook page.
Lankford also said there have been no issues in providing course materials to the students under the 21-day quarantine to ensure they can complete the school year.
The last day of school for the district will be May 23.
The measles outbreak prompted the Upper Missouri District Health Unity to host special walk-in vaccination clinics in Williston on Thursday and Friday.
Daphne Clark, spokesperson for the Upper Missouri District Health Unit, said the organization administered about 120 MMR immunizations on Thursday and, as of Friday afternoon, the foot traffic at the walk-in site had been “steady all day.”
“We’re seeing a lot of those 6-month to the 11-month (kids) getting that first dose and then that 12-month and older getting that second dose early,” Clark said.
She said some attendees were also getting caught up on other vaccinations, such as COVID-19 immunizations, while they attended the clinic.
The Upper Missouri District Health Unit holds regular walk-in vaccination clinic days at its Williston office on Thursdays from 3 to 5:30 p.m.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its weekly measles cases on Friday and reported an additional 66 measles cases were confirmed this week, bringing the nationwide total to 1,001 confirmed cases across 30 states.
Of those cases, 30%, 299 cases, involve children under the age of 5. School-age children between ages 5 to 19 represent 38% of the total measles cases nationwide.
Hospitalizations were required in 13% of all measles cases across the country. Children under 5 years of age accounted for more than half of the total hospitalizations.
Three deaths have been connected to the nationwide measles outbreak. None of the deaths involve cases in North Dakota.

The private university in the city’s urban core announced Friday that it plans to use philanthropic donations for the so-called “quadrangle” — which will become its epicenter of activity, hosting events such as graduation and alumni reunions, in addition to broader community activities.

Construction is to start in July near 22nd and Burt Streets, with a projected opening in fall of 2026. 
Calling the project among the largest physical reshapes of the campus, Creighton officials say it will include 5.7 acres of natural grass, an amphitheater, pavilion, stage, fountain plaza and an ellipse with an art installation.
 “The quadrangle will be Creighton’s own Central Park, a reimagining of campus green space that will live at the intersection of academic and residential life,” said Creighton president, the Rev. Daniel Hendrickson.
Designed by OJB Landscape Architecture and constructed by Kiewit Corp., the new feature is to be created on the site of what now are Creighton’s baseball practice and softball fields. Those are to be removed after the College World Series in June. 
New softball competition fields and a baseball practice area are under construction now in a community athletic complex near 17th and Cuming Streets, according to a media statement. 
The quadrangle green space will be surrounded by four residence halls, one set for completion this fall, as well as the School of Dentistry building, the Ahmanson Law Center and the Harper Center, which is home to the Heider College of Business.
“This transformation will forever change how our students, faculty, staff, alumni and guests experience campus,” Hendrickson said. “The quadrangle not only gives Creighton a prominent gathering space; it creates a crown jewel at the heart of the city’s urban core, where the University has invested more than $500 million since 2015.”
 The project comes as student surveys in recent years have pointed to additional natural green space as a way the campus could be improved.

 “We are always aiming to meet the needs of the thousands of students who attend Creighton, and who live and learn on this campus,” said Diane Duren, chair of the Creighton University Board of Trustees. “Campus-redefining projects such as the quadrangle will ensure that future Bluejays know when they choose Creighton, they are choosing an educational experience like no other, on one of the most beautiful campuses in the country.”
The project is part of recent construction momentum that includes the freshman residence Graves Hall, the CL and Rachel Werner Center for Health Sciences Education, the Jérôme Nadal, SJ, Jesuit Residence.
Other major improvements include renovations to the St. John’s Fountain and Plaza, the Skutt Student Center and, currently, Creighton Hall.
Creighton said the activity coincides with “record enrollment,” noting that over the past 25 years, the university has enrolled 22 of the 23 largest freshman classes in its history. This year’s enrollment reached 8,580 students, about half of them undergraduates.
 “These students are coming to Creighton from all over the nation,” Hendrickson said. “Approximately 80% of our students come from out of state, and 50% of all graduates stay in Nebraska.”

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)GARNETT — Kansas farmers are sharing opinions ranging from concerned to “pi**ed” about trade tariffs with U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, who toured a corn farm Friday southwest of Kansas City.
“When I’m talking to folks, I hear everything from concern and a cautious approach to how to navigate this tariff climate that we’re in, all the way to folks who are really, like, really worked up and are pi**ed,” Davids said, standing on a gravel road near the Phelon family corn farm outside Garnett.
Davids began visiting a variety of ag operations in 2023, including a goat farm in Miami County, a poultry and livestock operation in Anderson County. She serves on the House Agriculture Committee and wanted to learn more about farmers and their needs, she said.
The farmers she’s met with expressed concerns about potential future impacts on the international markets for their products because of tariffs, Davids said.
“The time and investment it takes to get those customers in international markets, it’s not a lightswitch, and it takes a lot of work and effort and rebuilding of relationships to get those same customers back and continue to have that level of market share,” she said. “The impacts are there and people are feeling it.”
Davids spent Friday morning with Adam Phelon and his father, Raylen Phelon, discussing the farm bill and other issues while touring their fourth-generation corn operation.
“I would say that right now, the prospect of a farm bill is very much dependent on how the Congress moves forward on reconciliation,” Davids said. “We’re supposed to have a markup on the reconciliation bill next week. I think when it comes to the farm bill, we have a really strong starting place in this Congress.”
Davids said Republicans and Democrats see crop insurance as a top priority, for instance, and there is agreement on other agricultural provisions.
“I think that there’s a reason to be realistically optimistic, but similar to last Congress — it’s not the farm bill that is holding up the process of getting a farm bill done,” she said. “It’s that there are other legislative things going on before we can do the farm bill.”
Adam Phelon, who is a Kansas Soybean Association board member, said he would like to see Congress pass a farm bill but added that multiple issues are being watched by farmers.
“It’s not just tariffs — it’s trade, it’s EPA regulations, it’s the energy costs, it’s infrastructure. I mean, infrastructure is such a huge one for us,” he said. “And that goes to not just our roads around here, but that goes to rail, that goes to ships that are coming into ports, you know, everything that goes on there. All that’s important to us as farmers.”
But the priority right now is getting a farm bill, he said.
“We need updated reference prices,” he said. “We need to make sure that there’s a strong safety net, and we need to make sure the crop insurance is protected because we have weather uncertainties. Without having crop insurance and making sure there’s a strong safety net underneath us — those things can be life or death in terms of a farm and how we operate.”
 
Statewide insights
Kaleb Little, CEO and administrator of the Kansas Soybean Association, was at the Phelon farm for the tour. He said he is hearing similar concerns as those expressed by Adam Phelon from others in the organization.
“There’s always so much uncertainty in farming and agriculture,” Little said. “There’s so much that’s just out of their hands. And then throw in what the federal government is and isn’t doing is just another layer of uncertainty in there, whether trade or not, getting a farm bill done, or bio fuels policy,” Little said. “Farmers are always optimists, right? Because they have to be.”
A lot of association members are hanging onto what Little termed “cautious optimism” that things will come out better. Still, he said, there is angst and concern.
For soybean farmers, half of their products go to the international market, he said. There were long-term impacts from tariffs put in place during President Donald Trump’s first administration. 
“The world dynamics really changed,” Little said, adding that pre-2018 tariffs, about 60% of China’s soybean market came from U.S. farmers.
“That got cut in half,” he said of the impacts of previous tariffs. “Some of the good that came out of that was soybean farmers and groups like the United Soybean or the American Soybean Association, those organizations really worked to diversify the international market. So U.S. soy is going to a lot more individual markets than it did pre-China. There are some positives there, but it’s a lot more work to maintain 50 countries as customers versus 12 or 15, especially when you talk about infrastructure and things like that.”
 
In his blood
Uncertainty is a part of running a farm, whether it be weather- or politics-related. But it makes planning difficult.
“The uncertainty is a huge issue,” Adam Phelon said. “So, yeah, maybe we won’t be making some bigger purchases that we planned on before, just so we can plan for the future in case, you know, things get worse before they get better.”
Even knowing the challenges, Adam Phelon never doubted that he’d continue his family’s farming tradition.
“This ground that we’re standing on today has been in my grandma’s family for around 100 years now,” he said. “Yeah, we’ve got VHS tapes of me in a crib being hauled up the side of a combine. I remember getting dropped off at youth group, and the look on my youth group teacher’s face when she saw me climb right into a tractor to go to work. Her jaw dropped. I was probably 11 or 12 years old.
“I love being out here working in the dirt, and seeing the crop grow from a seed to a final product, and taking pride in that,” Adam Phelon said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Phelon-use-1024x779.jpeg,,,2025-05-09 17:07:24.022656

[…]","The OOCL Iris container ship based in China is the largest vessel to visit the Port of Charleston, able to carry up to 16,828 cargo containers measured in 20 foot increments. (Photo by Matthew Peacock/Provided by S.C. State Ports Authority)CHARLESTON — President Donald Trump’s erratic tariff policies are roiling global trade, forcing South Carolina businesses and nearly every sector of the state’s logistics network to question where they go from here.
“It was like stopping a Ferris Wheel, and you’re sitting at the top,” maritime industry analyst Jim Newsome, former president of the S.C. State Ports Authority, said of the frozen future many industries are facing since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on April 2.
“Everybody is bracing for the impact,” he said.
Unlike their West Coast counterparts, the Port of Charleston has yet to see any major impacts from the Chinese shipping slowdown resulting from Trump’s 145% tariffs on that country’s imports.
That’s because transits to West Coast ports are shorter, and those ports typically have a much greater exposure to Chinese goods.
Year-over-year cargo levels measured by the equivalent of 20-foot-long containers — or TEUs in maritime jargon — moving through Charleston’s terminals have held steady or even increased this spring as retailers and others frontloaded shipments ahead of the tariffs.
That’s about to change, analysts say, because cargo that takes weeks to arrive along the East Coast will now be hit with the tariffs.
By June, ports in Charleston, Savannah and along the East Coast could see noticeable drops in cargo if tariff policies don’t change.
On average, about half of the freight bound for Charleston’s port either originates in or has major stops in China, which reported Friday that April shipments to the U.S. dropped by 21%.
Ocean liners in recent weeks have canceled about 17% of the container ships scheduled to travel to East Coast ports because of cargo shortages, according to Copenhagen-based maritime research group Sea-Intelligence.
Flexport, a San Francisco-based leader in supply chain management, says at least one weekly container service calling on Charleston has suspended trips altogether through mid-June.
Barbara Melvin, president and CEO of the State Ports Authority that owns and operates the Port of Charleston, declined to comment on tariff impacts.
But John McCown, a non-resident senior fellow at Arlington, Va.-based Center for Maritime Strategy, has a bleak outlook.
“I’m thinking a 25% overall (drop in cargo) could be conservative if things stay the way they are,” said McCown, author of the John McCown Container Report.
“I suspect the actual numbers will show reduced economic activity across the entire container shipping supply chain that will touch every port,” McCown said. “In addition, the tariffs will also result in noticeable inflation.”
‘Dropping like flies’
Some cracks are already starting to show.
A few trucking fleets at Charleston’s port, particularly those that handle Chinese imports, are seeing as much as 30% to 40% slowdowns, according to Rick Todd, president and CEO of the South Carolina Trucking Association.
“General trucking remains in a ‘worst ever’ freight and rate trough,” he said. “Combine that with relentless cost increases and we are finding smaller and more marginal fleets dropping like flies.”
About three-fourths of cargo at Charleston’s port moves by truck.
“The tariff/trade slowdown, with uncertainty, will exacerbate capacity leaving the market,” he said.
Todd’s counterpart in Georgia said that state is also “starting to see some ripples” in trucking volumes.
“But I think probably in another two to three weeks those ripples are going to start to turn into waves,” Seth Millican, president and CEO of the Georgia Motor Trucking Association, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
The Georgia Ports Authority has also seen little impact to date from tariffs, posting record volumes in March.
Griff Lynch, the authority’s president and CEO, said the port is talking with customers about how to mitigate tariff costs and using Savannah’s Garden City Terminal West to store containers and manage supply chain fluctuations.
Railroads that serve Charleston’s port say it’s hard to measure future tariff impacts.
“Tariffs could be a headwind to volumes for the rest of the year,” Ed Elkins, executive vice president and chief commercial officer for Norfolk-Southern, told analysts.
The biggest risk is an overall economic slowdown due to tariffs, he added.
CSX Corp. CEO Joe Hinrichs said near-term demand is “pretty strong” but “the keyword you’re hearing from everybody is uncertainty.”

About half of all imports to the U.S. are parts needed by manufacturers, including the Palmetto State’s $27 billion vehicle industry. Most of that cargo is moved by truck.
Volvo Cars this week announced layoffs totaling 5% – roughly 100 people – at its Berkeley County manufacturing campus, citing “challenging macro conditions” including tariff threats.
“The adjustment is due to changing market conditions and evolving trade policies, including tariffs,” a Volvo spokesperson said. “Our aim is to build where we sell, and we will continue to balance our ongoing investments in the U.S. with the need to optimize costs and drive greater efficiency in the current environment.”
Volvo also plans to add new models to its Lowcountry plant, which currently builds the battery-powered EX90 sport-utility vehicle, to offset tariffs on foreign-made cars.
BMW – the state’s largest automaker and the nation’s top vehicle exporter, primarily through Charleston’s port – said this week it has been making a case for tariff relief with White House officials but acknowledged the current status would have a “notable” impact on its second-quarter earnings.
Front-line workers at the port will also take a hit if tariffs lead to less cargo.
The International Longshoremen’s Association supplies thousands of dockworkers in Charleston, and those workers typically are paid only when there are ships to load and unload.
The ILA, which supported Trump’s election, has not issued any formal statement on tariffs. And Ken Riley, president of the union’s Charleston branch, did not respond to a request for comment.
A cloudy crystal ball
Tariffs that are announced one day and paused or canceled days later are adding confusion to South Carolina’s trade outlook.
“Nobody has an accurate crystal ball on the effect of these unprecedented catalysts,” McCown told Freightwaves.
Some of the biggest import commodities at Charleston’s port are Chinese tariff targets, including toys, apparel, footwear, televisions and other electronics. Combined with a 10% universal tariff on goods from most other countries, U.S. imports are projected to plummet.
Analysts disagree on how big the drop will be. The National Retail Federation puts the number at 20%. JP Morgan pegs it at up to 80%.
Walmart, which operates a 3 million-square-foot import distribution center in Ridgeville that supplies goods to 850 stores, said it is negotiating prices directly with overseas suppliers to blunt tariff impact.
Smaller businesses don’t have that luxury.
“It’s clear this is going to be a severe problem for small businesses because they don’t have the capacity to make bulk purchases or change their supply chains,” said Frank Knapp, president and CEO of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce. “You’re going to see businesses shutting down.”
Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary and a South Carolina native, is in Switzerland this weekend meeting with Chinese officials to talk trade. Bessent has said he doesn’t expect a major breakthrough, telling Fox News: “My sense is that this will be about de-escalation.”
Trump preempted Bessent’s talks Friday by posting on his Truth Social account that 80% tariffs on Chinese goods “sounds right” – the first indication that his stance is softening.
But lowering tariffs from 145% to 80% tariffs is still unsustainable and unlikely to move the needle on trade.
Newsome, the former port director-turned-president of Jim Newsome 3 consultants, said Trump’s tariffs are based on the flawed premise that they will bring manufacturing back to the United States.
“Forget about it,” he said. “You might be able to bring back some high-value manufacturing with a high potential for automation. But it’s never going to be the case that you’re going to bring a toy made in China back to the United States.”
There’s also no way to balance trade with China, he said, because that country “doesn’t have the consumption power we do.”
The per-capita U.S. income of $43,289 is more than 7.5 times greater than China’s.
“How do you balance that?” he said. “I think that kind of narrative got us off on the wrong foot.”
Newsome said he’s hopeful that reality is finally getting through to the president, and he thinks there will be too much pressure from retailers and other businesses for Trump’s China policy to persist. Retailers need holiday-shopping goods in their warehouses this summer, and they aren’t likely to sit by quietly if tariffs interrupt those shipments.
“The best outcome, the hopeful outcome, would be they have a good discussion (in Switzerland) and agree that things got out of hand a bit,” Newsome said. “Let’s push the tariffs off for 90 days to give some time to negotiate. That gets us past the Christmas shipping season.”
McCown agrees there will be intense political pressure to end the Chinese tariff war, but he’s skeptical that cooler heads will prevail.
“At all times and even before this nonsensical tariff policy went into effect, strong reasoned advice not to go down this path has been largely ignored,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ship-in-Charleston-Harbor.jpg,,,2025-05-09 17:07:24.022656

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark and one of six Democrats running to be New Jersey’s next governor, was arrested and detained by federal immigration agents Friday, according to his campaign.
This comes just over a week after the migrant jail, Delaney Hall, opened its doors as the largest detention center on the east coast. Baraka, whose city filed a lawsuit challenging whether the facility’s owner secured proper city permits before opening, has spent the week protesting outside the jail and attempting to gain entry, to no avail.
A photo taken by Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), who was also at Delaney Hall Friday, shows a handcuffed Baraka being led away from the facility in handcuffs. It’s unclear whether he has been charged with any crime and where he is being held.
Acting U.S. Attorney of New Jersey Alina Habba said on social media that Baraka “committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center.”
“He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody,” said Habba.
Habba, a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, said in April that she is investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state ban on local law enforcement assisting in civil immigration enforcement. Under a 2018 attorney general directive, state, county, and local cops are barred from aiding federal agencies in civil immigration arrests or providing access to state or local resources and databases.
In February, private prison firm Geo Group announced it had secured a 15-year contract with ICE to use Delaney Hall as a 1,100-bed detention center amid ramped-up immigration enforcement. Trump has made mass detention and deportation of immigrants — including some here legally — a pillar of his second term in office.
Delaney Hall, which held immigrant detainees from 2011 to 2017, reopened May 1, despite Newark officials’ attempts to block the opening through the lawsuit. ICE officials have confirmed that detainees are being held there, but have not said how many.
The Attorney General’s Office and the governor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

House Majority Leader Jefferson Moss, R-Saratoga Springs, will be resigning from the Utah House effective May 30 to serve as executive director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity, according to a news release issued Friday. 
“Serving in the legislature has been one of the great honors of my life,” Moss said in a separate news release issued by the governor’s office. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to continue serving the people of Utah in this new capacity and help advance the Governor’s vision for economic opportunity across the state.”
Moss’s first day in his new role will be June 2, according to the governor’s office. Starting that day, he’ll serve as interim executive director until his appointment is confirmed by the Utah Senate.

“Jefferson Moss brings a rare combination of public service, private sector experience, and a deep understanding of innovation and education,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “He’s been a driving force behind many of Utah’s most forward-thinking initiatives, and I’m confident he’ll lead the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity with the same vision, energy, and commitment to our state’s future that have defined his career.”
Moss will replace GOEO’s former executive director, Ryan Starks, who left earlier this month to “pursue other professional endeavors,” according to a news release issued May 2. 
While announcing Starks’ departure, Cox lauded him as an “invaluable asset to the state and our economic development efforts. … We wish him the very best in his future pursuits.” 
Starks, according to his LinkedIn page, originally intended to launch his own consulting business before he was offered a position leading the Economic Development Corporation of Utah, which he accepted. 
Moss, during his time in the Legislature, focused on policy impacting education, energy, government spending and economic development. He was first elected to the House in 2017. He served in House leadership roles since 2019, including as vice chair of the Executive Appropriations Committee, a powerful budgeting body. 
To choose a new majority leader, the House Republicans’ caucus will hold a special leadership election in coming weeks. 
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, praised Moss in a post on X, saying he has a “unique ability to bring people together, think outside the box, and solve complex challenges.” 
“While we’ll miss his leadership in the House, I know he will continue to serve Utah with the same passion and purpose in his new role,” Schultz said. 
Moss also currently works as associate commissioner of innovation, commercialization and economic development for the Utah System of Higher Education and as managing director of the Utah Innovation Fund. He’ll “continue in a leadership role with USHE in addition to leading GOEO,” according to the governor’s office. 
Previously, Moss also held leadership positions at Utah Valley University, was a strategist at KeyBank and Credit Suisse, and was a founder of several businesses.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Every kid has heard “No means no!” when they want something their parents don’t think they should have. This week that phrase got a couple high profile uses when Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, told Donald Trump right to his face that Canada was not and never would be for sale and Montana’s Congressman Ryan Zinke forcefully said “no” to the sale of public lands in the West.
In this day and age seeing U.S. politicians keep their campaign promises — or honor their oaths of office — is becoming increasingly rare.  But on “keeping public lands in public hands,” Rep. Zinke did just that.
The measure in question was part of the “big, beautiful bill” touted by Trump to give yet more tax breaks to the already wealthy. The new twist was to sell hundreds of thousands of acres of federal lands in Nevada and Utah for mining, logging, drilling and development to finance those tax breaks.
Doug Burgum, the Secretary of the Interior, has publicly declared public lands and resources as “natural assets” that can be used to pay down the national debt. Consequently, GOP Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada and Celeste Maloy of Utah inserted the public land sale as an amendment since it was not contained in the original draft of the bill due to bipartisan opposition.
Montana’s Congressman and former Secretary of the Interior called the move to sell public lands “a red line” and was adamant: “It’s a no now. It will be a no later. It will be a no forever.’’   As Zinke explained his firm opposition: “I prefer the management scheme and I give as an example a hotel. If you don’t like the management of a hotel, don’t sell the hotel; change the management.”
At almost the same time, Canada’s Prime Minister, Mark Carney was using almost the same words in his White House meeting. After listening to Trump’s blather about how Canada should be our 51st state, how much he “loved Canada” and how erasing the “artificial” border line would make one beautiful piece of real estate, Carney used Trump’s own real estate line to fire back: “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale.  We’re sitting in one right now.  Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it’s not for sale, won’t be for sale,” adding: “Canada’s not for sale. It never will be for sale.”
Carney won office largely on his opposition to Trump’s intentions to take over Canada, saying during the election that: “America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. But these are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.”
Both Zinke and Carney are dead right.  Polls show 74% of Americans oppose the sale of our public lands — and Carney’s election speaks for itself.  He won by fighting Trump’s nasty threat to take over our northern neighbor that 77% of Canadians oppose.
For a guy who’s always been told he can have everything he wants, the double-barrel blast should be a wake up call.  The world is not one big real estate sale to be marketed solely to make greedy billionaires even more money.  Kudos to Zinke and Carney — and hopefully a sign to the rest of Congress and the world that it’s time to tell our spoiled child of a president “No means no!”

Kay Ivey delivers the State of the State address in the Old House Chamber at the Alabama State Capitol on Feb. 4, 2025 in Montgomery, Alabama. (Will McClelland for Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey Friday signed a bill reducing the state sales tax on groceries.
HB 386, sponsored by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, will cut the state share of the tax from 3% to 2% effective Sept. 1. 
“When we can reduce taxes in Alabama and provide some relief to the hardworking people of this state, I am all for it. I was pleased to sign House Bill 386 to take another notch off our state grocery tax,” Ivey said in a statement.
Alabama is one of just a few states that still taxes groceries. Until September 2023, the state taxed groceries at the full 4% state sales tax that’s been around since 1939. Combined with local taxes, the total tax on food in Alabama ran as high as 10% in some places. In Montgomery, a family spending $600 a month on groceries could pay up to $60 in taxes.
The Legislature in 2023 reduced the state sales tax on groceries from 4% to 3%. But it also required growth of at least 3.5% in the Education Trust Fund (ETF), which gets most of the grocery tax.  
Compared to the previous fiscal year, the current 2025 ETF has grown 3.28% this year, compared to the 2024 ETF at the same point, but budget chairs indicated they were comfortable with moving forward.
Under the new legislation, the tax bill on $600 worth of groceries in Montgomery will go from $54 to $48.
Lawmakers also changed the bill to allow local governments to reduce their sales and use tax on groceries, effectively combining HB 387 with the legislation — which the House passed in March and a Senate committee in late April.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Washington and 14 other states are suing the Trump administration over the president’s declaration of an “energy emergency” to speed up permitting for fossil fuel projects.
Issued the day of his inauguration, President Donald Trump’s executive order says inadequate domestic energy development and an unreliable grid warrant the national emergency. The order argues these issues are most pronounced in the Northeast and on the West Coast.
“Dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population,” the order reads.
The order pushes federal agencies, like the Army Corps of Engineers, to use “any lawful emergency authorities” to “facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands.”
In practice, this has meant bypassing or quickening reviews under the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and the Historic National Preservation Act for planned energy projects and giving the public less time to weigh in, according to the complaint filed Friday in federal court in Seattle. Washington and California lead the 15-state lawsuit.
The lawsuit cites a proposed 100-mile transmission line that would mostly run under the riverbed of the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon. The project could be expedited despite water quality concerns.
Attorney General Nick Brown noted Trump’s order emphasizes oil and natural gas, while excluding renewable energy like wind and solar.
“This is not a serious or lawful effort by the president,” Brown said in a press conference Friday. “It is all about limiting competition and shackling America to dirty fossil fuels forever.”
Last month, the Interior Department announced it would fast-track the approval of coal, gas, oil and mineral projects on public lands in light of Trump’s emergency declaration. Environmental reviews that can typically take a year would be shrunk to two weeks.
Meanwhile, the United States produces more oil and gas than any other country and production is growing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The energy emergency order is separate from one the president issued last month targeting state climate policies, including potentially Washington’s Climate Commitment Act.
Casey Sixkiller, the director of the state Department of Ecology, said the emergency declaration is “an abuse of authority.”
“Environmental regulations aren’t red tape,” Sixkiller told reporters. “There are guardrails that protect our air, water, land and keep people safe.”
Bill Iyall, chair of the Cowlitz Tribe, said it’s difficult to weigh in on what projects will mean for the tribe’s land when they only have a week or two.
“We are there to advocate for our cultural and natural resources,” Iyall said. “Looking at a project individually, if you did it carefully and planned it carefully, you would be able to minimize those impacts and get a facilitated permit.”
The lawsuit asks a judge to declare the president’s order illegal and stop the issuance of emergency permits. The states are not seeking a temporary restraining order to immediately stop the Trump administration’s actions, as it has in other cases.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
This marks 17 lawsuits Brown has filed or joined against the Trump administration since January. Four of those came this week, over freezing permitting for wind energy development and funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, as well as dismantling the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Trump’s immigration enforcement casts shadow over Vermont housing discrimination bill 

by Carly Berlin 
April 10, 2025, 4:57 pmApril 10, 2025, 4:57 pm 



Legislative leaders have indicated that S.127, which passed the Senate in late March and is currently winding through the House, will be the central housing bill in 2025. But at the same time, the Senate is continuing to work on a separate version of a similar bill, H.479, muddying the path to the final product.Here’s a look at the top changes this year’s housing package would make – including where lawmakers are still debating the details and where Gov. Phil Scott’s administration stands.Financing infrastructure The hallmark piece of S.127 is a new initiative aimed at financing infrastructure for housing, particularly in smaller towns. The Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, or CHIP, is essentially a scaled-down version of Vermont’s longstanding tax increment financing program. The goal is to allow municipalities or developers to borrow money for infrastructure like water lines, roads and sidewalks for a particular housing project. Then, the increased tax revenue from the new development would pay off the debt for the infrastructure.Advocates for municipalities and housing boosters have pushed hard for the new initiative, and developers big and small have said the new financing tool could help make more housing projects pencil out. Critics have argued that if some development aided by the program would have still happened even without it, the initiative does not justify the foregone property tax revenue to the state’s overstretched Education Fund. The House’s tax-writing committee is contemplating restrictions on the proposal, including a test to determine whether a project would have occurred anyway, along with affordability rules and geographic boundaries.Getting the CHIP proposal passed is a main priority for Scott’s administration, said Alex Farrell, commissioner of the Department of Housing and Economic Development. But he cautioned against narrowing who can take advantage of it too much.Alex Farrell, commissioner of the Department of Housing and Community Development, speaks before the Senate Natural Resources Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Feb. 26. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“It’s concerning to me when we try to solve every problem with a single program,” he said.This year’s budget also directs $10 million in loans and grants for infrastructure projects that support housing.Changing who can challenge new housingRight now, if a person has an issue with a new housing project and wants to take its developer to court over a local permit, they have to meet one of a few key criteria: they must be a direct neighbor, or they can gather 19 other people to sign a petition to trigger an appeal.Many housing proponents have argued that these provisions make it too easy for “not in my backyard”-style legal challenges to interfere with badly-needed new homes. The House has advanced a change that would scrap the “abutter” and “petition” appeal options, as they’re often called, with a different legal standard: an opponent must show they will be personally harmed by the development. Rep.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMihaly, a champion of the change, sees it as narrowing the scope of who can lob an appeal. If an individual is concerned about stormwater runoff from a new building, for example, “I would have to show that runoff comes onto my property, or I actually swim in that water or drink it, or something like that,” he said. But Farrell and members of the Senate’s housing committee have expressed concerns that the House’s change could in fact open a new avenue for opponents to appeal, without any geographic bound on where an appellant lives. That committee has advanced language that maintains a proximity requirement, which must now get vetted by the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee. Immigration protections Lawmakers have incorporated a bill that seeks to expand housing access for immigrants without legal status into the omnibus package. The legislation would amend the state’s fair housing laws to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of citizenship or immigration status when someone is seeking to rent or buy a home. S.127 also spells out that a landlord needs to accept a range of forms of identification on a rental application in order to conduct credit and background checks – not only a Social Security number. That follows testimony from immigrants who’ve told lawmakers that landlords have frequently passed them over when they couldn’t provide the identifier. But lawmakers took a step back from an outright ban on landlords asking for Social Security numbers that advocates had originally pushed.In a move to assuage landlords and lenders spooked by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, the bill also spells out that federal laws and regulations take precedence over the state’s protections. Farrell said on Wednesday that the administration does not yet have a position on the new protections.Spending debatesIn parallel with the housing packages, lawmakers have finalized their state budget proposal for the coming fiscal year.The budget gives about $15 million to two pandemic-era housing development programs that had since run out of funds, one that provides low-interest loans to developers of rental housing for people with moderate incomes, and another that gives subsidies to builders of homes for purchase by “middle income” buyers.Construction on a housing project in Colchester on May 31, 2022. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThat’s less than half of what Scott advocated for the pair of programs at the outset of the legislative session, prompting Scott to say several weeks ago that the cut was one of his chief gripes with lawmaker’s budget proposal.The budget also gives $4 million to the Vermont Housing Improvement Program, which provides modest grants to rehabilitate rental housing that has fallen into disrepair. But because that funding is one-time and not designated as an ongoing expense, as the administration had requested, the unpredictability may jeopardize maintaining staff positions into the future, Farrell said.Lawmakers also directed about $27 million to the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board for deeply-subsidized housing, far less than what affordable housing advocates have said is needed to fill a backlog of projects.Odds and endsS.127 also takes steps to streamline remediating contaminated brownfield sites for future development, directs the state to look at what it would take to create a land bank to buy up abandoned properties, and sets up studies looking into accessibility standards for residential buildings and housing options for people with developmental disabilities. Notably, the bill does not take up further reforms to Act 250, a subject where Scott saw more room to push after last year’s major overhaul. Some of his asks got taken up in a late-in-the-game land-use bill that has thus far seen little action.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lawmakers piece together housing bills that take on permit appeals, immigrant protection and funding.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/burlington-apartments-1-20211119.jpg,,,2025-05-09 17:07:24.022656

But the health center’s administrator, Zachary Moser, said a recent decision to freeze family planning funds has the center fearful it won’t be able to continue covering family planning services for its rural southeastern Missouri population.
In late March, the Trump administration froze about $27.5 million in Title X funding to a number of states, including several million dollars to Missouri that are distributed by Missouri Family Health Council. 
The Title X program was created more than half a century ago as a funding stream to support access to family planning options, including contraceptives, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings related to reproductive health.

While some have speculated the administration was trying to target abortion providers, only seven of the 52 recipients of Title X grants through the Missouri Family Health Council are Planned Parenthood clinics. A breakdown of how funding is distributed between clinics was not made available.
The majority of the recipients are health centers like Moser’s. Moser said in the short-term, Dent County has redirected some general revenues toward family planning services and continues to offer them to patients for free.
“Will we be able to do that indefinitely?” he asked. “No.”
For example, instead of Title X funding covering the cost of an IUD — a contraceptive device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy — the patient would instead have to foot the bill, choose a less-effective but more affordable or go without. 
Moser said some of the longer-lasting contraceptive devices can cost upwards of $1,000 out of pocket, a price that isn’t feasible for most of the people the center serves. 
Limiting or eliminating family planning services can impact entire communities and public health. 
Michelle Trupiano, executive director of the Missouri Family Health Council, said if the freeze continues, she anticipates immediate health consequences like increased unintended pregnancies, later-stage cancer diagnoses, more overall disease and worse maternal health outcomes. 
Missouri Family Health Council has been leading the state’s Title X planning program for nearly 45 years. Their network of 52 clinics includes health departments, community action agencies, federally-qualified health centers and hospital-based clinics. They also work with family planning clinics, including seven Planned Parenthood locations.
“The Trump administration and Elon Musk are using Title X to push their own political agenda and impose their personal beliefs on everyone at the expense of people who need critical access to care,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. ” …. If blocking health care for low-income patients is what the Trump administration means by ‘making America great again,’ then we want no part of it. It’s cruel, it’s calculated, and it won’t stop us from fighting for our patients.” 
Trupiano said she’s not sure why Missouri was targeted while other states with Planned Parenthood clinics were left untouched. But the letter Trupiano received announcing the freeze cited compliance concerns around diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI. She said the grant they were awarded includes “access, quality and equity” among its priorities. 
Through Title X funding, Missouri clinics served nearly 34,800 patients in 2024. Of those, 83% were female, 75% were under the age of 34 and 45% were uninsured.
Last year, 58% of the patients served were white and 30% were Black. 
“We know the devastating impact and consequences that will result if this is not swiftly resolved,” Trupiano said.
The funding to Missouri Family Health Council was paused the day before year four of a five-year grant cycle began on April 1. 
The Dent County Health Center applied for Title X funding after hiring a full-time nurse practitioner in 2022. Not only does the grant help them increase health care access for patients, but Moser said it also backs up an ongoing effort to inform more young people on pregnancy prevention. 
In his corner of southeast Missouri there’s still a lot of stigma around premarital sex, Moser said, making it difficult to educate teenagers on pregnancy-prevention. Among those teens who do seek out contraceptive access at the health center, he said many don’t want to go through their parent’s insurance policy because they want to keep their choices private. 
“We won’t have any way to serve those patients,” Moser said. “It’s going to limit access for sure, which is going to drive up the teen pregnancy rate, drive up unwanted pregnancies and have other unintended consequences.”
Missouri’s teen pregnancy birth rate has steadily declined over the past several years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though it still remains among the highest in the country.
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, director of Right By You, a Missouri-based nonprofit that in part advocates for contraceptive access, said some of the most common calls to the organization’s hotline revolve around navigating birth control access.
She said a continued freeze could have “catastrophic” effects, potentially shuttering programs or clinics whose efforts help reduce unintended pregnancies.
If the freeze continues, Kraft Sheley said, that likely means navigating fewer people to pregnancy-prevention options and increasingly directing them to abortion options. While abortion is now legal in Missouri, access is still difficult for many people, as only three Planned Parenthood clinics have resumed procedural abortions and medication abortions remain unavailable.
Missouri abortion ban clears House, heads to Senate despite concerns from top Republican

Trupiano has spent the past few weeks helping clinics like Moser’s navigate the abrupt funding change as they work to determine how to stretch resources in order to continue providing free family planning services to patients. 
“They already were working in the leanest possible way to provide this critical care,” she said. “These cuts are very devastating, and for a lot of the health departments and other safety net clinics, this isn’t the only infrastructure cut that they are facing.” 
That rings true in Dent County, where Moser said Title X is one of a handful of programs under threat right now. He remains particularly concerned about continued federal funding for the county’s lead testing and vaccine programs, both of which rely entirely on grant funding.
Trupiano and others have been drawing attention to Missouri’s public health safety net for years, raising concerns that clinics and providers are stretched beyond capacity. Funding freezes such as this only cause longer wait times and more people who ultimately go without timely care as the burden shifts off one clinic and onto another, she said. 
For example, if a clinic relying on Title X funding were ultimately to close, those patients would be forced to find another provider. In many places, new patient wait lists are already months long. For those without reliable access to transportation, getting to a different clinic further away might be too much of a burden to continue care.
While the greatest harm will be inflicted on the most vulnerable Missourians, Trupiano said, “the impact is going to be borne by everybody.”

For years, outdoors enthusiasts in New Mexico have pushed to overhaul the state Department of Game & Fish — an agency plagued by leadership turnover, funding woes and the scorn of hunters and tree-huggers alike.
Now, state lawmakers have given the agency a new name, a new mission, new leadership and a boost in funding to expand its role. The sweeping law enacted in March puts New Mexico at the forefront of a growing movement to rethink states’ traditional model of wildlife management.
“We came from a place of extreme dysfunction,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, an environmental nonprofit that advocated for the new law. “Now, I truly do believe that we’re going to be a gold standard for wildlife management. Over the next few years. you’re going to see an unbelievable shift.”

New Mexico’s new approach expands the agency’s focus beyond hunting and fishing to protect more species and brings in new funding to reduce its reliance on license sales. Other states are watching closely. Lawmakers across the country have introduced bills to change their wildlife agencies, and many have cited the New Mexico measure as an example of what’s possible.
“That’s the biggest game changer,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a national nonprofit focused on overhauling states’ wildlife governance. “That’s the legislation we’ll be pointing to as a model in future years.”
From Oregon to Utah to Florida, legislators have introduced bills that would overhaul their wildlife agencies’ funding, mission and governance.
While the proposals have had varying levels of success, New Mexico leaders say it took years of coalition-building to get their bill across the finish line. Wildlife advocates expect the issue to earn more legislative attention nationwide in the years to come.

Under the traditional model, state wildlife agencies have largely been funded by the license fees paid by hunters and anglers, plus federal excise taxes on equipment such as guns and fishing tackle. The agencies have focused most of their work on species like deer and trout, prized by the sporting groups that provide their revenue.
In New Mexico, as in most states, the commissions that govern these departments have been appointed by governors. They’re often filled by hunting and fishing guides, ranchers and political donors. Critics say this model results in panels that set policy to protect their economic interests.
Today, many wildlife agencies are struggling to stay afloat as fewer and fewer residents hunt and fish. At the same time, plummeting wildlife populations are compelling agencies to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species. And some wildlife advocates are demanding a new governance model that puts more scientists in charge.
This year, state lawmakers across the country have passed or considered a host of major wildlife management overhauls. Some would expand their agencies’ mission to focus on non-game species. Others would provide new funding streams to take on that additional work. And some would change the makeup of the commissions that dictate wildlife policy.
In New Mexico, lawmakers did all three at once.
The state’s agency had faced numerous problems over the years. Hunters and bird-watchers alike were frustrated with the agency’s leadership. In recent years, several commissioners have resigned or been forced out by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. At times, the panel has lacked enough members to form a quorum.
The agency’s budget was in trouble as well. The state had not raised license fees in nearly 20 years, keeping revenue flat even as inflation made the cost of its work more and more expensive.
“We were having to repurpose money from on-the-ground conservation just to make salary adjustments,” said Stewart Liley, wildlife division chief with the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish. “We were getting to a precarious spot.”
In 2023, lawmakers passed a bill to restructure the agency’s commission, which would have taken some power away from the governor. Lujan Grisham declined to sign the bill, killing the effort with a pocket veto.










We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it's the only one we've got.


– Jesse Deubel, New Mexico Wildlife Federation executive director


This year, lawmakers took a bigger swing. The package passed this session renames the Department of Game & Fish to the Department of Wildlife. It expands the agency’s authority to protect non-game species in need of conservation help.
“We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it’s the only one we’ve got,” said Deubel, of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “They’ve got a responsibility to work on any species in the state that has conservation need.”
Agency leaders say they were already conducting research and conservation work for non-game species. They viewed that aspect of the bill as a largely symbolic measure that “shined a light” on the need for more restoration work, Liley said. However, the law did provide more explicit authority for the agency to manage insects and regulate the direct “take,” or killing, of certain animals.
The measure raises license fees — a provision supported by many hunting and fishing groups — and allows for inflation-based adjustments in future years. Meanwhile, lawmakers included another $10.5 million from the state budget, spread over three years, to help the agency take on more non-game conservation.
“It seemed only fair that if we were going to ask the department to take on a broader role that they not finance that just through hunting and fishing,” said Democratic state Rep. Matthew McQueen, who was among the key sponsors.
Liley, the agency official, said the new money, along with a separate conservation fund established in 2023, will more than double the state’s investment in helping threatened species. The agency expects to hire up to eight new biologists who will conduct research, determine which species need aid and lead restoration efforts.
“This will help us get a better grasp of where we are with different species across the state,” he said. “There are absolutely projects we have not undertaken because of lack of capacity. This will allow us to do more surveys, to radio-mark birds, to [use that research] and say, ‘Let’s do forest restoration this way for pinyon jays.’”
The package will also change the agency’s governance. The current commission has seven seats, all appointed by the governor. Lujan Grisham’s appointees have included a car dealer, an Exxon Mobil lobbyist and a former lawmaker who owns an oil and gas business.
Under the new model, a bipartisan legislative committee will nominate three candidates for every seat, each of whom must be vetted to demonstrate their knowledge of wildlife. The governor must choose from among those three. One of the seats will be reserved for a wildlife scientist, one for a conservationist, one for a hunter and angler and one for a rancher or farmer.
“These changes add expertise and really important perspectives to the commission,” said Chris Smith, wildlife program director with WildEarth Guardians, an environmental nonprofit. “Our [current] commission was having structural problems and light scandal almost consistently.”
Backers’ one disappointment is that Lujan Grisham used a partial veto to strike a provision that would have protected commission members from dismissal by the governor. She argued that the proposed change relied too heavily on the slow-moving court system to remove commissioners, making it difficult to hold problematic members accountable.

Lawmakers say they’re still intent on protecting agency leaders from the governor’s whims, but pleased the rest of the package has gone into effect. While the measure passed with bipartisan majorities, some lawmakers objected to the idea of expanding the agency’s mission to protect species beyond those that can be hunted.
“With all due respect, I don’t want to pay for a butterfly,” said Republican state Rep. Harlan Vincent, according to KUNM. “I’m just being honest with you.”
And some groups are skeptical that the extra funding from the state budget will be enough to cover the agency’s growing conservation role.
“If New Mexico wants to expand the mission of the department, New Mexico needs to pay for it,” Tom Paterson, president-elect of the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association, said during a Senate committee hearing. “The necessary funds should not come on the back of the license fees that hunters and anglers pay.”
While the agency’s new funding and mission are now in place, its name change to the Department of Wildlife won’t take effect until next year. And its current commission will remain in office until Jan. 1, 2027. Lujan Grisham’s successor will then appoint new commissioners under the revised model.
The advocates who backed the New Mexico overhaul say it will take time and investment to make the new model work. They know other states will be watching closely.

Conroy's name was added to the state law enforcement memorial at the Capitol in 1987. This image is from the 2025 ceremony adding two names to the memorial.  (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Sadness and alarm accompanying the execution-style shooting of Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Conroy O’Brien on May 24, 1978, was matched by despair and shock of state law enforcement leaders when informed of the decision to parole murderer Jimmie Nelms.
Kansas Highway Patrol Col. Erik Smith, Attorney General Kris Kobach and Sage Hill, president of the Kansas State Troopers Association, objected to the three-member Kansas Prisoner Review Board’s order to authorize release of 78-year-old Jimmie Nelms.
Nelms was convicted of premeditated felony murder and sentenced to two life terms in prison for killing O’Brien near Matfield Green during a traffic stop. O’Brien had pulled a speeding vehicle over on the Kansas Turnpike. While he wrote a citation, three men — including Nelms — overpowered the trooper. O’Brien was forced to walk into a roadside ditch and kneel on the ground. He was pistol-whipped by Nelms, who then shot the trooper twice in the back of the head at close range. O’Brien was 26.
Hours later, Nelms and his partners eluded KHP Trooper Charles Smith following a chase on county roads and a shootout. The trio fled on foot and were captured.
Smith, who leads the Kansas Highway Patrol, said the agency opposed Nelms’ request for parole at multiple hearings, including the March session prompting the parole order. He said the board’s decision relayed to him this week by the secretary of the Kansas Department of Corrections was like a gut-punch.
“There is no conceivable world in which the release of a convicted cop killer – an executioner – is acceptable,” Smith said. “Yet, the legal framework allowing parole existed at the time and has now come full circle. So, while we may vehemently disagree with the board’s decision, we must live with it by continuing to support his surviving family and his blue family.”
Kobach said it didn’t make sense to release of a person who killed a law enforcement officer and was sentenced to prison for life.
“There is something deeply wrong with this picture. Those who murder law enforcement officers should expect to receive the death penalty, not to be walking free on the streets of Kansas,” Kobach said.
Kansas didn’t reinstate capital punishment until 1994, and the state hasn’t executed anyone since 1965.
Hill, president of the state’s trooper association, said it was unfathomable the review board betrayed O’Brien’s family, friends and “anyone who ever has or ever will wear the badge of a Kansas state trooper.”
“It does not go unnoticed when life sentences in Kansas aren’t worth the paper they’re written on, even for cop killers when there is no question of guilt,” Hill said.
Hill said the decision of review board members Carolyn Perez, Jeannie Wark and Mark Keating was “disgraceful and disgusting.”
“We hope you feel profound shame from this day forward whenever you see a young Kansas state trooper on the side of the road protecting our community,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/law-enforcement-memorial-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 16:08:06.834392

A resolution filed Thursday afternoon accuses Rep. John McCravy of using “antisemitic, racist and sexist statements that were so egregious as to amount to personal attacks.” The Greenwood Republican says he didn’t use any of the terms he’s rumored to have said.
Democrats “demand there be an investigation and swift justice,” Rep. Jermaine Johnson of Columbia, the measure’s chief sponsor, told reporters gathered in the Statehouse lobby. “We deserve better, and we will demand better.”

Johnson’s resolution was sent to the House Ethics Committee in the last hours of the 2025 legislative session. It’s unclear when in the off-session the committee will meet. It is the only committee divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats in the supermajority GOP chamber.
The resolution seeks censure on the grounds that McCravy violated a House rule that requires legislators to “act with decorum at all times when the House is in session.”
House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, a member of the Ethics Committee, said a censure is the least that should happen after McCravy used a racial slur when answering a reporter’s question.
While he did not name the reporter, The Post and Courier reported after the news conference that the slur came during an unreported and unrecorded part of an interview with McCravy last week. According to the newspaper, the legislator said the term as something he would not use toward a Black colleague.
The interview was about House Majority Leader Davey Hiott’s departure from the Family Caucus, which he co-founded with McCravy in 2017.
Hiott said part of his rift with McCravy stemmed from comments he made last session when referring to two legislators he didn’t believe should lead House Judiciary subcommittees. McCravy denied using any derogatory terms while voicing his concerns over policy differences.

Johnson’s resolution wraps up the various accusations as “antisemitic, racist and sexist.”
“When it goes to the committee, we want to know what exactly happened and action to be taken from a strong stance of this body that hate won’t win,” said Rep. Hamilton Grant, D-Columbia, a co-sponsor.
Asked about the resolution, Hiott said “it’s an ethics situation now.”
Ethics Committee Chairman Jay Jordan, R-Florence, “will handle it just like any other ethics complaint,” said Hiott, R-Pickens. “He will allow the process to work. So, as far as I’m concerned, it’s off the House, and it’s into the Ethics Committee.”
The resolution followed Wednesday’s mass resignation from the Family Caucus, which was over activists’ tactics in pushing for an abortion ban. The 29 legislators who co-signed the resignation letter to McCravy said the caucus under his leadership “has grown increasingly exclusionary and divisive.” It made no mention at all of alleged comments.
Activists’ push for near-total abortion ban leads to split among SC Republicans

The rebuke was over McCravy’s continued affiliation with hardcore abortion opponents, whose tactics included going to House GOP leaders’ churches on Palm Sunday to distribute fliers that accused leadership of blocking a vote on McCravy’s bill banning nearly all abortions.
“We reject the intrusion of that brand of activism into our state, our churches, and our conservative movement,” reads the letter provided to reporters.
The letter came after McCravy declined leaders’ request to rein in the activists. McCravy has told the SC Daily Gazette he doesn’t think it’s appropriate or ethical to tell the activists what they should or shouldn’t do.
It’s unclear when the House last censured anyone.
Democrats introduced a similar resolution in 2021 calling for the censure of a different Republican legislator over comments he posted on Facebook. Nothing came of it, but that legislator lost his bid for re-election in 2022.
In 2017, then-Speaker Jay Lucas was preparing to introduce legislation taking the exceedingly rare move of expelling a legislator, something not done in the state House for more than a century. The legislator, who was charged with beating his wife bloody, resigned rather than face expulsion.

This comes just over a week after the migrant jail, Delaney Hall, opened its doors as the largest detention center on the east coast. Baraka, whose city filed a lawsuit challenging whether the facility’s owner secured proper city permits before opening, has spent the week protesting outside the jail and attempting to gain entry, to no avail.
A photo taken by Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), who was also at Delaney Hall Friday, shows a handcuffed Baraka being led away from the facility in handcuffs. It’s unclear whether he has been charged with any crime and where he is being held.
Acting U.S. Attorney of New Jersey Alina Habba said on social media that Baraka “committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center.”
“He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody,” said Habba. 
Habba, a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, said in April that she is investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state ban on local law enforcement assisting in civil immigration enforcement. Under a 2018 attorney general directive, state, county, and local cops are barred from aiding federal agencies in civil immigration arrests or providing access to state or local resources and databases.
In February, private prison firm Geo Group announced it had secured a 15-year contract with ICE to use Delaney Hall as a 1,100-bed detention center amid ramped-up immigration enforcement. Trump has made mass detention and deportation of immigrants — including some here legally — a pillar of his second term in office.
Delaney Hall, which held immigrant detainees from 2011 to 2017, reopened May 1, despite Newark officials’ attempts to block the opening through the lawsuit. ICE officials have confirmed that detainees are being held there, but have not said how many.
The Attorney General’s Office and the governor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Unvaccinated students at Missouri Ridge Elementary, Williston Middle School and Williston High School were told they need to isolate for 21 days to ensure they were not infected, said Paula Lankford, spokesperson for Williston Basin School District 7. The precaution is to prevent students from unknowingly spreading the virus to others.
Health officials on Tuesday confirmed nine cases of measles in Williams County in northwest North Dakota. Daphne Clark, spokesperson for the Upper Missouri District Health Unit, said the measles cases are considered part of an outbreak because health officials believe community spread is occurring without direct contact with known carriers of the illness.
Four people diagnosed with measles were in Williston schools while infectious, the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services said.
The entire campuses of the affected schools were considered exposed, Lankford said.
The quarantine requirement affects some unvaccinated fourth grade students who were touring Williston Middle School on the day of the exposure, Lankford said. It also affects a few other students who don’t attend the affected schools but shared a bus ride with an exposed student, she said.
“Each of the schools is going to work with those families that are excluded to ensure that they have educational opportunities for their kids and connections with teachers through digital means,” Lankford said.
The Williston school district has a total enrollment of about 5,300 students.
Lankford encouraged parents, students or community members to contact their school or health care provider if they have questions.
“What’s obviously on our side is that there is not that much school left,” Lankford said. “We are done here on May 23rd.”
If Williston High School seniors under quarantine do not show any symptoms after their 21-day isolation, they will be allowed to participate in graduation commencement at the end of May, she said.
Of the confirmed cases, two are children under 10; five are between ages 10 and 19; one is between 30 and 39 and one is between 40 and 49, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The first case reported Friday was a Williams County child who is believed to have contracted measles from an out-of-state visitor. All are people who were not vaccinated, health officials say.
The measles, mumps and rubella vaccination rate for Williams County kindergarten students is 81% for the 2024-25 school year, down from 87% two years ago, according to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services. The rate is 95% for seventh graders and 97% for 11th graders. Public health officials say 95% is needed to prevent community spread.
The Upper Missouri District Health Unit, which serves Williams County as well as Divide, McKenzie and Mountrail counties, is holding walk-in vaccination clinics at 110 W. Broadway, Williston, from 1-7 p.m. Thursday and 8:30 to 6 p.m. Friday.

“I feel like we maybe will be busy,” Clark said. “We’re fielding some phone calls today with people with questions, but you never know what that’ll look like when it actually becomes time.”
Clark said anyone experiencing cold symptoms or anyone who has been in contact with a carrier of the illness should not attend the vaccination clinic. Clark said those people should quarantine themselves for 21 days to prevent further spread of the disease.
“I think the biggest thing is, if they are a case contact or they are sick, don’t come to the clinic,” she said.
The vaccinations are not free of charge, she said, so clinic attendees will want to bring their private health insurance cards with them. Depending on their ages, those without health insurance could be eligible for reduced pricing through a state-funded vaccination program.
“I think there’s a lot of concern and I just recommend people go to trusted sites to get their information,” Clark said of community members who may be vaccine hesitant. She added the North Dakota Health and Human Services website is a good source for those looking for more information on the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.
Those planning on attending the walk-in MMR vaccine clinic in Williston can fill out the organization’s immunization consent form ahead of time to speed up the process once they arrive. The form can be found on the Upper Missouri District Health Unit website.
CHI St. Alexius Health medical center in Williston also urged people with symptoms to stay home and call a health care provider prior to coming to the clinic. CHI needed to temporarily close its Williston walk-in clinic on Wednesday after a possible measles exposure was reported, according to a social media post by the health care provider.
Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash. For information about measles, vaccines or local clinic availability, contact the HHS Immunization Unit at 701-328-2378 or visit hhs.nd.gov/measles.
Health officials also urged anyone who visited the Williston Walmart between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on April 29 to monitor for symptoms and contact a health care provider if symptoms develop.

(Justin Sullivan | Getty Images)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Army will hold a listening session in Charleston next week to get public input regarding proposed changes to the federal Clean Water Act that could redefine what waterways are subject to regulations and protected from certain kinds of pollution nationwide.
Two listening sessions will be held on Wednesday at the Kanawha County Courthouse, the first from 2:30 to 4:15 p.m. and the second from 4:15 to ,6 p.m., according to a news release from the EPA. Attendees can participate virtually or in person by registering for the listening sessions here.
The federal agencies, according to the news release, are looking to “understand real-world perspectives and experiences” regarding how the “Waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, are defined in the Clean Water Act. 
Since the 1970s, WOTUS has been used to refer to nearly all waterways in the nation, including wetlands and smaller streams and tributaries that run adjacent to them. The term, however, has never been clearly defined, making regulation of certain waterways more difficult.
In 2023, a decision from the Supreme Court of the United States narrowed the protections and regulations for wetlands, which provide habitats for thousands of species of animals and plants and can play a crucial role in controlling floodplains in areas prone to flooding as well as naturally filtering drinking water.
The Supreme Court decision led to an amendment to the federal rule from the EPA, which has since been mired in litigation and contention. Under the amendment offered in 2023, more than half of the nation’s remaining wetlands have no EPA regulations or protections over them. 
In March, the EPA — operating under President Donald Trump’s direction — issued a new interpretation of the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision that further erodes protections, which experts say will disproportionately impact rural communities. 
Wetland conservancy groups and environmentalists from across the country have spoken out against the changes to the federal Clean Water Act. Meanwhile, the American Farm Bureau Federation — a lobbying group representing industrial farming throughout the nation — wants to see the changes made to relieve what they say is a burden for the farm industry, which is responsible for runoff and toxic pollution into thousands of tributaries and wetlands nationwide.
The listening sessions in Charleston are just a few of those being held across the nation in recent and coming weeks.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Birdwetlands-scaled-1-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-05-09 16:08:06.834392

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Three men are on the ballot in Tuesday’s special election to fill a vacant Oklahoma Senate seat that represents constituents living in five counties.
The Senate District 8 seat, which represents Okmulgee, Okfuskee and McIntosh counties and portions of Creek and Muskogee counties,  has been vacant all session, following the resignation of former Sen. Roger Thompson, R-Okemah. 
Republican Bryan Logan of Paden, Democrat Nathan Brewer and independent Steve Sanford, both of Henryetta, are on the ballot.
Logan, 41, is self-employed and a pastor at Paden Holiness Church.
He said he is running “to make a difference in the district.”
He said his top issues are education, health care, roads and infrastructure.
Brewer, 41, said the murder of his daughter at the hands of a sex offender motivated him to run.
Brewer, who is a small business owner and works full time for Okmulgee County, said not enough is being done to protect children and the community from sex offenders.
Brewer’s 15-year-old daughter, Brittany, was one of seven people killed in a murder-suicide on a rural property in May 2023.  Authorities said Jesse McFadden, who was a registered sex offender, killed his wife and five teenagers before killing himself. Brittany was visiting the property when the slayings occurred.
Brewer said he plans to prioritize increasing  mental health care availability in rural communities and growing funding for volunteer and rural fire departments.
Sanford, 58, is a member of the Henryetta City Council and owns Rustler’s BBQ.
“If you want to make a difference, you have to put yourself in a place where you can,” he said.
He would like to increase the availability of vocational education and help the community grow.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Fabian Schmidt, the German-American man who was detained by immigration officials in March and held at a detention center in Rhode Island, has returned to his home in Nashua, New Hampshire, his family said on social media.
“FABIAN IS FREE and HOME!!!!” his partner, Bhavani Hodgkins, wrote on Facebook Thursday. “We ask for your patience and privacy as we navigate through this.”
In the post, Hodgkins said she’d be providing updates and a video at a later date.
Schmidt was born in Germany but has lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager. He is a legal permanent resident with a green card. On March 7, Schmidt, who currently lives in New Hampshire, was returning from Luxembourg when immigration officials detained him at Boston Logan International Airport and took him to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island, according to his attorney.
His family told reporters and attorneys that upon being detained, Schmidt was stripped naked, placed in a cold shower, violently interrogated, denied his medication for anxiety and depression, and given little food or water. They said officials asked him to relinquish his green card, and they didn’t know why he was being detained.
Officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security denied the allegations.
“These claims are blatantly false with respect to CBP,” Hilton Beckham, assistant commissioner of public affairs for Customs and Border Protection previously said in a statement to the Bulletin. “When an individual is found with drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action.”
The officials did not publicly provide justification for his detention.
Schmidt is not the subject of any active criminal proceedings. However, according to court records in California, he faced misdemeanor charges for possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence in 2015 and 2016, respectively, among other minor charges. His family said those cases had been resolved.
GBH News was the first to report the news of Schmidt’s release.
His detention came amid the Trump administration’s high-profile immigration agenda. That agenda has included a slew of deportations and immigration actions, including sending hundreds of men to a famously brutal prison in El Salvador. Among them is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the administration has acknowledged was mistakenly deported. International students who protested on their college campuses against Israeli military strikes on Palestinian civilians have also been detained.
Additionally, other Germans have faced issues at U.S. borders. The New York Times reported that two German tourists — Jessica Brösche, who was held for 46 days, and Lucas Sielaff, who was held for 16 — were detained at the border trying to enter the country for vacation. Tourists from Germany are typically allowed visa-free travel to the U.S. for up to 90 days, but they were held in detention centers for weeks and then deported.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis continued his full-fledged campaign on Friday to get the Florida Legislature to back his idea of providing immediate targeted property tax relief this year to Floridians, and for lawmakers to jettison their proposed sales tax cut.
Speaking in Tampa earlier this week, the governor declared that any tax package sent to his desk that features a sales tax component would be “dead on arrival.” That comment has now led to an apparent breakdown between legislative leaders in trying to come together on the state budget, which forced them late last week to extend the legislative session into June.
DeSantis and Hernando County Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia said in Tampa this week that they have encountered very few members of the public who say they’d rather have a cut in the sales tax vs. property taxes, and a public opinion survey of Floridians released on Friday seems to back up the anecdotal evidence.
In the survey of 1,200 Floridians taken in April for the James Madison Institute, 46% said they support eliminating property taxes while 32% supported reducing sales taxes. Another 12% said they preferred keeping things status quo.
When asked whether they support eliminating property taxes by expanding the homestead exemption for primary residents, 65% said yes while just 24% opposed that proposal. Another 11% were unsure.
However, following that question up, 60% said that they were concerned about how elimination of property taxes would affect potential cuts to local services, such as law enforcement and public schools. Only 33% of voters said that they were not concerned about that outcome.
If policymakers want to eliminate property taxes, they would need to raise $43 billion (or $2,015 per Floridian) to maintain public services now funded with property tax revenue, the Florida Policy Institute recently wrote in a report titled, “A Risky Proposition.”
House Speaker Daniel Perez said last week that because the Florida Constitution prohibits the Legislature from exercising direct control over property taxes, any such reform would need to go before the voters on the November 2026 ballot. That’s why, he said, there is a need for his Select Committee on Property Taxes to study the issue.
The 37 lawmakers on the committee will prepare a Joint Resolution by this fall to allow lawmakers to put the question on the ballot next year. It would require 60% support to pass.
DeSantis has said that the committee has been set up to fail, noting that Perez appointed several “far-left Democrats” who the governor predicts will end up voting against such a proposal.
The James Madison Institute survey was conducted by Targoz Market Research of 1,200 voters, 43% of whom said they were Republicans, 33% Democrats, and 23% independent voters. It has a +/- margin of error of 2.77%.

(Photo: Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)A trio of federal judges appeared skeptical on Friday of arguments advanced by attorneys for the state of North Carolina in a voting rights case involving the issue of voting by people with past felony convictions. The state is seeking to overturn a lower court ruling that struck down a statute criminalizing voting by disenfranchised felons as racially discriminatory.
The case concerns a state law making it a felony for anyone who has lost their right to vote following a criminal conviction to cast a ballot unless they have had their right restored. The North Carolina A. Phillip Randolph Institute (APRI), a nonprofit affiliate of the AFL-CIO, filed suit in 2020 on the grounds that prosecuting individuals who unknowingly vote while ineligible is an unconstitutional violation of due process and equal protection rights. The nonprofit also contended that the law has a chilling effect on North Carolinians with criminal convictions who have since regained their eligibility.
In 2023, the General Assembly passed an updated version of the law — explicitly excluding unintentional voting violations from prosecution — and set it to take effect for any offenses taking place on or after Dec. 1 of that year. Federal Judge Loretta Biggs ruled in April 2024 that the prior statute unconstitutionally discriminated against Black North Carolinians on both grounds, and permanently enjoined its enforcement, finding that the legislature did not repeal the previous law when it rewrote it.
The North Carolina State Board of Elections appealed the ruling, arguing that: a) the district court should not have granted relief in light of the new law, b) APRI no longer had a concrete interest in the case, and c) the matter should be declared moot. The board did not dispute the contention that because North Carolina has no statute of limitations for felonies, voters could still face prosecution for ballots cast in past elections.

The panel on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals — judges James Wynn Jr., Pamela Harris, and DeAndrea Benjamin — grilled lawyers for the board and the state Conference of District Attorneys Friday on why they would want the law to remain on the books when it was replaced by a new statute in 2023, unless they sought to prosecute under the old law.
Terence Steed, an attorney with the North Carolina Department of Justice representing the board, noted that APRI was not challenging the new law and said “there’s no evidence in the record” that the previous law would be enforced, even if it legally could be.
“Can I ask why you’re here, then?” Harris asked. “If there will not be prosecutions under the old law, I truly don’t understand why you’re here.”
“There’s important principles of mootness in this case,” Steed replied. “When our office defends statutes, which it is frequently called upon to do, it is not uncommon — just as it is in Virginia and all the other states in the circuit and across the country — that the General Assembly, during the pendency of that litigation, might step in and amend the law to correct what the plaintiffs are concerned about.”
Harris said while that may be true, she had “never seen anything like this” in which a state nonetheless appeals an injunction against enforcing a law that has been made obsolete. She asked why the old law could still be enforced after the passage of its replacement, to which Steed replied that he was “not sure how it would work under North Carolina law, and that’s not an issue I was prepared for” — a statement that Wynn chided him for.
“I don’t understand at all what you’re arguing here when you say you don’t understand how it operates under North Carolina law,” Wynn said. “You’re representing the state of North Carolina, we expect you to know that.”
Judges also pressed Elizabeth O’Brien, an attorney with NCDOJ representing the Conference of District Attorneys, on whether she was arguing the state should be able to prosecute offenses prior to 2024 under the old law.
“I think that the way the statute was amended provides that those prosecutions could occur,” O’Brien said.
  Judge James A. Wynn Jr. expressed skepticism toward attorneys for North Carolina, noting that if they did not uphold the district court ruling, prosecutions could continue under the old statute. (File photo)
“That’s the point we’re making,” Wynn interjected. “You’ve just admitted, you just presented why it’s not moot. You say they could occur, and so if they can occur if we don’t uphold the district court, then essentially, you’re saying you should have two statutes you can prosecute under.”
Jonathan Youngwood, the attorney representing APRI, said if anything, the new law creates more of an interest in relief to prevent voter misinformation about their voting rights. He cited the confusion in the courtroom as evidence that voters with criminal convictions whose rights had been restored could easily be misled into thinking it was still unlawful for them to vote.
“North Carolina has no statute of limitations on felony charges. That means any person who voted in a prior election and some DA, someday decides could be subject to this old discriminatory law, could be prosecuted,” Youngwood said.
He said the General Assembly’s amendment was insufficient to counter this issue, arguing that because it said it is “effective to acts going forward,” it does not repeal the previous statute by implication. And he noted that at the time of discovery in 2022, there were 200 active cases related to the law. “All those cases could be live,” Youngwood said.
“Your Honor, I wish we could make some deal that there wouldn’t be future prosecutions. The only way we know it is the way we pursued it in the district court, which was to seek an order making it clear,” Youngwood said. “We hoped the case wouldn’t be appealed, it was appealed, and so we’re taking up your time this morning.”
Wynn asked whether it would be sufficient to uphold the district court order on only one of the grounds: either as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause or a violation of the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Youngwood replied that while he did not presume to tell them how to write their decision, either would be adequate relief so long as it would “permanently wipe the statute from the books.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fourth-Circuit-richmond-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 15:09:34.176217

(Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Washington and 14 other states are suing the Trump administration over the president’s declaration of an “energy emergency” to speed up permitting for fossil fuel projects.
Issued the day of his inauguration, President Donald Trump’s executive order says inadequate domestic energy development and an unreliable grid warrant the national emergency. The order argues these issues are most pronounced in the Northeast and on the West Coast.
“Dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population,” the order reads. 
The order pushes federal agencies, like the Army Corps of Engineers, to use “any lawful emergency authorities” to “facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands.”
In practice, this has meant bypassing or quickening reviews under the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and the Historic National Preservation Act for planned energy projects and giving the public less time to weigh in, according to the complaint filed Friday in federal court in Seattle. Washington and California lead the 15-state lawsuit.
The lawsuit cites a proposed 100-mile transmission line that would mostly run under the riverbed of the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon. The project could be expedited despite water quality concerns.
Attorney General Nick Brown noted Trump’s order emphasizes oil and natural gas, while excluding renewable energy like wind and solar. 
“This is not a serious or lawful effort by the president,” Brown said in a press conference Friday. “It is all about limiting competition and shackling America to dirty fossil fuels forever.”
Last month, the Interior Department announced it would fast-track the approval of coal, gas, oil and mineral projects on public lands in light of Trump’s emergency declaration. Environmental reviews that can typically take a year would be shrunk to two weeks.
Meanwhile, the United States produces more oil and gas than any other country and production is growing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The energy emergency order is separate from one the president issued last month targeting state climate policies, including potentially Washington’s Climate Commitment Act.
Casey Sixkiller, the director of the state Department of Ecology, said the emergency declaration is “an abuse of authority.”
“Environmental regulations aren’t red tape,” Sixkiller told reporters. “There are guardrails that protect our air, water, land and keep people safe.” 
Bill Iyall, chair of the Cowlitz Tribe, said it’s difficult to weigh in on what projects will mean for the tribe’s land when they only have a week or two.
“We are there to advocate for our cultural and natural resources,” Iyall said. “Looking at a project individually, if you did it carefully and planned it carefully, you would be able to minimize those impacts and get a facilitated permit.”
The lawsuit asks a judge to declare the president’s order illegal and stop the issuance of emergency permits. The states are not seeking a temporary restraining order to immediately stop the Trump administration’s actions, as it has in other cases.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

(George Frey | Getty Images)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Friday issued guidance for how families who object to vaccines on religious and philosophical grounds can receive exemptions to the state’s school immunization requirements.
While the state’s compulsory school vaccination law has not changed, the governor does not intend to rescind his executive order granting religious and philosophical exemptions, according to a news release Friday.
“I am calling on the State Superintendent of Schools and the county boards of education in this state to work with the Bureau for Public Health to ensure that religious rights of students are protected,” Morrisey said. “Students will not be denied access to public education because of their religious objections to compulsory vaccination.”
In his letter Friday, Morrisey acknowledged that the state cannot compel private schools to exempt children without a statutory change, but he urged the schools to “honor the religious beliefs of their students and not turn them away because of their strongly held objections to vaccines.”
West Virginia state law includes one of the strongest school vaccination policies in the nation. All states require children attending school to be vaccinated for a number of infectious diseases, like polio and measles. West Virginia was one of only five states that allowed only medical exemptions to those vaccination requirements.
In a Jan. 14 executive order, Morrisey directed the State Health Officer and the Bureau for Public Health to establish a process for religious exemptions and come up with necessary rules and legislation to facilitate them. West Virginia’s last health officer, Dr. Matthew Christiansen, resigned in December. Morrisey has not appointed someone to fill the role.
State lawmakers rejected a bill that would have established religious exemptions in state code. The measure, Senate Bill 460, passed in the Senate but was rejected by the House of Delegates with a vote of 42 yeas and 56 nays.
The disagreement between the state’s executive and legislative branch has led to confusion among the state’s schools and daycare facilities. Some private schools in particular have said they’re not following the executive order.
The Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston — which operates 24 schools throughout the state — will not accept religious exemptions for required school vaccinations despite the executive order, Tim Bishop, communications director for the church, told West Virginia Watch this week.
West Virginia state School Superintendent Michele Blatt put out a memo to county boards of education on May 2 saying that since the state Legislature didn’t adopt the bill allowing religious exemptions, students who enroll with an exemption prior to May 1 would be allowed to finish the school year. But, the memo continued, students would not be allowed to enroll in the upcoming school year without the required immunizations. Before the day was over, Blatt rescinded the memo at Morrisey’s request and said the school system would work collaboratively with the governor’s office to issue guidance to counties about how to comply with the order.
According to the governor’s guidance, parents seeking a religious or philosophical exemption to a vaccine should send an email to vaccineexemption@wv.gov with the following information:


Name and date of birth of the student seeking an exemption


Name of the student’s parent or guardian


The school the student intends to enroll in


 A mailing address for the parent or guardian.


The Bureau for Public Health will mail a letter to the parent telling them whether the exemption has been granted, and a copy of the letter will be sent to the school, Morrisey’s letter says. Exemptions will be granted on a per-year basis.
Morrisey told public school officials that when a student receives an exemption, the exemption should be honored by the school the student is enrolled in and the student should be allowed to attend virtual and in-person classes without the vaccination they’re exempted from getting.
Morrisey’s executive order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act, a 2023 law signed by former Gov. Jim Justice. The law prohibits government action that substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion unless it serves a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive way of achieving that interest. In his letter Friday, Morrisey argued that the order takes precedence over state law because the legislature wrote that the EPRA applies “notwithstanding any other provision of law.”
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, told West Virginia Watch earlier this week the Legislature has the authority to set the school vaccination policy and the governor does not. Garcia, an attorney by trade, said the matter would likely have to be settled by a lawsuit.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/vaccination-shot.jpg,,,2025-05-09 15:09:34.176217

Fabian Schmidt of Nashua was released from Wyatt this week and is now back at home. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Fabian Schmidt, the German-American man who was detained by immigration officials in March and held at a Rhode Island jail, has returned to his home in Nashua, his family said on social media.
“FABIAN IS FREE and HOME!!!!” his partner, Bhavani Hodgkins, wrote on Facebook Thursday. “We ask for your patience and privacy as we navigate through this.”
In the post, Hodgkins said she’d be providing updates and a video at a later date.
Schmidt was born in Germany but has lived in the U.S. since he was a teenager. He is a legal permanent resident with a green card. On March 7, Schmidt, who currently lives in New Hampshire, was returning from Luxembourg when immigration officials detained him at Boston Logan International Airport and took him to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island, according to his attorney.
His family told reporters and attorneys that upon being detained, Schmidt was stripped naked, placed in a cold shower, violently interrogated, denied his medication for anxiety and depression, and given little food or water. They said officials asked him to relinquish his green card, and they didn’t know why he was being detained.
Officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security denied the allegations.
“These claims are blatantly false with respect to CBP,” Hilton Beckham, assistant commissioner of public affairs for Customs and Border Protection previously said in a statement to the Bulletin. “When an individual is found with drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action.”
The officials did not publicly provide justification for his detention.
Schmidt is not the subject of any active criminal proceedings. However, according to court records in California, he faced misdemeanor charges for possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence in 2015 and 2016, respectively, among other minor charges. His family said those cases had been resolved.
GBH News was the first to report the news of Schmidt’s release.
His detention came amid the Trump administration’s high-profile immigration agenda. That agenda has included a slew of deportations and immigration actions, including sending hundreds of men to a famously brutal prison in El Salvador. Among them is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the administration has acknowledged was mistakenly deported. International students who protested on their college campuses against Israeli military strikes on Palestinian civilians have also been detained. 
Additionally, other Germans have faced issues at U.S. borders. The New York Times reported that two German tourists — Jessica Brösche, who was held for 46 days, and Lucas Sielaff, who was held for 16 — were detained at the border trying to enter the country for vacation. Tourists from Germany are typically allowed visa-free travel to the U.S. for up to 90 days, but they were held in detention centers for weeks and then deported.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/wyattdetention-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 15:09:34.176217

Photo courtesy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Movement on a project to block invasive carp from the Great Lakes could be on the horizon, according to the Detroit News, which says President Donald Trump is expected to sign a memo Friday afternoon directing his administration to “expeditiously implement” measures to prevent their migration and expansion into the region. 
The memo offers its express support for the $1.15 billion Brandon Road Lock and Dam project, “provided that the State of Illinois does not stand in the way of its construction.”
Last July, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the state would cosponsor the project alongside the United States Army Corps. of Engineers and the state of Illinois. The project targets a critical pinch point near Joliet, Ill., and would implement a series of complex deterrents against invasive carp and other nuisance species. 
Whitmer pledged $64 million in support of the project, matching $50 million from Illinois and unlocking $274 million in federal funding for the effort.
While Michigan announced its first construction contract for the effort back in December, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a vocal Trump critic, has refused to move forward on the effort without a commitment from the president to supply the funds appropriated to the project, including $226 million allotted through President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan infrastructure law. 
During a meeting with Whitmer and Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall in April, Trump pledged to protect Lake Michigan, and by extension all of the Great Lakes, from the invasive fish. However, Pritzker remained unswayed, despite pressure from members of Michigan’s Republican Congressional delegation. 
Members of the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives advanced a bipartisan resolution on Wednesday calling on Pritzker to move forward with the project to prevent the carp from spreading into the Great Lakes. 
The Michigan Department of Natural Resources warns that if invasive carp move into the Great Lakes, they could outcompete native species and greatly harm the ecology and economy of the entire Great Lakes region including rivers and inland lakes, and its $20 billion fishing and boating industries. 
The fish can grow up to 60 pounds and eat 40% of their body weight each day. A single female can produce one million eggs, with only 10 females and 10 males needed to establish a population in the Great Lakes.

States are moving to strengthen protections against human trafficking, but some advocates warn that federal funding cuts could undermine efforts to support survivors.
This year, lawmakers in several states have introduced bills to expand education, strengthen penalties and fund survivor support. But some victim service providers say these efforts might fall short, with millions of dollars in federal cuts threatening programs that help trafficking victims heal and rebuild their lives.
Human trafficking is the exploitation of people through force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of sex or labor. It often involves victims who lack control over their circumstances — whether due to threats, manipulation or economic dependency — and can occur in both illicit and legal industries, from commercial sex work to agriculture, domestic work and construction.
A poll released in March by the University of California, Irvine and the anti-trafficking nonprofit EverFree found that while nearly 99% of Americans view trafficking as a global and national issue, only about 80% believe it’s a problem in their own state — a gap that hinders local prevention efforts, experts say.
The poll, which was conducted in October, also found that just 19% of respondents ranked human trafficking as a top national concern.
“Because it’s such a dark, challenging issue, there’s a dissonance that happens where you don’t want to believe that [trafficking] happens in your community,” Kelsey Morgan, the CEO and co-founder of EverFree, said in an interview. “To admit or to acknowledge that it’s happening in your community requires action.”
Lawmakers across the country are considering or have already passed a range of bills this year aimed at curbing human trafficking and supporting survivors. Many approaches focus on prevention, education, tougher penalties and expanding support services.
In Michigan, a pair of new laws will allow certain hearsay statements from trafficking survivors to be admitted in court and permit relevant prior acts to be used as evidence in human trafficking cases. In March, Utah enacted a law that increases criminal penalties for sex and labor trafficking offenses. In Tennessee, a new law set to take effect next year requires tattoo artists to complete up to one hour of training on recognizing and reporting signs of trafficking.
In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a “Survivor Support Fund” and criminalize loitering with the intent to purchase sex. The Oregon House passed legislation in April targeting illicit massage businesses by expanding enforcement authority and increasing criminal penalties and fines.
Other states are taking steps to raise awareness and improve accountability. The Florida and Montana legislatures passed bills mandating trafficking prevention education and training in schools. Both bills await action by governors.
A bill in Indiana would require gas stations, rest areas and welcome centers to display trafficking awareness posters, and mandate training for employees at food and lodging establishments. It passed in April and was sent to the governor.
Lawmakers in Florida and Georgia also have passed legislation that aims to strengthen criminal trafficking penalties, particularly in trafficking cases involving children or people with disabilities.
Minnesota is weighing several new proposals, including one to increase oversight of adult entertainment venues and massage parlors. The governor signed into law another measure that will require biennial legislative reports on the state’s child trafficking prevention efforts.
 Funding to help victims recover

Some advocates say the legislation nationwide reflects growing awareness of trafficking’s scope — but caution that without consistent funding for victim services and a deeper public understanding of the issue, laws alone won’t be enough to support survivors or prevent trafficking.
In late April, the U.S. Department of Justice canceled 365 federal public safety grants — including some that supported anti-human trafficking programs — disrupting a wide range of services for crime victims, local police departments and correctional facilities.
Since then, the department has restored at least two of the canceled grants — one supporting a national crime victim hotline and another funding a national domestic violence network.
The cuts, which totaled $811 million, were administered through the Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, which awarded roughly $3 billion in competitive grants during the 2024 fiscal year, according to Reuters.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way.
 Underreported to police

Human trafficking data in the United States is limited, but available figures suggest the problem is both widespread and underreported.
FBI data shows that in 2023, there were 2,584 reported trafficking incidents and 3,117 identified victims — a sharp increase from just 22 incidents in 2013, when the agency began tracking trafficking through its Uniform Crime Reporting system. The rise is largely attributed to more law enforcement agencies participating in the data collection system.
Separate data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which offers support to victims, identified 9,619 trafficking cases in 2023 — up from 5,551 in 2015. In 2023, the hotline received more than 30,000 tips, or “signals.”
Experts and advocates emphasize that both the hotline and the crime data capture only a fraction of trafficking incidents, given the hidden nature of the crime and the barriers victims face in reporting to police.
Although national data struggles to capture the full scope of trafficking, Minnesota is among the states that have taken extra steps to build their own data collection systems to better understand the issue and support victims.
Its efforts have drawn attention for state officials’ focus on both urban and rural communities, as well as on Native populations that often face barriers to accessing services.
Experts say it’s a common misconception that trafficking is primarily an urban issue — in reality, it can and does happen everywhere.
Still, some victims — including boys and men — may be overlooked.
“Sometimes for male youth, they are not identified as victims. They may show up in the criminal justice system as defendants or they may be adjudicated as juvenile delinquents,” said Caroline Palmer, the human trafficking prevention director at the Minnesota Department of Health. “There’s not really a close look at what might be happening in the background in terms of their victimization and trafficking exploitation.”
Palmer noted that while Minnesota offers programming for all genders, some male-identifying people may not feel comfortable with certain services, highlighting the need for more tailored support to meet everyone’s unique needs.
More than three-quarters of respondents to the UC Irvine-EverFree poll said being a woman greatly increases the risk of trafficking, but only 2% of respondents said the same about men — despite the fact that trafficking affects people of all genders.
Public perceptions about survivors were also influenced by the victim’s age: While 83% of respondents believe minors who are trafficked are always victims, only 61% say the same about adults — a gap that, advocates warn, can contribute to the criminalization of adult survivors.

Without directly addressing the merits of Iowa’s law restricting the dissemination of government records in languages other than English, the court found that the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa lacked standing to bring its lawsuit challenging the state’s application of the English Language Reaffirmation Act.
Joe Enriquez Henry, president of LULAC Council #307, said he was disappointed in the court’s decision.
“There are over 50,000 registered voters in the state of Iowa whose primary language is not English,” Henry said. “This issue has an impact not only on Latinos but other ethnic groups and new citizens. This is a constitutional issue. You know, the right to vote is a constitutional issue, and language should never be a barrier to exercising that right. So, for the Supreme Court to say we lack standing to bring this case is totally wrong.”

Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said in a statement: “I appreciate the court’s thoughtful consideration of this case. Today’s ruling affirms our efforts to administer Iowa election laws securely, fairly, and in accordance with state and federal laws. We remain committed to maintaining a careful balance between protecting election integrity and supporting voter participation among all eligible Iowa voters.”
Friday’s ruling is tied to a 2007 case in which LULAC was not a party. In that case, a group that included then-U.S. Rep. Steve King, four county auditors, three state legislators and U.S. English Only Inc. filed a lawsuit against Iowa’s secretary of state and the Iowa Voter Registration Commission challenging the provision of voter registration forms in languages other than English.
The district court dismissed the claims of everyone but the county auditors, ruling only they had the standing to challenge the practice, and in 2008 ruled in favor of the auditors, finding that the Iowa English Language Reaffirmation Act unambiguously required all official government documents to be in English. While noting that language barriers could “serve as an impediment to voting” and that exceptions outlined in the law “might justify the use of non-English voter registration forms,” the judge noted that the secretary of state had never raised that argument.
The district court enjoined the secretary of state and the Iowa Voter Registration Commission “from using languages other than English in the official voter registration forms of this state.”
Thirteen years later, in 2021, LULAC sued Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the Iowa Voter Registration Commission, and several county auditors, arguing the law, correctly interpreted, allowed for the dissemination of voting materials in languages other than English.  The district court ultimately granted LULAC’s requests to dissolve the 2008 injunction.
Pate’s office appealed, and in addressing the matter, the Iowa Supreme Court said the primary question it faced was whether LULAC had standing to seek dissolution of the 13-year-old permanent injunction issued in the initial case and to seek a court interpretation of a law that did not cause any injury to LULAC itself.
In its ruling Friday, the justices concluded the district court’s 2008 decision “had no effect on LULAC’s rights, status, or legal relations … LULAC asks us to direct Secretary Pate to administer the law as LULAC wishes and to allow county officials to have the discretion to administer the law as LULAC wishes. In effect, LULAC is asking the judiciary to exercise the executive functions of the government at LULAC’s behest. This the court cannot do.”
As for LULAC’s argument that it had standing in the case due to the injury it suffered by having to spend money translating documents for members, the justices noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has previously ruled that a litigant “cannot spend its way into standing simply by expending money” in response to a law it is attempting challenge.
In finding that LULAC lacked standing to bring its lawsuit, the justices reversed the rulings of the district court and remanded the case back to district court for an order of dismissal. All of the justices concurred in the opinion, except for Justices Thomas D. Waterman and Edward M. Mansfield, who did not take part.

These mega-plants could soon compete with existing industries to buy timber, wood chips, and sawmill residues as raw material for wood pellet manufacture.  The wood pellets would be exported and burned in power plants in Asia to generate electricity. 
Some critics have raised concerns about how these industrial-scale wood pellet plants could lead to the overharvesting of Pacific Northwest forests, similar to how large swaths of forests in the southeastern U.S. were logged despite promises that the plants would only use leftover timber scraps. This is a serious concern, compounded by recent federal cuts that could lead to lax forestry oversight. But another equally important concern on the minds of Washington residents is this: How will our health be harmed?
These concerns are not hypothetical. Those of us who live in the communities targeted for pellet-plant construction are learning about the serious health impacts associated with these plants. We have spent hours on the phone talking with people who live in the South, where the wood pellet industry is already established.      
There’s no way around it – producing wood pellets from forest biomass is dirty, noisy and bad for our health. Making industrial wood pellets releases hazardous air pollutants, dust and fine particles. Colleagues from the South who live near these facilities describe how dust is ever-present in the air, clinging to every surface and burrowing deep into residents’ lungs.
Micro-particles are released by industrial biomass plants, worsening asthma, causing other significant respiratory issues and can even trigger heart attacks in vulnerable individuals. The release of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less is of particular concern because these particles penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream.
Other pollutants emitted in large quantities include acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, both probable carcinogens, and acrolein, a toxic substance that affects the eyes, skin, nose, and throat and can cause respiratory disease. 
And then there’s the noise. Hammer mills, the machines that break down trees and wood chips into the wood fibers used to make the pellets, are described as “like the loudest train whistle you’ve ever heard, but constant.” The facility proposed for Hoquiam, similar in size to the plant proposed for Longview, is less than a mile from the Hoquiam High School and Middle School buildings and even closer to the Grays Harbor National Wildlife Refuge, one of the most important stopovers for migratory birds on the entire Pacific flyway.  
One of the pellet companies trying to set up in Washington, Drax Global, a U.K. company positioning to open the Longview plant, currently operates wood pellet plants in several southern states. In the last few years, the state of Mississippi fined Drax $2.5 million for violating air emissions limits, and Drax agreed to pay $3.2 million in pollution-related settlements in Louisiana.
Fortunately, we’ve learned about the harms to communities from these plants before they’ve taken root in the Northwest. In Hoquiam, local and national conservation groups challenged an air discharge permit for Pacific Northwest Renewable Energy on the grounds that its pollution estimates were too low. A Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board hearing for this appeal is planned for May. 
Drax was similarly moving forward with its facility in Longview but withdrew its permit following scrutiny by its regional clean air agency.
We oppose the construction of these wood pellet plants in Hoquiam and Longview because of the pollution these plants would bring, and because the industry has not been honest about the health harms they cause in nearby communities.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1302915966-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 15:09:34.176217

Spencer Cox and his cabinet hold a news conference to announce GRIT, a new government efficiency initiative, at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City on May 9, 2025. (Courtesy of the Governor's Office)Gov. Spencer Cox signed an executive order on Friday launching a new government efficiency initiative called GRIT — Utah’s take on DOGE. 
But when pressed on whether it will lead to employee layoffs, Cox said he didn’t expect so because he sees the Government Reform, Innovation and Transparency project as yet another budgeting exercise on top of several that state leaders already practice to spend taxpayer dollars wisely in Utah’s $30.8 billion budget. 
“I’m not out there looking to just cut a whole bunch of jobs,” Cox told reporters during a news conference at the Utah Capitol, though he added, “we may need to move some people in some other ways that will be better. … But we’re trying to empower our employees to make things better, not trying to make our employees scared of their jobs.” 
Trump insists ‘good people’ shouldn’t lose their federal jobs, despite mass firings

But “the short answer is yes,” Cox said when asked whether GRIT was Utah’s version of the Department of Government Efficiency that was launched under President Donald Trump and Elon Musk to slash federal spending. 
However, Cox also said he hesitated to directly compare the two initiatives, because Utah leaders already do “about 10 things every year that the federal government hasn’t done in about 50 years” to audit government programs for efficiency. 
“DOGE is awesome and I desperately want DOGE to work,” Cox said. “We have a bloated federal government that is a disaster. We’ve been begging for something like DOGE for decades, and I’m so excited that it’s actually happening.” 
But as far as Utah is concerned, he said, “we do DOGE like six times a year in this state every single year.”
“We DOGE the hell out of our budget every single year,” Cox said, to chuckles from his cabinet leadership members standing behind him. “We were DOGE before DOGE was a thing. We were DOGE when it wasn’t cool, and we will be DOGE long after it is cool.” 
The Republican-controlled state already has several layers of yearly budgeting processes where both the executive and legislative branches hunt for cuts.

The governor’s office does it while preparing its budget recommendation to the Legislature. Lawmakers sitting on legislative committees go through their own process, line item by line item. Then legislative leaders on the powerful Executive Appropriations Committee make the near-final decisions, deciding what new funding requests get prioritized, what doesn’t, and what should be cut. Then the Utah Legislature votes as a whole on the state’s budget, which is balanced every single year. Finally, the governor can also use his pen to veto budget line items, if he wishes. 
Plus, legislative auditors also pick several agencies a year to find inefficiencies, which Cox likened to “going to get your physical exam when you’re 50.”  
So why GRIT? Cox said it’s because “the question I always have is, how can we be better?”
“You don’t stay No. 1 by just doing the things that you’ve always done,” he said. “We have to be constantly improving.” 
For 18th year, Utah ranks No. 1 for best economic outlook. What could threaten its top spot?

That was one piece of praise that leaders from the “limited government” think tank, the American Legislative Exchange Council, offered to Utah when they ranked the state’s economic outlook No. 1 for the 18th year in a row last month. Cox pointed to that ranking — and the U.S. News & World report ranking Utah the No. 1 best state in the nation for a third straight year earlier this week — as evidence that Utah is the “best managed state.” 
“(ALEC) said if we had just stopped 18 years ago, where we were when we were first No. 1, we would now be 22nd or 23rd,” the governor said. “So we’ve been able to maintain that by constantly reinventing ourselves, looking for ways to do things better.” 
Through Utah’s existing fiscal conservatism, “we’ve already done all the low-hanging fruit.” 
“That’s the difference between this and DOGE,” he said, saying the federal government has “so much low-hanging fruit,” while Utah will have to reach higher. “It’s going to be harder for us, for sure, but we know it can be done.” 
Pressed on whether GRIT could mean cuts to services — including social services — Cox said that’s not the aim. 
“It’s not (about) reducing services. It’s improving services,” he said, adding that he’d like to see any savings found to be recommitted toward making programs better, like perhaps moving people up on social services’ wait lists. 
“That’s ultimately what we’re trying to do, is not to just cut back what’s already working and helping people,” Cox said, “it’s so we can help people more and fill some of those gaps that are already out there and broken.”

What will GRIT do? 
Cox called GRIT “a comprehensive effort to make Utah’s government more efficient, more accountable, and more responsible to the people that it serves.” 
The governor said GRIT will have a “bottom-up” approach, involving state government employees to ask “tough questions about what is actually working, what’s wasting time and money, and what needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.” 
“If something isn’t delivering value to the citizens of this state, we should stop doing it, and do something else with those limited resources that we have,” he said.

With GRIT, “we are really going to empower even more our cabinet members and our employees — every one of our employees.” 
“We’re expecting them to bring real solutions,” he said. “And we’ll be holding them accountable to doing exactly that.” 
Additionally, Cox said state leaders will welcome feedback from Utahns about what is and isn’t working for them. 
Under Cox’s executive order, all state agencies will be required to: 

Submit at least one efficiency improvement project to the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget no later than July 1. 
Direct each division, office or bureau to independently launch at least one additional internal efficiency project. 
Participate in the state’s Efficiency and Process Improvement Collaborative, an advisory committee made up of representatives from state agencies that is tasked with fostering a culture of continuous improvement. 
Use public feedback gathered from the state’s Customer Experience Initiative, a program the Legislature created in 2020 that collects feedback from Utahns’ experiences with state employees and issues annual reports for improvement. 
Report “measurable results related to cost savings, time savings, and improved service delivery,” according to the governor’s office. 

The governor’s office encouraged Utahns to participate in the initiative by using QR codes that will be posted on receipts and in government buildings across the state, wherever Utahns engage with state services. They can also submit feedback online. 
For transparency, Cox also said the state will be “standing up dashboards” to show the initiative’s progress, “how much money we’ve been able to save, and how much time we’ve been able to shave off.” 
Cox said state leaders have “purposefully” not set a firm dollar amount of how much taxpayer money they’d like to save through the GRIT process because he said he wants to let agencies go through the exercise first. 
“We will eventually get to a goal, but I want to hear the best ideas,” he said, though while looking around at his cabinet members he added “we want this to be uncomfortable for the people standing behind me.” 
“That’s how you sharpen the saw.”

For years, outdoors enthusiasts in New Mexico have pushed to overhaul the state Department of Game & Fish — an agency plagued by leadership turnover, funding woes and the scorn of hunters and tree-huggers alike.
Now, state lawmakers have given the agency a new name, a new mission, new leadership and a boost in funding to expand its role. The sweeping law enacted in March puts New Mexico at the forefront of a growing movement to rethink states’ traditional model of wildlife management.
“We came from a place of extreme dysfunction,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, an environmental nonprofit that advocated for the new law. “Now, I truly do believe that we’re going to be a gold standard for wildlife management. Over the next few years. you’re going to see an unbelievable shift.”
New Mexico’s new approach expands the agency’s focus beyond hunting and fishing to protect more species and brings in new funding to reduce its reliance on license sales. Other states are watching closely. Lawmakers across the country have introduced bills to change their wildlife agencies, and many have cited the New Mexico measure as an example of what’s possible.
“That’s the biggest game changer,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a national nonprofit focused on overhauling states’ wildlife governance. “That’s the legislation we’ll be pointing to as a model in future years.”
From Oregon to Utah to Florida, legislators have introduced bills that would overhaul their wildlife agencies’ funding, mission and governance.
While the proposals have had varying levels of success, New Mexico leaders say it took years of coalition-building to get their bill across the finish line. Wildlife advocates expect the issue to earn more legislative attention nationwide in the years to come.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.
Under the traditional model, state wildlife agencies have largely been funded by the license fees paid by hunters and anglers, plus federal excise taxes on equipment such as guns and fishing tackle. The agencies have focused most of their work on species like deer and trout, prized by the sporting groups that provide their revenue.
In New Mexico, as in most states, the commissions that govern these departments have been appointed by governors. They’re often filled by hunting and fishing guides, ranchers and political donors. Critics say this model results in panels that set policy to protect their economic interests.
Today, many wildlife agencies are struggling to stay afloat as fewer and fewer residents hunt and fish. At the same time, plummeting wildlife populations are compelling agencies to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species. And some wildlife advocates are demanding a new governance model that puts more scientists in charge.
This year, state lawmakers across the country have passed or considered a host of major wildlife management overhauls. Some would expand their agencies’ mission to focus on non-game species. Others would provide new funding streams to take on that additional work. And some would change the makeup of the commissions that dictate wildlife policy.
In New Mexico, lawmakers did all three at once.
The state’s agency had faced numerous problems over the years. Hunters and bird-watchers alike were frustrated with the agency’s leadership. In recent years, several commissioners have resigned or been forced out by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. At times, the panel has lacked enough members to form a quorum.
The agency’s budget was in trouble as well. The state had not raised license fees in nearly 20 years, keeping revenue flat even as inflation made the cost of its work more and more expensive.
“We were having to repurpose money from on-the-ground conservation just to make salary adjustments,” said Stewart Liley, wildlife division chief with the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish. “We were getting to a precarious spot.”
In 2023, lawmakers passed a bill to restructure the agency’s commission, which would have taken some power away from the governor. Lujan Grisham declined to sign the bill, killing the effort with a pocket veto.




We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it’s the only one we’ve got.


– Jesse Deubel, New Mexico Wildlife Federation executive director



This year, lawmakers took a bigger swing. The package passed this session renames the Department of Game & Fish to the Department of Wildlife. It expands the agency’s authority to protect non-game species in need of conservation help.
“We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it’s the only one we’ve got,” said Deubel, of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “They’ve got a responsibility to work on any species in the state that has conservation need.”
Agency leaders say they were already conducting research and conservation work for non-game species. They viewed that aspect of the bill as a largely symbolic measure that “shined a light” on the need for more restoration work, Liley said. However, the law did provide more explicit authority for the agency to manage insects and regulate the direct “take,” or killing, of certain animals.
The measure raises license fees — a provision supported by many hunting and fishing groups — and allows for inflation-based adjustments in future years. Meanwhile, lawmakers included another $10.5 million from the state budget, spread over three years, to help the agency take on more non-game conservation.
“It seemed only fair that if we were going to ask the department to take on a broader role that they not finance that just through hunting and fishing,” said Democratic state Rep. Matthew McQueen, who was among the key sponsors.
Liley, the agency official, said the new money, along with a separate conservation fund established in 2023, will more than double the state’s investment in helping threatened species. The agency expects to hire up to eight new biologists who will conduct research, determine which species need aid and lead restoration efforts.
“This will help us get a better grasp of where we are with different species across the state,” he said. “There are absolutely projects we have not undertaken because of lack of capacity. This will allow us to do more surveys, to radio-mark birds, to [use that research] and say, ‘Let’s do forest restoration this way for pinyon jays.’”
The package will also change the agency’s governance. The current commission has seven seats, all appointed by the governor. Lujan Grisham’s appointees have included a car dealer, an Exxon Mobil lobbyist and a former lawmaker who owns an oil and gas business.
Under the new model, a bipartisan legislative committee will nominate three candidates for every seat, each of whom must be vetted to demonstrate their knowledge of wildlife. The governor must choose from among those three. One of the seats will be reserved for a wildlife scientist, one for a conservationist, one for a hunter and angler and one for a rancher or farmer.
“These changes add expertise and really important perspectives to the commission,” said Chris Smith, wildlife program director with WildEarth Guardians, an environmental nonprofit. “Our [current] commission was having structural problems and light scandal almost consistently.”
Backers’ one disappointment is that Lujan Grisham used a partial veto to strike a provision that would have protected commission members from dismissal by the governor. She argued that the proposed change relied too heavily on the slow-moving court system to remove commissioners, making it difficult to hold problematic members accountable.
Political appointees set state wildlife policy. Critics say that’s a problem.
Lawmakers say they’re still intent on protecting agency leaders from the governor’s whims, but pleased the rest of the package has gone into effect. While the measure passed with bipartisan majorities, some lawmakers objected to the idea of expanding the agency’s mission to protect species beyond those that can be hunted.
“With all due respect, I don’t want to pay for a butterfly,” said Republican state Rep. Harlan Vincent, according to KUNM. “I’m just being honest with you.”
And some groups are skeptical that the extra funding from the state budget will be enough to cover the agency’s growing conservation role.
“If New Mexico wants to expand the mission of the department, New Mexico needs to pay for it,” Tom Paterson, president-elect of the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association, said during a Senate committee hearing. “The necessary funds should not come on the back of the license fees that hunters and anglers pay.”
While the agency’s new funding and mission are now in place, its name change to the Department of Wildlife won’t take effect until next year. And its current commission will remain in office until Jan. 1, 2027. Lujan Grisham’s successor will then appoint new commissioners under the revised model.
The advocates who backed the New Mexico overhaul say it will take time and investment to make the new model work. They know other states will be watching closely.

Efforts to lobby Wyoming’s congressional delegation and administratively reauthorize the Wind River Reservation-focused office have not yet resulted in any assurances. 
The post Tribes urge Trump to undo planned DOGE closure of Fish and Wildlife’s Lander Conservation Office appeared first on WyoFile .","FORT WASHAKIE—Art Lawson sometimes feels like he’s doing the work of five people in his job overseeing wildlife on the Wind River Indian Reservation, a Yellowstone-sized landscape that’s home to the full suite of native species, from grizzly bears to wolverines. 
The Department of Government Efficiency’s planned closure of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Lander Conservation Office after its lease ends in March could increase the Shoshone and Arapaho Fish and Game director’s workload further yet. 
“That would give me three more jobs to do,” Lawson told WyoFile from his office this week. “It would put us in a world of hurt, without those guys.” 
The possible loss of the Lander Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office, which is devoted to assisting the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes, was worrisome enough that Lawson decamped from his west-central Wyoming home this spring to try to sway the outcome. 
“We hadn’t gotten any responses,” Lawson said. “I even flew to DC to get questions answered.”

But meetings with U.S. Sen. John Barrasso and U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman — two-thirds of Wyoming’s congressional delegation — yielded nothing, he said.
“They didn’t have any information to give,” Lawson said. 
The absence of information suggests that Wyoming’s delegation is also being kept in the dark about the reported federal office closures — there are at least seven — affecting their constituents.
Started by biologist Richard Baldes in the 1970s, the office and the Fish and Wildlife Service’s presence in the area were instrumental to the establishment of a tribal game code and the return of species like pronghorn and bighorn sheep, which had been drastically reduced by decades of unregulated hunting. 
“Dick Baldes, and everything he’s done in the past, it could all be wiped away in the blink of an eye,” Lawson said. “It’s pretty scary.” 
Lawson, who is a Northern Arapaho member, is not alone in encouraging the federal government to reconsider the planned closure of the Lander facility. This spring, the Eastern Shoshone Tribe’s business council signed off on a resolution that emphasized its support for the federal facility.

“Be it further resolved, that the Shoshone Business Council urges the federal government to restore funding for the Land[er] Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office and cease efforts to eliminate, reduce, or dismantle this office so that these critical activities and federal trust responsibilities continue,” the resolution reads. 
According to its website, the Fish and Wildlife Service’s Lander Office and the agency’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program have assisted in the restoration of over 50,000 acres of sage-steppe, 1,700 acres of wetlands and 26 miles of river. 
Support from the Eastern Shoshone Business Council was unanimous, the resolution stated. 
WyoFile’s efforts to reach the Northern Arapaho Business Council, whose members share the Wind River Indian Reservation with the Eastern Shoshone, were unsuccessful. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service’s leadership under the Trump administration is likely to include at least one official who’s familiar with the agency’s Lander Conservation Office. Wyomingite Josh Coursey, a longtime president of the Muley Fanatic Foundation, was presidentially appointed to a yet-to-be-titled Fish and Wildlife Service post last month. And the nominee for director, Brian Nesvik, is a former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director who’s cleared his first two congressional hearings and is awaiting confirmation from the full U.S. Senate.

Jason Baldes — Richard Baldes’ son — played a role in the Eastern Shoshone’s resolution. He said it remains to be seen if Nesvik will use his influence to advocate for the Lander office’s continuation. (Disclosure: Jason Baldes’ wife, Patti Baldes, is a member of WyoFile’s board of directors, which has no editorial oversight.)
“I would think that [Nesvik] would be amenable to understanding the tribe’s position, and that he wouldn’t dispute the importance of the Fish and Wildlife Service’s presence,” Jason Baldes said. “But how far is he going to take that? Is he going to ensure that the Lander Field Office remains?” 
In 1982, the Service’s Lander Conservation Office had been slated to close, according to Richard Baldes. Ultimately, however, it survived thanks to support from the tribes and Wyoming’s congressional delegation.

Some 43 years later, the push from Lawson, Baldes and the Eastern Shoshone Tribe has not yet produced the same outcome. Administratively, Fish and Wildlife staffers have also put in a request to reauthorize the Lander Conservation Office, according to a source familiar with the situation. WyoFile is granting the person anonymity because of fear of reprisal. But at least so far, efforts to protect one of Fish and Wildlife’s only offices focused on tribal land wildlife have fallen flat.
“It’s still canceled,” the source said. “Everybody is frustrated.” Fish and Wildlife’s public affairs office in Washington, D.C. — the regional communication teams were recently eliminated — did not respond to WyoFile’s inquiry by the time this story was published.

A legislative committee voted to draft 10 bills related to Wyoming’s elections at its first off-season meeting Thursday. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers go full steam ahead on election reform — again appeared first on WyoFile .","LANDER—Wyoming lawmakers filed a record number of election-related bills in this winter’s general session, but they showed little sign of slowing down Thursday on plans to remake the state’s election system. 
During its first meeting of the legislative off-season, the Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee voted to draft 10 pieces of election legislation. The bills range from banning ballot drop boxes and restricting independent candidates, to codifying hand-count audits of ballots and curtailing the use of student IDs and Medicaid and Medicare insurance cards as acceptable forms of voter identification. 
The slate represents just a fraction of the 45 bills filed in 2025, but is a considerable number for a committee to undertake heading into a legislative budget session when bills face a steeper initial hurdle compared to a general session. 
The legislation will, however, have the advantage of being well-trodden ground for lawmakers. Each of the 10 bills will be modeled after 2025 measures that failed only a few months ago. Several have long been hailed by Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who encouraged lawmakers Thursday to reconsider roughly 20 bills from the last session. 
That was too big a bite for the committee. 
“It’s kind of unrealistic for any committee to carry 20 bills into a session, especially a budget session,” Sen. Bill Landen, R-Casper, told the committee. “And we haven’t even touched on all the other issues we’ve got today.”
Electricity issues alongside 911 system funding and outage reporting were topics scheduled for that afternoon, while on Friday, the committee was set to discuss elected officials’ associations, public record laws and commercial transaction regulations. 
Meanwhile, the secretary encouraged lawmakers to keep the door open on some of the more sweeping election measures from 2025, including a ban on all electronic election equipment, including voting machines, tabulators and pollbooks.
“It’s something that we really need to be examining,” Gray said when pressed by House Minority Floor Leader Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, to clarify his stance on banning such equipment.

Gray also pointed to a forthcoming report from U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard regarding electronic voting equipment. The report is the result of an executive order by President Donald Trump from March that would largely put elections under presidential control. 
Gray’s predecessor, Ed Buchanan, put considerable efforts into debunking misinformation about Wyoming’s electronic voting equipment, including publishing a collection of facts about election integrity and security on the office’s website. After Gray took office, the website vanished. 
Ahead of the 2020 election, as the website detailed, Wyoming replaced its outdated voting equipment, none of which has the hardware or software required to allow internet connectivity, nor does the tabulation computer in each county have the hardware or software required to allow internet connectivity.
Gray’s comments Thursday followed a demonstration by several county clerks of the voting machines used across the state. 
“We have no intention of swaying your opinions about electronic voting systems, or to sell you on anything,” Platte County Clerk Malcolm Ervin told the committee. 
“Instead, we just want to provide information about what we are doing to allow you further context when you make decisions regarding those systems,” he said. “Again, our goal is not to lobby you, but our goal is to provide information.” 
Ervin pointed to a survey published by the Wyoming Survey & Analysis Center at the University of Wyoming in November ahead of the general election. It found that almost 90% of Wyoming adults believed their county’s tally of ballots for president in the 2025 election would be very or somewhat reliable. 
“This survey shows that confidence in elections grows when administrators of that election are close to home,” Ervin said. 
As part of their demonstration, the clerks walked lawmakers through their election timeline, dotted with dozens of deadlines. 
The clerks also used an electronic tabulator identical to the ones used in Wyoming’s elections to hold a mock election. Committee members filled out ballots deciding their favorite pet and school subject, and were then tasked with looking over the shoulders of election staff as they parsed out the results.

An identical election would be held at Baldwin Creek Elementary, Fremont County Clerk Julie Freese told lawmakers. 
“You might be a tough crowd, but the toughest crowd you’ll ever find is the group of fifth graders,” Freese said. “You’ll get every question under the sun. They are pretty amazing.”
For about half the Joint Corporations Committee, this is their first term as lawmakers, so Thursday’s meeting was also their first interim meeting. Plus, the majority of the committee is now made up of members and allies of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — the further-right wing of the Republican party in the Legislature. And most of the election bills of the 2025 session were sponsored by Freedom Caucus associates, who have said voters gave them a loud and clear mandate via the very system they want to reform. 
Several of those voters testified at the meeting. 
“The silent majority is finding their voice and speaking up and saying, ‘We need changes. We need things done,’” Patricia Junek told the committee. 
Junek lost a bid for the Legislature in 2022, and has since led a charge in Campbell County to count ballots by hand.
“I’m not going to single out any one bill that was presented by our secretary of state. I support every single one of them,” Junek said. 
But none of those bills focus on fixing the real issues with Wyoming’s elections, Phyllis Roseberry told the committee. 
“We do have a problem, and that is that our people are not turning out to vote. Twenty-seven percent of eligible voters in Wyoming voted in the primary this last year,” Roseberry, a former Washakie County pollworker, said. 
Roseberry was among the roughly 30 members of the League of Women Voters who filled the room in support of the county clerks. 
The committee’s next meeting is set for August, when members will have the option to draft additional election-related bills. At the very least, the committee will discuss the possibility of removing political parties from the election code after the Wyoming Republican Party disregarded a state law and a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling at its officer elections in Cody last weekend. The matter is now the subject of a lawsuit.

CHICAGO — The Trump administration took the unprecedented step of halting work on the next National Climate Assessment last week, dismissing all 400 volunteer scientists who were tasked with writing the new version of the report.

Illinois State Climatologist Trent Ford was among those dismissed in his volunteer capacity with the federal program. On April 28, Ford and his colleagues received an email saying the upcoming Sixth National Climate Assessment, due to be released in 2027, is “currently being reevaluated in accordance with the Global Change Research Act of 1990.”

The Global Change Research Act mandates that the National Climate Assessment be published every four years to inform the public of the ongoing impacts, risks and responses to climate change. In the last 35 years, the federal government has never failed to publish the nation’s preeminent report on climate change, but its fate was brought into question last month when it was reported that NASA canceled a critical contract for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which oversees the assessment.

“It’s disappointing from a personal standpoint,” said Ford, who served as a technical contributor to the Fifth National Climate Assessment published in 2023. He said he was looking forward to taking on a larger role as an author of the Midwest chapter in the next report, which was due in 2027.

He and the other authors of the Midwest chapter had already begun planning what topics the next report should focus on, like the effects of extreme heat on farmers and farm workers, livestock and even mental health, “something that the Midwest chapter hadn’t done previously,” Ford said.

Illinois researchers have always played a role in the National Climate Assessment. University of Illinois emeritus professor Donald Wuebbles has contributed to all five previous reports, including serving as a lead author of the fourth assessment in 2017.

He said his greatest concern is that the report could now move forward under a different team of scientists hand-picked by President Donald Trump, who has a history of denying climate change as a “hoax.”

“There’s a group of denialists out there,” Wuebbles said. “They let their politics affect their science.”

The National Climate Assessment is meant to help policymakers understand the immediate threats of rising global temperatures to the environment in their region and implement solutions at the local level.

“Almost all impacts of climate change are local,” Ford said.

In Illinois, those impacts include heavy rainfall and flooding, heat waves and drought in the summer, and natural disasters like tornadoes, which can lead people to become displaced and cost the state billions of dollars in damage, according to Ford.

A 2021 Illinois climate change assessment, which Wuebbles led and Ford co-authored, cites extreme flooding in the spring of 2019 as an example of how climate change is already impacting Illinois. Crop yield losses that year led to a record number of Prevented Plant claims and crop insurance payouts to farmers by the state. Similar events are expected to occur more often and with more intensity if global temperatures continue to increase at the current rate, the 2021 assessment found.

“Climate change isn’t going to stop by ignoring it,” Ford said. “If we don’t have the assessment, we don’t know what to expect, and therefore we can’t plan. Is it (climate change) going to cost $5 billion to the economy, or is it going to be $10 billion?”

The Trump administration is reportedly not going to track the cost of major natural disasters any longer.

Ford shared Wuebbles' concerns that the next assessment, if published, could be influenced by Trump’s anti-climate change regulation agenda. He also said without the involvement of a diverse group of researchers, the next assessment could fail to represent the interests of the states.

“We are, as experts, tasked with assessing what kinds of problems and solutions are worth including in the National Climate Assessment,” Ford said. “But if this is being disbanded, who’s going to be leading this?... Probably not people from Illinois.”

Trump’s White House has fueled these concerns, saying climate change regulations threaten the president’s goal of “unleashing American energy.” He described state and local climate policies as “burdensome and ideologically motivated,” saying they” “threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.”

This is paired with a recent move by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zelden to repeal the endangerment finding of 2009, the agency’s official recognition of greenhouse gases as harmful to human health and the planet.

Proposed Illinois legislation could fill gaps in research

Amid national setbacks to climate change research and environmental policy, Illinois lawmakers are continuing to advance progressive climate legislation at the state level, such as Illinois Senate Bill 1859, referred to as the Climate Displacement Act. That measure cleared the state Senate and is awaiting action in the House.

If passed, the act would establish a state task force to assess and provide recommendations for how Illinois can prepare for the impacts of climate change — specifically, an anticipated influx of climate-displaced people moving to the Midwest from other parts of the U.S.

Sponsors say the bill was informed by the Fifth National Climate Assessment, which projected a trend of increased migration of people away from coastal areas over the next 20-30 years, due to greater frequency of natural disasters. The task force would evaluate ways Illinois might proactively respond, and what the cost burden of that response would be. An initial report of its findings would be due in 2026.

“There’s not a lot of states that are proactively doing this kind of planning despite, you know, the looming danger,” said Senate bill sponsor Sen. Graciela Guzmán, D-Chicago.

Rep. Blaine Wilhour, R-Beecher City, criticized the measure in an Energy and Environment committee hearing.

“Is this task force going to study the outmigration as a result of some of our climate policies in this state, specifically the outmigration of good union jobs?” he asked.

House bill sponsor Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago, said the proposed task force would work to project those trends. Wilhour said if the task force were to include relevant union stakeholders, he would consider supporting the bill.

The bill passed the House Energy and Environment Committee, and now moves to the House floor.

Illinois has a track record of enacting progressive climate policies, which Ford said is the silver lining to an otherwise difficult situation for climate scientists.

“They don’t have to follow the science,” he said. “But they’re at least informed by the science at the state level in Illinois. We’re at least doing that.”

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Twenty-one agency leaders, health industry professionals, disability advocates and others will look to contain Medicaid spending on Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy — while ensuring continued care for thousands of young, autistic Hoosiers — the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) announced Friday.
Gov. Mike Braun directed the agency to create the working group in a February executive order. A report featuring three cost-containment recommendations is due by December.
ABA therapy is commonly used to improve social, communication and learning skills in children and young adults with autism or other developmental disorders. Some critics, however, object to the teaching tool and say it encourages compliance over independence. Additionally, some practitioners coupled it with electroshock therapy as late as 2022.

Indiana Medicaid spending on ABA therapy has risen over time:
2019: $120 million
2020: $102 million
2021: $276 million
2022: $420 million
2023: $639 million
Source: Indiana Capital Chronicle reporting

Nevertheless, it’s increasingly popular. Families, however, often struggle to access the therapy because of the price, limited insurance coverage and other health care industry stumbling blocks.
State coffers are also taking a hit.
Indiana Medicaid expenditures for ABA therapy rose from about $14 million in 2017 to $120 million in 2019, according to FSSA, then dipped to $102 million in 2020 — still the second-highest in the nation, per U.S. Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General.
The cost surge prompted the federal office to audit Indiana’s 2019 and 2020 ABA payments. The 2024 report found at least $56 million in improper payments — citing problems with documentation, diagnostic evaluations, staff credentials, referrals and more. It recommended that Indiana refund more than $39 million to the federal government.
Soaring totals since then have prompted greater scrutiny from Hoosier leaders worried Medicaid costs are growing too much, too fast. The financial pressure has only worsened.
A grim April revenue forecast forced lawmakers to cut $2 billion in spending out of the state’s next two-year, now-$44 billion budget.
Braun’s order charged the working group with evaluating cost-containment strategies that “minimize the negative impact felt by enrollees and their families.”

He directed the group to evaluate the “best” clinical care models to provide the right therapy in the right setting at the right ages. The order sought recommendations for “a better coordinated experience” for children, “but in a financially sustainable manner.”
Under the order, group members must also consider potentially implementing quality metrics for ABA services, caps on the number of therapy hours per week, caps on the number of months children can receive the therapy, an appeals process for “extenuating circumstances” along with new provider enrollment and billing requirements.
The “comprehensive review” of ABA therapy in Indiana should “identify key drivers of Medicaid expenditures,” Friday’s news release read. 
An evaluation must be completed by September 30. A written report has to include three recommendations for “meaningful” cost-containment, plus the advantages and disadvantages for each recommendation. That’s due to Braun by November 30.
The working group’s members include:

FSSA staff, some of whom lead disability and Medicaid utilization efforts
Health care industry representatives, including a pediatrician, psychiatrist and a health insurance company lobbyist
Autism, other disability and special education organization advocates
State lawmakers
Other parents

Controversy over ABA cuts ensnarled Braun’s predecessor, former Gov. Eric Holcomb. Families rallied repeatedly, urging Holcomb and his FSSA to reconsider.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A new Oklahoma law will prohibit schools from inflicting physical pain as punishment for students with disabilities.
Although the practice is already banned in the state’s regulations for schools, attempts by the Oklahoma Legislature to add the rule to state law failed in previous years. State law had barred schools from using corporal punishment on students only with “the most significant cognitive disabilities.” 
Senate Bill 364 extends the corporal punishment prohibition to students with any type of disability defined in a federal law known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
Gov. Kevin Stitt on Thursday permitted SB 364 to take effect without his signature. The bill had passed the state Senate in a 31-16 vote and the House 63-25 after lengthy debates in both chambers.
It outlaws the “deliberate infliction of physical pain by hitting, paddling, spanking, slapping or any other physical force” as a method of discipline for students with disabilities.
“While many schools already prohibit corporal punishment, there are still instances where it is used against children who may struggle to control their behavior or grasp the consequences of their actions,” said Sen. Dave Rader, R-Tulsa, an author of SB 364.
Rep. Jim Olsen, R-Roland, has been an outspoken opponent of the measure. He said the bill was overbroad because it extends to students who have no type of cognitive disability. He said it also limits parents’ choice to decide how schools should discipline their children.
State law previously allowed parents to waive the corporal punishment ban by giving written consent. SB 364 removes that provision.
More than 100 school districts in Oklahoma permit corporal punishment.
The rate of students disciplined with this method has declined nationwide, and 27 states ban the practice entirely, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education. 
Students with disabilities were overrepresented among the children who experienced corporal punishment at school, as were Black and Indigenous students, federal data shows.

(Photos courtesy of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana)LINCOLN — At just 7 years old, Teddy Bronson of Omaha has faced six brain surgeries, been prescribed 14 different drugs and used about half a million dollars in medical hardware to fight his drug-resistant epilepsy that at one time had him enduring an average of 3,800 seizures each month.
Matt Bronson, a disabled U.S. Air Force veteran, and Liz Bronson, a nurse practitioner at Children’s Nebraska, say that each day is a fight for their “beautiful little son,” Teddy, including any measures possible to reduce his seizures. That included a groundbreaking half-day neurosurgery at Children’s just a few years ago with a robotic surgical assistant.
At a public forum this weekend for medical cannabis regulations, which the Bronsons say could help ease Teddy’s pain, Matt Bronson said his son is at 85% higher risk of losing his life each night. But each morning, Liz and Matt greet their son.
“I get to see my son smile, I get to hear him babble, and damn it, he is seven and a half years old and he’s walking,” Matt Bronson told an often raucous, cheering public forum crowd in Omaha on May 4. “Three years ago, he was in a wheelchair.”

Data shows Teddy is improving, “but any seizure can take him,” Liz Bronson said. Quoting the family’s California-based epileptologist, Liz Bronson said, “We can either pass evidence-based, well-regulated legislation, or we can sign more death certificates.”
“We come here before you today to say that, ‘I’m sorry, but Teddy matters,’ and that our family matters and that the suffering individuals in this state matter,” Liz Bronson said.
A continued fight
In a more than decade-long fight for medical cannabis in Nebraska, through three election cycles, numerous legislative bills and multiple court fights, the Bronsons are among those who have consistently fought for access to the medicine.
Voters overwhelmingly approved legalizing medical cannabis in November. It was approved by 71% of voters, and just a slightly smaller percentage, 68%, approved the basic outlines of a regulatory system.
The Bronsons were among hundreds of Nebraskans who attended public forums May 3 in La Vista, May 4 in Omaha or May 5 in Lincoln. Most shared a similar message: Medical cannabis is legal in Nebraska, and the “will of the voters” must be implemented.

But how the state should do so differed among the dozens of speakers who addressed a bipartisan group of 13 state senators spread between the three events on Legislative Bill 677, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, a bill meant to clarify regulations. Senators estimated at least 300 attendees.
Some speakers linked the fight with legislative efforts to water down minimum wage and paid sick leave protections passed in the 2022 and 2024 statewide elections. 
Others linked LB 677 to LB 316, from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, a priority of Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, who has escalated his opposition to LB 677 and all products containing tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. LB 316 essentially reclassifies “hemp” as “marijuana.” Opponents call it a “de facto ban” on nearly all THC or hemp products.
Hilgers said Wednesday that it was never his intention to use LB 316 against the ballot measures. Hansen is working to make explicit in Kauth’s bill that it does not conflict with the ballot measures or LB 677.
Nebraska attorney general steps up medical cannabis opposition, regulatory bill awaits debate

Hilgers said his “heart goes out” to anyone in pain who feels they can’t access something they feel could alleviate the hurt. However, he said he must uphold federal laws against marijuana despite dozens of states approving medical or recreational cannabis.
“I think two plus two is four, even if everyone else says two plus two is five,” Hilgers said this week when he launched a law enforcement campaign against LB 677.
Speakers at this month’s forums blasted LB 677 for its compromises, including prohibiting smoking cannabis, specifying 15 “qualifying conditions,” allowing no more than 30 medical dispensaries and requiring a patient or caregiver to pay up to $45 for a registry card under the new state regulatory system.
Among those was Ethan Stankus of Bellevue, who said that if he’d known there would be a smoking ban, conditions list or other “needless compromises,” he would have voted “nay.”
“This is not what we voted for,” Stankus said, holding up a breakdown of the amendment to LB 677, asking why Nebraskans needed to take time to reexplain their vote.
‘100% of the apple’
For Hansen and supporters, the need for the bill is complicated, illustrated, for instance, when many attendees criticized the regulations for being housed in a new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission that shares resources and staff with the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission.
That was part of the ballot measure, partly in response to consistent opposition to medical cannabis from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Across the dozens of speakers, only one, the state’s former longtime state epidemiologist in DHHS, Tom Safranek, raised hesitation about the voter-approved laws, for a “potential for societal damage.” 
DHHS also opposes LB 677.

Due to constitutional constraints with ballot measures — including the need to stick to a “single subject” — supporters were limited in what they could present to voters. Supporters of LB 677 say it would provide clearer guidance before the commission acts.
The proposal also seeks to aid a voter-enacted deadline for the commission to write the regulations, which is currently July 1. The commission, in court filings, has said the ballot measure provided “no ability to carry out any duties” set forth in the new laws, particularly with its lack of funding.
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee, who worked with Hansen on the bill, said Sunday there is “no way” the measure’s required regulations can be completed in time.
LB 677 seeks to delay the required regulations by three months, while also more explicitly setting the parameters of the new regulatory system. The voter-passed laws’ wide flexibility to let the commission draft all regulations could end up with a system stricter than LB 677 proposes.
For instance, one of the governor-appointed members, Lorelle Mueting of Omaha’s Heartland Family Service, said in an online comment against a separate LB 705 this year that her agency does not support legalizing marijuana “in any form for medical purposes” without federal approval. 
Mueting opposed LB 677 at its hearing.
Hansen said the time is right “to get off our butts” and unite Democrats and Republicans and reach the 33-vote threshold needed to pass LB 677 and help Nebraskans. 
The system needs to start right and show “the world hasn’t ended,” Hansen said. “Everyone’s not dying. People aren’t smoking doobies on the corner like a lot of my conservatives think.”
“We’re not going to eat 100% of the apple,” Hansen said Saturday of the efforts. “We get 75%, 80%, make sure the people who need it, you get it.”
‘Pigs must be flying’
Marcie Reed of Blair, one of Hansen’s constituents, spoke of her 12-year-old son Kyler, who has epilepsy and takes six medications a day. Since 2019, the family has prepared to use a rescue medication for Kyler, a controlled substance, if Kyler’s seizures last more than five minutes.
“You don’t ever get it until you’re in that situation,” Reed, who worked on the recent cannabis ballot measures, said. “One day, somebody you love might have epilepsy or cancer, and I think that if you truly think about it, you will realize you wish that you could have this to give to your loved one and not keep fighting for it.”

While tense at times, the weekend also brought moments of levity, such as Shannon Coryell of Omaha, a self-described “bleeding heart liberal” who said that “pigs must be flying” because she agreed with Hansen, a Republican with a Libertarian bent.
Tom Becka, a former host on conservative talk radio in Omaha and a longtime broadcaster, spoke to Hilgers and Ricketts, saying that the movie-musical “Reefer Madness” wasn’t a “documentary.”
“More people have died from the onions on the McDonald’s hamburger than have died from medical cannabis,” Becka said to a laughing crowd.
No deaths from overdoses of marijuana have been reported, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, though some edibles have led to an increasing number of emergency room visits.
‘Fight like our lives matter’
Multiple Nebraskans also encouraged lawmakers to act quickly, as some patients who could have gotten help or tested out the medication have died in 12 years of legislative waiting.
Jill Hessing of Lincoln spoke of her mother, an open-minded Republican and licensed practical nurse who died of cancer in 2006. While some speakers said they would just go to Missouri for marijuana anyway, Hessing said that wouldn’t be the case for her mother, a “kind, compassionate, law-abiding woman.”

Lia Post of Springfield read a written letter Monday on behalf of her friend Angie Cornett of Norfolk, who missed the meeting to bury her mother.
Cornett, a nurse, wrote that her mom endured severe and chronic pain for decades. When she tried cannabis for the first time 25 years ago, at age 50, it eliminated the severe burning pain in her feet caused by severe nerve damage from her back and apathy from diabetes. 
Cornett said her mom described the new pain relief as “stepping on cold slushy watermelon.”
A “cocktail” of addictive pain relief medications was part of her mom’s medical regimen, Cornett said, adding she couldn’t help but wonder how her mom’s life could have changed with medical cannabis.
“She knew exactly what she was voting for, and as I bury my mom today, I want you to know that she is just one of many patients who have died waiting for the right to access plant-based medicines in Nebraska and access to a God-given plant that was used medicinally since the ancient times,” Cornett wrote Monday.
Post, a frequent medical cannabis advocate at the Nebraska State Capitol, said she is one of a handful of longtime advocates who have been told by lawmakers to mind their interactions and cool frustrations or methods of advocacy, such as Post telling Republicans that patients are dying.

Even so, Post said the roadblocks won’t make her back down from a disease — complex regional pain syndrome — that will one day take her life.
“Fight for us. Fight like our lives matter,” Post said Saturday. “None of you are God, and you do not deserve to play God in this anymore.”
Seeing patients
Dominic and Shelley Gillen of Bellevue have been in the fight for 12 years, similar to the Bronsons, for their now 23-year-old son Will, who similarly has a severe form of drug-resistant epilepsy and is referred to by friends and family as “God’s Will.” 
In that time, Dominic Gillen estimated, his son has faced more than 450,000 seizures and “a body littered with scars.”
Dominic Gillen said he considers Hilgers’ efforts against the medical cannabis campaign and its many volunteers, patients and caregivers, the type of “lawfare” that Republicans lamented under former President Joe Biden. At each event, Gillen told senators to see the patients, “not look through them.”
“Will has never spoken a word, but he’s touched countless lives in this state and other states through his story,” Dominic Gillen said. “Will is truly the greatest of blessings. He’s perfect even in his imperfection.”

Hansen, too, urged Nebraskans to share their stories and photos with lawmakers, particularly Republicans. “Out of curiosity,” he asked Sunday whether those in attendance would support recreational marijuana if LB 677 failed and the regulations became too restrictive.
Nearly everyone raised their hands. Hansen said he’s telling his colleagues to pass LB 677 and regulate medical cannabis, or the voters will end up legalizing recreational marijuana. Hilgers and other opponents of medical cannabis and recreational marijuana have said LB 677 would open the door to recreational use already.
Court battles continue in front of the Nebraska Supreme Court and in courts in Hall County, against a notary, and Lancaster County. The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office has argued the laws are preempted by federal law and threatened to sue the Medical Cannabis Commission if it issues dispensary licenses.
Notaries targeted in those cases have pledged innocence, including Jacy Todd of York, a notary who faces first-of-their-kind criminal charges in Grand Island. None of the four notaries targeted in the case before the Nebraska Supreme Court has been criminally charged, though a lower-court judge tossed some of their signatures. Hilgers said the lack of charges shouldn’t be “read into.
Hilgers, joined by various sheriffs on Wednesday, said that medical cannabis and LB 677 are “going to make Nebraska less safe, more dangerous. It’s going to handcuff the good men and women here that are in front of you and all their colleagues around the state.”
‘Let’s take away this pain’
Todd, a disabled veteran, was among those asking lawmakers to act and include post-traumatic stress disorder in the list of acceptable conditions for use, the removal of which Hansen said was one of the “negotiating factors” that was needed to get LB 677 out of the General Affairs Committee.

Two amendments from State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha would add PTSD to the list. The first directly, the second by removing the list altogether and leaving the decision between doctors and patients.
Matt Bronson, who served in the military, left for war at age 19. He said he broke his back in 2007, struggles with PTSD, is a recovering alcoholic and has lost most sensation in his legs. He was given many options, including opiates and other addictive pain medications. Before Teddy was born, he said he tried to take his life.
Medical cannabis is not about Matt Bronson or Teddy getting high — “I give two s— about getting high,” his father says.
However, Bronson says he can’t take the addictive medications, get significant back surgery or be put in a wheelchair for 18 months because he and Liz Bronson need to care for Teddy at a moment’s notice, who comes first above his own health.
“Let’s take away this pain,” Matt Bronson said. “I don’t want to remember those brothers and sisters I lost in war.

David Rozas, an attorney representing Alireza Doroudi, said in a statement Thursday that Douroudi made the decision after a hearing in Jena, Louisiana, where he was taken by authorities after ICE agents took him into custody in March.
“Mr. Doroudi made the difficult decision to ask for and was granted voluntary departure and return to Iran in order to avoid prolonged and unnecessary detention,” Rozas said in the statement. “He turned and looked at me and said, ‘I love this country, but they don’t want me here, so I will go home.”’

A message was sent Friday to the Department of Homeland Security seeking comment.
Rozas said no evidence was ever presented in court that indicated Doroudi, a doctoral student studying mechanical engineering, was a national security risk while he resided in the U.S..
He said the charge that the agency brought against Doroudi was that his F-1 student visa had been revoked and an allegation that he was “not being in status.” But Rozas said the revocations would only take effect upon his departure from the United States, not while he was in the country.
“The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acknowledged this and indicated during the master hearing their intention to drop the charge. This acknowledges that the initial reason for arrest 45 days ago was an error,” Rozas said.
Rozas said that the judge in the case required DHS to submit in writing to the court the agency’s intent to rescind the charge and have a second hearing to address the issue even though the charge that Doroudi is not “in status” and that “it no longer holds weight without the F-1 revocation, because he was clearly still in status.”
Rozas also stated in his statement that Doroudi’s legal team had submitted evidence on multiple instances and requested a subsequent bond hearing to have him released as the court decides his case. However, the judge refused and stated that the request needed to be filed formally with the court, leaving Doroudi to remain in custody of DHS.
“In the face of this legal uncertainty and prolonged detention, Mr. Doroudi chose to leave voluntarily. This is not only a loss for him personally, but a setback for our system,” Rozas statement said. “When due process is delayed or denied, when charges are sustained without standing, and when individuals are forced to choose between uncertain length of detention in a country they feel no longer wants them, or leaving voluntarily, we must ask what kind of precedent we are setting not just for foreign students, but for fairness and justice in America.”

(Photo by Getty Images)A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to change oversight of child welfare in Maine to mirror the approach taken by its neighboring state. 
Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) said she modeled her bill after the New Hampshire Office of the Child Advocate. LD 1893, which has two Republican and seven Democrat cosponsors, would transfer Maine’s existing child welfare ombudsman into a new, independent agency with expanding responsibilities to advocate for Maine children. 
The proposed Office of Child Advocate would have the authority to receive complaints, access information, investigate, make public reports and advise the executive and legislative branches on how best to provide services to the state’s youth. 
“This bill builds a foundation for meaningful oversight and reform while ensuring children’s voices and interests remain at the forefront,” Gramlich told the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee during a public hearing Friday morning. 
After renewed scrutiny in recent years, there have been multiple proposals from lawmakers and agency leadership to improve the state’s embattled child welfare system. Last year, frontline workers came forward with accounts of onerous workloads that culminated in December with a letter of no confidence in the agency’s leadership. 
The proposed restructuring comes after the committee backed a proposal to update the state’s definition of child abuse and neglect that legal experts have argued is easy to conflate with poverty. 
Christine Alberi, the state’s current child welfare ombudsman, supports the bill to transition her position into an Office of Child Advocate because it preserves the work her office is already doing while adding “necessary functions.” For example, the new office would allow for juvenile justice investigations and access to facilities such as Long Creek Youth Development Center, the South Portland-based youth correctional facility. 
However, Alberi said that adequate funding would be crucial to the office’s success. During the hearing, she said it wasn’t clear where those resources would come from, since the ombudsman office has struggled with a lack of funding for staff since 2012. 
The current child welfare ombudsman program in Maine operates as a nonprofit that assists and investigates complaints against how child protective services cases are handled. It submits an annual report that includes an analysis of case specific reviews and other details about its interaction with the Office of Child and Family Services. 
Having served as New Hampshire’s first child advocate, Moira O’Neill said she believes Maine could have avoided a lawsuit with the U.S. Department of Justice over the state’s children’s behavioral health services had there been a proactive resource checking on the children in the care of the Department of Corrections. The suit was settled last November. 
O’Neill, who helped craft the model in New Hampshire before stepping down in 2021, supported Maine adopting that structure. She said Maine’s current ombudsman office leaves many children, especially those in the juvenile justice system, without an ally. 
Republican lawmakers in New Hampshire have expressed interest in cutting the Office of Child Advocate when looking for ways to trim the state budget.
Gramlich said the Office of the Attorney General suggested modest amendments to the bill that she is happy to work with the committee to incorporate. 
The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the state’s child welfare agency, spoke neither for nor against the bill. Director of Government Relations Abby Stivers said the department would like more time to review the proposal, but cautioned that the new framework being proposed likely requires more consideration than the department can give it in the remaining time for this legislative session. 
Stivers said the authority granted to the child advocate in this legislation could be wide reaching and questioned whether it is necessary given the multiple forms of oversight that already exist for child welfare services. The agency is subject to federal oversight, multiple citizen review panels and was subject to extensive investigative work from the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee last session. 
However, Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot) reintroduced a bill he brought forth last session to create an Office of the Inspector General of Child Protection. 
“The problems with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services are going to require far more than cosmetic surgery being suggested by some,” he told the committee when introducing LD 770.
An inspector general at the state level would send a “clear and articulate message” that the accountability and transparency of Maine’s child welfare system needs to be substantially changed, Baldacci said. He referenced a 2024 report from the federal watchdog that indicated Maine struggled to comply with best practices in the vast majority of abuse and neglect cases. 
Under this proposal, the inspector general would be appointed by the governor to serve a five year term, with the potential for reappointment. It would also take on matters related to juvenile justice and have subpoena powers.
No one from the public testified on the bill. Bobbi Johnson, director of the Office of Child and Family Services, provided written testimony opposing the legislation. She wrote that it isn’t clear what benefit the role would offer to the “robust and comprehensive oversight of child welfare that already exists.”
The proposal last session ultimately died after it was not endorsed by the Health and Human Services Committee.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)On Thursday, 27 Democratic New Mexico lawmakers wrote to the 14-member board that governs state water policy, urging members to reconsider in an upcoming meeting its recent decisions regarding oil and gas wastewater.
Last month, the Water Quality Control Commission continued deliberations on a proposed rule to expand the uses of oil and gas water outside the oilfields. Deliberations have been ongoing since December 2023, when the New Mexico Environment Department petitioned to expand legal uses beyond oilfields.
With New Mexico water sources expected to become increasingly strained by more demand and shrinking supplies from a hotter, drier climate, the relationship between oil and gas and its wastewater has sparked a major policy debate in the past few legislative sessions and in the WQCC’s rulemaking.
The state’s oil and gas production generates billions of gallons of wastewater, which is extremely salty and can include radioactive materials and heavy metals from underground; chemicals used in the fracking process; or cancer-causing or toxic compounds mixed in from the oil and gas, such as benzene.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has floated using treated oil and gas wastewater in manufacturing and other industries in her Strategic Water Supply proposals, but lawmakers stripped produced water from the final bill. Water and conservation groups that opposed the idea said that treatments for the water remain unproven and the waste poses threats to human and environmental health.
The WQCC rule-making deliberations  included several weeks-long hearings in 2024 with hours of testimony from scientists, water experts, environmental officials and industry representatives. In April, recent edits to the rules culminated in the board adopting positions to allow for some pilot projects to discharge treated produced water into the groundwater, and allowed for so-called “closed-loop” projects to bypass the permitting process.
Lawmakers weigh in
The letter, signed by Democrats in both chambers, called the board’s limitations for these pilot projects  “insufficient,” and said they contradict existing law and potentially risk human and environmental health.
“The decision to allow ANY discharge of treated oil and gas waste to ground or surface water prior to the development of treatment and quality standards is both irresponsible and dangerous in the extreme,” the letter said.
The letter cited testimony from New Mexico State University researchers, experts from the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association and even NMED, which requested the rule change, that produced water contains toxic chemicals and treatment options have not been proven safe nor effective.
“Until credible, scientifically based standards for treatment and water quality are adopted, we believe it is premature to issue permits for any pilot treatments outside the oilfield,” the letter said, and suggested research can be done in the labs or in the field under existing laws.
Lawmakers also said if the WQCC does allow pilot projects, then those projects must not discharge waste to surface or groundwater and must follow a permitting process, to allow for public notification and the right to protest.
“The Commission’s decision on the issue is contrary to the legislature’s intent and the letter of the law,” the letter stated.
The letter cited motions filed by environmental groups and suggested that any law adopt more stringent permitting standards. The letter also recommended that the WQCC include tests of 600 substances in the treated water.
WQCC Chair Bruce Thomson, an environmental engineer, said lawmakers raised “some good points,” in the letter but that he disagrees with the characterization of oil and gas wastewater.
“My biggest concern with the letter is that they claim that treatment technologies do not exist. I will agree that treatment technologies are in an early stage of development,” Thomson told Source, saying the board heard testimony of 15 to 20 studies about potential technologies “to treat it to a very high level of quality.
Thomson said the objections to the lack of permits would likely be discussed in the next deliberation.
Melissa Troutman, a climate and health advocate at WildEarth Guardians, told Source NM her group also argued to the WQCC that the leftovers from any produced water treatment process would meet the qualifications for hazardous waste.
“Our argument at Guardians is that it would be creating a new hazardous waste, but the rule isn’t applying hazardous waste laws, and that’s illegal,” she said, saying it would no longer have the exemption under oil and gas exploration.
Troutman said there’s still time to reshape the outcome.
“The door is still open for deliberation, and hopefully we can bring these points forward,” Troutman said. “Hopefully, when they do issue a final rule, it’s much, much closer to what we actually need.”
The WQCC is next scheduled to meet Tuesday, May 13 to continue deliberations.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)A $2.8 billion tax cut deal reached between Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez last week to help bring the 2025 regular session to a close is now off the table.
The breakdown means legislators are nowhere near coming up with a new budget, which needs to be in place by July 1 or the state risks a government shutdown.
The Friday morning announcement from legislative leadership came as Gov. Ron DeSantis continued to tour the state attacking the House, and Perez by extension, for pushing a reduction in the state’s sales tax rate instead of backing the governor’s two-step plan to provide property homeowners relief. 
Perez had championed a permanent reduction in sales taxes and last week Albritton said he was backing it. But in a memo to House members, Perez said Albritton has told him “he is breaking his commitment to the House that he publicly announced.”
  Speaker Daniel Perez via Florida House
“I was disappointed when the Senate President informed me of his decision to no longer bring the House’s historic tax proposal to the Senate floor,” Perez wrote. “As I’m sure you can appreciate, this blew up the framework for the budget deal we had negotiated.”
Albritton sent his own memo to his members shortly thereafter explaining that he was backing away from the agreement with Perez for an across-the-board sales tax cut because the governor had indicated the bill would be “dead on arrival.”  
Three concerns
Albritton’s letter outlines three main concerns he heard from senators about the $2.8 billion tax agreement, of which $2.5 billion would be recurring.
“An across-the-board sales tax cut of one quarter of one penny is not meaningful, felt, or seen by families and seniors when compared with other available options. A $2.5 billion recurring tax cut is not sustainable when combined with the projected budget shortfalls already on the horizon. A $2.5 billion recurring tax cut may constrain options for the major property tax reform the Governor, House, and Senate, and most importantly – the Floridians we represent – are asking us to put forward.”

Albritton continued:
“Throughout the entire course of negotiations with the House, the Senate has been and remains committed to tax cuts that offer broad-based and meaningful tax relief for families, seniors, and small businesses. As negotiations move forward, [Appropriations] Chair [Ed] Hooper and I will continue seeking your advice and feedback. 
“It is important to me that we develop a tax relief package that is sustainable for the long term and leaves room in our balanced budget for the voters to consider meaningful property tax relief on the ballot at the next general election. We will continue to work towards a final budget and tax relief package the House, Senate and Governor can support.”
The two sides need to reach a deal on the size and scope of tax cuts in order to reach a deal on budget “allocations” that determine how much money will be included in the final appropriations act.
The Senate and House on May 2 voted on a resolution (HCR 1631) that lists 16 bills the chambers will consider in an extended session. Included in the list is Albritton’s priority legislation to infuse $200 million in infrastructure in areas of the state that are less developed. Albritton has dubbed the bill “Rural Renaissance.”
Albritton said that day that the chambers had reached an agreement for a budget that included $2.8 billion in relief, which he noted is “the most historic tax relief package in the history of our state.”

The one must-pass bill
Nearly 2,000 bills were filed in the House and Senate for consideration during the 2025 session. Most of them didn’t pass — indeed, just 255 made it across the legislative finish line before the session adjourned.
But there’s just one bill the Legislature is required to pass each year and that’s the state fiscal year budget, officially known as the General Appropriations Act.
The chambers passed drastically different proposed spending plans for state fiscal year 2025-26 with a $4.4 billion gap between the two blueprints. 
Perez has championed rolling back the state’s sales tax by 0.75%, to 5.25%. The speaker’s plan would roll back all other sales tax rates by the same amount — commercial rent from 2% to 1.25%; electricity from 4.35% to 3.6%; new mobile home purchases from 3% to 2.25%; and coin-operated amusement machines from 4% to 3.25%.
The Senate floated a more modest $2.1 billion plan centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of this plan include a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
Meanwhile, DeSantis has pushed for elimination of property taxes, a proposal he has continued to champion this week at press events across the state, appearing Friday in Jacksonville.

Special elections will proceed,Geoff Pender,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/09/federal-court-approves-mississippi-legislative-redistricting-special-elections-will-proceed/,The panel has held that none of the state’s prior maps gave Black voters a realistic chance to elect candidates of their choice.,"A panel of three federal judges has approved a revised legislative redistricting plan from the Mississippi Election Commission, which will allow special elections to move forward this year for 15 legislative seats.
The court in April had ordered state officials to develop yet another legislative map to ensure Black voters in the DeSoto County area have a fair opportunity to elect candidates to the state Senate.
The panel, comprised of U.S. District Judge Daniel Jordan, U.S. District Judge Sul Ozerden and U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Leslie Southwick, previously ruled that when lawmakers redrew their districts in 2022 to account for population shifts, they violated federal civil rights law because the maps diluted Black voting power.
To remedy the violation, the court allowed the Legislature to propose a new House map redrawing House districts in the Chickasaw County area and a new Senate map redrawing districts in the DeSoto County and Hattiesburg areas.
Earlier this year, during the 2025 session, the Legislature attempted to comply with the order and tweaked those districts. However, the plaintiffs still objected to parts of the Legislature’s plan.
The plaintiffs, the state chapter of the NAACP and Black voters from around the state, did not object to the Hattiesburg portion of the Senate plan. But they argued the Chickasaw County portion of the House plan and the DeSoto County portion of the Senate plan did not create a realistic opportunity for Black voters in those areas to elect their preferred candidates. 
The judges accepted the Chickasaw County redistricting portion. Still, they objected to the DeSoto County part because the Legislature’s proposed DeSoto County solution “yokes high-turnout white communities in the Hernando area of DeSoto County to several poorer, predominantly Black towns in the Mississippi Delta,” which would make it hard for Black voters to overcome white voting blocs. 
The panel, comprised of all George W. Bush-appointed judges, ordered state officials to, again, craft a new Senate map for the area in the suburbs of Memphis. The panel has held that none of the state’s prior maps gave Black voters a realistic chance to elect candidates of their choice.
The court in its latest ruling set deadlines and a schedule for special elections for Mississippi legislative seats impacted by the new maps.
The deadline to publicize and share the maps with local election officials is May 12. Candidate qualification to run will run from June 2-9  and the slate of candidates will be submitted by June 13. Absentee voting for the Aug. 5 primaries will begin June 21.

PFAS, a family of chemicals which are heat and oil resistant, are commonly used in products like nonstick cookware, carpeting, waterproof clothing and food packaging. The chemicals break down very slowly and can accumulate in the blood and organs of people and animals. Alongside products manufactured using PFAS, the chemicals can be found in food, drinking water and in the soil and water near waste sites.
Labeled as an emerging contaminant by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, PFAS has been linked to several health conditions including harm to the immune system, increased risks of certain cancers  —including prostate, kidney and testicular cancers — decreased fertility, high blood pressure in pregnant women and developmental delays or effects on children.

The state has previously estimated there are more than 11,000 sites within the state contaminated by PFAS, with the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team identifying 300 sites where groundwater has been contaminated by the hazardous chemicals. 
“In Michigan we know all too well the urgent, growing threat PFAS pose. It’s more important than ever we’re taking serious action in Congress to keep PFAS out of our homes, water, and environment, hold polluters accountable, and clean up existing contamination,” Dingell said in a statement.



Over the next two years, the task force’s priorities will include:

Advancing comprehensive legislation to end harmful PFAS pollution.
Educating lawmakers and the public on the serious health and environmental consequences of PFAS exposure.
Securing historic federal investments in research, remediation, and prevention.




“Our country needs to address the problems PFAS chemicals create head-on, which is why I’m proud to co-chair the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force with both Republicans and Democrats,” McDonald Rivet said. “We will work together to raise awareness of the risk of PFAS chemicals and advocate for commonsense solutions for our constituents.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-09-123321.png,,,2025-05-09 13:19:49.636542

In this image WSU students walk to class on campus. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas conference of the American Association of University Professors condemned the targeting of college and university international students and scholars by the administration of  President Donald Trump.
The statement signed by Mary Turner, president of the Kansas AAUP, said it was wrong for the federal government to refuse scholars entry into the United States, revoke student visas or to take students into custody for proceedings that could include deportation.
“These actions, which are brazen attacks on the First Amendment and the right to learn, have been enacted by hidden bureaucrats and masked agents and have proceeded without any semblance of due process,” the statement said. “In addition to their impact on international students, they also strike at the heart of academic freedom and the international community of scholars.”
The Kansas conference of AAUP urged colleges and universities in the state to refuse to assist with the “assault on higher education.”
“At a moment when the future of higher education and free speech are in peril, Kansas higher education institutions have obligations beyond doing no harm,” the Kansas AAUP statement said. “If they fail to protect these international students and scholars, they jeopardize the safety and academic freedom of all students and scholars.”
Kansas higher education institutions enroll approximately 8,600 international students, Kansas AAUP said. It is not clear how many of these students had visas revoked by the Trump administration.
 
WSU’s visa revocations
Gamal Weheba, president of the AAUP-AFT chapter at Wichita State University, said the organization issued a resolution in support of international students in Wichita. He said in an interview that 27 graduate students at WSU had visas revoked during the spring semester.
“The international students are really scared,” said Weheba, a professor of engineering. “We care about the students, all of them, but especially international students.”
The majority of WSU’s international graduate students were enrolled in data science and computer science programs within the College of Engineering, Weheba said.
“We have to take a stand here,” he said. “Our basic message now to students is we’re here, we have your back.”
The AAUP resolution from Wichita State said the university administrators should commit to helping international students with degree completion, maintaining positions or stipends, and supporting legal action to challenge removal or rejection of student visas.
It said WSU President Richard Muma ought to issue a statement “clarifying student rights and legal protections to the student body, staff and faculty of the institution.”
The resolution asked WSU to provide direction to faculty on how to accommodate students who were unable to complete academic work in the spring semester.
Weheba said international students had studies interrupted after revocation of a visa or were afraid to attend classes for fear of drawing scrutiny or being taken into custody.
“This visa removal process has placed students in a legal limbo and induced fear and anxiety into the campus student community and adversely impacted the institutional mission,” the resolution said.
Neither WSU nor the Kansas Board of Regents immediately responded to requests for comment about the AAUP statements.
 
Kansas AAUP demands
Specifically, Kansas AAUP asked higher education administrators to cease turning over personal student information in response to federal investigations of alleged violations of Title VI the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Trump administration has relied on an interpretation of Title VI to launch inquiries into whether colleges or universities discriminated on the basis of race, color and national origin in federally funded programs.
Kansas AAUP urged higher education administrators to avoid voluntary cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement engaged in activities that could lead to deportation of students or scholars.
In addition, the statement asked colleges and universities in Kansas to not comply with Trump’s executive order calling on campus administrators to monitor and report on international students and staff.
Colleges and universities in Kansas should keep international students enrolled in the event of a visa revocation, legal status termination, detention or deportation, Kansas AAUP said. If possible, the statement said, students and scholars should be allowed to continue their studies remotely.
“Work swiftly and affirmatively — through lawsuits, if necessary — to stop the termination of legal status of students and scholars without any due process,” the statement said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/WSU-campus-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 13:19:49.636542

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images; logo courtesy the State of Iowa)An Iowa-licensed social worker accused of having personal or sexual relationships with two clients has agreed to surrender her license.
Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals charged Stephanie A. Davies, formerly Stephanie A. Levy, with engaging in sexual activity with a former client within five years of the client relationship ending, and with having her social work license revoked in the state of Nebraska.
Nebraska Bureau of Public Health records show the bureau revoked Davies’ Nebraska license as a master social worker and mental health practitioner in March 2024 for alleged immoral or dishonorable conduct, exploitation and failure to keep adequate records.
The Nebraska records indicate Davies was working in private practice as a mental health practitioner and was a leader in the Nebraska First Responders’ Support Network when the alleged violations occurred. The bureau alleges that while speaking to a therapist, Davies disclosed that in the fall of 2020, she had become attracted to a female first responder to whom she provided services between July 2019 and February 2022.
In February 2021, the bureau alleged, the first responder admitted to her ex-wife she was having an affair with Davies, and in September 2021, Davies and the first responder attended a wedding together as a couple. In January 2022, Davies allegedly moved out of the home she shared with her husband and, on occasion, began staying at the first-responder’s home.
According to the bureau, Davies admitted to a state investigator, “I recognize that this is against the rules, I own it and, yeah, that is where we are at.”
As part of the Nebraska board’s investigation of the matter, an investigator spoke to another of Davies’ clients who allegedly said he and Davies had once maintained a “weird, blended relationship” and that, “yes, professional lines were probably crossed.”
To resolve the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals’ charges against her, Davies recently agreed to surrender her license.



Social workers sanctioned by board
The Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals recently sanctioned two other licensees:
— Michelle Munsen, a licensed mental health counselor who practiced in Sioux City, was employed at Stokes & Associates where she allegedly failed to create and complete the appropriate notes for counseling services she provided. The board charged Munsen with professional incompetence. To resolve the case, Munsen agreed to complete six hours of educational training on recordkeeping and the board issued her a warning.
— Terris Sallis, a master’s level social worker who practiced in Newton in 2024 when the board charged him with practicing outside the scope of his license. According to the board, Sallis owns his own practice, Integrated Treatment Services, which contracted with an independent social worker.
Under Iowa regulations, a master’s level social worker cannot oversee the practice of independent social worker and cannot complete the clinical hours required for license when supervised by an employee due to the inherent conflict of interest. Sallis agreed to have his license placed on probation for three years and to complete at least 3,000 hours of additional clinical practice while overseen by a new clinical supervisor.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/license-applictation.jpg,,,2025-05-09 12:21:58.948661

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge said Thursday that federal immigration officials likely acted unlawfully when they terminated the records of five international Rutgers University students and one recent graduate.
The students — all from China or India — sued the federal government in April after their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, were abruptly terminated, placing their academic and professional careers in jeopardy. The database hosts information colleges use to track students’ compliance with their immigration status, and deleting students’ records effectively ends their protected status and any benefits that come with it, like the ability to work.
U.S. District Court Judge Katharine S. Hayden on Thursday granted the students a preliminary injunction barring the government from enforcing or implementing any legal consequences as a result of the deleted records. Hayden’s order also requires the government to restore the records and give the students at least 20 days’ notice if the records are terminated again.
Her 33-page decision came after the two sides met in court in Newark Wednesday.
Attorneys for the students applauded the judge’s order, which they say will allow them to safely return to research, work, and their public lives. 
“The government not only failed to provide notice or explanation when it terminated our clients’ records, but then gave shifting rationale for doing so, underscoring how arbitrarily this administration is treating students,” said Molly Linhorst, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. “But like all other people in the United States, regardless of immigration status, our clients are entitled to the Constitutional guarantee of due process of law.”
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has purged thousands of SEVIS records. Affected students had no ability to appeal the termination, and were told their visas had been revoked for “failing to maintain status.”
Two weeks ago, the Trump administration reversed course and reinstated students’ status following a flurry of lawsuits around the country. But the Rutgers students and graduate continued their legal challenge, contending that the notations left in their records would continue to cause them harm and serious legal consequences.
At least two of them already faced some fall-out — one student was fired after their status was terminated, and another lost their research assistant position, along with their annual $40,000 stipend. All of them expressed concerns that they still fear being picked up by federal agents, and that they’ll likely run out of money after losing employment. 
Hayden said the plaintiffs would likely succeed in their claim that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security violated administrative procedures when terminating the students’ records. She said the law requires agencies to make reasoned decisions and that “actions be set aside if they are arbitrary or capricious.” 
Hayden said the government supplied no reason for the termination of the students’ records, nor for their reinstatement. 
The Rutgers students, here on F-1 visas, said they were in good standing, compliant with the law, and had not been charged with any crimes. Some had minor or dismissed charges, like a driver’s license violation, which would not have jeopardized their protected status.  
“Plaintiffs’ visas were not revoked, so the remaining ground would be the criminal records check – but the so-called ‘criminal records’ of plaintiffs involved incidents that did not meet the requirements for termination of status under” the law, Hayden wrote. “Defendants do not contend otherwise.” 
In his second term, Trump has been executing his campaign promise to detain and deport immigrants, including those with legal status. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also confirmed plans to revoke visas for students, particularly those who participate in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses.
More than 23,000 international students attended New Jersey colleges in the 2023-24 school year, according to the Institute of International Education. New Jersey ranks 17th in the country for accepting international students, who spent nearly $1 billion last year, the group says.
Rutgers University officials did not immediately return a request for comment.

(John Gray/Verite News)A Louisiana House committee shelved a bill Wednesday that would have made it illegal for someone to “intentionally” expose another person to an “incurable” sexually transmitted disease after steep concerns that criminalization could worsen the state’s proliferating STD rates.
This was the second time Rep. Patricia Moore, D-Monroe, had introduced such a bill in five years, despite opposition from public and sexual health advocates as well as people living with STDs. Moore said at a House Administration of Criminal Justice committee meeting that she wants to create a law that offers people recourse for when someone “knowingly and intentionally” doesn’t disclose their STD status.
The bill would have created a new felony, carrying up to 10 years in prison and $5,000 in fines, for someone who knows they have an “incurable” STD and exposes someone else without their knowledge and consent. Those penalties would have increased if the person exposed to the STD is a minor, over 65 years old or has an intellectual disability. The exposure under either charge would have needed to come through sexual contact, donating bodily fluids such as blood or sharing needles.
After pushback during public testimony, Moore voluntarily deferred House Bill 76.

In 2023, Louisiana had the highest rate of chlamydia cases in the country and ranked in the top 10 for syphilis, HIV and gonorrhea, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The legislation comes as other states have repealed or modernized their own laws criminalizing STDs, especially HIV, over the past decade to align with the current medical landscape. An attempt to update Louisiana’s own law criminalizing HIV failed last year.
Before the bill was deferred, Moore amended it to just focus on “incurable” STDs, removing a proposal to create a new misdemeanor charge for exposing someone to a curable STD. The four most common incurable sexually transmitted infections are hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV. While no treatments exist to eliminate these viruses, all are treatable and manageable with medication, and HPV can sometimes clear up on its own.
But the groups who opposed the bill, including several members of the Louisiana Coalition Against Criminalization and Health, said the bill would have the same problems as another state law on the books that criminalizes “intentional exposure” to HIV.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Data on how many people have been charged under the law is challenging to compile, but UCLA’s Williams Institute identified 147 allegations of HIV-related crimes between 2011 and 2022 in Louisiana, though researchers said that number could be higher.
Dietz, the coalition’s state coordinator, told the committee that said both the current law and bill contain “legal loopholes” that allow the law to be used against people living with HIV in their personal relationships, in part because it’s on the person living with the STD to prove they received the accuser’s consent.
In 2024, Dietz and other members of a state task force charged with researching the criminalization of HIV found that Louisiana’s current legal approach “can actually interfere with work to end the HIV epidemic,” according to its report.
“We’ve already made recommendations for the way the existing law allows for environments of coercion because again … proving that you disclosed your status is challenging,” Dietz said. “Even if you were to have proof in your hand, even if someone were to write it down, what if someone ripped it up? Or you lost it?”
St. Tammany Parish resident Katie Darling, who also serves as the vice chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party, shared the testimony of one of her residents who said she had been living with HIV for 25 years. Darling said the resident had her first husband sign an affidavit acknowledging that he knew she had HIV and consented, even though she was taking medication that prevented transmission. When the marriage turned physically abusive, the resident testified that her former husband threatened to take her to court over her HIV status.
“Thankfully, I had the document he signed on file at my doctor’s office. But what if I hadn’t?” Darling read from the testimony. The St. Tammany resident has now had her second husband sign a similar affidavit.
Those who opposed the bill also acknowledged that there is a need for people to have justice when they are unknowingly given an STD, whether that’s under new legislation or current laws around sexual assault.
Jennifer Tokarski, who is living with HPV, testified in support of the bill. She shared the story of her former husband who had sex outside of their marriage, refused to admit it and ultimately transmitted the virus to her.
“After five years in what I believed was a faithful relationship and Catholic marriage, I became severely ill,” Tokarski testified. “My husband attended appointments, rejected STD testing, reassuring doctors we were monogamous.”
When she learned of his infidelity, she said he battered her and filed for divorce.
“Only then did I learn he had infected me with a lifelong and incurable STD,” Tokarski said. “This is not just a private betrayal, this is a public health failure.”
Moore and Tokarski said they believed such a law would help promote honest conversations about sexual health that would lower the spread and give survivors a voice.
Studies have shown that criminalizing STDs do little to lower the number of cases and increase stigma. During testimony, public health advocates said Louisiana should invest more heavily in resources for testing and treatment as well as sexual health education, which isn’t required in schools.
At Wednesday’s meeting, Moore said she planned to work with the bill’s opponents to improve the language and possibly return the legislation to the committee if there’s time before the session. Otherwise, Moore said she will bring a form of the legislation back next year.

Labor plays defense at the Capitol
Two years ago, Minnesota Democrats were basking in the national spotlight after passing a sweeping progressive agenda — with a one-seat Senate majority no less — that created a paid family leave program; guaranteed all workers paid sick leave; banned noncompete agreements; and extended government health insurance to undocumented residents.
Now, labor unions and their Democratic allies are just trying to hold the line after a bruising election ended their unified control of government and will force them to make concessions to Republicans to pass a two-year budget.
But even some Senate Democrats in swing districts are pushing to sand down policies they previously voted for as they face ongoing pressure from the business groups to ease up on regulations.
Six Senate Democrats voted with Republicans on Tuesday to pass a bill that exempts small farms and micro-businesses from the 2023 law requiring employers to provide paid sick and safe leave per year.
Sen. Nick Frentz, DFL-North Mankato, an author of the sick leave bill, also introduced a bill with Republicans to water down the paid family leave program slated to start next year. The bill would exempt businesses with 15 or fewer employees and reduce the total number of weeks employees could take off in a year from 20 to 14.
“We have a saying down in Mankato that you can’t have good jobs without good employers,” Frentz said in an interview. “Small businesses are clamoring for us to revisit those two programs.”
The paid leave bill didn’t get a committee hearing, showing there’s little appetite among his Democratic colleagues to discuss changing the program, but it could find new life in last minute budget negotiations.
In the evenly divided House, Democrats have remained largely unified, though that isn’t enough to pass bills.
The House labor bill, which will be debated on Friday, includes a provision that would exempt workers who make more than $200,000 a year from the ban on noncompete agreements passed in 2023.
Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, said Democrats resoundingly rejected changes to paid family leave, sick leave and a proposal to weaken the Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board. But they had to give up something to reach a budget deal.
“This year Republicans have spent all their time working to take away protections and benefits that Minnesota workers won last session, while DFLers have been fighting to pass a budget that protects them,” Greenman said.
House Democratic leaders also agreed to roll back unemployment insurance for bus drivers, teachers’ aids and other hourly school workers in 2029 as part of an education budget deal. But rank-and-file Democrats refused to send the bill to the floor with that provision, forcing more negotiations.
And a final sticking point will be over whether to continue allowing undocumented residents to buy into MinnesotaCare, the state’s health insurance for low-income working people.
Angie Craig racks up early labor endorsements for Senate
U.S. Rep. Angie Craig had a chummy conversation with Teamster President Sean O’Brien on his podcast “Better Bad Ideas” on Wednesday as she courts labor unions in her campaign for U.S. Senate.
Craig gave her assessment of the 2024 election. Like many moderate Democrats and O’Brien, she says the party suffered because they stopped focusing on pocketbook issues.
O’Brien is both cause and effect of the Republican Party seeking to win over working class voters, which President Donald Trump has done to great effect and in the process transformed America’s politics during the past decade.
O’Brien was the first Teamster president to speak at the Republican National Convention in 2024, and the international union declined to endorse a presidential ticket after releasing polling showing nearly 60% of their members supported Trump.
(Still smarting from Gov. Tim Walz’s jab that union leaders who didn’t endorse in the race lacked courage, O’Brien said on the episode that Walz looks like a “creepy wrestling coach for junior high.”)
Craig committed to winning support from these Trump-supporting workers, which means sometimes alienating party loyalists by supporting some of Trump’s policies.
“If you take the opposite position every time the administration acts, you lose the ability to reach back and win the people (Trump) won the national election with,” Craig told O’Brien.
And she checked the boxes on O’Brien’s agenda: reining in Big Tech; going after Amazon; banning autonomous vehicles; supporting energy infrastructure projects; and implementing “strategic” tariffs.
Craig has already won the endorsement of the Teamsters Local 32 in Minnesota, along with nine other local labor unions representing more than 150,000 workers. The endorsements landed just two days after she launched her campaign and included the more moderate building trades — carpenters, operating engineers, painters and sheet metal workers — but also the local union of federal employees, whom Craig has defended against indiscriminate cuts by the Trump administration.
Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, the other major contender in the Senate race, hasn’t announced any labor endorsements yet, but the far larger, more progressive unions like SEIU and Education Minnesota haven’t weighed in.
Trump’s tariffs have truckers on edge

Truckers in Minnesota are bracing for a massing slowdown in work as businesses suspend orders from overseas because of Trump’s tariffs. Ocean carriers have canceled trips at a faster rate than during the COVID-19 pandemic, and cargo at the massive Port of Los Angeles is down 35% in early May.
New Brighton-based shipping company Big Blue Box Vice President Ted Longbella said truckers in Minnesota will feel the effects of the tariffs around June, when the surge of goods that were panic-ordered before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement turns into a trickle.
There are more than 56,000 semi-truck drivers and another 18,000 light truck drivers in Minnesota, according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development, meaning widespread layoffs and reductions in income could ripple throughout the greater economy.
Macalester College staff file for union election
More than 270 Macalester College employees could unionize with the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, the largest union of state employees.
Workers filed a petition on Monday with the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees private sector unions, to hold an election after the college declined to voluntarily recognize their union. If successful, the union would represent non-managerial staff across campus, from athletics to alumni relations and library services.
“Macalester staff built a thoughtful, disciplined organizing effort and they didn’t back down when management refused recognition,” said MAPE President Megan Dayton in a statement announcing the union filing. “Now, we’re ready to win this election.”
The union drive is more than two years in the making, according to the Mac Weekly, and comes on the heels of undergraduate student workers voting to unionize, the first effort of its kind in Minnesota.
Macalester spokesman Joe Linstroth said the scope of the union is “yet to be determined.”
“Should there be an election, we plan to encourage all eligible employees to vote so that they are able to have a say in whether they wish to be represented by a bargaining unit,” he wrote in an email.
Pope Leo XIV’s pro-labor predecessor
In taking the name Leo on Thursday, the new pope signaled his intention to continue his predecessor Pope Francis’ zealous advocacy for the poor.
Pope Leo XIV’s name honors the previous Pope Leo, who led the Catholic Church from 1878 to 1903, when workers were fighting back against ruthless industrial capitalism of the Gilded Age.
Pope Leo XIII wrote the encyclical Rerum Novarum — sometimes titled “On the Condition of the Working Classes” — in 1891, in which he praised unions and sharply criticized unchecked greed and the exploitation of the working poor.
“A small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke little better than that of slavery itself,” he wrote. “To misuse men as though they were things in the pursuit of gain, or to value them solely for their physical powers — that is truly shameful and inhuman.”
He also shunned the socialist aim to eliminate private property altogether, saying it would unjustly deprive workers of the “liberty of disposing of his wages, and thereby of all hope and possibility of increasing his resources and of bettering his condition in life.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250501_0394-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-09 12:21:58.948661

Photo via Adobe StockThe city of Burlington has cut 25 full-time positions as it faces a multi-million-dollar budget gap for the second year, and difficult financial questions ahead.Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, in an email sent Thursday night, announced to city staff and the city council that 12 union employees, as well as 13 non-union positions across a number of departments, were being eliminated. The cut positions represent roughly 5% of the city’s workforce.Seven of those positions were vacant, the mayor said.“This was an incredibly challenging process and resulted in some of the hardest decisions I have had to make as mayor,” Mulvaney-Stanak wrote in her letter to staff. “I understand that this may be upsetting news to receive, and that you will likely have questions about what this will mean going forward.”It was not immediately clear which departments were affected. A message sent to local representatives of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal union was not immediately returned.The layoffs come as Burlington faces a difficult financial future. The city needs to address a $8 million budget gap for fiscal year 2026 as its budget process begins in earnest this month.“We’ve known for some time that if we wanted to address affordability concerns and keep down the ever-increasing cost of city government that we were going to have to make some difficult decisions,” Council President Ben Traverse said in an interview.This budget season marks the second year that the first-term Progressive mayor is responding to a multi-million-dollar budget gap. Last year, the city increased existing taxes and fees and used nearly $4 million in one-time funds to fill a $14.2 million budget gap for fiscal year 2025.While this year’s budget gap is more manageable, the mayor said the “solutions to balance the budget are much fewer this year.”Over a 10-year period, the city added 98 full-time positions to the city’s general operating budget, including 37 positions created with one-time funding sources through federal or state grants or pandemic relief funding. There are just over 500 full-time positions in city government, according to the release.“The city has grown unsustainably” over the last 10 years, Mulvaney-Stanak said.In the letter, the mayor cast some blame on the city’s “outdated” charter, which she said limits the city’s ability to use property taxes “to support city expenses in a fair and predictable way for residents and city government.”City taxes increased by 6% in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, and by 11% last year.The mayor convened a tax fairness working group in February to explore ways that Burlington could redistribute its property tax structure. A recommendation from that group is expected within the next several weeks.Democratic Councilor Evan Litwin said in an interview that he had concerns the city wasn’t cutting enough, but added that budget presentations from the mayor’s office and city departments have not come expeditiously enough to make informed decisions.“My worry is we’re not having these hard conversations” between the legislative and executive bodies, he said. “We’re not being given a lot of time. We have tough decisions ahead of us.”Other city officials reacted with concern. Progressive City Councilor Gene Bergman questioned how the work done by the 25 eliminated positions would be fulfilled.“What I need to know is, what are the functions that are being eliminated that we are just not going to do, and who’s going to pick those up somewhere?” he said in an interview.This story will be updated.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Burlington cuts 25 full-time positions as city faces a difficult financial future.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Burlington-Vermont-City-Hall-1-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-05-09 12:21:58.948661

The underlying bill, which passed the Senate and could be taken up as early as Monday in the House, would authorize Clay County to establish a county sports complex authority for the purpose of “developing or maintaining sports, convention, exhibition or trade facilities.”
Any stadium funding plans would be added to the bill as an amendment in the House, said state Rep. Brad Christ, a St. Louis County Republican handling the legislation in that chamber. 
Christ said his involvement with the stadium funding is “very minimal,” and he has not been kept in the loop on any details of the proposal. 
All signs point toward Clay County as the preferred location for the new stadium, Gregory said, with the idea that moving the Royals would also clear the way for the Chiefs to remain in Arrowhead, demolish Kauffman Stadium and build a covered entertainment center.
“It’s not ‘downtown,’ but Clay County works a lot better,” Gregory said of a possible North Kansas City site. “There can be better parking. You’ll have the Kansas City skyline just two miles away. They could run the streetcar out to it. It just works.”
Some sort of local support would likely still be needed, Gregory said. But he’s optimistic that can get done, because “when I was knocking doors in Clay, the most frequent question I got was ‘what are we going to do about the Chiefs and the Royals.’”  
Both teams have publicly expressed interest in moving from Missouri to Kansas after Jackson County voters rejected a proposal last year to extend a 3/8-cent sales tax to help finance a downtown Kansas City baseball stadium and upgrades to Arrowhead. 
Kansas lawmakers responded by expanding a tax incentive program in the hopes of convincing one or both teams to relocate. The leases for both teams’ Jackson County stadiums run through the end of the 2030 season. 
Regardless of the details of any potential plan, the idea faces incredibly long odds with so little time left in the session. The House and Senate must adjourn for the year at 6 p.m. next Friday.
The tight timeline is especially problematic in the Missouri Senate, where any opposition could turn into a run-out-the-clock filibuster.
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat who co-sponsored the Clay County sports authority bill with Gregory, said she’s not been involved in recent discussions and had doubts there was time to still get something done so late in the session. 
Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, said there have been ongoing talks all year about the idea of trying to keep the Royals in Missouri. But she has not been directly involved in formal discussions of a new plan this week, she said.
And taking a stadium funding plan from start to finish in less than a week, O’Laughlin said, will be incredibly tough.

(Photo By USAf/Getty Images)The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday asked a federal judge in Virginia to immediately halt what it calls a sweeping campaign of classroom censorship in military-run schools — including at Crossroads Elementary in Quantico — stemming from executive orders issued by former President Donald J. Trump earlier this year.
The motion for preliminary injunction, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, follows a lawsuit brought last month on behalf of 12 students enrolled in Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools. 
The students, from pre-K to 11th grade, are children of active-duty service members stationed in Virginia, Kentucky, Italy and Japan.
The ACLU’s new filing alleges that books and curriculum touching on race, gender and civil rights have been systematically scrubbed under the guise of enforcing executive orders 14168, 14185 and 14190, which instruct federal agencies to purge references to “gender ideology,” “divisive concepts” and diversity programming.
In Virginia, that has included removing materials from the library at Crossroads Elementary School in Quantico and canceling student events.
“The Trump administration cannot violate the First Amendment by removing books and curricula it doesn’t like,” said Matt Callahan, senior supervising attorney at the ACLU of Virginia. “Students have a right to see themselves reflected in their libraries and classrooms, and they also have a right to learn from the perspectives of people who aren’t like them. That’s no less true for military families than for anyone else.”
Among the 233 books listed as removed or “quarantined” in the latest motion are “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee, “Looking for Alaska” by John Green and “Can’t Stop Won’t Stop: A Hip-Hop History” by Jeff Chang. The plaintiffs say the materials most frequently targeted are by or about women, people of color and LGBTQ individuals.
Jessica Henninger, a Virginia-based military parent and one of the lead plaintiffs, said her family had remained silent for months out of fear. But after watching DoDEA schools cancel Juneteenth and Holocaust Remembrance Day events and take down posters of Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistan education activist shot by the Taliban and winner of the Nobel Peace Price age 17, and Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, she decided speaking out was no longer optional.
“We make sacrifices as a military family so that my husband can defend the Constitution and the rights and freedoms of all Americans,” Henninger said. “If our own rights and the rights of our children are at risk, we have a responsibility to speak out.”
In court filings, the ACLU argues that the censorship campaign has disrupted students’ academic progress — particularly those preparing for Advanced Placement exams — and created a chilling effect in classrooms. Some students now hesitate to ask questions about race or gender, worried that even inquiry could trigger administrative pushback.
“These are American students in American schools, and they have the same First Amendment rights as their peers,” said Emerson Sykes, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “Families in DoDEA schools have the right to access books about race and gender and the right to learn about the vibrantly diverse world around them.”
Virginia plays a central role in the case. Not only are some of the plaintiffs based in the state, but the case is being heard in the Eastern District of Virginia — a jurisdiction with a history of high-profile First Amendment rulings. Attorneys believe the court could set a national precedent on how far federal agencies, including the military, can go in shaping the content of public education.
While DoDEA officials have said the policy is about “safeguarding children,” critics say it’s political overreach, forcing public servants’ children to bear the brunt of ideological battles. 
The ACLU says the orders violate the Supreme Court’s 1982 decision in Island Trees School District v. Pico, which barred school officials from removing library books simply because they dislike the ideas within.
“This kind of political meddling is antithetical to the First Amendment,” said Corey Shapiro, legal director of the ACLU of Kentucky. “And in DoDEA schools, which are some of the most diverse and high-performing schools in the nation, the impact is magnified.”
If successful, the injunction could compel DoDEA to immediately restore books and classroom materials removed this year — including at Virginia installations — and affirm the rights of military families who, attorneys say, have been sidelined in a fight over what their children are allowed to read and learn.
“Our children are not political pawns,” Henninger said. “They deserve to learn the truth — and we intend to make sure they can.”

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Historical Society (IHS) will keep its building — and take ownership of the land it sits on — after a compromise with the governor’s office.
The agreement follows earlier consternation over the historical society’s Indianapolis headquarters during the 2025 legislative session.
​​Gov. Mike Braun’s original budget proposal for the upcoming biennium included provisions that would have terminated a longstanding lease agreement, under which IHS paid $1 annually to lease the state-owned land that houses the nonprofit’s 165,000-square-foot building. The lease also obligated the state to cover approximately $1 million per year in maintenance and operational costs.
House and Senate Republicans included similar, jeopardizing language in their budget drafts.
Braun’s office later clarified that the state did not intend to force the institution to give up its building. The final version of the budget retained provisions in current law that permit IHS-state leases and only struck the maintenance requirements.
“We are very pleased to have a final agreement with the state to set in motion a process to transfer to us the land we operate on currently. They have been terrific partners throughout,” said Jody Blankenship, president and CEO of IHS. “This agreement will put us on a path to carry out our mission for decades to come.”
State’s proposed budget could cost Indiana Historical Society its building

Braun signed the next two-year state spending plan this week. It takes effect July 1, at the start of the next fiscal year.
“We are pleased that the state and the Indiana Historical Society finalized an agreement that begins the process to transfer land from the state to the Society. We appreciate the partnership of the Indiana Historical Society Board and its leadership,” said Griffin Reid, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, in a written statement to the Capital Chronicle. “The necessary legislative changes, as reflected in the budget bill, allow the Indiana Historical Society to continue its mission to preserve and promote Indiana’s rich history.”
The historical society owns the downtown Indianapolis building where its headquarters, museum and archives are housed. It does not, however, own the land on which the building sits.
Language in the earlier budget drafts would have cancelled the existing lease agreement between the state and IHS.
According to contracts reviewed by the Indiana Capital Chronicle, any expiration or termination of the lease would have required IHS to “surrender to (the state)” the land in question.
Separately, a provision in state law required the historical society to “convey” its building title to the state after the structure was constructed. That law dated back to 1992, and the IHS building opened to the public in 1999.
The title was never transferred, however. Braun’s budget deleted that conveyance language from Indiana Code.
Braun’s office maintained that the state simply wanted to reduce or eliminate costs of contractual maintenance for the IHS building, and that the governor did not intend to assume the IHS building or the state land on which it sits.

Main StreetWhite River Junction, VT 05001To send photos or reserve a “Gene Zine,” email magg.cass@gmail.com.EAST THETFORD, VT — Eugene Horton Cassidy, the prolific writer and news editor who also spent time as a house painter, bartender, cab driver, grocery clerk and community radio DJ, died peacefully Friday, May 2, 2025, at the Jack Byrne Center for Palliative & Hospice Care in Lebanon, N.H., after suffering a severe stroke days earlier. He was 70.Gene’s most important roles were friend, mentor, son, husband and, above all, father. (Well then, why don’t you lede with the most important stuff? he says. Give me a break! I say.)Gene was born Sunday, Aug. 22, 1954, in Rockville Centre, N.Y., to Eugene Charles Cassidy, a federal immigration judge, and Helen (Almond), who was raised on an upstate New York dairy farm. The family, including older sister Maureen, lived in Natick, Mass., where young Gene attended St. Patrick’s School and sang in the boys’ choir. He attended Xavier High School in Concord, Mass., before graduating from Boston College High School in 1972.Smart and funny, Gene was defined by curiosity toward the world and generosity for the people in his life. From the start, he was an unusual thinker, an exceptional writer and an insatiable reader, though an apathetic student. (Too many adjectives, he says. I say: Too bad!) He nearly graduated from Boston University before dropping out to live among friends at the beach, including on Cape Cod and in Key West, Fla. He went windsurfing and scuba diving, catching lobsters to eat. He worked with Maureen at Anthony’s Pier 4 restaurant in South Boston and as a Boston cabbie, once ferrying a famous Celtics player to McDonald’s before a game.Gene was tall and handsome (made shorter in middle age after falling out of a tree). In the early ’80s, while eating pizza barefoot at a bar, he met Nancy (Porcella) and fell in love. They were married in 1982 and moved to Framingham, Mass. Gene submitted columns and movie reviews to The Middlesex News while working as a house painter. Margaret (Maggie) was born in 1988 and Charles (Charlie) in 1990.Under the byline “E. Cassidy,” the columns grew to a regular job. Gene directed his zany skewering humor toward everyone from speeding drivers to corrupt executives and moved readers with his observations of daily life, including about his family. Op-eds written by his dog, an Akita named Bob, under the byline “B. Cassidy” were among his many hits. Gene soon led the night desk in the critical position of news editor, working overnight to shape stories and the daily report. He also shaped a generation of the paper’s reporters and editors, many of whom recalled him as a top mentor and beloved source of fun with talent to match. He could be gruff, with a newsroom temperament that ranged from seething exasperation to unbridled generosity and warmth. One former reporter recalled nights “often spent looming nervously over his shoulder as he not so delicately edited our copy and taught us life lessons about great storytelling.” He assisted the paper’s evolution to The MetroWest Daily News in 1998. After shaping the news all night, Gene was an active stay-at-home father all day, an uncommon sight in that era. Not just uncommon, Gene’s fatherhood was extraordinary. He nurtured deep bonds with Maggie and Charlie that lasted a lifetime. The trio walked to school, to Learned Pond and around Callahan State Park, often with Cocoa the dog. The family drove along the beach on Martha’s Vineyard each summer. Their cookouts were huge. (He says: Nice mix of short and long sentences!!!) Gene was very involved in Maggie’s soccer teams from youth through high school, including as a coach, criss-crossing Massachusetts in his nine-seater GMC Suburban with a gaggle of girls and equipment. He loved driving convertibles and drove Route 20 nearly cross-country with Charlie and the corgis, Lilo and Louie, in his wood-paneled Chrysler LeBaron in 2005. After divorce, Gene moved to White River Junction, Vt., in 2014 to be near Maggie, whom he’d helped to get a job at the Valley News. Charlie followed years later, and father and son moved in together in East Thetford in 2021, soon joined by Lottie the cat. In recent years, Gene rekindled an important friendship with Nancy.Gene Cassidy, of East Thetford, left, sings a Beatles song as he settles into an ice bath with support from Arjan van der Schoot, of South Woodstock, right, and Marion Griswold, of Greenfield, Massachusetts, back left, and Maria Coffin, of Hamden, Connecticut, back right, look on in White River Junction on Friday, Dec. 6, 2024.

Photo by James M. Patterson/Valley NewsIn the Upper Valley, Gene cherished time with Charlie; Maggie; his son-in-law, Chico Eastridge; and the Eastridge family. He made many friends while working briefly at the Hotel Coolidge and for 10 years at the Co-op Food Stores’ WRJ location. He loved chatting and laughing with colleagues, shoppers and his children in the grocery aisles, where he worked until his passing. (Hey, this thing is getting too long, he says. I know, I know, I say.)Gene’s final chapter, a joyous one, was marked by live music, dinners with friends and Royalton Community Radio. “All Vermont Music,” the Tuesday morning show he launched in 2021, defied its name with three-hour sets that spanned eras, genres and geography. (He once wrote that the show’s “eclectic” characterization meant “for God’s sake buddy, pick a lane.”) He recently helped relaunch a talk show about words and mentored until the end, encouraging a young colleague to pursue the writing she wanted to do.Throughout his life, Gene loved giving people gifts, silly or momentous. He picked up trash on walks and took it home to throw away. He volunteered, made art, cared for animals and tried to look out for people. To honor him, please do the same. (OK, Magg, time to wrap it up, he says. I don’t want to, I say. But I will.)In addition to many dear friends and family, Gene is survived by Charlie, Maggie, Nancy and Chico. We extend our deepest thanks to the EMTs who responded to Dad’s stroke; the medical professionals at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s emergency, neurology and neurocritical units; and the Byrne Center staff who compassionately assisted Dad’s journey. We were so grateful to be with him.In lieu of flowers, please donate to Royalton Community Radio (royaltonradio.org/donate) or the Jack Byrne Center (dartmouth-hitchcock.org/palliative-care/donate). And play badminton. He wanted to start a club!Come celebrate Gene’s life at the Hotel Coolidge in White River Junction, Vt., on the afternoon of Saturday, June 21, 2025. Details TBA.

Byron Donalds leading Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, 44%-25, in the race for the Republican nomination for governor in 2026.
That’s from a new poll conducted for the James Madison Institute (JMI) in the middle of May among 516 Republican voters.
That’s after those Republicans were informed that Donalds has already been endorsed by President Donald Trump for the governor’s race. The poll says initial results from GOP voters surveyed before learning of the Trump backing had Ms. DeSantis narrowly leading Donalds by a single point, 29%-28%.
Ms. DeSantis is not a declared candidate yet for governor, but she has not dismissed the possibility of running next year to succeed her husband, Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited from running again.
She has faced more media attention over the past month than at any other time as First Lady over the past six years. That’s because of reports about potential misappropriation of funds involving Hope Florida and the Hope Florida Foundation, the social welfare charity that she has been associated with.
Gov. DeSantis has accused House Republicans, the “liberal media,” and Democrats of launching “baseless smears against Hope Florida and by extension myself and the First Lady,” he said at a press conference in Kissimmee last month.
Donalds announced his candidacy for governor on Feb. 26, five days after  Trump endorsed him. Since his announcement, Donalds has reported raising more than $12 million as of the end of March, with most of that money flowing into his affiliated political committee.
The James Madison Institute commissioned two public polls, one in April and one in early May. The April poll results were taken when South Florida Sen. Jason Pizzo was still in the Democratic Party and a potential nominee for that party’s gubernatorial nomination next year.
The May poll shows former Northwest Florida U.S. Rep. and now cable news pundit Matt Gaetz in third place at 10%; Jeanette Nuñez, the former lieutenant governor and now interim president of Florida International University, in fourth place with 9% support. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez is next with 5%.
Democratic field
As mentioned above, the JMI poll surveyed voters in both April and May. In April, it surveyed 464 Democratic voters, who gave Pizzo 41% support.
In distant second place at that time was Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava with 15%. Former Republican U.S. Rep. turned Democrat David Jolly was next with 7%, followed by former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham at 5%.
Jacksonville state Rep. Angie Nixon and former South Florida state Sen. Lauren Book were next at 4%. South Florida state Sen. Shevrin Jones was at 2% and House Leader Fentrice Driskell was at 1%.
But with Pizzo’s departure, a follow-up survey in May of 396 Democratic voters showed Mayor Levine Cava now leads the Democrats with 32%. Gwen Graham is next at 13%, followed by Jolly at 10% and former state Sen. Lauren Book at 7%. However, 20% were undecided.
The survey in both months was conducted by Targoz Market Research of 1,200 voters, 43% of whom said they were Republicans, 33% Democrats, and 23% independent voters. It has a +/- margin of error of 2.77%.

Lewes, a quiet seaside town known for its scenic views and laid-back charm, was the clear favorite.
Trap Pond State Park and Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge rounded out the top three.
With its calm beaches, historic streets, and tranquil trails through Cape Henlopen State Park, Lewes offers the kind of peaceful atmosphere many moms say they rarely get to enjoy.
“Whether it’s a bike ride along the bay or just sitting by the water with a good book, Lewes gives moms space to breathe,” the survey report noted.
Runner-up destinations also highlight a preference for nature and solitude.
Trap Pond State Park, with its bald cypress trees and quiet kayaking spots, is a haven for outdoorsy moms.

he survey reveals that modern motherhood often leaves little room for recharging. Moms report getting just under six hours of alone time each week—far less than the nearly 8.5 hours they say they need to truly feel rested.
The biggest barriers to self-care are time, guilt, and financial constraints.
When asked how they’d spend a full day to themselves, moms favored simple pleasures: watching TV, sleeping in, spending time outdoors, or enjoying a hobby.
Their top dream gift? A clean house, followed closely by a full day off without responsibilities.
“Mother’s Day is about more than gifts—it’s about giving moms a real moment to recharge,” said Sanjit Sandhu of Present.com. “Whether that means a peaceful beach, a cozy nature walk, or just time without a to-do list, our survey shows moms are craving space to slow down and feel appreciated.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01e3c19c3855eea267b9d1d0ea36352c.jpg,,,2025-05-09 11:08:45.647714

Robert Prevost, the Chicago-born missionary who spent his career ministering in Peru and took over the Vatican’s powerful office of bishops, was elected the first pope from the United States in the history of the Catholic Church on Thursday.
Prevost took the name Leo XIV.
Archbishop Christopher Coyne, head of the Archdiocese of Hartford, said he was not expecting a decision to come so soon.
“I have to say when the announcement was made that Cardinal Prevost was to be our next pope, I was stunned. The first words out of my mouth were a two-letter phrase of which the first word is ‘holy.’ And I will leave the second word to your imagination,” he told reporters just hours after the white smoke emerged from the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican. “I never thought for a minute that an American would be elected pope.”
Coyne spoke at the Archdiocese of Hartford Pastoral Center in Bloomfield. He said he knows the new pope to be level-headed and well-qualified for the role.
“On behalf of all Americans, I congratulate our fellow American, Robert Francis Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV, on his elevation to the office of St. Peter,” Coyne said. “My hope is that he will show to the world a side of America that is merciful, charitable, generous and peaceful.”
Coyne said he hopes the election of an American pope will invigorate the Catholic faith in Connecticut and across the country. The new pope is also a citizen of Peru, where he served the church for many years, and Coyne noted the significance for the Peruvian community in Connecticut.
“I think the very fact that they were watching this man from Peru, who was a bishop in Peru, who is a citizen of Peru, speaking to them in Spanish — their hearts must have been just as full as mine is, as his being an American.”
Brian Stiltner, a theology professor at Sacred Heart University, said the newly-elected pope is known for his compassion towards marginalized groups such as immigrants.
“He’s a person with a global view of the economy and politics in the church,” Stiltner said. “From what we’ve seen of his public comments in social media in recent years, he is very much in the spirit of Pope Francis.”
Stiltner said the new pope will lead the church during a time of heightened divisions between conservative and liberal Catholics in the United States, but increased growth in Africa and Asia.
Prayers for Pope Leo XIV
In eastern Connecticut, Bishop Richard Reidy of the Catholic Diocese of Norwich offered prayers for the new pope. Reidy, who was appointed bishop just a few months before the death of Pope Francis, said the Catholic church is renewed and called the pope’s selection a visible sign of unity and hope.
“May his leadership draw the Church ever closer to Christ, and may he be strengthened in his mission to proclaim the truth in love to a world in need of mercy, peace, and faith,” Reidy said.
New Haven-area U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Catholic, says she is also praying for the new pope.
“I am praying for your success, your wisdom, and your moral clarity in guiding the church through these trying times,” DeLauro wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
DeLauro noted the last pope to take the name Leo is considered the father of Catholic social teaching, who affirmed the dignity of workers in the late 19th century. DeLauro, a Democrat, said she hopes the new Pope Leo carries on that tradition.
Gov. Ned Lamont said the pope’s selection is a celebratory day for millions of Catholics all over the world.
“My prayers are with Pope Leo XIV as he guides the church and leads with wisdom, faith, and compassion,” Lamont said.

(Courtesy of South Dakota NewsMedia Association)Delayed Postal Service deliveries of small-town newspapers are frustrating readers, undermining subscriptions and hurting advertising revenue, according to publishers across South Dakota.
“It’s taking nine days to get a paper from Armour to Sioux Falls,” said Julie Hinckley of Rocket Printing, which prints several small-town publications. “That’s unacceptable for timely news.”
Armour and Sioux Falls are about 95 miles apart. Many smaller publishers, like those that work with Rocket Printing, depend on the post office for deliveries to subscribers who’ve moved away to Sioux Falls or other locations but still want to receive their hometown paper. Some larger newspapers that formerly hired employees to deliver the paper now count on the post office even for local deliveries, due to tighter budgets, a migration to online readership and a lack of people interested in having a paper route.
The Postal Service had announced last year it would pause — at least until this year — a controversial plan to downgrade several mail processing centers, including one in Huron. The pause followed pushback from the state’s congressional delegation. 
In a Feb. 21 press release, the Postal Service announced a $3 billion cost-cutting initiative, but also mentioned $3 million in planned upgrades to the Huron facility. The release did not mention the removal of any sorting operations.
Then, in early April, a postal employee emailed David Bordewyk, executive director of the South Dakota NewsMedia Association, to say that some sorting operations were halted in Huron, and some newspapers and other bulk mail were going to a postal facility in Fargo, North Dakota, before being routed back to South Dakota for final delivery.
The change adds days to delivery, according to newspaper publishers.
“We’re getting calls left and right,” said Barb Pechous with the Wagner Post. “Advertisers are starting to pull back.”

Dan Bechtold with the Winner Advocate said readers are assuming their subscription has lapsed when papers don’t arrive on time. 
“If something is coming up people want to know about, they’re going to miss it,” he said.
After reaching out to member newspapers, Bordewyk heard from at least a dozen papers reporting problems. He also reached out to the state’s congressional delegation, whose staffers said the Postal Service claimed the problem stemmed from newspapers not properly sorting their own mail. 
Bordewyk said that explanation “doesn’t make any sense,” because papers have been sorting the same way for years.
“Are they changing the rules in the middle of the game?” he said. “If things need to be fixed, tell us. Work with us.”
Bordewyk said the Postal Service has not provided newspapers with any updated guidance on how to prepare mail. He hopes to arrange a meeting between the papers and the Postal Service. 
The Postal Service responded to a request for comment by asking for more specific questions from South Dakota Searchlight, but did not immediately respond upon receiving those questions.



 Newspaper delays in South Dakota

The South Dakota NewsMedia Association has collected reports of postal delivery delays from member newspapers, including:

The Timber Lake Topic reported more readers switching to email delivery due to delays, but noted that many subscribers are elderly or lack reliable internet.
The Highmore Herald reported a subscriber in South Dakota who hasn’t received the last four issues.
The Aberdeen Insider said papers delivered just 50 miles away are taking seven days to arrive, resulting in a loss of subscribers. 
The Sanborn Weekly Journal, based in Woonsocket, said it had received at least six non-delivery calls in one week alone, far above normal.
The True Dakotan in Wessington Springs reported delays of at least two days and said a major delivery to Mitchell never arrived.
The Pioneer Review in Philip reported that its shopper publication didn’t reach Wall one week. A local postmaster confirmed that papers are now trucked from Huron to Fargo.
The Wagner Post reported papers taking up to nine days to reach customers.
The Grant County Review in Milbank received non-delivery complaints from as far as Vermont and Oregon.
The Sioux Valley News in Canton said cross-border deliveries to Iowa and Minnesota now take five days.
The Marshall County Journal in Britton noted delays forcing staff to re-mail individual copies in envelopes.
The Brookings Register said subscribers reported no delivery for a week, with delayed bundles arriving out of order.

(Screenshot of meeting)Starting next month, regents on New Mexico university boards will have to complete 10 hours of training to prepare them for their roles in guiding academic institutions. 
Senate Bill 19, sponsored by Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces), directs the New Mexico Department of Higher Education to develop those training hours to include topics such as state law, financial management, institutional governance and student success. The HED is tasked with providing the training and ensuring regents comply. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed SB19 on April 8 and the bill goes into effect on June 20. The bill states that current regents must complete the training by Dec. 31 this year. 
Higher Education Department Spokesperson Auriella Ortiz told Source NM in a written statement that members of the department have started considering requirements and platforms for the training, which she said is projected to be completed by the end of the year.
“Since the agency has provided a similar type of training for regents in the past, this process is not new to us,” Ortiz wrote.
Steven Neville, a former state senator who represented San Juan County, recently took over as chair of the Western New Mexico University Board of Regents. The entire board consists of four new members after previous members resigned or concluded their tenure in late 2024 and early 2025, following the board’s controversial decision to award outgoing university President Joseph Shepard a $1.9 million severance package. Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a civil suit against Shepard and the board in an effort to recover the state funds. A hearing is scheduled in June to consider Shepard’s motion to dismiss the case against him.
Neville told Source NM that he has a lot of knowledge about state law and financial management from his time as a lawmaker and member of the Legislative Finance Committee, which he will use in his new role, but university management is still different. 
“There’re certain things about the way universities run that are totally different than my county commission experience or my city council experience or even my state senate experience,” Neville said. “I’ve been on several boards and commissions through the years, but nothing is exactly the same.” 
He added that all four members of the board need some aspect of the future training, despite everyone’s background. He said the HED provided all new regents with a short orientation over a couple of hours when they were first appointed, but hopes that future training also involves more explanation of higher education policies and funding “intricacies that are a little different from one agency to the next.”
Ortiz reiterated to Source that the HED already provides training to newly appointed and reappointed regents covering topics such as governance, ethics, fiscal management and state and federal laws. 
“Adding a requirement of 10 hours will enhance a governing boards’ understanding of their appointed or elected positions in addition to the tools they need to better champion students, faculty and staff on their campuses,” Ortiz wrote. “It is important to note that Higher Education Secretary Stephanie M. Rodriguez and our colleagues at the department are always available to assist governing board members at any time beyond the training sessions.”
During the session earlier this year, Steinborn told Senate Education Committee members that he introduced the bill to ensure regents are prepared for their work in hiring university presidents, setting tuition and other actions that fundamentally impact students and faculty. SB19 was one of several bills and resolutions introduced this session that would have addressed the process for how regents are chosen and the preparation they receive for fulfilling their roles.
Steinborn also introduced Senate Joint Resolution 7, which would have required the governor to choose regent nominees from a pool of candidates approved by a nominating committee. House Joint Resolution 12, introduced by Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), would have codified regents’ fiduciary duties; moved regent removal proceedings to the district courts; and allowed the attorney general or a majority of the board to initiate the removal of a regent. Both resolutions would have required a ballot vote to amend the state constitution, however both died in committee.
“I think we owe it to our universities and our kids and taxpayers that we have the best regents we can get and that they’re trained,” Steinborn said during the committee meeting.

The Lactation Network, a third-party biller that allows Mississippians with certain insurance to see non-physician lactation consultants, will no longer accept Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi patients. The network was previously subsidizing the unpaid portion of the claim for these moms’ visits, but it said that it can no longer afford to do so.  
The Lactation Network did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Mississippi Today by the time the story published. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi is the state’s largest private insurer. Lactation consultants and breastfeeding advocates worry the reduced coverage will worsen Mississippi’s breastfeeding rate – already one of the lowest in the country. The loss in coverage could have profound impacts on the health of mothers and children, experts say. 
“It’s such a complex puzzle of how to improve maternal and infant outcomes, but we know that breastfeeding is an integral, foundational part of that,” said Dr. Christina Glick, a retired neonatologist and lactation consultant in the Jackson area. “ … Lack of reimbursement will interfere with delivery of care, which will reduce breastfeeding rates.”

Breastfeeding has been proven to lower the incidence of diseases, infections and depression in both mother and baby. But it’s not always straightforward, and the list of potential challenges is not short: oversupply, undersupply, allergies and sensitivities, problems with pumping upon return to work, milk blisters and a host of other issues. Ninety-two percent of new mothers report having trouble breastfeeding three days postpartum and needing support.
Shay Bequette, a 25-year-old from Hattiesburg with Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance, overcame multiple hurdles to breastfeed her baby, born in January.
“I was struggling,” Bequette said. “I’m the first in my family to breastfeed. And my son was really small … I knew something was wrong intuitively, but I just couldn’t understand because I was producing (milk), but he was constantly crying. I was breastfeeding for an hour and a half on each side and he was still crying like he was in pain.”
Emotions and stakes are high for mothers learning to breastfeed. Moms who struggle to breastfeed often report feeling a sense of failure, while also facing intense pressure to make sure their baby is gaining adequate weight. 
Though she didn’t want to, Bequette considered switching to formula – and says she would have if she wasn’t able to access affordable lactation support. 
“I was losing my marbles, I was crying, I was frustrated,” Bequette said. “My whole family was like, ‘you know, you’re just going to have to switch to formula, obviously it’s not working.’”

Instead, Bequette found Maranda Nybo, an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) based in Pass Christian who expanded her practice to include a once-weekly trip to Hattiesburg. Bequette credits all of her current breastfeeding success to Nybo.
“She saved my sanity, and she saved his life,” said Bequette. 
Now, Bequette will have to discontinue her care – and Nybo worries for the future of her practice, where she estimates between 80 and 90% of her clients use Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance.
“Sunday, Monday and (Tuesday) I’ve had 12 moms schedule appointments with me … every single one of them have been denied as of today,” Nybo told Mississippi Today. “All of them, except one, have canceled their appointments with me.”
The Lactation Network announced April 30 that working with certain insurance companies is no longer affordable.
“Historically, nearly 1 in 4 out-of-network visits that TLN covers go unpaid by health plans,” read an April 30 email from TLN to providers. “For a long time, we’ve subsidized the cost of care, hoping these plans would come around and reimburse us for this vital care. But that’s not sustainable — we can’t continue absorbing the costs that these plans should be covering.”
A spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield Mississippi told Mississippi Today the company wasn’t aware of the changes and has no formal agreement with TLN. 
“Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Mississippi Members continue to have access to lactation consultation services when they use a Network Provider,” a Blue Cross spokesperson said.
The only in-network lactation consultants currently covered by Blue Cross are physicians, who do not generally operate outpatient clinics focused solely on breastfeeding care.  
While new mothers usually get some form of support while they’re still in the hospital, most breastfeeding problems don’t develop until well after they leave, explained Erin Mattingly, a Jackson-based IBCLC. 
“I hear all the time that parents think breastfeeding is going fairly well in the hospital and then they get home and things fall apart,” she said. “And a lot of that is because during their time in the hospital, for the vast majority of mothers, their mature milk supply has not even arrived yet. So, it’s after the mature milk comes in that they start to have issues.”
After parents leave the hospital, the next appointment is typically scheduled two weeks later with a pediatrician. The majority of mothers who are struggling to breastfeed will give up if they don’t get help in that interim period, Mattingly said. 
Even if moms continue breastfeeding for those two weeks, they don’t always get comprehensive lactation support during the pediatric visit.
Bequette says when she broached the subject with her obstetrician and her pediatrician, each of them referred her to the other for guidance. That’s not unusual, according to Mattingly. 
“Doctors are fantastic at what they do, but they don’t have the same lactation training that lactation consultants have,” Mattingly said. “And in addition to that, they don’t have the time. If they have 10, 15 minutes with a patient, that’s not enough time to observe a feeding, problem solve what could be going on, and create a strategy going forward.”
An average lactation session with Mattingly or Nybo runs between 60 and 90 minutes and costs between $100 and $125 without insurance. 
That may be an affordable out-of-pocket cost to some, but it will put support out of reach for many moms who are already at a disadvantage for breastfeeding. 
“As a private practice, for me this is devastating,” Nybo said. “But it’s also really devastating for the moms.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/09082035/IMG_0328.jpg,,,2025-05-09 10:02:47.633415

The western Oregon transit service is warning of potential service cuts if the state does not provide more funding. (Tillamook County Transportation District)Compared with major American cities, the ridership on public buses in Minot, North Dakota, can seem relatively minuscule.
But the 82,000 rides taken each year allow people without cars to get to work, help those with disabilities get around and connect patients with crucial health care.
“The value of those rides is unmeasurable, because the people that are using our system need our system,” said Brian Horinka, the city’s transit superintendent.
Like in many cities — from sprawling metropolitan areas to smaller and rural communities — the financial future of public transit is questionable in Minot, population 48,000. While increasing, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. Federal funding and state budgets remain uncertain, while inflation is pinching transit services.
For example, Horinka said he’s looking to buy a new 30-foot heavy-duty bus. He expects it will cost up to $700,000 because of inflation. Just five years ago, a similar model could be had for about $400,000, he said.
“We’re in dire straits, from a financial standpoint,” he said.
North Dakota’s four largest cities, including Minot, asked lawmakers for millions in extra grant dollars this year to keep transit buses rolling. The state enacted a new law awarding $2 million in grants — a welcome reprieve, but far less than the $15 million initially requested.
Republican state Rep. Dan Ruby, a sponsor of the legislation, said cities will likely need to increase local funding for bus systems.
“I don’t think it’s enough,” he said. “I think it is going to just be somewhat of a stopgap for some of them to be able to function.”
The law also calls for a study to develop a proposed funding formula for fixed-route bus systems. Ruby said he would prefer a permanent funding model that doesn’t require cities to continually rely on legislative grants.
“We also want to make sure that they’re not sitting on funds or running inefficiently just because they have the funding,” he said. “That’s the key to get support from most of the legislators, to show that they really do have a need and there’s no way to find any more cuts in their operations without affecting the people that need the rides.”
It’s indicative of discussions occurring in state capitals across the country as public transit faces existential funding challenges.
Public transit systems in major cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco face the potential of deep service cuts without more funding. But the problems also extend to smaller systems that connect people in rural America and smaller cities.
 
Partisan debates over transit funding
In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said the transit financial crisis affects residents in all 67 of the commonwealth’s counties.
“Let me just say, we face a dire situation for mass transit agencies all across Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh to Philly and rural communities in between,” Shapiro said at a news conference in April.
Transit funding has been stuck in a partisan battle in Harrisburg.
In November, to stave off cuts, Shapiro ordered the transfer of more than $150 million in federal highway funds to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as SEPTA, which serves the greater Philadelphia area with bus and regional rail lines. He’s also backed legislation to increase transit funding, which has found support in the Democratic-controlled state House but so far has not advanced in the GOP-controlled state Senate.
Late last month, House Republican Leader Jesse Topper proposed partially privatizing the Philadelphia-area transit agency rather than increasing funding, which he said in a statement would “only serve to patch over the problems of a system chronically in crisis.”
“The same old, same old is clearly not working,” he said, according to a report by public radio station WESA.
The transit agency has said it already operates one of the most efficient systems in the nation. On a special website it created to call attention to its $213 million budget deficit, SEPTA said there’s “nothing left to cut from the budget but service.”
The authority has said it may be forced to cut services by 45% and raise fares by 20% without help from the state.
Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents a portion of North Philadelphia, said that would be “catastrophic” for the region.
“It makes this not only a less appealing place to live for people who are considering moving here,” he said, “but it also makes it difficult to live for folks who call this area home.”
Kenyatta, who dismissed the idea of privatization, said the state has a moral and economic obligation to ensure sustainable funding for public transportation.
“We’ve done patches here and there,” he said. “And that patchwork approach is not one that inspires the type of confidence and allows our transit agencies to do the type of long-term planning that they need to do.”
 
Transit’s pandemic ‘death spiral’
Mass transit saw some of the most immediate impacts of COVID-19 as people worked from home and avoided public spaces.
The federal government provided nearly $70 billion in pandemic aid to transit programs, which saw revenues drop sharply because of reduced fare collections.
But with the rise of remote and hybrid work, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels even as costs for labor and equipment skyrocket. A recent Bloomberg News analysis estimates the nation’s largest transit systems are facing a $6 billion shortfall — only heightening fears of a so-called death spiral in which a combination of service cuts and fare increases cause further erosion of riders and revenue.
In Oregon, Democratic lawmakers have proposed increasing the state’s dedicated transit payroll tax. Billed as “a starting point,” the plan would increase the tax from 0.1% to 0.18% — estimated to raise $269 million over each two-year budget cycle.
“That’s appreciated, but it’s nowhere near what it needs to be,” said Brian Vitulli, general manager of the Tillamook County Transportation District in western Oregon. “There could be some service reductions in the near future if we don’t get more funding.”
Aside from rising costs, Vitulli faces major hiring challenges: The district has 19 drivers but could use eight to 10 more. With too few drivers, bus service has been cut to six days a week.
For some riders, the transit services provide a lifeline. After last year’s closure of Tillamook’s only dialysis center, for example, the agency began offering rides to other dialysis clinics well outside its service area.
That has driven up costs and tied up drivers, making services such as the on-demand Dial-A-Ride less available for other residents.
“We’re kind of the only option for these dialysis patients,” he said. “And we’re kind of prioritizing those trips rather than somebody who just wants to go to the Elks Club for lunch or something.”
Vitulli also serves on the board of the Oregon Transit Association, which is lobbying instead for a 0.4% increase in the transit payroll tax phased in over eight years. The association said the current 0.08% proposal could force transit providers across the state to cut services by as much as 25% in the next few years as inflation and decreased fare collections push many into deficits.
TriMet, which operates rail, bus and paratransit services across 533 square miles of the Portland region, said it would still need to cut services even if the lawmakers’ proposed 0.08% funding increase were approved. The agency faces a deficit of nearly $75 million for the upcoming fiscal year.
Oregon lawmakers are broadly concerned about federal spending cuts, which could turn the state’s modest budget surplus into a gaping deficit, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported. Nearly a third of the state’s budget comes from federal money.
Democratic state Rep. Susan McLain said budget uncertainty has heightened scrutiny of all state spending this session. She is one of the authors of the state’s transportation proposal, crafted after nearly two years of meetings across the state. Aside from increasing the transit payroll tax, it calls for boosting the gas tax and hiking vehicle registration costs to help pay for road improvements.
McLain, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Transportation, said budget negotiations are ongoing, with aims of having hearings later this month.
While the state wants to do more to ensure everyone can access medical care, schools and jobs, McLain noted that belt-tightening is imperative for all manner of agencies, including transit.
“We’re really trying to dig in and find ways to do more with less,” she said, “but also to make sure that we’ve got sufficient, adequate types of investment in areas that we value.”

The post Former state senator defends position at nursing home in receivership  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","DIANNE WILKERSON, the former state senator who now works at a financially struggling Boston nursing home, defended her salary after a Superior Court judge raised concerns. A year ago, after the Benjamin Healthcare Center was placed into receivership to avoid closing the long-term care facility, the court-appointed receiver hired Wilkerson as his executive assistant. But her role at the facility, located in Boston’s Mission Hill neighborhood, has come under scrutiny over the last several months. Christopher Belezos, the judge overseeing the receivership case, asked for more details about her salary information, citing testimony she had given in response to “allegations of nepotism and self-dealing.” The judge’s concerns, outlined in an April 22 filing, came days after a court hearing in which Wilkerson and Joseph Feaster, the court-appointed receiver, took the stand to deny allegations of financial mismanagement and nepotism. Separately, the nursing home’s administrator, Delicia Mark, also complained that Feaster and Wilkerson created a hostile work environment, an allegation which Feaster categorically denied. Feaster has known Wilkerson since their days on Beacon Hill in the Dukakis administration. Wilkerson, once considered a rising political star, resigned in 2008 from the state Senate seat she’d held for 15 years after she was indicted on federal corruption charges. Asked about her hiring and her history last year, Feaster said Wilkerson had “served her time” between 2011 and 2013 in prison. Noting that Wilkerson testified under the pains and penalty of perjury, Judge Belezos pointed to Wilkerson’s statement that she earned $82 an hour and worked 90 hours per week. Last September, Wilkerson told CommonWealth Beacon that she worked “probably 70 to 80 hours a week.” “If such testimony is accurate, it raises significant concerns as to the rate of remuneration being paid to Ms. Wilkerson by an institution in receivership” and projected to lose roughly $4.4 million in 2025, Judge Belezos wrote in his filing, asking for tax forms and her most recent paystubs. Wilkerson filed a May 3 affidavit in response saying she wanted to “clarify” her testimony. Her testimony of “90 hours” was meant to be in reference to 90 hours over a two-week pay period, and she worked an average of 45 to 50 hours per week, she wrote. She added that as a salaried employee, she is not paid overtime.  She also submitted a lengthy list of her job responsibilities, including negotiating contracts with vendors, working with a bookkeeper to collect money owed to the Benjamin, and serving as a point of contact for information and document requests from banks, state. and federal officials looking into the facility’s former administrator’s financial activity before receivership. Her paystub and other salary information were filed under seal for privacy reasons. In the affidavit, Wilkerson reiterated her denials of nepotism and self-dealing. The allegations were sparked by an anonymous letter from employees pointing to the hiring of Wilkerson relatives to work in the facility, as well as a snow removal contract given to a company run by two of her sons. When she was on the stand last month, Wilkerson said she was not involved in the hiring of her relatives, and the hiring of the relatives was not a conflict of interest. She defended the hiring of her sons’ snow removal company, citing a “flash snowstorm” during the Benjamin’s 2024 Christmas party. The questions about her role were raised as Feaster, the receiver, is talking to companies interested in taking over the 164-bed facility, which will turn 100 years old in 2027. It is the only nursing home in the Northeast serving predominantly Black residents. The terms and conditions of any takeover include keeping the Benjamin name and ensuring the real estate that the building sits on remains dedicated to the facility. There is no mortgage on the facility, according to Feaster. Proposals were originally due May 8, but Feaster has extended it to June 5. Any sale requires approvals from the state’s highest court, the state attorney general, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The next court date is set for May 15 in Suffolk Superior Court. The post Former state senator defends position at nursing home in receivership  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/janey-7.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-09 10:02:47.633415

(Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — An herbal substance used as both a stimulant and sedative will likely soon be illegal for anyone under 21 in South Carolina.
The two psychoactive compounds in kratom, which comes from the leaves of a tree in Southeast Asia, can provide energy in low doses or mimic the effects of opioids in large doses. Lawful and unregulated, the potentially dangerous drug is available for anyone to buy at stores statewide.
Legislation sent Thursday to Gov. Henry McMaster would change that.
The bill approved unanimously in both chambers would ban stores from selling kratom to anyone under 21 and from displaying kratom products in a place where minors can access them.
While kratom products, often sold in capsules or gummies, would still be legal for adults, the bill sets requirements for the packaging. The containers must have “clear” labeling that includes ingredients, the amount of kratom, recommended amount for safe usage, and servings per container.
The bill also bans selling kratom products mixed with other things.
Violators could be fined $1,000 on the first offense and $2,000 for each additional offense.
“There are no restrictions or regulations around any type of kratom product,” Sen. Russell Ott, the bill’s lead sponsor, told the SC Daily Gazette. “A 14-year-old could walk into a store, buy it — buy as much as they want — and it’s legal in the state of South Carolina.”
The law takes effect 60 days after the governor signs it. Ott said that should give owners of the stores that sell the products time to comply.
“We’re not going to have to wait another seven months with minors being able to access something that clearly has an impact,” said the St. Matthews Democrat. “I think it’s appropriate to say, ‘It’s not for the kids.’ I’m excited about the bottom line of getting it out of here.”
There are no federally approved uses of kratom. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns against taking it, and the Drug Enforcement Agency considers it a drug of concern.
However, people use the drug to increase energy and alertness (in low doses) and as an alternative to opioids (in high doses) for pain relief and to manage withdrawal from opioids, according to the National Institute of Health. But it is also potentially addictive, linked to liver toxicity, seizures and could even be deadly.
Kratom was responsible for more than 4,100 deaths between 2020 and 2022, according to a Washington Post analysis of 44 states and Washington D.C. That is a fraction of the nearly 320,000 overdose deaths the Center for Disease Control and Prevention tallied during the same period.
Something brand new
Ott, a former House member newly elected to the Senate in November, said he first heard of kratom in 2018, when he got a call from a constituent about an addicted family member.
After that, he started noticing neon kratom signs regularly.
“I started asking some questions, but didn’t really get a lot of answers,” Ott said, adding he “just clearly realized that this was something kind of brand new.”
Then, about 2 ½ years ago, Ott got another phone call about it, this time from a friend’s son who admitted to having a kratom addiction.
Over a 90-minute conversation, the man detailed how the habit hurt his confidence and wallet, but said it’s still less dangerous than opioids and other drugs.
“He gave me both sides of it,” said Ott.
As kratom’s popularity has increased, states nationwide have tried to figure out how to tackle it.
At least six states, including Alabama and Arkansas, have banned kratom, according to an April report from the Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association. And in 18 more states the selling, manufacturing or possessing kratom is regulated, the report found.
Ott first proposed regulations on selling kratom last year.
The bill received a single hearing in the House before dying with the end of session. However, Ott noticed that more legislators were getting calls about kratom.
“We finally started getting a little traction, finally started getting people to ask more questions about it,” he said.
House moves quickly
A companion proposal to Ott’s was filed in the House in February. However, Rep. Heath Sessions, a co-sponsor of the bill, said he thought it had little chance this year.
But once the Senate unanimously approved the bill two weeks ago, supporters in the House jumped on the chance to make the bill law, the Rock Hill Republican told the SC Daily Gazette.
The lead sponsor of the House bill, Rep. Don Chapman, R-Townville has been pushing to regulate kratom since 2023.
Chapman, an architect, had a client with a son that became addicted to kratom while in high school and was eventually sent to rehab.
“He was taking so many pills because he built up a tolerance to it, and then just took more and more,” said Chapman, adding that he knows of constituents who have died from kratom overdoses.
This bill doesn’t stop anyone 21 or older from using it, Chapman said, likening it to alcohol.
But it does ensure that children are kept safe, the primary reason he advocated for the bill to be fast-tracked through the House.
“Time is at the essence when you’re trying to protect our young kids,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1298-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 10:02:47.633415

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Permafrost thaw is expected to impose costs of $37 billion to $51 billion to Alaska roads and buildings through the middle of the century, according to a newly published study.
The calculated toll, detailed in a study published in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environment, is higher than previous estimates of thaw costs to Alaska permafrost. That is because of a more complete inventory of roads, buildings and structures like storage tanks, made possible by improved satellite imagery and other technology, said lead author Elias Manos of the University of Connecticut.
Past studies have estimated several billion dollars in estimated costs. A 2023 study of thaw damages to infrastructure across the Arctic, for example, estimated costs to Alaska transportation facilities at between $14 billion and $24.5 billion by midcentury, with another $3 billion in costs from damages expected to buildings.
As information about existing infrastructure increases, estimates of costs are likely to do so as well, said Manos, who is pursuing the research as he works toward a doctoral degree. Better permafrost modeling could also help refine cost estimates, he said.
An important aspect of the study is that thaw damages analyzed are already ongoing, Manos said.
This number is what has already occurred or what is occurring in the moment, as opposed to what’s happening or going to happen the future,” he said.
The study compares expected costs under two climate scenarios, one with lower carbon emissions that eventually level off, creating less dramatic global warming, and the other with carbon emissions continuing at about their current rate, resulting in higher levels of warming.
It also compares effects in different parts of the state.
Measured by dollars, the Fairbanks North Star Borough stands to bear the highest costs, at over $7.4 billion for buildings and over $6 billion for roads through the 2060s, under the higher warming scenario. That reflects the concentration of infrastructure in that relatively high-population area, Manos said.
Measured per capita in the higher-warming scenario, the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area has the highest anticipated costs of permafrost-thaw damages to buildings and houses, the study found.
Even a more southern part of the state, where permafrost exists only in sporadic pockets, is vulnerable to damages, the study found. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough expected to have approximately $1 billion in permafrost-related costs through the 2060s, almost entirely from damage to roads, according to the study.
While enhanced information about infrastructure has enabled a more refined estimate for thaw-related costs, the infrastructure tally in the new study is incomplete.
It does not include the North Slope oil fields, oil pipelines, the Red Dog Mine or other large industrial sites. Manos said he has analyzed those and plans to include them in future studies. This study is more focused on communities “where people actually live,” he said.
Those communities are also where much of the cost of permafrost thaw is borne, sometimes without much assistance, said study co-author Anna Liljedahl of the Massachusetts-based Woodwell Climate Research Center.
Homeowners can buy flood insurance, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency provides aid to cover damage caused by various weather and climate events, Liljedahl noted. “But when it comes to permafrost, it’s not part of the language at the federal level,” she said.
The federal Stafford Act, under which FEMA provides disaster aid, addresses acute events like storms, not ongoing and more gradual events like permafrost thaw.
Thaw can be expensive to homeowners, nonetheless, she said. She cited cases in Fairbanks where people bought property without understanding the permafrost below. “Suddenly, there are sinkholes appearing, and their foundation is sinking in,” she said.
The analysis of thaw-related costs to infrastructure is continuing.
The Alaska-focused study is part of a more comprehensive circumpolar mapping project by Manos that also includes Canada and Russia.
Up to now, lack of data about infrastructure has posed a challenge, especially in Russia, he said. That is why satellite imagery is valuable.
“That’s kind of the beauty of satellite-based Earth observation, or as people call it, remote sensing,” he said. There is now commercial satellite imagery spanning the Arctic, he added.

Last week the Northern California beach town of Santa Cruz enacted a tax on sodas, ice teas and other beverages with added sugar. Voters approved the 2-cent-per-ounce tax in November, despite the beverage industry pouring at least $1.2 million in opposition.
Besides generating an estimated $1.3 million for the city, the tax aims to curb the overconsumption of sugary drinks, which research has shown to work. Drinking too many sugary drinks can lead to heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, said Blythe Young, a lobbyist for the American Heart Association, a key proponent of the tax.

Young: “The average American consumes a bathtub full of sugar from sugary drinks annually, or 30 gallons.”

But the tax also exists in defiance of state law — sort of.
Let’s back up: In 2018 California lawmakers brokered a deal with the beverage industry to preemptively ban local governments from implementing local grocery taxes until 2030.
That law included a provision requiring the state to withhold local sales tax revenue from any city imposing its own new grocery tax, even if a court determined that the tax “is a valid exercise of a city’s authority.”
Charter cities — which under California’s constitution are granted more flexibility from some state laws — took that part personally. Especially Santa Cruz, at the time poised to put a soda tax proposal before voters, which it then had to scrap.
But, in 2023 a state appeals court ruled that the withholding revenue part of the law was unconstitutional, giving Santa Cruz’s city council the green light to move forward with a soda tax. So, the law against cities enacting their own grocery tax is still in effect, but the law has no teeth (perhaps appropriate for a law effectively protecting sugar consumption).
In a statement to CalMatters, the American Beverage Association said it is assessing next steps, decrying Santa Cruz’s tax as illegal and an “unfair burden on working families struggling with record-high prices.”
A legal dispute would serve as yet another instance of a city attempting to carve out more autonomy. Cities have recently fought to enact their own housing policies, election rules and book bans. But instead of coming to blows with the state (or the federal government at times), Santa Cruz would be facing a multibillion-dollar industry.

Shebreh Kalantari-Johnson, Vice Mayor of Santa Cruz: “We’re ready for that. … It does not have to be the case where people with money or special interests can dictate how a city, county or state makes decisions. It should not be.”

Prisons not ready for disasters, report finds

As President Donald Trump directs the Department of Justice and FBI to reopen the aging Alcatraz as a prison, a review of 30 active state prisons found that California’s corrections system is woefully unprepared for natural disasters, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
Published last week, the report by an independent oversight agency said that issues with transportation, overcrowding and an emphasis on reshuffling prisoners within prison walls during a disaster instead of an outside location, are some of the shortcomings of the prisons’ emergency preparedness.

The report: “The department is unable to evacuate the incarcerated population and staff at most prisons within the first critical 72 hours of an emergency. Without the ability to quickly evacuate prisons, it is likely that wildfires, floods, and earthquakes will result in loss of life within the incarcerated population.”

In 2023 storms threatened to flood two San Joaquin Valley prisons. The prisons ultimately remained safe, but the event underscored the department’s need to develop better evacuation plans.
Some human rights advocates say the findings are still troubling, confirming what they’ve argued for years about the department’s inability to face climate hazards.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)Observe New Mexico Elections on Thursday released a report on its findings from the state’s 2024 election that mostly gave high marks after observing operations at a majority of voting sites during early voting and on election day.
Specifically, the nonprofit election transparency group dispatched 50 watchers to 91 sites in 24 counties during early voting, and had 160 election site watchers in 29 of New Mexico’s 33 counties on election day.
“This important, nonpartisan information-gathering effort — led by and for New Mexicans — found that elections went well, votes were counted, and problems were limited,” ONME co-leader Carmen Lopez said in a statement. “We are pleased to see that the findings reflect sufficient staffing levels, poll timeliness, proper functioning of tabulators and voter privacy. All of these things in conjunction made it possible to ensure every vote was counted and New Mexicans’ voices were heard this election cycle. The findings of our report — showing both successes and room for improvement — will allow us to make the voting process and poll worker training even stronger and more transparent in the years to come.”
Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver told Source New Mexico she had not seen the report yet, but had heard about its findings.
“That’s what we always shoot for,” she said when Source conveyed the report’s overall positive findings. “So, that’s good.”
The report did identify a handful of issues, such as same-day registration overwhelming the system, as Source reported last year.
The ONME report recommends  “the state ensures robust stress-testing of the bandwidth available to accommodate processing of same-day voter registrations and works closely with county clerks to increase the levels of staffing necessary to process same-day registrations in a timely manner.”
Toulouse Oliver said the state suffered server problems during the morning of the Nov. 5, 2025 general election, followed by a large volume of people participating in same-day registration. According to data provided at the time, 52,705 people used same-day voter registration in last year’s general election — and approximately half of them did so on election day.
County clerks had already fallen behind due to the server issues, Toulouse Oliver said, and the volume of people registering to vote overwhelmed them. “I’m not criticizing the clerks at all,” she added. “This is not their fault, but they did not have enough staff to process the amount of registrations that came in through the day and with the backup and everything it did get bogged down.”
For the next election, she said, the state will need to ensure the servers are robust enough and clerks will need to have adequate staffing, in so far as the budget allows. That being said, she does not anticipate a repeat of the same-day registration overwhelm from last year’s Election Day.
“I really feel like 2024 was an anomaly when it comes to same day registration,” she said, compared with years past. Moreover, starting this summer, the state will have automatic voter registration through the Motor Vehicle Division. “So I really feel like between just that election being an anomaly and AVR, and now that we know we need more resources on [same day registration], moving forward, just in case, I think it’s going to be much better.”
The ONME report also identified confusion by some presiding judges at polling places over the use of provisional ballots, which also were used in higher numbers last year, as well as seven locations that lacked sufficient provisional ballots. Toulouse Oliver said she had not heard previously of any locations running out of provisional ballots. She said given the challenges clerks were facing with same-day registration, her office was repeatedly advising the use of provisional ballots. “That’s what they are there for,” she noted. Legislation that would have provided additional training on issues like provisional ballots did not pass the Legislature, Toulouse Oliver said, but nonetheless, her office plans to keep reinforcing “the provisional process as the option for… if SDR is not working.”
ONME also recommended the state and county clerks, during early voting and on election day, use trained translators who are familiar with elections terminology after “watchers were unable to validate that written and oral translation services into Native languages were provided in all areas of the state covered as minority language jurisdictions under Section 203 of the federal Voting Rights Act.”
Toulouse Oliver told Source NM she thinks “we do a really good job of that in our Native communities, because that’s who we hire is people who can speak and interpret.” She said her interpretation of Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act is that clerks need to have people available, but not necessarily physically present, to provide other translation services as needed.
“And I have been under the assumption that every county that falls under that section is doing that, and apparently that’s not the case. Apparently we need to do a better job of that,” she said.
Toulouse Oliver said while her office already works with academic institutions, including the University of New Mexico, for analyses of elections, she’s happy to receive the additional outside observations.
“They make some really good points,” she said. “And…from our perspective of trying to make the argument to the Legislature,’we need this or we need that,’ it’s not just coming from me. It’s coming from other sources.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/elex3LR-2048x1356-1-1024x678.png,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

“You've got plenty of money. Stop the nonsense and start figuring it out and start rolling up your sleeves,” said Rep. Michael Soter in response to the Cannabis Control Commission’s ask for more money. 
The post Cannabis commission, elected leaders out of sync on budget ask appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AS MASSACHUSETTS LAWMAKERS work to craft a budget, facing an ever-shrinking pile of money coming from the federal government and rattled by economic uncertainty, the leaders of one of the state’s most troubled agencies – the Cannabis Control Commission – are saying that they cannot make crucial improvements without more money from the Legislature. But legislators, so far, aren’t buying it. According to Travis Ahern, the CCC’s new executive director, the agency needs more money to make key IT infrastructure updates that will fix some of the issues that the agency has come under fire for, like failing to collect $550,000 in licensing fees. The commission has asked the Legislature for over $30 million for Fiscal Year 2026, with $2 million allocated towards the IT upgrades.  Just a few months out from the often-stretched deadline to finalize the budget, the CCC’s ask looks unlikely to come through. Budget proposals from the governor, the House, and the Senate have all capped the commission’s budget at $19.88 million.  From his perch at the CCC, Ahern describes the roughly $9 million gap as a roadblock to needed upgrades. “The best way to optimize operations of this regulatory body is by investing in IT infrastructure,” he said. “We are looking to do the procurement to replace or enhance those systems, but as of right now, especially with [how] the FY26 budget looks, we don’t have the funding to do that. … When people ask [me] how can I reorganize or how can I create efficiencies within the organization, without the proper [IT] tools, it’s really difficult to say.” The implications if the agency doesn’t receive this funding go beyond IT infrastructure updates, said Ahern. A training initiative for people from disadvantaged backgrounds who want to participate in the cannabis industry is also at risk of being put on hold. The commission has previously said that a budget shortfall led to jobs going unfilled and mandated research and public awareness campaigns being put on hold.  Legislators are publicly frustrated with the agency, which has drawn unfavorable attention with allegations of harassment, slow regulatory rollouts, power struggles between commissioners following the suspension of the commission chair over allegations of racial insensitivity, and operational failures.  Inspector General Jeffrey Shapiro called the CCC a “rudderless ship” in June 2024. He urged the Legislature to put the agency under receivership and to reorganize the commission’s leadership structure. This March, he called on the agency to conduct an audit over the issue of uncollected fees and to make fixes to its IT systems. State Rep. Michael Soter of Bellingham, a Republican who is on the Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy, said that the commission needs to try hard to prove that it is functional before the Legislature allocates any more money to the agency, especially in a year when the state expects limited revenue growth.  “They need to evaluate what they’ve been doing, and I think they need to kind of look through where they need to make some efficiencies to get the money that they need to make things work,” Soter said of the CCC. “Throwing more money at a problem that no one has put a plan together to fix is not a great way to approach this.” State Sen. Michael Moore of Millbury, who has pushed for a bill that would establish an internal audit unit within the commission, said that the commission should look into spending their budget more efficiently to find the money for a new IT system.  “It’s very difficult when you have an agency that’s had the problems that the [CCC has] had to then come back and ask for additional money when you’ve seen money squandered,” said Moore. “We’ve seen money that was supposed to be brought in as revenue not brought in,” he said, referring to the uncollected licensing fees. “It would be very hard for anyone to give additional resources when they’ve had the managerial problems that they [have] had.” Soter said that other legislators didn’t seem particularly keen on increasing the CCC’s budget. When the budget proposal was presented to the House, he said, there was agreement on the commission’s line item. “They need to get their act together and earn the respect back to show us that they actually need this,” said Soter. “It’s an excuse to say we can’t do this because you’re not giving us more money. …You’ve got plenty of money. Stop the nonsense and start figuring it out and start rolling up your sleeves.” Ahern said that he is ready to roll up his sleeves and make the commission more efficient, but that a better IT infrastructure will give him more information to institute changes. It’s “impossible” to respond when people ask “Do you have enough people? Do you have too many people? Should you be shifting priorities within the organization?” said Ahern. “If we were able to more efficiently deal with all of the things that we rely on those IT platforms for, then that would change the way that I would approach managing the organization, administering our mission.” One of the chairs on the cannabis policy committee, Rep. Daniel Donahue of Worcester, affirmed his support for the budget as it stands and said that legislators are still considering making reforms at the embattled state agency. “The requested IT infrastructure improvements are better suited to the resources made available through IT bonds,” said Donahue in an emailed statement, referring to bond bills targeting IT upgrades. In December 2024, the commission’s Acting Chair Bruce Stebbins sent a letter to the chairs of the legislative cannabis policy committee, arguing that the both the commission’s responsibilities and inflation have increased year over year, but the agency’s budget has mostly remained flat at around $19 million. “Although the cannabis industry has experienced significant growth and tax revenues have steadily increased, the commission’s budget has not proportionally increased, limiting our ability to meet regulatory requirements and the needs of the industry,” Stebbins wrote.  Though Ahern said he is disappointed that the agency won’t have the extra money, he will try to find other sources of money and work with other state agencies like the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security to make IT upgrades.  He’d like to get the agency on track, as far from the scandal-plagued last year as possible. “I would love the CCC to get to a position where we’re a boring regulatory agency, and people don’t really think about us,” said Ahern when asked about what his goal for the commission is. “We don’t want to be in the news cycle unless it’s an interesting story on the cannabis industry. That’s where we want to be. We want to be a non-news story.” The post Cannabis commission, elected leaders out of sync on budget ask appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/470937768_2270163153363719_6060005292694954621_n.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

(Photo by: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)The Clark County teachers union is pushing legislation to speed up the arbitration process and allow teachers to petition district court to allow them to legally go on strike.
If the Legislature doesn’t pass the proposal — or if Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoes it — the union says it is prepared to make their case directly to Nevada voters through their “right to strike” initiative, which is already slated to appear on the 2026 General Election ballot.
Clark County Education Association, which represents the approximately 18,000 teachers and licensed professionals within the Clark County School District, is backing Senate Bill 161. The bill would establish an expedited arbitration process for teachers unions and school districts, which could kick in if a contract has not been reached 75 days before the start of a new school year.
More controversially, the bill would also establish a pathway for K-12 public school teachers to legally go on strike, something they are currently prohibited from doing.
The bill, which was given an exemption from standard legislative deadlines, received its first hearing Wednesday night in the Senate Committee on Government Affairs. The bill was immediately passed out of committee on a 5-2 vote and is headed to the full Senate for possible consideration.
State Sen. Rochelle Nuygen, the Las Vegas Democrat sponsoring the bill, told the committee that the threshold set in SB 161 to authorize a strike is high. Teachers would have to make the case that their proposed strike would be “equally or less detrimental” to students than remaining in schools that are failing them through existing policies or conditions.
The strike would also not apply to special education services, food services, mental health counseling, and after-school supervision.
Nguyen characterized it as a nuanced approach that meets the spirit of the state’s existing anti-strike law while addressing the established pattern of prolonged arbitration between the fifth largest school district in the country and its largest bargaining unit.
In contrast, the right-to-strike ballot initiative would be a “blunt instrument,” she argued. Nevada state law prohibits legislators from altering a law established through the initiative petition process for two regular sessions (so, four years) after it is approved by voters, so lawmakers couldn’t quickly alter it if issues arose.
“That’s the choice,” CCEA Executive Director John Vellardita told the Nevada Current in an interview. “The choice is: This is going to be on the ballot in ‘26. We have the resources to run a successful campaign. We’ve done field research. We have the support.”
Bradley Schrager, an attorney who represented the teacher’s union in numerous cases two years ago, pointed out in the bill hearing that CCSD and CCEA have reached a negotiation impasse and gone into arbitration four times in the past decade.
“There’s only five two-year cycles in a decade,” he added.
The pattern of prolonged arbitration means teachers are routinely beginning the academic year without new contracts in place, which can be demoralizing and lead to poor teacher retention, argued CCEA members who spoke in support of the bill.
That was the case in 2023, when the Legislature and Lombardo approved a K-12 education budget they routinely described as “historic” in its funding levels, only to see another impasse and months of public bickering between the district and union. That year, a contract agreement was reached in December, halfway through the school year.
That fall, a significant percentage of teachers at a handful of schools coordinated “sickouts,” leading to those schools closing for one day. The court ruled it strike activity, which put the union at risk of punishment.
SB 161 “forces cooperation at a very early time,” said Schrager, and evens the playing field between the union and district.
But not everyone agrees with that sentiment.
Tom Clark, a lobbyist representing the Nevada Association of School Boards and the Reno+Sparks Chamber of Commerce, suggested teachers strikes would wreak havoc on communities, make national news, and cause pain and suffering to families. Tens of thousands of children could be left without childcare, he added.
“That’s the leverage the strike gives to one side of the equation,” he said. “That imbalance does nothing for negotiations, does nothing for the benefits of students, the teachers, the families, the people in our community that rely on the vital public service that our teachers and our schools provide.”
The Nevada State Education Association, whose affiliate units include teachers in non-Clark counties and support staff in CCSD, is opposed to the bill on the grounds it would give teacher’s unions an unfair advantage over other bargaining groups. NSEA and CCEA have an antagonistic relationship with one another.
The Nevada Association of School Superintendents is also opposed, with lobbyist Mary Pierczynski arguing that states like Nevada have outlawed teacher strikes “for very good reason.”
“The emphasis tonight has been on Clark County and CCEA but there are 17 school districts in our state and they will all be impacted,” she added.
CCSD did not participate in the hearing and has not expressed a public position on the bill. When contacted by the Current for comment, the district’s media relations department stated it is tracking the bill.
“District staff work with legislators to monitor changes made to the language in bill drafts. CCSD provides public comment on bills as appropriate throughout the process as the legislation progresses,” continued the statement.
Nguyen in her presentation emphasized the bill is not a criticism of Jhone Ebert, CCSD’s new superintendent, who started last month. Nguyen said she and others working on the bill are “rooting for her success.”
This year’s legislative session is scheduled to end on June 2. That leaves SB 161 a little over three weeks to pass both chambers of the Legislature and make it to the governor’s desk.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190823_165829-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

Chris Hoene
Chris Hoene is the executive director of the California Budget & Policy Center, a nonpartisan research and analysis nonprofit.


As California leaders and advocates enter prime budget negotiations, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s revised proposal may soon provide clarity, revealing an expected shortfall and a lot of uncertainty driven by federal leaders. 
At the same time, Californians are facing real and growing needs, driven by rising housing costs, persistent inflation and new pressures like tariffs. 
We’re also still waiting to see what happens with the federal budget, as Congress and the president make it a priority to cut health care, food and other vital benefits, while spending billions on tax cuts for the rich. 
Newsom’s May revision must reflect the urgency that Californians are feeling. This is not the time to pit programs and people against each other. It is time for leaders to put people first and advance a vision for California that lies in stark contrast to that of federal leaders. 
For many Californians — especially those with low incomes — this is not a debate about politics or complex policy. It’s about whether they will continue to have access to housing, local hospitals, health care, child care, public transportation, food and other basic needs. 
Scaling back social supports during economic uncertainty only worsens inequality by making it harder for Californians to cover basic expenses and live with stability. Voters across the state see this as a serious and growing concern. 
In this environment, California must lead. State leaders can do this by boosting revenue streams and making the tax system more fair. 
California has often led the nation in bold policymaking. But in this moment, other states are stepping up to protect their residents.
In Minnesota, for instance, House members introduced the Protect Medicaid, Not Millionaires Act, which would raise new state revenue through a tax on millionaires, allowing the state to offset lost federal Medicaid funding if cuts are enacted. This would make taxes more fair for millionaires, who stand to reap huge benefits under the federal budget proposal, while preventing state residents from losing vital health care. 
In New Mexico, a bipartisan group of state senators has earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars in a Medicaid trust fund to support the state’s recipients if Congressional Republicans are successful at slashing health care benefits for millions of Americans. 
And in Washington state, the legislature approved an $8.7 billion revenue package to help balance the budget and prevent deep cuts to services amid federal uncertainty. The measures raise taxes on high earners and large businesses through increases to the capital gains tax, estate tax and business taxes, while expanding the sales tax to new services and eliminating certain tax breaks.
These approaches may not be tailor-made for California, but they offer compelling examples of courageous state action. 
Newsom and state legislative leaders should take steps through this year’s budget to protect California’s most vulnerable against mounting federal threats. That begins with aligning tax and budget policy with our values. 
California gives away billions annually through tax breaks that primarily benefit corporations and high-income households. Closing these loopholes is not only fair — it’s fiscally responsible. 
The coming weeks and months will test state leaders. Will they protect the programs that keep families afloat or preserve tax breaks for the wealthy? Will they advance fairness or deepen inequality? Will they defend Californians against federal threats or enable the harm? 
As Congress prioritizes unnecessary new tax cuts for the wealthy, California must ensure it has the resources needed to take care of its people.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/040725_Capitol-Assembly_MG_CM_35.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719
,California,2025-05-09 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Floods exposed weaknesses in California prisons’ emergency plans. They still aren’t ready,Cayla Mihalovich,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/05/prisons-natural-disasters/,"Earthquakes, wildfires and floods all could cause problems for California prisons. A new audit says they aren't ready to quickly evacuate prisoners.","In summary
Earthquakes, wildfires and floods all could cause problems for California prisons. A new audit says they aren’t ready to quickly evacuate prisoners.


In 2023, amid record-breaking rain and snow, two prisons in the southern San Joaquin Valley faced a serious risk of flooding. But neither prison, California State Prison, Corcoran or the Substance Abuse Treatment Facility, had a robust evacuation plan on hand and ready for the looming disaster.  
Instead, the prisons developed a joint plan to transfer roughly 8,000 incarcerated people to other state prisons within 11 to 14 days — or longer. Wheelchair-bound individuals, the plan stated, would take six days to evacuate. And department buses intended to shuttle people to safety could take up to a day to arrive.
The floods that year ultimately did not reach the prisons, but the threat they posed illustrated how California’s 90,000-prisoner corrections system has failed to prepare for natural disasters. That’s according to a report issued last week by an independent agency that oversees the department’s disciplinary process and internal investigations. 
“While California’s prisons are vulnerable to wildfires, floods, and earthquakes, we found they are not adequately prepared to respond to emergencies posed by natural disasters,” stated the report by the Office of Inspector General, which reviewed emergency plans for 30 state prisons after fielding concerns about the department’s disaster response. 
The report detailed deep fractures in the department’s emergency preparedness, including issues of transportation, varied risk assessment methodologies, lacking mutual aid agreements, timely evacuations, and prison overcrowding. As of December, California’s prison system was operating at roughly 120% – or 16,000 people – over its designed capacity, according to the report. 
“Not only are some prisons overcrowded, but the department is unable to evacuate the incarcerated population and staff at most prisons within the first critical 72 hours of an emergency,” the report noted. “Without the ability to quickly evacuate prisons, it is likely that wildfires, floods, and earthquakes will result in loss of life within the incarcerated population.”
Notably, the inspector general found that none of the prisons included a plan to evacuate incarcerated people outside their gates, but rather focused on moving “the incarcerated population to and from locations within the prison.” 
The report concluded with a list of 18 recommendations, including ones that would bring the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation into compliance with California regulations around emergency planning. 
Carlee Purdum, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Houston who researches how disasters impact incarcerated people, said the report is a “first step” in identifying more resources to support prisons and corrections agencies as they plan and prepare.
“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” Purdum said. “Prisons and corrections agencies are very marginalized and isolated in the emergency and disaster planning space. The significant takeaway should be that we have not engaged in these kinds of discussions, and put forth the kind of state level resources and accountability into these institutions.” 
Advocates for years have been sounding the alarm over the ways in which California prisons are ill-equipped to confront climate hazards due to issues such as overcrowding and aging infrastructure. A 2023 report by the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs and the nonprofit organization Ella Baker Center for Human Rights chronicled those concerns and urged the state to implement safeguards. 
“People inside have a fear that the actual plan is to abandon them in the case of an emergency. It is deeply troubling,” said James King, director of programs for the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. “In these public health crises, it’s not just going to affect the people in the prisons, either incarcerated there or working there. It’s going to impact the entire county, the entire community.”

Those concerns were echoed by Dax Proctor, statewide coordinator for Californians United for a Responsible Budget, a statewide coalition of organizations that view climate hazards as a key reason to close prisons.
“The number one solution to address these issues at hand is to reduce the number of people locked up in California prisons as rapidly as possible,” Proctor said. “A good starting place would be those most vulnerable to climate hazards.”
Officials from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services answered questions about the report before lawmakers at a hearing Thursday. They assured lawmakers that the department would not work alone in a large-scale emergency.
“California has a vast amount of resources and we would rely heavily on our federal, state and local partners to assist us with the evacuation of an entire prison,” said Melissa Prill, special agent-in-charge at the corrections department’s Office of Correctional Safety.

But Sen. Laura Richardson, a Democrat from Inglewood, said that in an unpredictable situation, those partners “may be busy assisting other people.”
“To assume that these other agencies are going to be available to help you, or to help us in a prison environment is not something, going forward, we have the freedom to assume,” Richardson said. “I would give this (office of inspector general)’s report of your organization — I would consider it an ‘F’ — frankly.”
Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Republican from Murrieta, said he wasn’t “extremely critically concerned.”
“I think we’re getting a little overboard in terms of thinking that we are going to have to evacuate entire prisons,” Seyarto said. “It’s just not a practical thing to think that somehow the whole prison is going to catch on fire.”
In a statement to CalMatters, department spokesperson Mary Xjimenez said prisons take an “all-hazards” approach to emergency planning and that it coordinates its plans with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. The department “follows the FEMA National Incident Management System, which is the national doctrine that provides all federal, state, and local response agencies with a consistent set of principles, management structures, and a systematic approach to emergency response.”
King said the department has a history of being unprepared for climate hazards and instead reacts to them once they inevitably occur. 
“These are simply facts,” King said. The department “could accept these facts and do something about them — or they could try to manage their response to the report. Disappointedly, it seems like they’ve chosen the latter. This is an opportunity to improve their response, to see the gaps and to create plans that address the gaps. ”

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Freddy Lazo left a restaurant job for a higher paying one in trucking about two-and-a-half years ago. But the way President Trump’s trade war is going, he’s thinking he might have to go back to waiting tables soon.
“It’s really super slow,” Lazo said, looking across the mostly empty trucking yard of shipping company Big Blue Box in New Brighton.
A slump in work is to be expected in this industry every once in a while, although in normal times, it’s usually brief and quickly followed by a boom in business. Looking out at the horizon though, harder times may lie ahead.
Since “Liberation Day” on April 2, when Trump announced tariffs on the whole world, many retailers have suspended orders of patio furniture, Barbie dolls, candles and everything else that arrives on rail from coastal ports in giant shipping containers, which Lazo trucks to final destinations across the Midwest. Although Trump paused the so-called reciprocal tariffs, the 145% tax on Chinese imports and a 10% tax on imports from most other countries remain, along with deep uncertainty.
Lazo is an independent contractor, which means if he’s not driving, he’s not getting paid. It also means he’s not eligible for unemployment benefits to ease the pain of lost earnings. Fortunately, he’s already paid off his older rig and has been able to tap into his savings. Still, a protracted slowdown would mean he or his wife will need to get another job to support their five kids.
“If this continues… I definitely have to find a different way to make money,” Lazo said.
Big Blue Box Vice President Ted Longbella said they aim to move about 120 containers a day — big blue shipping containers, as the name suggests. Toys, windows and games come in. Scrap metal, grain and dairy powder go out.
He’s been keeping a close eye on the number of blank sailings, when an ocean shipping company cancels a planned trip, because it tells him what demand will be like in the near future.
He’s like a taxi driver staring up at the airport sign listing arrivals and watching one flight after another canceled. There are passengers that still need rides home now, but pretty soon the airport will be empty.

There are more than 56,000 semi-truck drivers and another 18,000 light truck drivers in Minnesota, according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development, meaning widespread layoffs and reductions in income could ripple throughout the greater economy.
Ocean carriers in the Pacific have been canceling trips at a faster rate than during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to freight forwarder Flexport. The company reports more than 25% of weekly transpacific service-loops were canceled in late April and early May compared to 24% in the same time period in 2020.
Cargo at the massive Port of Los Angeles, which handled nearly 20 million containers in 2024, is down 35% in early May from the same time last year.
To prepare for the coming dip, Longbella said he’s put on his salesman hat to find new business to keep his 140 employees and independent contractors busy — and keep them from leaving to work for competitors.
He said truckers in Minnesota will really feel the effects of the tariffs around June, when the surge of goods that were panic-ordered before Liberation Day turns into a trickle.
That lines up with a timeline of turmoil from Apollo Global Management, which predicts empty shelves by the end of May and layoffs in trucking and retail in early June. A recession could follow shortly after that.
The situation could be worse had companies not diversified their suppliers after the COVID-19 pandemic to be less reliant on China. Many companies have been able to switch to suppliers from other countries and are now loading up on goods before the pause on reciprocal tariffs lifts on July 9.
Yet it’s not just imports that are suffering.
“We’re usually doing a lot of soybean pickups throughout the whole year, and those have slowed since the tariff uncertainty,” Longbella said.
Trump administration officials are scheduled to meet with Chinese representatives this weekend in Switzerland, which could help lead to a deal that reduces the tariffs on China that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described as effectively an embargo. Even if Trump lays down arms in the trade war soon — an unlikely, best case scenario — the trucking and retail industries will still feel aftershocks.
“On the other side, demand is going to be nuts,” Longbella said.
That will give shipping companies power to raise prices like they did during the pandemic. The challenge for truckers is to make it to the other side.
“Trucking companies have to pay their bills in one or two weeks,” Longbella said. “A lot of companies will have gone out of business, unfortunately, because a lot of trucking companies are hand-to-mouth.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5876-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

We are heartened by the can-do spirit seen in the response to these cuts. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Wendy Nunez and John Kingston: Despite Americorps cuts, service is alive and well in Vermont.","This commentary is by Wendy Nunez and John Kingston, chair and co-chair of the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps board of directors.As many of you know, on April 25, AmeriCorps programs across the country were informed that over 1,000 grants — totaling $400 million — had been terminated. This news hits home for many Vermonters.For those unfamiliar with this program, it’s helpful to think of AmeriCorps as a domestic Peace Corps, where volunteers commit to service terms that range from a couple of months to a full year. AmeriCorps provides federal funding to local nonprofits, which, in turn, provide members with a “living allowance.” At the end of one’s service term, members also receive a Segal Education Award which can be used for tuition and paying off school debt.AmeriCorps not only empowers people wanting to serve, but also offers us a model that combines service, workforce development and project accomplishment. AmeriCorps is a win-win-win.Nationally, more than 200,000 people serve through AmeriCorps positions. Here in Vermont, SerVermont is our state service commission and helps oversee grants that support approximately 2,500 service members. Participants focus on pressing issues that range from conservation work, to food security, to flood relief, to work in local schools.For young professionals, their service is a chance to make a lasting difference just as it is a powerful learning and professional development opportunity. In fact, Jobs for the Future recently reported that 92% of AmeriCorps programs had strong career and workforce development training embedded in their curriculum.Imagine being a young person fresh out of high school with an array of opportunities ahead of you. As you look at the world, you’re determined to roll up your sleeves and contribute. Your commitment to making the world a better place is the spirit that is at the center of service. This brings us to the painful decision to cut funding.READ MORE
More than $2.3 million dollars of grants allocated to programs here in Vermont were terminated suddenly in April. We have to move forward with the expectation that these funds will not return in future years.As readers saw in a recent Seven Days article, these funds impact the programs of essential Vermont nonprofits and state government, including ReSOURCE, the Department of Environmental Conservation, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, Vermont State University, and the organization whose board we chair, the Vermont Youth Conservation Corps.All is not lost however. We are heartened by the can-do spirit seen in the response to these cuts. Vermont Youth Conservation Corps is finding ways to continue to offer service experiences to every incoming participant. They won’t be AmeriCorps members, but they will still have a position at Vermont Youth Conservation Corps and an opportunity to serve their community. We also see other organizations being nimble in their response. History is instructive. People are probably aware of the Civilian Conservation Corps, launched during the Great Depression by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which enrolled 3 million men in public service. Different versions of federal service programs existed until the early ‘80s. President Ronald Reagan then eliminated these programs during an era of limited federal government.In response, many states then created city-based, state and regional corps. Today, more than 150 corps exist in America. We likely find ourselves in a similar moment of reinvention and revitalization. Service is alive and well in Vermont — and across the country. The elimination of AmeriCorps funding should be a call to action for us all. Now is the time to invest in young people, and increasing the value and accessibility to service experiences can be a strategy that makes Vermont stronger.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Wendy Nunez and John Kingston: Despite Americorps cuts, service is alive and well in Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719

According to the White House, the Department of the Interior’s budget provides about $1.2 billion to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project. Of that, the White House is proposing a $609 million cut. 
Described as the “most comprehensive federal water resource development project” in the state, the Central Utah Project is a web of reservoirs, pipelines and river systems that transports Colorado River water from eastern Utah to the Wasatch Front, where it’s tasked for municipal and industrial use, irrigation, hydroelectric power, fish and wildlife, conservation and recreation. 
But reservoirs and pipelines disrupt wildlife and vegetation, and sometimes come at the expense of hunting, fishing and other types of recreation — so a portion of the funding for the project has been used to offset those impacts. Now, the Trump administration wants the project to solely focus on water infrastructure.

According to the budget proposal, the money allocated to the project funds programs that “have nothing to do with building and maintaining water infrastructure, such as habitat restoration.” 
“Instead, the Budget focuses Reclamation and the Central Utah Project on their core missions of maintaining assets that provide safe, reliable, and efficient management of water resources throughout the western United States,” the proposal reads. 
The request doesn’t specify any habitat restoration project in particular, and it’s likely the request would also impact other bureau projects in the West. 
In Utah, that funding helped restore wetlands and riparian areas along the Provo and Duchesne rivers, improve recreation access for hunters, anglers and boaters, and have contributed to the resurgence of the June Sucker, a fish native to Utah Lake that was once near extinction. 
“It’s tough to say at this point how that all trickles down to Utah and to our project, but we’re making plans and adjustments,” said Michael Mills, executive director of the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission. “It’s a difficult spot we’re in, we don’t really have any more details than what is included in that budget proposal.”
Mills’ commission was formed in the 1990s after Congress passed the Central Utah Project Completion Act. The commission works to offset the environmental impact of large water infrastructure projects — for instance, when the Jordanelle Reservoir was created in 1993, the commission worked to restore a lower section of the Provo River to make up for the section that was flooded, and conserved land in Wasatch County for elk herds that were displaced. 
Since its inception, the commission has worked with federal, state and local governments, universities, nonprofits and the Ute tribe on a number of ecosystem and wildlife conservation projects. 
One of the most recent is the Provo River Delta Restoration and the June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program on Utah Lake.

The June Sucker was nearly extinct in the 1980s — if it didn’t have a lifespan of nearly 40 years, some ecologists say the species would have disappeared. But a few hundred held on, and as the species was listed as endangered, the June Sucker Recovery Implementation Program took shape. 
Farmers and water users in the basin worked to conserve water to increase Provo River flows, and a collaborative effort to restore the river’s delta in Provo began. The delta has undergone a complete transformation — now there’s a boat ramp, hiking trails and a thriving ecosystem. On any given day, you can find scores of birds, fish and other wildlife at the delta, including the June Sucker. This year, scientists estimated the fish’s population to be 80,000. 
All of that was made possible by the federal revenue stream now on the chopping block.

“A lot of people think the federal government is all about overreach and regulation. But what we see with the June Sucker program is that federal coordination brought resources, it brought a lot of funding, and it gave a mechanism for different stakeholders to be heard,” said Ben Abbott, associate professor of environmental science and sustainability at Brigham Young University. 
“Yes, it was about this endemic fish that only lives on Utah Lake, but it ended up improving water quality and creating better public access and having a lot of unexpected benefits,” he said. 
The proposed budget cut makes Abbot and others nervous that projects like the June Sucker restoration won’t be possible in the future. The Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission is currently working on a restoration project on the Duchesne River in eastern Utah that, if federal funding is pulled, could be impacted. 
Plus, operation and maintenance for completed projects could suffer. Federal funding pays for snow and garbage removal, bathroom maintenance, fencing, general upkeep and ongoing conservation. 
“Obviously, I think the work we do is very important, and I enjoy doing it. But if our elected officials are saying there’s other priorities out there, we pivot to try to accommodate those priorities,” Mills said.

The president’s budget recommendations are just that — recommendations. Congress has the final say when it comes to federal spending, and experts say that many of Trump’s proposed cuts won’t get a green light. 
But it provides insight into the Trump administration’s priorities. Since taking office, the administration, in partnership with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has cut budgets for federal agencies and laid off federal workers in an attempt to streamline the government and cut waste. 
The budget proposal reflects that same sentiment, with a proposed $163 billion in cuts to non-defense discretionary spending. That includes more than $15 billion in funds allocated under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act; $1.3 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to study climate change; nearly $1 billion for the National Park Service to operate the park system, build new infrastructure, preserve historic sites, and offer preservation and recreation grants; and $721 million slated for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development Program.

(Capital-Star photo by John Cole)Sen. Dave McCormick said he’s introduced a second bill aimed at addressing the cost of housing with Arizona Democrat Ruben Gallego.
In a press release, the swing state senators said the bill is meant to increase cooperation across U.S. government agencies with programs and research on affordable housing. It directs the Departments of Agriculture, Urban Development and Veterans Assistance to create a data-sharing agreement for housing-related research and information, and to report to Congress on how they can increase collaboration on housing programs.
“Homeownership is out of reach for far too many families in Pennsylvania, including our nation’s veterans,” McCormick said in a press release. “We need federal agencies to work together more effectively to increase the limited supply of housing and reduce housing costs.”
This follows another bill aimed at boosting the development of multifamily homes, which Gallego introduced and McCormick co-sponsored in late April. That bill would increase the limit on loans from the Federal Housing Administration for developers of multifamily homes with up to four units.
The loan limits, which Gallego said in a press release had not been raised since 2003, were put in place to prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development from subsidizing luxury projects.
McCormick and Gallego were also co-sponsors of a bill introduced by Alex Padilla (D-Ca.) that is intended to help homeless veterans by excluding veterans’ disability payments from counting towards annual income qualifications for a joint HUD and VA housing program.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mccormick1-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector) The Alabama Public Library Service board Thursday adopted a definition of  the term “sexually explicit” after advocates and local library officials throughout the state said that the term — the center of controversies over book content around the state — was vague and hard to comply with.
The new definition is taken from the state’s criminal code defining adult bookstores and adult movie houses. It includes material containing sexual intercourse between people of the same gender or opposite gender, sexual excitement and nudity.
“I think that is an easy thing for us to figure out,” said APLS Chair John Wahl, who introduced the motion on Thursday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The move follows the board’s move in May of last year requiring libraries to restrict library materials from the minors or risk forfeiting state funding.
To qualify for state aid, libraries must adopt policies for selecting library materials that prohibit minors from having materials that are sexually explicit or inappropriate for children, specify the physical location of books and materials deemed sexually explicit or inappropriate materials for children, and obtain advance approval for materials that are marketed or promoted to children.
Libraries must also establish policies that “approve written guidelines that ensure library sections designated for minors under the age of 18 remain free of material containing obscenity, sexually explicit, or other material deemed inappropriate for children or youth,”
Wahls’ motion comes amid continued unrest at the state board that oversees local library funding. In March, members of the APLS voted to suspend funding to the Fairhope Public Library after several patrons complained  that books that allegedly violated the APLS administrative code have yet to be moved to the adult section.
In that same meeting, because of another motion from Minton, APLS terminated Nancy Pack, the former director who led the agency since 2012.
The Fairhope Library has yet to have its funding restored. Supporters have started a fundraiser to help offset some of the funding that could be lost by the library.
Wahl said he had “cordial communication” with Fairhope Public Library Director Robert Gourlay and chair of the Fairhope Public Library, Randal Wright.
“They are still in their review process,” he said. “The APLS board is waiting until they finish their review process.”
Both Gourlay and Wright attended the meeting to address the APLS board during the public comment period.
“We have gotten a lot of reconsideration forms submitted since the beginning of 2023, and we have about 20,000 plus cardholders in Fairhope. Six or seven individuals are responsible for those requests for reconsideration,” Gourlay said.
He said staff have taken the requests seriously and have moved six books from the juvenile and teen section to the adult section.
Wright said that the Fairhope Public Library is not attempting to defy the updated APLS administrative code and recommended that the state agency establish a procedure for libraries to follow who may not be complying and give libraries an opportunity to respond before threatening funding.
“I have witnessed the standards of the majority of the citizens of Fairhope who have spoken out in support of our library,” Wright said. “And I believe we are adhering to the APLS guidelines while also listening to the community standards of Fairhope.”
Fights over book content began erupting in 2023 when a parent complained that the Autauga-Prattville Public Library had a book with inclusive pronouns.
The issue went all the way up to Gov. Kay Ivey, who pushed the board to adopt administrative code changes. Critics said the campaign was about removing books with LGBTQ characters.
The fight continued at Thursday’s meeting.
“Let me be blunt,” said Craig Scott, director of the Gadsden Public Library. “Libraries are not political playgrounds. They are not here to serve an agenda. They are here to serve people, all people. And yes, sometimes providing materials that have been challenged, discomfort, or even provoke thought.”
Wahl said he found Scott’s comments offensive.
“I personally, went to the state Legislature, and found guaranteed funding, so that local libraries would not have to risk losing federal grants,” Wahl said. “There was not a single thank you there. To say that this board does not stand up for local libraries, and does not fight for them, is offensive.”
Board member Amy Minton, who moved to revoke Fairhope’s funding last month, put forward a draft of a motion for the APLS Board to consider at the next meeting that invoked Alabama’s “What is a Woman Act” and the executive order from President Donald Trump that affirmed only two genders.
“In alignment with these clear positions of both state and federal government, it is the opinion of the APLS Board that any library material that encourages, promotes or contains positive portrayals of transgender procedures, gender ideology, or the concept of more than two genders shall be deemed inappropriate for children and youth under APLS Code,” Minton’s proposed motion states.

,California,2025-05-09 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Two Emmy nominations for CalMatters’ Digital Democracy and CBS-TV,Sonya Quick,,,,,https://calmatters.org/inside-the-newsroom/2025/05/emmy-nominations-digital-democracy/,"This is CalMatters’ third year in a row of Emmy nominations, with two award wins.","In summary
This is CalMatters’ third year in a row of Emmy nominations, with two award wins.


CalMatters’ collaborations with CBS-TV are again nominated for Emmy awards, following two previous Emmy wins, and bringing nominations three years in a row.
Both awards, given by the Northern California chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, are for work produced in partnership with CBS News and using deep reporting from CalMatters’ Digital Democracy, a tool that uses data and artificial intelligence to examine state government. This comes just a week after Digital Democracy was awarded the Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation in the national Poynter Journalism Prizes.
“Using new AI, grieving moms discover California lawmakers killed popular fentanyl bill by *not* ​voting” pairs CalMatters’ state government analysis with video reporting by Julie Watts of CBS News. The entry is nominated for politics and government news coverage and recognizes Watts and producer Dennis Lopez along with CalMatters’ reporters Sameea Kamal and Ryan Sabalow. Foaad Khosmood, a computer science professor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and an architect of Digital Democracy, was also recognized.
The video tells the story of how advocates for fentanyl legislation were upset to learn through Digital Democracy that their bills died when legislators declined to vote. The broadcast followed a CalMatters’ story, “Power is never having to say ‘no.’ How California Democrats kill bills without voting against them” co-authored by Watts and CalMatters reporter Ryan Sabalow. The story used data from Digital Democracy to show that instead of directly voting against a bill, Democrats often killed bills by declining to vote.
And “Why some California Democrats take Big Oil money and vote against environmental laws” pairs CBS’ news analysis, powered by Digital Democracy, this time for a nomination for politics and government short-form content. The segment reveals “that California Republicans in Congress voted against most (92%) environmental bills in the last session, even though surveys show that most of the people they represent think lawmakers should do more to prevent climate change.”
The nomination recognizes CBS’ Watts along with Grace Manthey, Kurtis Ming, Jui Sarwate and Dennis Lopez – again with Khosmood.
Emmy winners will be announced June 14 in Sacramento.
CalMatters’ first Emmy win two years ago was for Watts featuring CalMatters reporter Julie Cart’s coverage of the devastating effects of endless wildfires on the mental health of California’s firefighters. And the second Emmy award last year was for CalMatters criminal justice reporter Nigel Duara and Julie Watts for their segment on how California investigates shootings by law enforcement officers of unarmed civilians.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/040324-DD-Dave-Lesher-FG-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

Burl Toler was born in Memphis. The first Black official in any major sport in the U.S., he defeated prejudice at each turn. 
In 1951, Toler starred for the legendary undefeated University of San Francisco Dons. Prejudice kept the integrated team from playing in the Gator Bowl, but the team found success anyway. Nine players went to the NFL, three of them later inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame. Their best player may have been Toler, who was drafted by Cleveland but suffered a severe knee injury in a college all-star game that ended his playing days. 
Toler decided to make his way into professional football through officiating. The NFL hired him in 1965 — a year before Emmett Ashford became the first Black umpire in Major League Baseball and three years before Jackie White broke the color barrier in the NBA. 
He rose above the racism he encountered, working as a head linesman and field judge for a quarter-century. He officiated Super Bowl XIV, where the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Los Angeles Rams in 1980. Two years later, he officiated the “Freezer Bowl,” where the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the San Diego Chargers in the AFC Championship Game. The game marked the coldest temperatures of any game in NFL history — minus 59 degrees wind chill — and Toler suffered frostbite. 
In addition to his NFL work, he worked as an educator, becoming the first Black secondary school principal in the San Francisco district. He died in 2009. Two area schools and a hall on the University of San Francisco campus have been renamed in his honor. On Nov. 23, 2020, Toler was remembered again when the NFL had its first all-Black officiating crew.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06120242/May9-ALL-BLACK-OFFICIATING-CREW.jpg,,,2025-05-09 09:02:53.829719
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-09 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT agency aims to build housing in downtowns, near public transit",Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/09/ct-municipal-development-authority/,"The Municipal Development Authority, which started work last year, helps towns build up their downtowns and areas near public transit.","The Naugatuck train station is a small plexiglass box with a single bench, a lone dot in the expanse of the concrete parking lot, just across from the loading dock of a post office.
It’s exactly the type of car-centric development that David Kooris, executive director of the Connecticut Municipal Development Authority, wants to avoid. A construction site just south of the station will soon be the home of a larger train station and a mixed-use apartment complex with homes on top and businesses on the bottom floor.
“We want vibrancy,” said Mayor Pete Hess, on a recent walking tour of the site. “We want people walking, eating, drinking, shopping using the train.”
It’s paired with a project to improve walkability in the nearby downtown, where workers were putting in new brick sidewalks late last month. It’s an expensive project, and the town will need improved infrastructure, Hess said. Just when he was worrying over the small town being unable to afford the cost, “out of nowhere, an angel came from above, and it was CMDA.”
The Connecticut Municipal Development Authority, formerly called the Municipal Redevelopment Authority, was established in 2019 as an unfunded entity and officially got money and started work last year. Since then, at least 11 cities have passed ordinances agreeing to work with the quasi-public agency. Another 10 are in the process, Kooris said.
[RELATED: CT agency aimed at increasing housing convenes, picks director]
He’s hoping more towns along Metro-North will join in the coming months, and for those that have started, he’s aiming to have projects in the works later this year, he said.
The authority is statutorily charged with helping municipalities build up their downtowns and districts near public transportation. In addition to helping with the planning process, the agency has $60 million in bonding that towns can apply for to help spur development.
​​”The way that I describe it is: we’re trying to help give communities the tools they need to be the next best version of themselves,” Kooris said. “That means taking what’s there and tweaking it to provide more housing, more support for local businesses, more riders for transit.”
CMDA is governed by a board of directors, and chair Felix Reyes said they’re focused on supporting Kooris. Reyes, the director of economic development and planning in New London, said he’s encouraged his city to work with CMDA.
“We see New London’s downtown is changing fundamentally, because now it’s becoming not just a center of commerce or a center of business, but it’s also becoming a neighborhood, because a lot of our historic buildings are being revitalized to include housing on the second floors and above,” Reyes said.
To work with the agency, town councils need to adopt a resolution to enter a partnership with CMDA. They then decide what area of town they want to work in, whether that be downtown or a public transit station.
CMDA works with contractors to help evaluate the town’s zoning and where they can “substantially increase” housing supply, Kooris said. The town also then becomes eligible to apply for CMDA funding.
Kooris is waiting for the next biennial budget to pass to determine the details of his next steps. Gov. Ned Lamont’s proposed budget included $1.2 million for the authority, while the legislature’s proposal included $700,000. How much money he gets will determine how many staffers he can hire for the agency, Kooris said.
As CMDA grows, Kooris hopes to find ways to connect towns to more state funding and, eventually, cut through red tape around development projects. He hopes that towns that participate can work their way through environmental approvals and other state permitting more quickly, he said.
The CMDA has been a priority for Lamont, who touted his support during the past couple of legislative sessions. He’s proposed it as a way to increase the state’s housing supply and boost the economy.
Connecticut lacks tens of thousands of units of housing that are affordable and available to its lowest income residents, and people across economic classes are struggling to pay housing costs. This has posed difficulties for employers, who need places for workers to live.
Lamont has spoken often about the need for more housing for the workforce and painted CMDA as the agency to resolve the issue without statewide control of zoning. He’s supported local control of zoning issues.
The agency is centered around a land use concept known as transit-oriented development, which encourages walkable neighborhoods with easy access to public transportation. It’s a growing movement across the United States and has been particularly popular among land use and urban design advocates.
The idea has been controversial in the Connecticut legislature. For the past few legislative sessions, lawmakers have considered another proposal to encourage more transit-oriented development known as Work, Live, Ride. This year’s version of the bill would prioritize certain infrastructure funding for towns that opt to establish denser districts near train and bus stations.
Opponents have said that it would usurp local control and mean that those towns that don’t opt in may struggle to get funding that they need for bridges and roads. 
In 2023, opponents submitted testimony on the bill to provide funding to the CMDA expressing fear that the authority would require too much density and require substantial changes to towns.
But Kooris sees CMDA as a way for towns to get creative.
“We would help kind of focus everyone in on this limited geography and say, ‘OK, what are we all trying to get out of this development? What do we all think is needed to unlock the potential of this place?,’” Kooris said.
That can mean allowing for more infill development of three- and four-family units, more accessory dwelling units or mixed-use development like what’s underway in Naugatuck. Often, Kooris is focused on what may seem to be smaller details such as how many drive-throughs are allowed in the area, the amount of parking or making sure the town has pedestrian-friendly infrastructure such as raised crosswalks.
Michelle McCabe, executive director of Connecticut Main Street Center, said the creation of CMDA is a good sign for Connecticut downtowns. 
“Village centers are complex ecosystems that have a lot of different stakeholders trying to succeed in them, whether it’s your small businesses, your arts and culture, the residents who live there, the way that the streets are designed for mobility, for traffic, it all comes together,” McCabe said.
Kevin Brown, executive director of the Norwich Community Development Corporation, said the work with CMDA will help the economy in his town. It has several blighted buildings and former mills, and he wants to see those revitalized, particularly downtown and along the water.
“When you talk about sort of the anchor point for this and transit-oriented development, we are already upping the ante on our economic development and our residential downtown living near our intermodal transportation center,” Brown said, of the transportation hub at the mouth of the Yantic River. “And so this just really is, you know, to use an analogy, throwing gas on the fire for the forward momentum of the city of Norwich.”
Much of Kooris’ inspiration comes from historical Connecticut, he said, when towns had thriving main streets and a variety of businesses within walking distance. Often, he thinks about historical images and maps of towns from the 1920s, 30s and 40s.
“We were introducing the car, but we weren’t yet governed by it,”  he said. “So you accommodated the car, and you started to have parkways and stuff like that, but they were used to connect these walkable, transit-oriented communities to one another.”
He believes in the concept of “environmental determinism,” which means that the way people behave is largely determined by their environment. So, there are ways to encourage people to drive less and interact with their neighbors more, just through urban design, he said.
“We create the context within which we can then perform,” he said. “If you build all your community around wide roads and car dependency, then you’re going to drive everywhere. If you build your community to be walkable and mixed use, then you might walk a good chunk of the time.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0423_SR_DavidKooris_021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

(Getty Images)A group of LGBTQ+ baristas is working to unionize a Starbucks in Huntsville for what they hope will help create a more fair and equitable workplace for everyone.
If successful, the store on Memorial Parkway would be the third organized Starbucks outlet in Alabama, after stores in Scottsboro and Birmingham. The organizing team wants to join Starbucks Workers United (SBWU), the union that represents over 570 union Starbucks stores, out of about 15,000 outlets in total.
Questions at the Huntsville Starbucks were directed to a corporate media line. Messages sent by phone and email seeking comment were left with Starbucks.
Huntsville union organizing team members Briar Wolf and Nox Ashes were initially drawn to Starbucks because of its long-standing reputation as an inclusive and supportive workplace, especially for LGBTQ+ employees.
“Starbucks is the place where queer people land and where trans people land because they’ve had a reputation for a long time as being a friendly place to work,” she said. “You know, there’s the joke about the whole blue hair, they/them baristas making the best coffee and all that. Starbucks had presented themselves as this, this paragon of acceptance for queer and trans people to be able to work there.”
Wolf was also attracted by the company’s benefits, including tuition reimbursement for a first-time bachelor’s degree through Arizona State University and the company’s health insurance plan. In 2018, Starbucks introduced a supplemental insurance plan that covered gender-affirming procedures like electrolysis, facial feminization, and other related health care, many with no co-pays or deductibles. The company provides travel reimbursements for gender-affirming care.
But now, she said, that support has been slowly eroded. Fast Company reported in 2022 that many of the procedures covered by the supplemental plan were moved to a primary plan, which can include co-pays and in-network and out-of-network doctors.
“For one of the surgeries that I plan to have, to get a doctor that is even on WPATH’s (World Professional Association for Transgender Health) recommended list, I’m going to have to go to San Francisco,” she said. “They used to pay for travel, but now they only pay for a certain amount of travel, and only if it’s approved, and only if there’s not an in-network doctor within driving range. They’ve chipped away at little bits and pieces of it.”
Starbucks said its benefits package has not changed. In a letter to the union sent in 2023, May Jensen, a Starbucks vice president, wrote that individual state policies led to shifts in coverage.
“Whether specific same-sex and gender affirming care, services, and procedures are covered as part of the Company’s core health insurance plan or its additional wrap plan depends upon the state law applicable to the Company’s plans and, more specifically, whether the care, services, and procedures are required to be part of Starbucks core health insurance plan offerings,” the letter said.
SBWU bargaining delegate and Birmingham barista Naomi Wilson, whose Starbucks store is unionized, is part of the team drafting and negotiating SBWU’s first collective bargaining agreement with Starbucks, as well as an active member of the union’s Trans Rights Action Committee (TRAC).
“One of the biggest things that we want is the reinstatement of the trans health care supplemental plan that they took away in 2023,” Wilson said. “Everybody is like, yeah, we’re getting that. I haven’t seen anybody say that, ‘no, that’s too much.’ Everyone in our union says we are going to get that.”
Another key issue driving Huntsville’s union effort are allegations from Wolf and Ashes of  workplace discrimination against transgender workers. They say coworkers are misgendered by management, and despite multiple corrections every day, it continues without response. Starbucks refers to employees as “partners.”
“At some point, it really does become malicious, and partners who were more outspoken about the way things were being run were being misgendered very frequently and sort of pointedly,” Ashes said.
The baristas say that logistical issues also plague this location. On Starbucks’ website, the Memorial Parkway location is supposed to close at 6 p.m., but the baristas say it regularly closes at 2 p.m. because of staffing issues. Wolf said workers who are scheduled for those shifts have to use PTO to make up the hours.
Ashes said turnover in the store, which left everyone “fed up,” also contributed to the union push.
“I just didn’t feel safe anymore,” she said. “Suddenly my job security did not exist.”
Despite concerns about risking her job, benefits and education, Wolf began organizing just three weeks into the role.
“I decided to go ahead with it, because it’s just the right thing to do,” she said. “Showing people that folks look down on and consider unskilled labor, whatever that is, because all the labor is skilled labor, that they do have power and that they can organize. (…) My life’s mission is to organize and empower marginalized people and people who work at Starbucks, people who work at whatever fast food places, they’re marginalized people. People look down on them.”
The organizing team recently filed for a union vote, which grants them legal protections against retaliatory firings. If they are fired during this period, they can file charges with the National Labor Relations Board.
Ashes said she hopes a union will give them guaranteed hours, proper staffing and power for workers.
“We’re having p.m. workers who have been working p.m. for a year plus, sometimes several years are now being forced to work a.m. because they’re being told that their hours don’t exist anymore,” Ashes said. “The power to take all of those issues and say, this needs to be fixed, and if you don’t fix it, your store is not going to run. We need to be respected. We were hired to work this. We can work this. We desire to work, but you need to let us and support us”
Wilson has worked at the unionized Birmingham Starbucks location for a year and a half. She said she has greater job security but that the union has led to greater scrutiny from the company.
“People are scared to say the word ‘union,’” Wilson said. “It was dark. It was like saying the word ‘union’ was like a bad word in our store.”
But Wilson said the union gave her  a heightened sense of responsibility in her workplace and a stronger community.
“By participating, you actually give people a fighting chance to have a good workplace, a stable workplace,” she said. “And by burying your hand in the sand, you’re leaving everyone vulnerable to like, harassment, firings.”
In a report released in January, the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, cited Starbucks as engaging in union busting, citing 771 open or settled unfair labor practice tactics before regional offices of the federal National Labor Relations Board through February 2024.
Workers at the Huntsville location are starting to report documents on unions are being hung up around the store. They report that two documents were hung up in their store recently, including one listing ten negative things about joining a union.
Local labor organizations have expressed support for the Huntsville Starbucks, including the North Alabama Democratic Socialists of America, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and The North Alabama Area Labor Council.
“Starbucks workers in Huntsville have realized what more than 10,000 Starbucks workers across the country have realized — that a voice on the job is important, and that they do deserve it,” said Jacob Morrison, president of the North Alabama Area Labor Council.
The union election is scheduled for May 12.

Mackey and the board discussed rules for a paid parental leave policy, which passed the Alabama Legislature in April.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Board of Education will adopt temporary rules for paid parental leave for public education employees at its June meeting, State Superintendent Eric Mackey said Thursday.
The move comes a few weeks after Gov. Kay Ivey signed a law extending the benefit to the workers. SB 199, sponsored by Sen. Vivian Figures, D-Mobile, goes into effect on July 1. 
Mackey said the board will have to adopt an emergency rule in order to approve temporary rules on the paid leave because of the turnaround for the effective date of the benefit. Once the board adopts temporary rules, there will be a 35-day public comment period before the permanent rules are adopted in July.

“All that’s to say there could be changes between the two, so during the public comment period, obviously,” Mackey said Thursday during the board’s work session.
The law allows women who give birth; have a stillbirth or experience a miscarriage after 12 weeks to receive eight weeks of paid leave. It also allows the father to take two weeks of paid leave under those circumstances. If a couple adopts a child under three years old, either parent may have eight weeks of leave if they are both eligible employees.
The benefit can be taken within a year of the event. Mackey said, though, that a parent that gives birth or any other related event on June 30 will not be eligible for the benefit. Also, employees must be employed for one year before they are eligible for paid leave.
“Let’s say somebody has a baby July 1 this year. They qualify if they have been employed the last year,” he said.
Mackey also said that the benefit can only apply once every 12 months. However, the benefit can be taken at any time within those 12 months after the event. A teacher who gives birth during the summer while she is not working can take eight weeks off when school starts in August, Mackey said.
“They could say, start their leave (when) their first day back to school is August 8. They can wait and start their leave on August 8 and then take their leave, you know, for eight weeks,” he said.
The program did not receive supplemental funding for fiscal year 2025, so Mackey said the individual school districts would have to pay employees that take the leave between July 1 and Sept. 30. Once the FY 2026 Education Trust Fund budget takes effect on Oct. 1, the state will reimburse the districts at $120 per day.
He said the Legislature likely underestimated the number of related events that happen in a year. The line item for the benefit received $9.6 million, but Mackey said it is likely closer to a $12 million expense.
“So $9.6 (million) covered what was originally written, but it got changed, when they put in the father’s leave for fathers’ two weeks, which was not in the calculation,” Mackey said..

(Nevada Immigration Coalition video screengrab)A heightened federal immigration enforcement presence in Nevada is a tactic to create fear, and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo should be assuring Nevadans their rights will be protected, the Nevada Immigration Coalition said Thursday. 
The press conference comes after an estimated 30 people were arrested this week by federal agents in Northern Nevada, including in Reno and Carson City.
Noé Orosco, the Government Affairs Manager with Make the Road Nevada, warned that having immigration enforcement in Carson City where “laws of our state are being made” shouldn’t be seen as a coincidence. 
“That is intimidation, plain and simple,” he said. 
The coalition earlier announced it had canceled its immigrant lobbying day scheduled for next week out of fears of prolonged presence of federal immigration officials. 
Organizers have previously warned of increased immigration enforcement in the state over the last few weeks, but have struggled to verify how many people have been detained by immigration officials in Southern Nevada.
Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, said immigration actions taken by President Donald Trump and his administration have been “devoid of due process” as federal officers have targeted undocumented immigrants, Green Card holders and “even U.S. citizens in some instances.”
“Realistically, there needs to be a press conference next door because the governor has been silent,” Haseebullah said. “We need the governor to stop being silent.” 
Nevada Current asked Lombardo’s office to comment on reports of an escalated presence of federal enforcement officers in the state, what communication the governor’s office had with them, and how he plans to ensure people receive due process if they are detained.  
Elizabeth Ray, a spokeswoman for the governor’s office, referred all questions to immigration enforcement officials. 
“Nevada is not a sanctuary state or jurisdiction, and Nevada will continue to follow federal law under Governor Lombardo’s leadership,” Ray said in an email. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t respond to questions. 
Having repeatedly promised “mass deportation” on the campaign trail, since his inauguration Trump has rescinded a 2011 policy prohibiting immigration enforcement in “sensitive” places such as schools, churches, and hospitals, targeted green card holders, and flaunted court  orders finding the administration’s immigration policies have failed to provide people with due process under the law.
Haseebullah said many of these actions are done in cooperation with state and local agencies.
“For any government institution in Nevada that decides it’s going to cooperate with ICE in these investigations in violation of the law, expect to hear from us,” he said. “If you are hiding records, which many government entities are … we will find them, we will bring legal action against you and you will be held accountable for that.”
The coalition cautioned that even the threat of enforcement could disrupt and harm people, especially families. They also said increased U.S. Immigration, Customs and Enforcement activity would damage the state’s fragile economy since it depends heavily on its immigrant workforce.  
“We are day laborers, bakers, food service workers, parents and neighbors,” Orosco said, adding that the state’s immigrant community “contributes over $20 billion annually to the economy.”
Several state Democratic lawmakers also joined the coalition during the press conference as they work to pass several bills that seek to provide a measure of reassurance to anxious families. 
Assembly Bill 217 would prohibit school employees from granting permission to immigration officers to enter a school, or provide student records, including information on a student’s family, without a warrant. Assembly Bill 460 seeks a streamlined process for selecting a temporary guardian for minors prior to any immigration action.
“Every Nevadan, regardless of their immigration status, deserves due process, dignity and protection under the law,” said Democratic Assemblymember Cecelia González, who is sponsoring both bills. “Immigrants are not a threat to Nevada, they are essentially.” 
The coalition encourages people to be aware of their rights if confronted by enforcement agencies

I have Type 1 diabetes. I’m raising a toddler. And I am so tired.
Every day is a balancing act between staying alive and staying afloat. I’m constantly monitoring my blood sugar, taking insulin, scheduling appointments, and praying I don’t hit a snag, because any delay or disruption in my care could land me in the ER or worse. And even when I do everything right, I’m drowning.
Insulin isn’t some luxury item. Neither are the supplies that keep me stable. But the price tags make it feel like I’m being punished for needing them. I shell out hundreds of dollars a month just to keep my body functioning—and there’s zero margin for error. No extra wiggle room. No safety net. Just the relentless pressure to survive another day.
That level of constant stress—that’s my baseline now. And it’s catching up with me.
It’s a pretty simple story. Insulin prices have gone up in my lifetime. That burden has dictated the course of my entire adult life. It’s stopped me from switching jobs, going back to school, or building financial stability. 
Every other developed country on Earth offers insulin at little to no cost. And yet, people die in this country every year from rationing insulin. That’s not just a tragedy—it’s a human rights violation. Keeping life-saving medicine behind a paywall while it’s free everywhere else is indefensible.
The Biden Administration capped insulin prices for seniors on Medicare through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. While this is still in place, the insulin cap does not cover millions of individuals. This action demonstrates that it is possible to put people above profits. With the current Trump Administration and a Republican controlled House and Senate, it is not clear if the insulin cap in the Inflation Reduction Act will remain. It is incumbent upon states to address this issue so residents are not forced to ration medication or simply go without this life-saving drug.
Here in Nevada, something good is happening—finally.
Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager introduced a bill in the Legislature to cap insulin prices for individuals on private insurance at the state level. And that gives me hope again. It tells me that someone is listening and understands that this isn’t about handouts—it’s about survival. About moms like me getting a chance to live long enough to raise our kids.
I don’t want Hudson to grow up without his mom because insulin became too expensive. I don’t want to become another headline about a woman who died young because the system made her choose between her health and her bills.
We need insulin caps. We need full coverage for diabetes care—supplies, appointments, everything. We need a healthcare system that doesn’t crush people who are doing everything right but still can’t afford to survive.
I’m not asking for luxury. I’m asking to stay alive.
Yeager’s bill gives me hope that Nevada might lead the way where the federal government has failed. That maybe, just maybe, moms like me won’t have to carry this weight alone anymore.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/insulin-1024x732.jpeg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

Divided views on flooding, housing, crime and poverty have shaped two local council races.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Next week, Barre voters have a choice of City Council candidates with different approaches to its biggest issues.","City Hall in Barre on Sept. 19, 2023. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIf there’s anything Barre City’s Ward 3 City Council candidates can agree on, it’s that Barre is struggling. “Barre has a really high poverty rate, and with the floods, that’s only gone up,” incumbent Samn Stockwell said. “I do believe that Ward 3 has been kind of forgotten,” her challenger, Don Routhier, told the podcast 802 Scoop last month. But on a variety of issues, the two candidates — who will face each other in elections on Tuesday — are at odds: from flood mitigation, to homelessness and crime, to the tenor of their candidacy and the way that the City Council should view Barre’s future. Routhier, owner of a local used car dealership, has framed his campaign around the concept of “Bring Barre Back” — back to the days of his family’s roots as business owners in the North End. The issue in Barre, as he described it on the podcast is “we have a lot of ideologies who have a dream, this rainbow coalition of everything’s going to happen, but it’s not.”“We need doers. We don’t need teachers,” Routhier went on, “we need doers” taking action to address issues like crime and road repairs. Stockwell, a poet and social services coordinator for the Family Center of Washington County, has put more emphasis on the need for affordable housing and ways to support residents on the path toward homeownership. A similar battle of viewpoints has played out in Ward 1, where current Councilor Emel Cambel is stepping down. Former school board member Eddie Rousse said in an interview that supporting the police department and limiting loitering should be key priorities for the City Council. His competitor Beth Hilgartner, a retired minister and author, emphasized consensus building over jumping to specific solutions. In Ward 2, current Councilor Jeff Bergeron is running for another term unopposed. The election, scheduled to take place on May 13, will also have a budget vote, a vote on a street and sidewalk improvement fund and a vote on whether the city clerk should be appointed by the City Council rather than an elected position. ‘Good Old Boys’?Routhier declined to speak with VTDigger, saying that it was too close to the election for him to do an interview. As of Thursday, his sole media appearance has been on 802 Scoop, a local podcast, on April 16. In that appearance, Routhier held up an old photo of his parent’s former business, the Heiress Motel, now known as the Budget Inn. Although Routhier left Barre to go to college, he eventually returned and opened a used car sales business, Routhier Auto Center. On the 802 Scoop podcast, Rothier was asked if that made him one of the “good old boys,” an oft-used term in Barre to refer to an in-group of political figures. He replied that he finds the term “slanderous,” he said on the podcast, but indicated his support for current mayor Thom Lauzon, who came back into power in 2024 after a six-year hiatus. “Thank God that, you know, we have a new mayor, and I think with a little bit of help, we can turn the city around again,” he said. His vision for turning the city around includes more support for the police department and more cleaning up, beautifying and adding amenities in Ward 3, which includes the North End, one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods in the 2023 floods. Stockwell also believes that new flood-safe development should be a priority in the North End. As a City Council member, she’s been working on flood mitigation through creating new floodplains, removing bridges that contribute to flooding and seeking federal funds for flood-safe housing development and home elevation. But at the same time, she said, Barre should be looking for more opportunities to build dense housing downtown.“The North End would remain a rehabilitated and restored neighborhood without a ton of apartment buildings,” she said. “I think downtown is a place to develop ‘up.’” She also said Barre should look at programs to help residents become homeowners. The two candidates are directly at odds on whether the city should consider dredging the Stevens Branch of the Winooski River, which state officials have warned municipalities to approach with caution, since it can worsen flooding in some situations. Routhier told 802 Scoop he would dredge the river and recommended it be “cleaned out.” Stockwell said there were “real reasons” that dredging can be destructive and hasn’t been the most effective method for Barre. Not ‘that easy a divide’Like Routhier, Rousse, in Ward 1, said he’d like to talk to Barre Police Chief Braedon Vail about ways to reduce crime. He’s specifically interested in cracking down on loitering, particularly among drug users and unhoused people, and said he believes it creates a negative image in downtown. Growing up in a family of seven, Rousse said he didn’t have a lot of goals, but “you’d see (someone) loitering around that was unmotivated, and I just said, ‘That’s not who I want to be.’ And I see more and more of that now.”Rousse has spent decades as a financial planner and representative for National Life Insurance Co. He’s also active in local civic organizations like the Barre Rotary. He cited his professional experience as giving him an advantage when considering the complex fiscal situation of the city. “I think I could provide a common-sense response to whatever comes my way, no matter what it is,” he said. Hilgartner said she tried to approach issues like homelessness with “compassion.” But beyond her personal beliefs in how Barre should address the issue, she believes the emphasis should be on a more community-driven process for tackling it. It’s something she has experience with as an Episcopal minister, where you “have to keep everybody on board” to gain funding and support, she said. She does have one topic that is personal to her: traffic safety. Shortly after Hilgartner, a Barre native who was away a long time, moved back in 2022, two cars got into an accident on her road, damaging the heat pump connected to her home. Barre’s road quality was a top complaint among residents in a 2025 budget survey, and all four candidates mentioned the need to fix cracks and potholes. But Hilgartner floated the possibility of going beyond maintenance and trying to add features to slow down drivers on Main Street. “There’s a 25 mile-an-hour speed limit throughout the city of Barre,” she said. “It is not observed.”Despite the challenges Barre faces, Hilgartner said it’s a wonderful place to live. She recalled the flood in 2023, when residents and community organizations across the board jumped in to help clean up. “The day after the rain stopped, people were just down Main Street and in the North End with their buckets and their shovels and their boots and their gloves, and they were digging their neighbors out and trying to get the businesses up and running again immediately,” she said. Stockwell said one recent bright spot has been the influx of new businesses to Barre, from the Slowpoke Clothing Exchange to Foxy’s, an LGBTQ+ bar. Reflecting on the tone of the different City Council campaigns, she said that Barre had a broad spectrum of political beliefs and backgrounds, among both new and longtime residents. “I don’t think it’s that easy a divide, and I hope people will work together to keep Barre alive,” she said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Next week, Barre voters have a choice of City Council candidates with different approaches to its biggest issues.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/barre-1-20230919-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

StebbinsA fundraiser set to be held Friday night by the Berrien County GOP has drawn criticism for hosting Jan. 6 rioters in a local American Legion hall. 
The fundraiser, “Battlefield Michigan: Untold Stories from Michigan Freedom Fighters,” will be held at American Legion Post 568 in Stevensville and will feature two men charged, and since pardoned by President Donald Trump, for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol – including former gubernatorial candidate Ryan Kelley. It will also host William and Michael Null, who were acquitted of plotting to kidnap and kill Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
A flyer for the event calls the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol a “mostly peaceful protest about a stolen election.” A bipartisan U.S. Senate report found that at least seven people died in connection with the riot, including three law enforcement officers.

After the event was announced, criticism came from within the veterans community itself about hosting such a divisive event.
Marty Goldrick, a veteran and former member of the American Legion, told WNDU he was opposed to the openly partisan nature of the fundraiser.
“First of all, they bring these people in, but then they divide the American Legion, veterans, forcing them because there’s Democrats and Republicans, Independents in any organization, but this thing here is a wedge. To glorify these people is unacceptable,” Goldrick told the station.
Once the criticism mounted, the Herald-Palladium reported that the American Legion attempted to cancel the event, and issued a statement saying officials had not been told about the nature of the fundraiser at the time it was booked.
“Upon learning the nature of the event, from an outside source, the post attempted to cancel the event but was unable to do so because of contractual obligations and the dollar amount requested by the Berrien County GOP to allow the post out of the contract. The American Legion is a non-partisan organization and has no position on the subject matter being presented at the fundraiser and is not a part of the fundraiser,” the statement said.
The county party, in a statement posted to Facebook, said there was an “effort underway on social media to sabotage our event and disparage the Berrien County GOP,” and that canceling the event would constitute a breach of the contract they had both signed.
“We simply want to give Ryan Kelley and our other guests an opportunity to share their experience and perspective because they deserve the opportunity to tell their story and set the record straight. The public deserves an opportunity to hear their stories,” said the statement.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Connor Daley: Vermont’s nonprofits are the backbone of our communities. Let’s support them like it..","This commentary is by Connor Daley, a nonprofit strategy consultant based in Winooski. He works with organizations across the country to build stronger and more resilient nonprofits, foundations and community organizations.Vermont is a special place when it comes to mission-driven organizations. We’re home to more nonprofits per capita than any other state in the country. Vermont ranks behind only Washington, D.C., as a percentage of our workforce employed by nonprofits.From food shelves and housing supports to cultural institutions and youth programs, our nonprofits are the lifeblood of communities. Both rural and urban, reaching from Bennington County to the Northeast Kingdom and from White River Junction to Alburgh, they serve where government resources fall short or the government itself pulls back.They step into where the private market doesn’t (and shouldn’t) go. They step in when towns flood, when a family is unhoused, when a neighbor is hungry or when a kid just needs a mentor to believe in them.Yet, despite their irreplaceable role, Vermont’s nonprofits are being targeted. This is especially true for those led by women, BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and disabled people.These organizations — from direct services to advocacy and from downtown development to grassroots power-building — help Vermont be a more welcoming, supportive and inclusive place. But now, threats of uncertain federal funding, policy decisions and regulatory environments are threatening one of Vermont’s most effective and impactful sectors. Resources like this map of the scale and scope of federal funding cuts/freezes to organizations place in stark relief the severity of the situation.This has been a problem for a long time – Vermont nonprofits have forever been chronically underfunded and overburdened.Per Common Good Vermont’s most recent Nonprofit Wages and Benefits Survey & Report, executive directors identifying as women make up two-thirds of nonprofit leaders yet only earn, on average, 79% of what executive directors identifying as men are making. If we want a resilient, inclusive and vibrant future for our state, we must do more than just applaud their mission. We must fund their work and pay them equitably.From the data and from my experience with national organizations, it’s clear: Nonprofits led by people from historically marginalized communities receive less philanthropic funding, face higher hurdles to institutional support and are often left out of decision-making spaces that impact their operations. Addressing this is not just a matter of efficacy — it’s a matter of doing the right thing. These leaders bring lived experience, cultural knowledge and innovative approaches that are essential to solving the most pressing issues Vermont faces.As someone who works alongside nonprofit leaders every day, I see the brilliance, the commitment and the quiet exhaustion that comes from holding communities together with shoestring budgets. I see the young executive director trying to launch a workforce development program with no full-time staff. I see the grassroots mutual aid network scrambling for unrestricted funds while still meeting daily needs. I see the leader training our next generation of community leaders while simultaneously fundraising to support her students. I see potential everywhere and capital nowhere.Vermonters are generous people. We show up. We volunteer. We give when asked. But we cannot afford to treat giving as seasonal or optional, especially given the state of the world and the state of our community organizations. If we care about women in leadership, equity, justice, education, housing, mental health or the environment, then we must care about the nonprofits doing the work on the ground, year-round, often invisibly.Growing up in the Northeast Kingdom, my father taught me and my younger brother that neighbors aren’t just the people you live next to. They’re your community, your support system and — sometimes — your friends. Our nonprofits are led by our neighbors. Let’s help them out. Here is my ask: Give more. Give monthly. Give without strings. Support Vermont nonprofits led by people who haven’t historically had a seat at the philanthropic table. Talk to your friends and networks about starting an informal group that supports your local nonprofit or library or food shelf.If you’re nervous about being recognized or flagged for your support of an organization, call your financial adviser or a community foundation and ask about setting up a small donor-advised fund, through which you can give anonymously. Challenge your business or foundation to increase its corporate social responsibility donations or community benefit programs to help these organizations continue doing good work.If you’re already giving, thank you. Please keep going. The time to step up is now.The future of our state’s well-being, culture and communities depends on it. Our neighbors deserve it.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Connor Daley: Vermont’s nonprofits are the backbone of our communities.

In the meantime, the much larger Washington Federation of State Employees is pressing Ferguson to sign the budget, which would pay for raises for its members and does not include furlough plans that the union fought against.
The Washington Public Employees Association delivered a letter to Ferguson this week, asserting that inaction by negotiators in his budget office prevented contract talks from being completed faster so the collective bargaining agreement could get funded.
“I recognize that the position you find yourself in is not an easy one,” union president Amanda Hacker writes in the letter. “Please recognize that signing a budget that harms over 5,000 of your employees for asserting their legal right to participate in their union is not the correct way out of this situation.”
Hacker sought to drop the letter off at the governor’s office on Wednesday but was told no one was there to accept it. 
A Ferguson spokeswoman emailed the Standard late Wednesday, indicating the letter had been received.
“Governor Ferguson looks forward to reviewing it,” communications director Brionna Aho wrote. 
Also Wednesday, about 100 association members rallied at a public service recognition event held across the street from the state Capitol. 
Throngs of state workers attended the annual celebration that featured food, music and dozens of information booths representing agencies, community organizations, and service providers. 
Ferguson did not attend the event, choosing instead to schedule a midday bill signing in Seattle.
Delayed agreement
The Washington Federation of State Employees represents 50,000 state government, higher education and public service workers. It has more than a dozen contracts funded in the budget approved by the Legislature on April 27, the last day of session.
“We want him to sign it,” Ashley Fueston, the federation vice president, said. “It’s definitely a tough situation for all of us. We worked very hard to get our contracts funded. We hope they find a way into the budget.”
Those contracts contain general pay hikes of 3% on July 1, 2025 and 2% a year later. These agreements also raise the starting wage for state workers to $18 an hour.
Members of the Washington Public Employees Association are not receiving those increases. They work at 14 community colleges and nine state agencies, including the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Revenue, the Liquor and Cannabis Board and Department of Agriculture.
By law, public sector unions in Washington must approve a new contract by Oct. 1 to be considered by a governor for funding in the ensuing two-year budget.
But association members overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement with the pay hikes by that deadline. Union leaders told employees then that rejecting the accord would put them in “uncharted territory.”
Hacker said they sought to keep bargaining. But the Office of Financial Management, which represents the state, wouldn’t, she said. The union sued to try to force a resumption of talks. Negotiations restarted in December. Hacker lays out the timeline in her letter.
The two sides reached a tentative agreement in March and union members ratified it April 3. It is essentially the same contract they turned down, and has 3% and 2% increases, the same as the other contracts.
“As you know, Governor Ferguson was not in office when most of this occurred,” Aho, the communications director, emailed. “We would defer to OFM for more details.”
On March 19, the Office of Financial Management told legislative budget writers that separate tentative agreements had been reached with Washington Public Employees Association general government workers and higher education employees. OFM staff estimated those two contracts would cost $55.8 million for the 2025-27 biennium.
In the same letter, OFM director K.D. Chapman-See said the agency supported a “one-time non-precedent setting suspension” of the Oct. 1 statutory deadline “to enable these tentative agreements to be considered for funding.”
She also included potential language that could be put in the budget bill, making clear the funding would be solely for the upcoming budget cycle.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed-2-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Some of Florida’s most vulnerable people who rely on Medicaid may wind up having their care flow through managed care organizations under a bill the Legislature passed this session.
Advocates for people with intellectual disabilities are willing to make this move because the proposal, HB 1103, also makes changes to how the Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) operates, requiring, among other things, for it to be more transparent about the billion-dollar Medicaid iBudget program it administers.
Now there are fears the bill won’t become law because the Legislature heavily recast the original agency bill. For example, it provides for a no-bid statewide expansion of a Medicaid pilot program, imposes transparency requirements on the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis, and is a priority for House Speaker Daniel Perez, who has been rowing with the governor.

“Everyone is worried he’s going to veto it,” Alan Abramowitz, executive director of the social services agency The Arc of Florida, told the Florida Phoenix in a telephone interview.
The legislation involves a Medicaid managed-care pilot program launched at the behest of then-House Speaker-Designate, now Speaker, Daniel Perez in 2023. The pilot was designed to care for up to 600 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and was approved for Medicaid regions D and I, which serve Hillsborough, Polk, Manatee, Hardee, Highlands, Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties. 
The state received federal approval for the pilot in February 2024. The Agency for Health Care Administration issued a competitive procurement for the pilot with two vendors, Florida Community Care and Simply Healthcare Plans Inc., vying for the contract. AHCA eventually awarded the contract to Florida Community Care.
Three hundred and fifty eight people were enrolled in the pilot program as of May 5. During testimony in a House Health and Human Services Committee in February, Carol Gormley, vice president for government affairs for Independent Living Systems, attributed the slow start-up to administrative barriers on APD’s part. Independent Living Systems is the parent company of Florida Community Care. 
HB 1103 would lift the 600-person cap on the pilot program on Oct. 1, expanding enrollment statewide for qualifying disabled people on the Medicaid iBudget wait list. There are 21,000 plus people on the waitlist, according to a legislative analysis.
Expansion premature?
iBudget provides clients with money to choose services to help with activities of daily living such as eating and bathing. Those home- and community-based services allow clients to live in their communities and outside of institutions. APD serves 35,790 individuals through iBudget Florida.  
Under the bill, in July 2026 the program would open to every Medicaid-eligible intellectually disabled person, including those already enrolled in the iBudget program and a different Medicaid managed-care program known as the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) long-term care program.
Some observers feel the statewide expansion may be premature, though.
Valerie Breen, executive director of the Florida Developmental Disabilities Council, told the Florida Phoenix that there hasn’t been enough experience with the pilot program to take it statewide.
“[The] council believes there should be more data before it goes statewide. In addition, we believe that people should have the ability to choose their long-term support and services,” Breen said.
  State Sen. Jennifer Bradley via Florida Senate
Senate bill sponsor Sen. Jennifer Bradley tagged two amendments onto HB 1103 late in the session that ensured Florida Community Care will continue to be the only contracted managed-care plan for the intellectual disabled for the next six years.
The Arc of Florida doesn’t oppose statewide expansion of the pilot program because enrollment in it isn’t mandatory, Abramowitz said.
Agreement required
Indeed, Abramowitz lauded HB 1103 because it makes it clear that intellectually disabled clients or their guardians must affirmatively agree to be placed into a managed-care plan and cannot be mandatorily assigned into one. The affirmation applies to the intellectually disabled program and the Medicaid managed-care program. 
While most Medicaid beneficiaries in Florida are required to enroll in that managed-care program, people with intellectual disabilities are not. Nevertheless, the AHCA has been assigning Medicaid-eligible intellectually disabled people into the managed-care program unless they tell the state they don’t want to be enrolled.
Again, Florida Medicaid statutes don’t authorize AHCA to randomly assign people, but the DeSantis administration has done it nonetheless, including through mandatory assignment language in the last managed-care contract.
AHCA was rolling out the managed-care policy change while APD was announcing the new intellectually disabled managed care pilot program.
“It confused everyone. It was a mess. People were unhappy,” Abramowitz said. 
Hijacked by the House
HB 1103 quickly went from a priority bill for APD  to a priority bill for House leadership and advocates.
The bill was filed in February when Taylor Hatch still headed the agency (she now heads the Department of Children and Families.) As initially filed, the bill would have increased the size and power of the APD and made it the single state agency to serve Florida residents with disabilities. 
To that end, an early version of the bill would have transferred the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, the Division of Blind Services, and the Federal Rehabilitation Trust Fund from the Department of Education and placed them within APD. It also would have changed the title of the person who runs the agency from “executive director” to secretary.
None of that is in the final bill, though. That’s because the House Human Services Subcommittee tagged a lengthy amendment onto the measure, replacing the agency’s wish list with the House leadership’s instead.
The amended bill would create a statewide advisory council to make recommendations to the APD.










The  idea that information about the number of people served, the expense of the service being accessed, those on the waiting list, those sorts of things, once again being available online is certainly going to be a positive.


– Former APD Executive Director, advocate, and lobbyist Jim DeBeaugrine


It also would require ADP to post its quarterly reports on its website regarding Medicaid iBudget and its operations, including the numbers of clients and of people on the iBudget wait list.
APD routinely posted the information on its website for years but in the last two years under the DeSantis administration has stopped making the information — which the agency is required to submit to the Legislature — publicly available. 
Former APD Executive Director Jim DeBeaugrine lauded the transparency requirements for the iBudget reports.
“The  idea that information about the number of people served, the expense of the service being accessed, those on the waiting list, those sorts of things, once again being available online is certainly going to be a positive,” DeBeaugrine said.
A surge of support
Abramowitz said the transparency requirements, along with creation of a  Statewide Family Council, represent important changes for people with intellectually disabled family members.
The Statewide Family Council would advise APD on policy, working alongside the existing local Family Care councils. These councils have for the last 31 years worked with families of people with disabilities, sharing information about programs, services, and resources available in Florida.
The bill would require APD to publish on its website all local family care council reports plus local council findings, policy recommendations, and an assessment of the agency’s actions in response to previous recommendations of the local councils.
Lastly, the bill would require APD to contract for a study to review, evaluate, and identify recommendations regarding the algorithm used to set a person’s iBudget allocation. The study must, at a minimum, assess the performance of the existing algorithm used by the agency and determine whether a different algorithm would better meet clients’ needs.
Abramowitz said a lot of the bill was “grassroots written” and that there’s been a surge of support for it in the community.
Stephanie Nordin is a mother of four, including twins with severe autism, who wrote a letter to DeSantis beseeching him to sign the bill.
“Like so many parents across Florida, I live with the constant weight of trying to secure support for my children in a system that feels impossible to navigate. This bill would bring meaningful, desperately needed change to families like mine,” she wrote. 
“And just as importantly, this bill creates real transparency. For the first time, agencies will be required to publish updates about waitlists and funding, so families aren’t left in the dark wondering where they stand.”
Abramowitz, too, wrote a letter to the governor asking that he sign the bill into law.
“Our families, self-advocates, and providers would be honored to celebrate this moment alongside you and your staff. I hope you will consider holding a bill signing ceremony. We would be there in force to celebrate with you. . I would be happy to help coordinate and bring families to the event,” Abramowitz wrote.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Federal officials announced an ambitious plan Thursday to modernize the nation’s air traffic control system, acting after several recent deadly plane and helicopter crashes ignited public panic and made air safety a sudden priority for the Trump administration.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy outlined plans to replace decades-old technology, build new air traffic control centers and towers, and “supercharge” hiring to erase the current national shortage of more than 3,000 air traffic controllers.
Workers would replace radar, software, hardware, and telecommunications networks, with an eye on reducing outages, improving efficiency, and ensuring safety, Duffy said. The plan also aims to eliminate close calls on runways and in approach airspace by expanding a “surface awareness initiative” to 200 airports.
Duffy likened the current system to a flip-phone, saying it has antiquated telecommunications technology that relies on copper wire instead of fiber-optic cable and air traffic control centers dating back to the 1960s.
“You have to redo it all, simply put,” Duffy said. “We are going to build a brand-new air traffic control system. Full stop … this is the biggest lift, the biggest build that has ever happened in the history of the FAA.”
Duffy announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Washington, D.C., before an audience that included politicians, press, and people who lost loved ones when a plane and Army helicopter collided in January over the Potomac River near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Sixty-four plane passengers and three soldiers died in that crash, and investigators revealed more than 15,000 “near-miss” incidents occurred near the airport in the four years before the crash.
President Donald Trump joined the announcement by phone, referring to ongoing delays and outages at Newark Liberty International Airport as “the flavor of the moment.” On April 28, a radio and radar outage left air traffic controllers unable to track aircraft or communicate with pilots at Newark airport for 90 seconds.
“That was not a good situation,” Trump said Thursday. “I’m sorry what you’re going through with the terminals, but we’re going to get them fixed up.”
It’s unclear if the proposed improvements will ever happen, as Duffy and Trump had no cost estimate for the plan.
Pressed by reporters, Duffy said administration officials haven’t put a price tag on the plan, although he expects it will cost “billions. Lots of billions.”
“I’m going to leave that to the Congress,” Duffy said.
He added: “Congress has a lot of fights over money. This is one they should not fight over.”
Rep. Sam Graves, R-Missouri, said the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which he chairs, has approved a $12.5 billion “down payment” to get improvements rolling.
Trump said he hopes one company will get “one big, beautiful contract, where it’s, you know, they’re responsible for everything from digging ditches to the most sophisticated stuff. And if you have any ideas as to who makes the best system, we’d love to have it.”
Duffy called the plan a national priority and said it will require “permitting reform” so that whatever companies do the work can bypass regulations that would likely drag improvements out over 10 to 15 years or longer. Administration officials instead aim to have the work done within three to four years, Duffy said.
The improvements are especially urgent as the skies become more crowded, Duffy added, citing recent upticks in air taxis and delivery drones.
A parade of CEOs from airlines and industry groups took the microphone after Duffy to applaud the plan as long overdue.
“The technology that we use to track our teenagers is more advanced than what we give to our air traffic controllers. That is literally insane. We need to fix that,” said Todd Hopley of the American Association of Airport Executives. “We need better technology. We need better facilities, and we need more controllers. It is as complicated as that and as simple as that. It’s something we can fix, it’s something we should fix, and it’s something we will fix.”
Joanna Geraghty, the CEO of New York-based Jet Blue, acknowledged the families of crash victims in the audience.
“It should not take a tragedy to solve this problem,” she said. “We know air traffic control delays and challenges far, far too well. This has quite literally been our number one priority for decades.”

Jim Murphy, R-St. Louis (Photo courtesy of Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)A bill that would help fund the installation of rescue boxes for parents in crisis to anonymously relinquish newborns to the state is headed to Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe.
State Rep. Jim Murphy, a St. Louis Republican and the sponsor of the “Safe Place for Newborns Fund,” called his legislation “a pro-life bill that everybody agrees with.” 
That was nearly true. The bill faced no opposition until it reached the Senate, where state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, voted against it Wednesday when it passed 31 to 1. When the bill returned to the House for final approval on Thursday evening, it passed 136 to 1, with state Rep. Bryan Wolfin, a Republican from Ste. Genevieve, as the lone dissenting vote.
The legislation was amended in the Senate where lawmakers tacked on an increased tax credit allowance for maternity homes from 70% to 100% and raised the ceiling from $50,000 to $100,000 per taxpayer per year. The Senate also extended the expiration date on the diaper bank tax credit to 2031. 
The amended bill also establishes the “Zero-Cost Adoption Fund,” which would go toward helping Missourians pay for adoption costs, giving priority to those adopting children in foster care. The fund would be administered by the Missouri Department of Social Services and also provide financial support for community-based interventions to help prevent children from entering foster care. 
“Any time we can make not only the adoption process smoother and more cost-efficient and also put supports in place to ensure that the adoption is successful, that’s an easy yes for me,”  state Rep. Melissa Schmidt, a Republican from Eldridge, said Thursday. 
But the “newborn safety incubators” remained the focus of the bill. These boxes are increasingly popular around the country, allowing parents to anonymously relinquish their infant to the state without criminal consequence for abandoning the child. Under state law, parents who relinquish their infants still have an opportunity to ask the state for custody of their child again in the future.
‘Really horrifying’: Missouri draws scorn over treatment of teen mom in foster care

Six of these safe boxes have been installed around Missouri with four more on the way, all thanks to private donors, Murphy said. One child has been safely relinquished through this method, he said. 
The first box was installed in August 2023 at the Mehlville Fire Protection District in south Saint Louis County. Exactly six months later, the box’s silent alarm went off. Inside the box, first responders found an hours-old newborn. 
In early February, while testifying in support of the bill, Hendricks said he planned to attend the little girl’s 1st birthday later that month with her adoptive family.
“There is no reason in the world we live in that babies end up in dumpsters,” Hendricks told state representatives in February. “We can do better. But the funding is an issue.” 
The fire chief said he receives at least three calls a month from other fire departments and law enforcement agencies interested in installing their own boxes. But in most cases, funding is a major barrier. 
The cost of installing each box is roughly $20,000, Murphy said. This includes equipping the box with temperature controls, alarms to notify first responders the box has been activated and a feature that dials 911. Some are also outfitted with video cameras that show a live feed of the baby. 
The current budget earmarks $250,000 for the program, which would put up to $10,000 toward each box, thus contributing to the installation of 25 more boxes in the next fiscal year.
Murphy told his colleagues that the interest in the boxes spans the state. In Kansas City, for example, one councilman is looking to install six boxes, he said.
During the House hearing on the bill, state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, told Hendricks that she was texting the fire chiefs in Berkeley and Ferguson in north Saint Louis County about the technology. 
“I want that box,” said Proudie, who suggested extending the relinquishment period to six or 12 months.
In 2002, Missouri passed a safe haven law that allowed mothers to surrender babies within the first weeks of their lives to staff at hospitals, fire departments, ambulance services, law enforcement agencies, maternity homes or pregnancy resource centers.
Since then, Murphy said, “many, many babies were still found in dumpsters and alleys and places like that,” adding: “The safe haven bill didn’t work as planned.” 
The National Safe Haven Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for “infant abandonment protection,” reports that in 2021, 73 infants were relinquished through Safe Haven laws around the country. That same year, the nonprofit reports, 31 babies were found abandoned in dangerous locations like dumpsters around the country. Of those 31 infants, 22 were found dead. 
During Senate debate Wednesday, state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, expressed her support for the bill as she addressed Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman of Arnold, who handled the legislation in the Senate, acknowledging both their roles as adoptive mothers. 
“My son was placed in my arms at 13 days. I can’t imagine what his birth mom was going through during those days, but I am so grateful that after 13 days, she was able to place him in my arms,” Nurrenbern said. “That’s what we want for all birth parents in that situation, to recognize that there is a safe place for their baby.”
On Thursday, state Rep. Bridget Walsh Moore, a St. Louis Democrat, accused  Senate Republicans of hypocrisy for passing the baby box legislation then leading a filibuster the evening prior to kill legislation that would have created a child care tax credit.
“These baby boxes are all well and good,” Walsh Moore said. “But if we invested in our families and our working families making sure that mothers are healthy and cared for and that children are safe in child care, then maybe people wouldn’t have to hand their children over to the government.”

(Photo by Getty Images.)  Minnesota did the right thing in 2023 by passing earned safe and sick time for all workers. 
This was a powerful first step that affirmed a simple truth: No one should be fired, or risk the ability to feed themselves or their family, because of a short-term illness, the need to care of a sick family member, or because they’ve suffered domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking. It was a common sense step toward ensuring dignity for all workers, no matter where we live or what we do. 
This week, six members of the Senate DFL joined Republicans to put that promise in danger.  
On Tuesday, the Minnesota Senate passed amendments to take ESST away from more than 110,000 workers who have been earning and using earned sick and safe time for 16 months now, for no other reason than the size of their employer.
In doing so, they sent a clear, troubling message: some workers count less than others. 
Let it be clear, sick is sick. It doesn’t matter if you work in a small business in Minneapolis or as a farmworker in Greater Minnesota. It doesn’t matter if you have four coworkers or 40. The need for paid time off to see a doctor, get out of an abusive relationship, or care for a loved one doesn’t change based on the size of your workplace. It’s a basic dignity that all Minnesotans deserve. But with these amendments, our lawmakers are creating a two-tiered system that leaves behind more than 110,000 Minnesotans, as well as the loved ones we care for.
But this will wind up affecting all of us: The child care workers who nurture our children; the home care workers who take care of the most vulnerable among us; the farm workers who grow and harvest the food we eat. 
When we deny these workers the ability to rest, recover or care for loved ones, we don’t just endanger their health — we compromise the well-being of our entire society. No community thrives when its families are forced to choose between their health and a paycheck. Undermining their protections is not just unjust — it’s dangerous.
These rollbacks are a direct blow not just to workers, but to the industries they claim to protect. Stripping away basic protections makes attracting and retaining workers harder, makes workplaces less safe, fuels public health risks, and undermines the stability families depend on. It’s short-sighted and deeply unfair.
For the last 16 months, ESST has allowed all workers to take care of themselves and their loved ones, and made them proud to work in a state where we look out for each other. 
As we think of these potential cuts, we are reminded of a story of a young father from Saint Cloud whose partner developed severe vertigo during pregnancy. He had to take on extra caregiving responsibilities for both her and their child, often stepping in when their daughter was sick. Having just started a new job without paid sick days, he was forced to choose between earning a paycheck and being there for his family, a choice that caused immense stress and heartache. These are the families that ESST was developed to protect. These are the painful stories that could again become reality if these carveouts become law.
Luckily, the fight is far from over. The Minnesota House and Gov. Tim Walz now have a critical opportunity and a responsibility to do what the Senate would not: stand up for universal, common-sense protections and reject these harmful carveouts. They must listen to the voices of working Minnesotans who simply want the right to care for themselves and their loved ones without risking their livelihood.
Minnesota promotes itself as one of the best states to live, work and raise a family. We fight for strong public schools, vibrant communities, and a commitment to fairness and opportunity. But policies like these carveouts chip away at basic worker protections and move our state backwards. We cannot claim to be a national leader while telling thousands of workers their health and dignity are negotiable because of who signs their paycheck. 
If we want to continue setting the standard for a thriving, equitable state, we must defend the rights that make that possible. Cutting corners on ESST doesn’t just hurt workers — it weakens the foundation of what makes Minnesota great.

Revamped regulations tripped Indiana lawmakers up for nearly four months but emerged from a chaotic legislative session within House Enrolled Act 1390, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles’ (BMV) annual package. They’re set to take effect next month after a zig-zagging path through the Statehouse.
“Indiana is the No. 1 predatory towing state in the nation,” author Rep. Jim Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “… Our towing practices exploit and harm trucking companies in their time of need.”

Surveyed commercial carriers logged the most “predatory” towing incidents relative to mileage in Indiana between 2021 and 2023, according to a report by the American Transportation Research Institute. The state also had few of the personal vehicle owner towing protections identified in a 2021 report from the Public Interest Research Group’s Consumer Watchdog team.
“House Enrolled Act 1390 holds towing providers accountable, requiring transparency, capping fees and ensuring access to personal belongings, while penalizing bad actors who are taking advantage of a bad situation,” Pressel said.
Commercial vehicles in the spotlight
That research sparked a Hoosier campaign for reform.
“The great majority of the towers … are responsible businesspeople and are not the problem, but there’s a small percentage that have taken advantage of the industry, and those are the ones that we’re focused on,” Indiana Motor Truck Association President and CEO Gary Langston said.

After learning of the commercial tow findings, Langston began asking around — and was “bombarded with invoices” from in-state and out-of-state carriers.
Indiana law already mandates itemized receipts, but that doesn’t mean all charges are legitimate.
Langston recalled one invoice for an 18-mile tow that featured a fuel surcharge of more than $7,000. He also described seeing overstated hourly labor costs and various “hidden” fees in the miscellaneous and administrative columns on the invoices.
Commercial vehicle interests additionally sought greater recourse for recovering vehicles and the client loads inside while disputing such charges.
In committee hearings, Indiana Towing & Wrecker Association President Karrie Driscol expressed openness to additional regulations but similarly blamed the complaints on a handful of bad actors. Her organization declined comment to the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Charges, releases scrutinized
Several chunks of incoming Indiana code tackle what Langston dubbed “egregious” overcharging.
Towing companies on the Indiana State Police (ISP) rotation will only be able to charge the rates they’ve already filed when ISP calls them for emergency tows. When their services are requested by local law enforcement agencies, the restrictions shift.
If there are set rates, that’s what’ll get charged. If not, a company could charge its ISP rates. If the company isn’t on the ISP rotation, it will charge, at most, what’s in the ISP district’s agreements.
The legislation also requires law enforcement agencies to include a lengthy list of provisions in written policies or contracts entered into, amended or renewed after June 30: contract lengths, service and storage rates, allowable administrative fees, a prohibition on charging unlisted fees, a provision allowing the agencies to suspend or remove violator companies, and more.
When private property owners request tows, companies will charge whatever rates are in the agreements they already have with the owners, according to the legislation. If there’s no preexisting agreement, a company must charge a rate applicable under the legislation’s local law enforcement agency provisions.
The state’s itemized invoice requirement also got tweaks.

Come July 1, invoices must include the number of miles the vehicle was towed, a “good faith estimate” of where and how long invoiced items were used, and an attestation that all invoiced items were “used and necessary in the ordinary course of business.”
Fees must also be accompanied by “full” descriptions of the services provided. Towing companies and storage facilities are barred from charging inspection fees but could charge for retrieval.
Another piece of the legislation lets commercial carriers file complaints with the Indiana Attorney General’s Office if they believe the charges are “unreasonable.” A towing company or storage facility will have to release the impounded vehicle and its cargo within 24 hours of receiving payment for 75% of the invoice, proof of a bond for the remaining 25%, and a copy of the complaint.
Legislators also cracked down on towing company compensation offers for referrals. They’re banned unless there is a prior contract in play.
Winding journey, differing reactions
Towing changes encountered hefty opposition throughout several rounds of changes.
House lawmakers briefly considered giving the Secretary of State’s Office oversight and requiring that towing companies obtain licenses from the office, but the language ultimately wasn’t added to House Enrolled Act 1382 before it left the chamber.

Also in the session’s first half, procedural deadlines felled two towing-focused proposals. Pressel’s committee didn’t put one on its hearing agenda; the other advanced to the House floor but languished on the chamber’s agenda for eight straight session meetings and died.
One Senate committee resurrected that language during its turn to consider the annual BMV agency bill — the same place it was re-inserted more than two weeks later.
In between, another panel removed the provisions, prompting Pressel to cram them into a utility trailers sales bill. At the time, Driscol pressed lawmakers for a “pause” this session.
“May 1, are you available?” she quipped, in a March 31 committee hearing. “… I think that even if this does go, and passes, Chairman Pressel and I will be talking over the summer, because there are still tons of issues that need to be resolved.”
She’s not alone.
Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, was a vocal opponent. He told the Capital Chronicle that he’s looking forward to continued work with Pressel and others on the topic. He wants to make sure good towing companies don’t get caught up in the new regulatory structure.
“I think it’s workable, but it actually kind of contradicts itself as well,” Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, said of the final version. “There were so many different versions done on the language, trying to get it right.”

(Getty Images)For the second year in a row, legislators pushed back on State Public Defender Rémy Starns’ efforts to gain total authority over Louisiana’s sprawling indigent defense system. His proposal would also have made it easier for him to fire a small group of public defense attorneys who have publicly clashed with him. 
Two lawmakers hastily pulled bills from consideration Thursday after members of the House Committee on Criminal Justice questioned Starns’ motivation for pushing the legislation. 

The committee’s vice chair, Rep. Vanessa LaFleur, D-Baton Rouge, criticized the proposal as a “power grab” from Starns and then asked her colleagues to squash it. 
Attorneys who run local public defender offices in central and north Louisiana also testified Thursday that Starns was using the legislation to push them out of their jobs. He was upset, they said, because they had opposed his bills at previous legislative hearings. 
“We are about to have our careers wiped out because Mr. Starns doesn’t think that we should come before you and share with you when we disagree with his policies,” said Michelle AndrePont, the head of Caddo Parish’s public defender office and one of the attorneys Starns is trying to dismiss. 

House Bill 447, sponsored by Rep. Les Farnum, R-Sulphur, would have eliminated a review process AndrePont and other chief public defenders are in the middle of now to fight Starns’ decision to fire them. It also would have taken away some limited power lawmakers bestowed on the State Public Defender Oversight Board just last year. 

House Bill 516, sponsored by Rep. Roy Daryl Adams, D-Jackson, would have consolidated authority over local public defense funds and operations with Starns. Both bills were scuttled temporarily by the authors but could be brought up for reconsideration later in the session. 
At the urging of Gov. Jeff Landry, state lawmakers in 2024 transferred significant authority for managing the state’s public defender system from an oversight board to the state public defender’s position, which Starns has held since 2020. 

Starns had clashed with the previous state public defender board on several issues and told legislators last year its members were interfering with his ability to improve the public defender system overall.

The new version of the board, which has less power than its previous version, is made up of appointees from the governor, legislative leaders and the Louisiana Supreme Court. It oversees the public defense system’s largest contracts, mostly with private attorneys who provide death penalty defense, and it sets the salary scale for chief public defenders hired to run local offices. 
Yet even on these limited issues, Starns has had difficulties getting along with the new board, whose members were seated last July. 
The new board initially declined to go along with Starns’ proposal to route the death penalty contracts through local public defender offices. Its members have also twice turned down his proposed pay scale for chief public defenders, primarily because it would have cut the salaries of some by tens of thousands of dollars.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

More recently, the board has agreed to review Starns’ decision to fire five chief public defenders, including AndrePont. 
All of the attorneys at risk of losing their jobs testified during Thursday’s committee meeting. They said Starns was trying to fire them, primarily because they have criticized his policies in front of state lawmakers and the state public defender board. 
Collectively, the attorneys said they have over a century of experience working in public defense. None have received a negative performance review, they added. 

“What do we five have in common? We are active in the legislative process,” said Brett Brunson, who has run the public defender office in Natchitoches Parish for 18 years and is at risk of losing his job. “At times, we have been at odds with Mr. Starns and his proposals.”

When the public defenders testified last year, they warned they might lose their jobs over speaking out publicly against Starns’ proposals. A few legislators appeared taken aback Thursday that Starns was attempting to fire them. 

“You all are the same ones who came in opposition? And all of you are the same ones who are now terminated?” Rep. Alonzo Knox, R-New Orleans, asked the attorneys. 

“Yes,” responded Trisha Ward, chief public defender for Evangeline Parish.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gavel-GettyImages-876701606-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

(Photo by Mike Simons/Getty Images)If the state of Indiana moves forward with the execution of convicted murderer Benjamin Ritchie on May 20 as planned, the Indiana news media — and by extension the public — will have no legal right to witness the proceeding. Our government will impose the ultimate punishment behind a veil of secrecy, with no objective witnesses.
It’s time for that to change.
Indiana is one of 27 states with the death penalty, but one of only two that prohibits professional media witnesses to its executions. Under state law, execution witnesses are limited to a small group of people, including the warden, immediate family members of the victim, no more than five friends or relatives of the convicted person, the prison physician, and the prison chaplain. The Indiana Department of Correction’s implementing policy explicitly states that the press “shall not be permitted to witness the execution or be in the Execution Chamber.”
Late last year, the state of Indiana executed death row inmate Joseph Corcoran, who was convicted of murdering four people in 1997. It marked the first time in 15 years that the state carried out the death penalty.
Members of the news media were barred from witnessing Corcoran’s death by lethal injection except for one. Indiana Capital Chronicle Senior Reporter Casey Smith witnessed Corcoran’s execution, but was only able to attend after being specifically invited by Corcoran to take one of the seats that the statute reserves for an inmate’s  friends and relatives. Smith’s access to Corcoran’s execution was an outlier. When the state carries out Ritchie’s execution later this month, journalists will be prevented from officially observing it.
Death row inmate Joseph Corcoran executed for quadruple murder

Earlier this week, attorneys from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Indiana’s ban on media access to executions on behalf of The Associated Press, the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Gannett, WISH-TV, and TEGNA. Our lawsuit argues that the media ban violates the First Amendment.
The public relies on journalists to serve as its eyes and ears, and Indiana’s exclusion of the news media from witnessing executions goes beyond safety or security. Indiana’s law and policy runs counter to the First Amendment and denies transparency to the public.
When state lawmakers hold hearings to discuss health care, public education, or property tax reform, we expect members of the news media to be there to document the debate and help us understand what it all means. When a mayor announces plans for a new economic development project, we expect reporters to be there to ask questions about how much it will cost and how it will impact the local community.
We should expect the same level of journalistic scrutiny when the government uses taxpayer dollars to carry out one of its gravest responsibilities — capital punishment.
Media witnesses play a crucial role in ensuring that executions are carried out lawfully. Their reporting provides the public with an accounting of execution protocol and proceedings, from start to finish. If the lethal injections go as planned, news reporting from media witnesses can help the public have greater confidence in the process. If things don’t go as planned and an inmate suffers a painful death at the hands of the state, journalists should be there to tell us about it.
The need for media witnesses is arguably more important today, as states increasingly use controversial methods to end the lives of death row inmates, despite mounting concerns that they don’t always work — or aren’t always administered — as intended. Reporting by independent media witnesses has shown that prison officials sometimes have conflicting accounts.
Indiana’s execution of Corcoran last December was the first in which the state used only a single drug, pentobarbital, rather than a cocktail of drugs as it has done in the past. (I am currently representing Indiana Capital Chronicle in a lawsuit against the Indiana Department of Correction seeking access to the cost of the drug. The lawsuit recently prompted officials to disclose that the state paid $900,000 to acquire the drug, but the government continues to resist disclosing important related information, including how much of the drug was purchased.)
Advocates for and against the death penalty will always debate its merit. But we should all agree that when the government carries out its ultimate punishment in the public’s name, it cannot be allowed to do so in secret.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-09 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,TVA suing Holly Springs over power grid failures,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/09/tva-suing-holly-springs-over-power-grid-failures/,TVA alleges Holly Springs breached their power contract by taking funds from its utility department it shouldn't have.,"The Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally created utility that sells wholesale power to local providers in the south including Mississippi, is suing the city of Holly Springs for breaching a contract by continuing to mismanage its electric department.
TVA, which has sold power to north Mississippi city since 1935, alleges Holly Springs breached a power contract between the two parties by taking funds from its utility department when it shouldn’t have, as well as by failing to make timely payments, increase its retail rates to customers, and provide regular financial updates to TVA.
That lawsuit, filed May 1 in the United States District Court in Oxford, lists as defendants: Holly Springs Mayor Sharon Gipson, who recently lost her bid for reelection, all five members of the city’s Board of Aldermen, and Wayne Jones, the utility department’s general manager. The suit asks the court to use its authority to enforce the contract.

Years of under-investment and deferred maintenance — as well as destructive weather, including a 2023 ice storm — have debilitated the utility to the point where customers experience unusually frequent and prolonged power outages, local officials, TVA and ratepayers told Mississippi Today. They said while the catastrophe was years in the making, decision-making under the current administration has exacerbated the problem.
In its complaint, TVA says it first warned the city in September 2023 that it lacked “necessary revenue” to run the power department. Last October, TVA again warned city leaders, saying it needed to increase customers’ rates to survive financially. The lawsuit alleges that Holly Springs hasn’t paid a monthly invoice to TVA on time since May of last year, and that it still hasn’t paid what it owes from this past February.
TVA also says Holly Springs leaders took funds from the utility department before ensuring there were sufficient reserve dollars. Under the parties’ contract, the city can take payments in lieu of taxes from the utility after it fulfills certain expenses, including saving enough money in reserves. The lawsuit alleges, though, the city made five such payments in the last year, all while having outstanding debts and thus no reserve funding.
While managed by city officials, the utility has expanded to the point where about two-thirds of its 12,000 customers live outside Holly Springs, meaning most ratepayers have no local voting power in terms of running the department.

Customers and state officials attribute much of the recent power issues to city leadership, especially Gipson, Holly Springs’ mayor since 2021. Just a month ago after severe weather took out power for Holly Springs customers, Northern District Public Service Commissioner Chris Brown alleged that Gipson refused assistance from crews in New Albany who offered help. Holly Springs officials denied the claim, FOX13 Memphis reported, saying the crews showed up without getting the city’s approval. 
The Public Service Commission, which oversees the utility thanks to a bill state lawmakers passed last year, initially scheduled a hearing for city officials to appear in Jackson in January. The city successfully appealed the initial date, arguing one of its attorneys, Sen. Bradford Blackmon, had to appear in the legislative session. The PSC agreed to postpone the hearing until after the session, which ended a month ago.
“We are currently in the final stage of the third party investigation and are awaiting a report from (third party investigator) Silverpoint which will determine the exact scheduling of a hearing,” Richard Stone, a spokesperson from Brown’s office, told Mississippi Today on May 5. 
During the 2025 session, Rep. John Faulkner, D-Holly Springs, offered two proposals related to the city’s utility: one requesting $2 million in appropriations, and another establishing a nine-person board — five appointees from Holly Springs and two each from the boards of supervisors for Marshall and Benton counties — to run the department. Both bills died in their House committees.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185719/3X0A1847-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-09 08:02:28.169693

(Photo by Taylor Jung for New Jersey Monitor)JERSEY CITY — The family of a man killed by police here in 2023 gathered with social justice advocates Thursday to condemn a grand jury’s decision last week not to criminally charge the officer responsible for his death, calling it another example of racism within the criminal justice system. 
It was an outcome that left the family and advocates disappointed, but not surprised, they told reporters. They also claimed that community-led mental health response programs that were supposed to be implemented in the wake of Washington’s death have yet to receive proper funding.
Washington’s case reflects broader failures in handling mental health crises, especially in communities of color, advocates said. 
“Mental illness is not met with sympathy and respect. It is met with militarized policing instead of compassion. Families like ours are left with funerals and trying to heal,” said Toni Ervin, Washington’s aunt.

According to Ervin, Washington had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. He was experiencing a mental health crisis when his family called a medical hotline for assistance (they said he feared police). Law enforcement eventually responded instead of mental health professionals, the family said, and after a two-hour standoff, officers broke open Washington’s door. Washington, who had a knife in his hand, came toward the officers, and then Officer Stephen Gigante shot and killed him.
The New Jersey Attorney General’s Office launched an investigation into Washington’s killing, as it does with all officer-involved shootings. On April 28, a grand jury decided Gigante would not face criminal charges.
“We are even more reinvigorated than ever to get justice for Drew,” said Amelia Green, an attorney for the family.
The family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in August 2024 against the Jersey City Police Department, Jersey City Medical Center, and Hudson County, alleging they violated Washington’s constitutional rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Green noted that following the grand jury decision, they now expect to receive previously withheld evidence, including unreleased body camera footage of some of officers’ interactions with Washington.
Washington’s death, along with the police killing of Paterson activist Najee Seabrooks, inspired the Seabrooks-Washington Community-Led Crisis Response Act, state legislation that Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law in January 2024. The law creates a two-year pilot for community-led, non-emergency crisis response programs. Though the state has pledged $12 million for the initiative, none of the selected organizations have received their promised funding, advocates said at the press conference.
Pamela Johnson of the Anti-Violence Coalition of Hudson County, one of the grant recipients, said her organization has an office on Martin Luther King Drive in Jersey City that it cannot open because it does not have enough money.
“So how are we supposed to address individuals going through mental health issues and answer those calls from family members when they need help,” said Johnson.
Jersey City Councilman Frank Gilmore expressed frustration with city leadership, calling the handling of Washington’s case an “epic failure” and accusing city officials of not making mental health resources a priority.
“This is what happens when you dehumanize a certain segment of the population. Because the reality is, if this would have happened to someone else, somewhere else, the sympathy would have been there,” Gilmore said.
Jersey City spokesperson Kimberly Wallace-Scalcione said that even with the city’s participation in Arrive Together — an initiative of the Attorney General’s Office that pairs mental health professionals with law enforcement for crisis calls — and its own investments in crisis response, situations with potential violence like the one involving Washington are still handled by police first.
“No other municipality in the state has addressed more police misconduct and terminated police officers for wrongful conduct than Jersey City.  The loss of anyone’s life is tragic, and even as the grand jury found no wrongdoing by the officers, the city remains committed to improving services while ensuring public safety,” said Wallace-Scalcione.
Washington’s family has continued advocating for improved mental health support systems in Jersey City and statewide. Ervin urged people to register to vote to help elect officials who will implement change.
“We will continue to demand justice, not just for him, but for every life disrupted or ended by police violence,” Ervin said.
Dan Prochilo, a spokesman for Attorney General Matt Platkin, said the office of public integrity and accountability that Platkin oversees “conducted a thorough investigation” into Washington’s death.
“The work of the Fatal Police Encounter Unit within OPIA’s Integrity Bureau, which conducts independent investigations of any civilian death during an encounter with law enforcement as well as deaths in custody, has resulted in several indictments and a conviction of a former corrections officer, who was sentenced to a three-year prison term,” Prochilo said in an email.
As for advocates’ claim that they have not received the funding they were promised from the Seabrooks-Washington bill, Prochilo said organizations that have received approval and a fully executed contract can submit reimbursement requests.
“Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin created the Division of Violence Intervention and Victim Assistance and the Office of Alternative and Community Responses to enable our Office to work hand-in-hand with community partners in the distribution of the funds that support such programs while also adhering to our obligation to be good stewards of the public funding,” he said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Joint Finance Committee kicked off its work on the next Wisconsin State Budget Thursday by eliminating over 600 items from Gov. Tony Evers’ sweeping budget proposal, saying they would start from “base” and his budget had too much “irresponsible” spending. Democrats criticized Republicans for blocking all of Evers’ proposals without presenting a plan of their own to address the concerns of everyday Wisconsinites.
The committee spent last month hearing from members of the public, many of whom called for investments in public education and health care, and from some agency heads, who have defended Gov. Tony Evers’ budget requests. The state has a $4 billion budget surplus it’s considering, and Evers proposed the state tap those funds and raise income taxes on the wealthiest Wisconsinites to fund his proposals. 
The list that lawmakers eliminated from the budget bill spanned about 20 pages and includes a new 9.8% income tax bracket for high-income earners, Medicaid expansion, nearly $500 million for the Child Care Counts program, marijuana legalization and taxation, $125 million to create a grant program to address PFAS, $200 million to address the replacement of lead pipes and other provisions to help address lead poisoning and many provisions related to public schools including free school meals, a “grow your own” teaching program and ensuring access to menstrual supplies in schools, funding for the Office of School Safety and a provision to cap participation in the state’s voucher programs.
Ahead of the budget meeting, committee co-chairs Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) told reporters that they would be starting from “base” with the budget, meaning removing all of the items and taking the budget back to the one in place for 2023-2025. 
Born said legislators are accustomed to “the way we have to manage the governor’s executive budgets.” Since Evers took office in 2019, Republicans have kicked off every  budget cycle by removing all of his proposals.
“Unfortunately, [Evers] sends us an executive budget that’s just piles full of stuff that doesn’t make sense and spends recklessly and raises taxes and has way too much policy,” Born said. “So, we’ll work from base and the first step of that today is to remove all that policy… and then begin the work of rebuilding the budget.”
Responding to Democrats’ criticism  that Republicans are removing items that are popular with the public, Marklein said they should draft separate bills and use the regular legislative process to advance those ideas. 
“I can point to things in the budget bill that we’re going to pull up that I like… and we’re pulling that out as well. It’s a policy,” Marklein said. “It’s got nothing to do with the budget.” 
Born noted that there are also other ways that lawmakers could address issues of concern apart from Evers’ suggestions, saying the removal of items “doesn’t mean that when we build this budget over the next couple of months, we won’t impact those areas in positive and significant ways.”
“The governor has one idea on how to fund child care or one idea on how to impact mental health,” Born said. “There are other ways that we can do that in current law and current budget operations by inserting more money in things that I can most likely see us do.”
Marklein also noted that there could be some changes to how they go about drafting the budget this year following the state Supreme Court upholding Evers’ partial veto in the last budget.
“I anticipate that you’re not going to see too many references to digits, years anymore,” Marklein said. “My guess is that our drafting attorneys are going to recommend that you spell out those years, and those dates in the budget.” Born said the decision could also affect the education budget because there are increases already “baked into the cake.” 
Evers slammed Republicans for gutting his proposal, saying that they are refusing to help Wisconsinites.
“The most frustrating part for me as governor is that Republicans consistently reject basic, commonsense proposals that can help kids, families, farmers, seniors and Wisconsinites across our state, all while Republicans offer no real or meaningful alternative of their own,” Evers said. “Republicans talk a lot about what they’re against, but not what they’re for.”
During the meeting, Democrats proposed keeping 19 items in the budget across a handful of motions that touched on certain issue areas, saying they hoped they could carve out some spots for agreement. 
One would have placed $420 million back in the budget to fund the Child Care Counts program, as well as several other child care related measures. 
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) said Republicans are “willing to pull out really, really important items” and said the child care proposals are essential, warning that money for the Child Care Counts program is expected to expire in June. 
“We are at risk of losing 87,000 [child care] slots… The fact that these things are being pulled out of the budget today and as of today, there is no mention or discussion of a replacement plan for something as important as this,” she said, is creating uncertainty among Wisconsinites and exacerbating a crisis. 
“Our children deserve quality services. Our families deserve affordable rates,” Johnson said. 
Another motion would have placed Medicaid expansion back in the budget. Wisconsin is one of only 10 states that haven’t accepted the federal expansion, which would allow coverage for those up to 138% of the federal poverty line. 
“Families are struggling to afford the care they need, and we have an opportunity — and I would argue an obligation — to do something,” Andraca said.
Andraca noted that Congressional Republicans, including Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, are considering cuts to the Medicaid program as they aim to extend the 2017 tax cuts from President Donald Trump’s first term.
“We heard how people are fearful of cuts to the programs that they rely on, and they are forced to make increasingly hard choices between groceries and prescriptions,” Andraca said. “Are you still willing to turn your backs on the people who entrusted us to vote for their best interests? Honestly, our constituents deserve better than this.”
The final proposal from Democrats would have kept items in the budget related to veterans including tax credits for veterans, funding for a veterans’ mental health program and for the Wisconsin Veterans Museum as well as an item to designate Juneteenth and Veterans Day as holidays. 
Rep. Tip McGuire (R-Kenosha) said he hoped they could agree on not making veterans’ lives harder.
“I recognize that it’s sort of the whole brand of the Republican party right now is to make everyone’s life a little bit more difficult,” McGuire said. “Certainly, it’s harder to travel in this country, It’s harder for people to access health insurance, it’s harder for people to afford college or go to college or manage their student loans. It’s harder for people to afford groceries and there may even be a question of what you can have full shelves soon… I know it’s your whole brand to make people’s lives harder, but I think we can all agree… [veterans] should still deserve some support.” 
Republicans rejected each motion.
McGuire doubled down on his point, saying that Republicans’ opposition to supporting even smaller parts of Evers’ proposal is a sign that they don’t want to help the average person.
“People are struggling and it is a challenging world and the one thing we should not be doing the one thing that nobody votes for their legislator to do is to make their life harder,” McGuire said. “Yet, that is all we are seeing out of the Republican party right now. That’s all we see out of the federal Republican party and frankly the Republican party here,” McGuire said, noting that Republican lawmakers recently passed legislation that would place additional restrictions on unemployment benefits.
“You’re making things less affordable and more difficult for regular [people] and that’s bad and we shouldn’t do it,” McGuire said.
Marklein said he was “glad we’re going back to base” because Evers’ budget proposal included a 20% increase in spending, an additional 1,300 positions funded by general purpose revenue and an increase in taxes. 
“When I talk to my constituents about the process, they are truly supportive of us not starting from this inflated budget that [Evers] put before us,” Marklein said, noting that Evers signed the last budget after they went through a similar process. “The idea that the door is closed on all these things is pretty ridiculous.” 
McGuire pushed back on Marklein’s comments, saying that lawmakers are pretending it is a “nice and friendly” process. 
“Part of the process that occurs here today is that not only do you remove the governor’s budget items, which make life easier for Wisconsinites, but then, you also prohibit anyone from ever discussing them ever again,” McGuire said. “And that’s really bizarre… This is a top-down totalitarian committee where we’re not permitted to discuss things past a certain point.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Every kid has heard “No means no!” when they want something their parents don’t think they should have. This week that phrase got a couple high profile uses when Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, told Donald Trump right to his face that Canada was not and never would be for sale and Montana’s Congressman Ryan Zinke forcefully said “no” to the sale of public lands in the West.  
In this day and age seeing U.S. politicians keep their campaign promises — or honor their oaths of office — is becoming increasingly rare.  But on “keeping public lands in public hands,” Rep. Zinke did just that. 
The measure in question was part of the “big, beautiful bill” touted by Trump to give yet more tax breaks to the already wealthy. The new twist was to sell hundreds of thousands of acres of federal lands in Nevada and Utah for mining, logging, drilling and development to finance those tax breaks.  
Doug Burgum, the Secretary of the Interior, has publicly declared public lands and resources as “natural assets” that can be used to pay down the national debt. Consequently, GOP Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada and Celeste Maloy of Utah inserted the public land sale as an amendment since it was not contained in the original draft of the bill due to bipartisan opposition.
When the measure was up for a vote in the House Natural Resources Committee, on which Zinke sits, Montana’s Congressman and former Secretary of the Interior called the move to sell public lands “a red line” and was adamant: “It’s a no now. It will be a no later. It will be a no forever.’’   As Zinke explained his firm opposition: “I prefer the management scheme and I give as an example a hotel. If you don’t like the management of a hotel, don’t sell the hotel; change the management.”
At almost the same time, Canada’s Prime Minister, Mark Carney was using almost the same words in his White House meeting. After listening to Trump’s blather about how Canada should be our 51st state, how much he “loved Canada” and how erasing the “artificial” border line would make one beautiful piece of real estate, Carney used Trump’s own real estate line to fire back: “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale.  We’re sitting in one right now.  Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it’s not for sale, won’t be for sale,” adding: “Canada’s not for sale. It never will be for sale.”
Carney won office largely on his opposition to Trump’s intentions to take over Canada, saying during the election that: “America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. But these are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.”
Both Zinke and Carney are dead right.  Polls show 74% of Americans oppose the sale of our public lands — and Carney’s election speaks for itself.  He won by fighting Trump’s nasty threat to take over our northern neighbor that 77% of Canadians oppose.  
For a guy who’s always been told he can have everything he wants, the double-barrel blast should be a wake up call.  The world is not one big real estate sale to be marketed solely to make greedy billionaires even more money.  Kudos to Zinke and Carney — and hopefully a sign to the rest of Congress and the world that it’s time to tell our spoiled child of a president “No means no!”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2213751899.jpg,,,2025-05-09 07:02:30.122244

A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the […]","Apartments and stores under construction in Rapid City, S.D., in 2023. New apartments reached almost 592,000 nationally last year, the highest number since 1974, with South Dakota and the Rapid City area approving new apartments at particularly high rates. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)More new apartments were built in 2024 than in any other year since 1974, but the Trump administration’s tariffs and deportations of potential construction workers, plus higher interest rates, could be a wet blanket on the boom.
A U.S. Census Bureau survey found almost 592,000 new apartments were finished last year, the most since the 1970s, when baby boomers sparked a construction surge as they moved out of their childhood homes. There were 693,000 new apartments built in 1974, when the country had about half as many households.
But there has been a steep slowdown in construction starts, as the newly completed apartments come online. The increased supply has lowered rents and increased vacancy rates, making new development less profitable. Some experts also say tariffs on construction materials and labor shortages caused by dips in immigration will create headwinds for new construction.
Apartment starts were down 27% in 2024 compared with 2023, and down 37% from a recent peak of 531,000 in 2022, despite the historic rate of completions. Apartment starts were at their lowest ebb since 2013.

Housing experts have long lamented that there aren’t enough apartments and single-family houses in the U.S. — at least not in places where people want to live and at prices they can afford. Estimates of the national housing shortage last year varied widely, from 1.5 million houses and apartments to 20.1 million; since then, another 1.6 million houses and apartments have been built. Most experts estimate a shortage of 1.5 million to 5.5 million, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
Some states are building apartments faster than others, according to a Stateline analysis. Though completions aren’t tracked by state, permits that lead to new apartments have been granted at high rates in recent years in South Dakota, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. Rates are lowest in Mississippi, Wyoming, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Oklahoma and Alaska.
The massive jump in apartment construction has its roots in 2021 and 2022, when interest rates were low and rent growth was high, said Rob Warnock, senior research associate for Apartment List, a company that posts rental listings online.

“Those new apartments came online in 2023 and 2024, and while those deliveries are slowing down today, there are still many apartments in the pipeline,” said Warnock, who added that “supply and demand are coming back into balance.”
In response to greater supply, rents have fallen by about $50 per month (3.5%) from their 2022 peak, according to a report released this week by Apartment List. Apartment vacancy is at a 15-year high of 6.3%, keeping a lid on rents, but that could turn around as construction slows, according to an April report by Moody’s, a financial services company.
Apartment building has been a bipartisan priority as single-family home prices soar further out of the affordability range for young families. In South Dakota, the Republican-controlled legislature worked to prolong the building boom with grants and loans under the state’s Housing Infrastructure Financing Program. The program put $200 million of state and federal funding toward defraying the costs of development in new neighborhoods, such as roads, sewer lines and streetlights.
Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree, sponsor of the proposal signed into law in 2023, told Stateline it was needed to address a housing shortage, especially in rural parts of the state.
“We have a drastic shortage of workers,” Crabtree said before a vote in 2023. “South Dakota businesses need more workers in our state. To get more workers, we need more housing.”
 Does overregulation of housing construction play a role?

Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America, said overregulation is a barrier to housing construction in many areas that his party controls.
“A lot of blue-government areas and cities have extremely restrictive zoning, impact fees and other rules that make it very difficult to build housing,” said Domalewski. Another barrier is local opposition, he said.
“If it was just a free market, developers would want to build in the places like California, where prices are the highest and rents are the highest, because they’d make more money,” he added.
In California, the 2021 HOME Act was meant to spur more affordable housing and ease labor shortages, but it’s faced local opposition in some areas. At the end of last year, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed several measures that aim to streamline regulations and crack down on local resistance to the 2021 law.
South Dakota approved nearly 6,000 permits for apartment units in 2023 and 2024, which when completed would add about 1.4% to its 2023 total of 417,000 housing units. That’s the highest rate in the nation. By contrast, Mississippi during that same period approved about 660 apartment units — a fraction of 1 percentage point to its 2023 base of about 1.4 million housing units.

– Armand Domalewski, co-founder of YIMBY Democrats for America




Chas Olson, executive director of the South Dakota Housing Development Authority, said the full impact of the state infrastructure funding isn’t apparent yet, as many developments that received the help are still under construction.
Completions are still strong this year with about 39,000 apartments finished in March, not much different from the 41,500 in March 2024, which was the biggest March number since 1985.
Another impediment to apartment construction has been high interest rates, which make it harder to borrow money to build, said Danushka Nanayakkara-Skillington, an assistant vice president for forecasting and analysis at the National Association of Home Builders.
She expects apartment building starts to slow until later this year.
“We are going to be short of workers for a long time. That’s the way it is. And of course tariffs are going to have an impact,” Nanayakkara-Skillington said.

(Photo provided by Benjamin Ritchie's legal team)Lawyers for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie are seeking a last-minute execution pause from the U.S. Supreme Court to allow evidence of the inmate’s “serious brain damage” to be weighed for the first time.
The high court requests are in response to a 2-2 decision handed down late last month by Indiana’s Supreme Court justices, which shut the door on any further legal challenges in state or federal courts.
Defense attorneys argued in the Wednesday filings that the denial was a “legal error” and said Indiana’s justices failed to take into account Ritchie’s “ineffective” lawyers at trial and in other post-conviction matters. Current counsel said those earlier lawyers “failed to present fetal alcohol syndromes,” which lead to a death sentence “based on inaccurate information.”

“Through trial, state post-conviction, and habeas review, the record developed by Ritchie’s attorneys contains incomplete information of Ritchie’s brain damage,” public defenders said in new court documents. “Ritchie’s attorneys allowed the State to create a materially false impression with the jury. … Ritchie was condemned to death without anyone hearing evidence that he suffers from a fetal alcohol syndrome.”
Ritchie faces a May 20 execution date for the 2000 killing of Beech Grover law enforcement officer William Toney. The condemned man has been on death row since his conviction in 2002.
Per court documents, the underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at the police officer, who did not survive the shooting.
The inmate’s current counsel said prior lawyers “completely failed to investigate the source of Ritchie’s serious brain damage” because they “erroneously believed” he lacked the facial features that are commonly associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. 
As a result, state prosecutors told the 2002 jury “to assign little weight to his mitigation because there was no such diagnosis,” according to the latest filings.
Separate from the SCOTUS filings, Ritchie’s attorneys are seeking an emergency stay from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. In the motion, filed Thursday, his defense team similarly argued that Indiana’s Supreme Court has wrongly shut down final opportunities for post-conviction relief.
If the higher courts decline to intervene, the only option for a commuted sentence rests solely with Gov. Mike Braun, who has final say over Ritchie’s pending clemency petition.










Ritchie was condemned to death without anyone hearing evidence that he suffers from a fetal alcohol syndrome.


– defense attorneys for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie


Those proceedings began earlier this week when members of Indiana’s Parole Board spoke with Ritchie during a Monday hearing held at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. A second meeting is scheduled for Monday, May 12, in Indianapolis and will allow members of the public to speak for and against Ritchie’s clemency petition.
After both hearings, the board will make a recommendation, but a final clemency decision about whether to commute Ritchie’s death sentence to life in prison without parole will ultimately be up to the governor. There’s no timetable for the board, or Braun, to issue opinions.
Neither the governor nor any current members of the state’s parole board have deliberated a death penalty clemency case before Ritchie’s.
Three clemencies have been granted in Indiana since 1976.
The most recent was in 2005, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels commuted the death sentence for Arthur Baird, who killed his pregnant wife and her parents in 1985. Although the parole board denied his petition for clemency, Daniels granted Baird clemency one day before the scheduled execution, in part citing questions about Baird’s sanity.
Years of ‘ineffective’ counsel
Ritchie’s lawyers submitted two requests to Justice Amy Coney Barrett: one to supersede the state supreme court and allow for further post-conviction review of the inmate’s case; and another to stay, or pause, the scheduled execution, at least until those proceedings can play out.
The petition for writ of certiorari — a request asking SCOTUS to review the state supreme court’s decision — held that a 2002 jury sentenced Ritchie to death “based upon inaccurate information.”
The inmate’s current lawyers said prior counsel was “insufficient(ly) prepared” and hired only one mental health professional who “was forced to admit that” any brain damage suffered by Ritchie “could not be traced to any source.”
Story continues below.
20250507154136734_Cert
 
That’s contrary to new evidence submitted to the Indiana Supreme Court earlier this year, Ritchie’s lawyers said.
Included in the most recent post-conviction filings were findings from two Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) experts, who claimed that Ritchie “has extensive brain damage resulting in deficits due to a fetal alcohol syndrome.”
One expert, a geneticist, specifically diagnosed Ritchie with Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), “meaning his brain damage limits Ben’s functioning to that similar to a person with intellectual disability.”
“Ritchie has significant adaptive functioning deficits caused by pFAS that, among other things, inhibit his ability to control impulses,” his lawyers wrote in the petition to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Importantly, unlike an investigation ‘into other mental illnesses and behavioral issues,’ a diagnosis of FASD can establish ‘both cause and effect’ of a criminal defendant’s actions,” they continued.
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office has repeatedly maintained in legal filings that Ritchie has failed to provide the high court “with a good reason to reconsider its decision to set an execution date or to deny him permission to re-litigate his trial counsel’s performance.”
“Ritchie has not explained why the jury would have found this evidence more mitigating had his trial counsel linked those functional deficits to a formal clinical diagnosis …” state attorneys wrote. “Ultimately, the reports submitted by Ritchie at this late stage do not cover any new ground and they certainly do not help Ritchie meet his burden of proving that there is a reasonable possibility that he is entitled to relief on his successive claims.”
State supreme court justices split
Indiana’s Supreme Court justices “agreed that (Ritchie) has brain damage caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol and other toxins.” But the court was split, 2-2, on whether he should be allowed to present evidence “of the effect of that damage on his behavior” on the night of his crime.
Chief Justice Loretta Rush, who disagreed with the decision to deny further post-conviction relief proceedings, said in her April 15 opinion that she believed evidence submitted to the court suggested “a strong likelihood” that Ritchie suffered from FASD when he murdered Toney, the Beech Grove police officer, in 2000.
Rush said she preferred to hold off on an execution date so the court has more time to “receive and consider” the FASD experts’ evaluations.
‘I am so sorry’: Clemency hearings begin for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

But Justices Derek Molter and Geoffrey Slaughter said in their opinion that “what Ritchie’s experts turned up is irrelevant.” The issue before the court “is not whether Ritchie suffered from FASD in 2000 or whether he does so today,” they said. Rather, the justices must decide whether Ritchie’s trial lawyers “were constitutionally ineffective during sentencing for failing to investigate the possibility that Ritchie suffered from FASD then.”
The affirming justices, citing federal law, maintained that Ritchie was unable to meet the necessary standards for his petition to be further litigated.
Last week, the state’s high court justices rejected a follow-up request by Ritchie’s defense team for a new hearing to reconsider the inmate’s request for post-conviction relief. The justices additionally denied a request for a stay which would have delayed the execution.
Justice Mark Massa, who served as a deputy prosecutor in Marion County and participated in proceedings related to Ritchie’s case, has recused himself from the case.
The decisions stymied Ritchie’s ability to appeal in federal court. His legal team wants the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Indiana justices’ ruling and allow Ritchie to continue his post-conviction pleas.
The high court’s ruling followed a series of exhausted appeals previously filed by Ritchie and his legal team.
Executions were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. The state paid $900,000 on execution drugs but won’t say how much was purchased. 
Ritchie and six other men remain on the state’s death row at the Indiana State Prison.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Budget cuts are often sold to the public as necessary belt-tightening — an unfortunate but unavoidable step toward “fiscal responsibility.”
But what happens when those cuts target the most vulnerable among us? What happens when the programs being slashed aren’t luxuries, but lifelines?
Across Oklahoma and the nation, disability services are quietly being defunded, downsized, or dismantled. These decisions may not make front-page news, but their impact reverberates deeply in the lives of disabled individuals and families who depend on them for support, inclusion, and survival.​
Programs designed to support and protect people with disabilities — like state councils on developmental disabilities, protection and advocacy systems, and national initiatives that give us a voice — face the threat of elimination.
As a single mom of five, raising a son on the autism spectrum, I live the realities these programs are designed to address.
Every day, I navigate school systems, health care barriers and support networks in a world that isn’t built with families like mine in mind.
And I’m not alone.
Since 2022, more than 2,000 Oklahoma families have been approved for or are currently receiving developmental disability services, following a significant reduction in the state’s waitlist from 13 years to one. These services are not luxuries; they are essential supports that enable families to move from merely surviving to truly thriving.
What truly changed the trajectory of my advocacy journey was Partners in Policymaking, a leadership training program I completed through the Oklahoma Developmental Disabilities Council. That experience gave me the tools to speak up — not only for my child, but for the entire community. I learned how to navigate the Legislature, challenge broken systems, and amplify the voices of others who are often ignored.
This is not just a budget issue — and it’s not about left versus right. It’s about what’s right versus wrong.
In Oklahoma, recent funding efforts have made a measurable difference. Rolling back that progress now would be devastating.
Despite that, I’m hearing growing concern that this progress could be reversed in the upcoming budget and that these critical services could be on the chopping block — putting thousands of families at risk of losing the critical support they’ve only just begun to receive.
Budget cuts would send a message loud and clear that our needs are not a priority. Without programs like these, future advocates won’t get the chance to find their voice. The leaders, policy changers, and community builders of tomorrow will be silenced before they ever begin.
Cutting disability programs means cutting off access — to education, employment, independence, safety, and basic dignity. It also means delaying early screenings and interventions — critical steps for diagnosing developmental disabilities, identifying delays like autism and addressing childhood trauma.
The data is clear: approximately 1 in 6 children aged 3–17 in the U.S. has a developmental disability. Services to support these children are not a luxury — they are a necessity. When children are denied early access to help, we miss critical windows of opportunity that shape their futures.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, early diagnosis and intervention for developmental disabilities can greatly improve a child’s development and long-term outcomes. Eliminating these services risks leaving thousands of Oklahoma’s children without timely help during their most critical developmental windows.
What starts as a delay in services, often grows into a lifetime of missed potential, greater needs, and heavier burdens — both for families and for our state. Cuts made today will cost far more tomorrow both in lives and in dollars.
We can’t claim to value community, family, or fairness while gutting the very programs that make those ideals possible for everyone. Oklahoma can’t call itself inclusive if we only show up when it’s convenient. We can’t say we care about all children while ignoring those who need support the most.
Because when we silence the most vulnerable among us, we don’t just harm individuals and their families — we betray the very values that are supposed to unite us and wound the very soul of our society.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas State Library Board on Friday will disburse public funds to libraries for the last time in the 2025 fiscal year, and likely the last time before all seven board members will be replaced.
As local library directors wait for their regular shares of state funding, some continue to await a long-delayed avenue for rural libraries to be eligible for more state funding. An amendment to the State Library’s fiscal year 2024 appropriation bill introduced by Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, required the Arkansas Department of Education to alter library funding eligibility standards to allow smaller libraries not supported with a local millage access to state aid.
The original deadline for establishing those standards was July 1, 2024, the start of the current fiscal year.

“We want [libraries] to receive local support,” Payton told a Joint Budget subcommittee at the time.  “We don’t want them dependent on the grants and aid that might come through the State Library system, but it’s impossible for them to pass and maintain one mill if they’re a city of less than 5,000.”
Arkansas Constitutional Amendment 30 prohibits libraries in cities with fewer than 5,000 people from being supported by local property taxes. Payton said he presented the proposal to change the rules on behalf of his constituents in Ash Flat, which has a population of just over 1,100 and a library funded by the city government.
Eligibility for state aid would allow the Ash Flat Library to apply for state and federal grants it currently cannot access, Terry Hill, chairman of the library’s governing board, told the Advocate.
Subsequent State Library appropriations, for fiscal 2025 and 2026, reiterated the need to broaden access to library funding, but the rule-making process stalled last year, meaning rural libraries still cannot access the funds, according to library directors and the education department.
State Library Director Jennifer Chilcoat told the board in a Feb. 14, 2024, email that the rules had to be in place before the board met that August to start disbursing state funds for fiscal year 2025. If not, the State Library would be “in violation of” either its standards for state aid to public libraries or the legal requirement to create the rules, Chilcoat said in the email.
The State Library appropriation bills state that the new rules must “allow a public library to adequately demonstrate a source of revenue in lieu of the requirement to maintain a one-mill county or city property tax,” which is currently a standard for libraries to receive state aid. Without formal rules, the current standard limits which libraries can receive state grants. A mill is equal to $1 dollar for every $1,000 in assessed value on real estate.
Calhoun County is Arkansas’ most rural county, and its library system would receive an $18,000 funding boost under broader state aid eligibility standards, director Allie Gosselink told the Advocate. The Hampton library would also be able to increase its hours of operation from 28 to 40 hours per week and would bolster its early literacy services and upgrade its technology, Gosselink said.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)
She and John McGraw, regional director of the Faulkner-Van Buren Library System, were both on the advisory committee that drafted new rules required by the 2023 law.
“We talked about every piece of that and tried to decide what worked, what didn’t work, what was detrimental, and we changed the rules based on what we thought would be fair,” Gosselink said.
Assistant Attorney General Sarah DeBusk told the State Library Board in November that proposed rules must be approved by the education secretary and governor and a public comment period before final approval by the Arkansas Legislative Council.
The Department of Education’s legal division is responsible for ensuring the rules are in the proper format before they return to the state agency that drafted them. The State Library Board would be responsible for opening a 30-day public comment period on the rules after receiving the formal version from the education department, and Chilcoat urged the board in the February 2024 email to plan for a special meeting the following month.
Education department attorneys were “tentatively predicting that we should either hear back from or receive approval from” Sanders’ office in the subsequent few weeks, Chilcoat wrote.
“There is a timeline that we are keenly aware of to get the changes in place before the start of the 2025 State Fiscal Year,” she said in her February 2024 email. “For that reason, we cannot wait until the May board meeting to get these Rules in front of you and the public.”
The State Library Board has not voted on the proposed rules but has a new deadline of this July 1 to act, according to emails obtained by the Advocate via the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.
Possible alternatives
The still unofficial rules and possible actions the Library Board can take were the subject of late April emails between Chilcoat and ADE Chief of Staff Courtney Salas-Ford.
Since the board doesn’t have new rules to address Payton’s 2023 appropriations amendment, Chilcoat wrote on April 25, “we need to have a stopgap formula beginning in August in case the promulgation process is not complete at that time.
“If there aren’t new State Aid Rules in place when the new board members begin their terms, these drafts will give them a template which they can use or dismiss, but it will give them a starting point from which to work if they so choose,” the email said.
One of the last laws the General Assembly passed before adjourning this month was Act 903, which will dismiss the entire State Library Board and require Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appoint seven new members in August.
In an April 30 email, Chilcoat told Salas-Ford she has “two versions of a one-time state aid formula for the current board to choose from and approve so that the new board doesn’t have to deal with the first quarter payments at their first meeting.
“One formula simply removes the MLS (Master’s of Library Science) credit from all recipients of it. The other is a simple across-the-board percentage decrease [in state aid to all libraries].
“Both are included so that we can honor Senator Payton’s amendment to include those libraries that don’t or can’t collect the millage previously required. Of course, the current board can also vote to pass the responsibility to the next board.”
Gosselink and McGraw both told lawmakers in April that the inaction on the proposed rules was a reason the Legislature should not dissolve the State Library and its board and transfer their responsibilities and funds to the education department. A House committee rejected the proposed dissolution, one of several bills that generated hours of debate about library oversight and funding throughout the 2025 legislative session.
The new rules for state aid to libraries are on Friday’s Library Board agenda.
Gosselink said she hoped Friday’s board meeting would create “a little bit of clarity” for her library’s funding for the rest of the state’s fiscal year.

The Sheridan Chess Association brought in a Serbian chess protegee who took on the room, playing 24 games at once and winning all of them. 
The post Grandmaster 24, Sheridan chess club 0, but winners all around appeared first on WyoFile .","At age 21, Serbian chess player Luka Budisavljević is the youngest Grandmaster in his country’s history. A grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can achieve, besides world champion, and there are only around 1,850 of them in the world today. 
In Sheridan last weekend for the Wyoming Community Foundation Open — a chess tournament with a $9,000 guaranteed purse — Budisavljević warmed up by playing 24 Sheridan players simultaneously. The Sheridan Chess Association, which hosts the tournament, put on the event to give local players a chance to compete against one of the sport’s elite. 
Going from board to board and move to move in sweatpants and a track jacket from the University of Missouri, where he is a student and the reigning Pan-American Collegiate Chess Champion, Budisavljević won all 24 games.

Daniel Hoopes, a Sheridan High School student, held out the longest, lasting more than 30 moves against the Serbian protegee, according to Sheridan Chess Association president Brian Kuehl. “A bunch of people who played out of the 24 were young kids,” Kuehl said. “It’s an opportunity to bring chess into the community and for kids to get a chance to play against a grandmaster they’ll likely rarely, if ever, have that opportunity again.” 
The real tournament began Friday and lasted until Sunday. The chess association has hosted the competition in Sheridan each of the last four years. The group’s principal goal remains getting Wyoming youth interested in chess, an activity Kuehl said imparts both critical thinking skills and focus to its young adherents. 
Before his simultaneous dispatching of 24 local players, Budisavljević visited two Sheridan schools to talk about chess and play students blindfolded.

Budisavljević was one of three grandmasters in Sheridan for the weekend. The 79 contestants from eight different states also included state champions from Colorado, Wyoming and Montana. Players ranged in age from eight to late 80s, Kuehl wrote in a summary of the tournament. 
Budisavljević ended up one of four people locked into a tie for first place in the tournament’s most elite division.

Wyoming's congressional delegation should review the ""Code of the West"" before they sell off our public lands, attorney Ryan Semerad writes.
The post Remember that some things aren’t for sale appeared first on WyoFile .","Our public lands are invaluable and irreplaceable. A national treasure and a source of local pride. Yet, when the opportunity arose for Wyoming’s senators to protect our public lands from being sold off and privatized, they voted no. 

Opinion

U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, voted against preserving our public lands because she didn’t want to “obstruct President Trump’s agenda,” according to an April 10 statement from her spokesperson Joe Jackson. Both Lummis and U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, have suggested that some of our public lands should be sold to develop more affordable housing.
In the fall, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon and 26 members of the Wyoming State Legislature joined legal briefs to support Utah’s lawsuit demanding a transfer of millions of acres of public land from federal management and public ownership to state management and, later, private ownership. And, in the span of just five days, Hageman and every Republican on the House Committee on Natural Resources — except for Rep. Jeff Hurd of Colorado, — went from backing away from selling our public lands to advancing a midnight amendment that could authorize the sale of nearly a half million acres of public land across the West. The late-night move allowed no time for reflection, discussion or public input. As Devin O’Dea of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers put it: “This amendment isn’t just a backdoor land sale — it’s a deliberate effort to circumvent a process that was thoughtfully designed to protect and improve our nation’s public lands.”
Is this plan to sell our public lands really what the Wyoming people want?
In January, the State of the Rockies Project from Colorado College released its 2025 Conservation in the West Poll. The poll surveyed 3,316 registered voters from eight western states, including 402 registered voters from Wyoming. Across the entire set of respondents, 37% identified as “MAGA supporters” and 24% identified as “MAGA Republicans.” From the Wyoming group, 53% identified as “MAGA supporters” and 74% identified as “Republicans.”
Some 65% of all respondents and 58% of Wyoming respondents opposed transferring control over our national public lands from the federal government and its agencies — including the U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management — to the states. Only 11% of Wyoming respondents supported selling these public lands to create space for affordable housing. By contrast, 86% of Wyoming respondents supported building more housing in existing communities near jobs, roads and transit.
Preserving public ownership of these lands produces immense economic value for outdoor recreation, energy development and agriculture alike. 
Last November, the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable announced new economic data showing that outdoor recreation across the United States generated $1.2 trillion in economic output in 2023 or 2.3% of the country’s gross domestic product. That is a 36% increase in real terms from 2012.
BLM-managed public lands situated in Wyoming produced $24.9 billion in economic output and supported 73,000 jobs in 2023, according to the agency. That economic output included $211.8 million from recreation, $238.9 million from grazing, and $24.2 billion from oil, gas, coal, and mineral development. From this output, BLM-managed public lands produced $970.9 million in payments to Wyoming and its counties to help fund our schools, road improvements, infrastructure and other public services.
“A recent trip on public lands in Wyoming.” (Andy Beach)
So here’s my question for our senators and Wyoming voters: How does selling our public lands promote the Wyoming people’s agenda? 
Do our senators believe that we want to give away our cherished public lands? The lands we hunt, fish and hike. The lands we inherited from our parents and grandparents, and that we hope to leave for our children and grandchildren. I don’t know about you, but I don’t remember voting for Lummis, Barrasso or Trump so they could strip us of that great legacy — our public lands.
We live our lives and make our homes in Wyoming, that great plain sweeping across the American West, because we love the land. We respect it. We honor it. 
And we raise our families on public lands. We teach our children the great lessons of life on these lands. We graze our stock on these lands. We marvel at their rugged splendor. We are the undeserved but grateful beneficiaries of the colossal bounty and beauty of these lands.
The people of Wyoming — contrary to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s belief — have never treated our public lands as just “national assets” on a balance sheet. We have never wanted these lands to be liquidated to pay for some short-term project like a temporary tax cut or to be transformed into a tiny pyrrhic band-aid on the societal wound that is a lack of housing supply.
These lands are part of the fabric of our Wyoming souls. They are in our blood.
By state law, W.S. § 8-3-123, Wyoming follows the “Code of the West.” I have the code framed on the wall of my office. Among other things, the code reminds us to “Remember that some things are not for sale.”
Our elected officials would do well to remember the code. Cause some things truly are not for sale. Otherwise, us Wyoming folk may have to find and vote for real leaders who represent our interests rather than followers who would sooner sell us and our legacy out in service of someone else’s agenda.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The State Assembly’s Committee on Judiciary held a public hearing Wednesday to discuss a bill which, if passed, would restrict the use of John Doe hearings in cases where prosecutors decline to charge police officers after deadly force incidents. Republicans and law enforcement supporters of the bill (AB-34) said officers need to be protected from repeated investigations, and that anti-police groups have abused Wisconsin’s John Doe law to harass innocent officers who’ve been involved in civilian deaths. A long line of attorneys, legislators, social workers and others spoke in opposition to  the bill, arguing that it adds to an array of legal privileges and protections police already enjoy.
Wisconsin’s John Doe law allows for a judge to be petitioned to review a case where prosecutors have already decided not to file charges. Once a John Doe hearing has been called, the judge may hear arguments from the petitioner as to why probable cause should be found that a crime was committed. If the judge agrees that probable cause does indeed exist, then special prosecutors may be appointed by the judge to review the case. Those prosecutors, however, ultimately decide whether charges will be pursued, regardless of whether a judge finds probable cause of a crime. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Rep. Clint Moses (R-Menomonee), an author of the bill, said the law had been used to “unfairly target” two officers who’ve been involved in deadly incidents. Former Wauwatosa officer Joseph Mensah killed Jay Anderson Jr. in 2016, claiming that Anderson lunged for a gun on the passenger seat of his vehicle. Anderson was the second person Mensah had killed in a year. He was involved in a total of three fatal shootings over his five year career at Wauwatosa PD. Mensah left Wauwatosa PD in late 2020 and was hired by the Waukesha County Sheriffs Department, where he is a detective. 
In 2021, a John Doe hearing was called to review Anderson’s shooting, after which Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Glenn Yamahiro found probable cause existed to charge Mensah with homicide by negligent use of a dangerous weapon. The second John Doe hearing, started in 2023, focused on Madison police officer Matthew Kenney for the 2019 killing of 19-year-old Toney Robinson. A judge declined to allow the hearing to go forward. 
“After the investigations, the court confirmed that he had acted in self-defense,” Moses said of the John Doe hearing in Anderson’s case. Mensah’s John Doe hearing “mirrored” reviews done by the Milwaukee County District Attorney’s Office, U.S. Attorney’s Office, FBI, and Wauwatosa PD, he said. “It’s concerning that such investigations, which echo previous exhaustions, can be perpetuated, consuming significant time and resources,” said Moses. 
While speaking Wednesday, Moses incorrectly referenced Mensah’s 2015 shooting as being the reason for the John Doe hearing in 2021. “Officer Mensah used self-defense to protect himself while on the job in a situation in 2015,” Moses testified on Wednesday. In 2015, Mensah killed 29-year-old Antonio Gonzales while still in his probationary period at Wauwatosa PD. Neither Gonzales, nor Mensah’s third fatal shooting of Alvin Cole in 2020, were the subjects of John Doe hearings.
Last year, when the bill was first introduced, Moses joined Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield) in claiming that families of people killed by police were seeking vengeance against officers. Moses confused details of Mensah’s shootings during those hearings as well. When asked about the mix up, Moses admitted to Wisconsin Examiner that he had not closely followed the Mensah cases. 
  Rep. Clint Moses (Wisconsin Legislature)
As Moses testified on Wednesday, Hutton joined him in the committee room. Hutton, who has brought forward Senate versions of the bill, has said that although he’s taken extensive feedback from law enforcement about the bill, he has not reached out to the families of people killed by police. During a hearing in February, Mensah testified in favor of the bill.
Mark Sette, vice president of the Wisconsin Fraternal Order of Police, said the bill is “crucial” and that law enforcement “have both the duty and right” to use deadly force to protect themselves or others. Sette said that police must make split second decisions in high-stress circumstances, and that deadly use of force incidents “are rare”. Sette praised Wisconsin’s process of conducting reviews of deadly force incidents led by an outside agency, saying that the investigations are thorough. Sette said that repeated investigations prevent officers from moving on with their lives, and trap them in a cycle of psychological trauma and financial stress. 
West Allis Police Chief Patrick Mitchell, a former president and current legislative chair of the Wisconsin Chiefs of Police Association, also praised the investigative process. Mitchell pointed to the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team (MAIT) as an example of how thorough reviews of deadly force incidents by police can be. 
Not everyone was sold on the bill, however. Rep. Andrew Hysell questioned Sette and Mitchell about whether or not it’s possible for a district attorney to make a mistake in clearing an officer of wrongdoing. Sette said although it’s possible, that it’s “incredibly unlikely” because of the thoroughness of deadly force investigations. Hysell said that district attorneys aren’t infallible, and that the bill — if passed — would set in stone a prosecutor’s decision, and deny one legal avenue for families of people killed by police.

After Moses, Sette, and Mitchell came numerous people from a variety of backgrounds voicing opposition to the bill. Gregory Jones, vice president of the Wisconsin NAACP and president of the organization’s Dane County branch, urged lawmakers to dig deep, ask tough questions, and consider all aspects of how the bill could negatively impact civil rights and the pursuit of  justice. 
Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin, stressed that the bill takes away judicial discretion and elevates law enforcement as a privileged class above all other citizens. Merkwae noted that prosecutors and law enforcement have close working relationships, and that district attorneys often rely on the very officers whose actions they’d need to review when citizens are killed. 
The advocacy director also cited investigations by MAIT, citing an investigation by Wisconsin Examiner in partnership with Type Investigations, which reviewed 17 MAIT investigations from 2019-2022, all of which resulted in no charges against officers. Merkwae listed the article’s findings including that officers who kill citizens are interviewed as witnesses or victims only, can refuse to have their interviews recorded, and may amend their statements after viewing video evidence. In several MAIT investigations, officers were not separated from one another to prevent statement contamination despite this being a required policy. 
Mensah and other officers provided contradictory statements and were not separated from one another after his third shooting. These facts were raised during a federal civil trial into Alvin Cole’s death earlier this year. The trial ended in a hung jury, with jurors unable to unanimously agree on whether Mensah’s killing of Cole was excessive.

Merkwae said that last year, Wisconsin had 24 fatal police encounters, up from 14 incidents the prior year. “So by creating a separate standard for police officers, this bill sends the message that they are above the law,” said Merkwae. “Which, I think, is a dangerous precedent that erodes trust and makes community engagement with law enforcement more fraught and less effective.” 
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) also spoke in opposition. Clancy said that he hadn’t planned to speak on the bill, but decided to when he heard Mensah’s name being used. “The idea that an officer who killed three people in three different incidents is a poster boy for why this is good legislation rather than bad is mindblowing to me,” said Clancy. “Joseph Mensah serves as an example of how our current system is failing the people that it is designed to protect. Had Joseph Mensah been held accountable after the first time he shot and killed somebody, he wouldn’t have shot and killed a second and a third person, in three different incidents. And it is sickening to me that he was brought up as an example of how this is necessary because he feels that some folks are mean to him in trying to find some measure of accountability.”
More people rose to speak against the bill after Clancy. Some were social workers and medical staff, who recounted being spat on, punched, kicked, scratched, and hurt yet never once considering criminally charging the person who hurt them. It’s a privilege that police officers have which they do not, the speakers argued. At one point, a Wisconsinite who wished to be identified only as G. Lee attempted to testify while wearing a hat that used an obscenity to criticize President Donald Trump. Committee Chair Ron Tulser (R-Harrison) called the hat offensive and got into an argument with Lee, after which he called for the assistance of the  Capitol Police and called the committee into recess.

When the hearing re-started, G. Lee was allowed to testify on AB-34 while wearing the hat, though he was warned any breaches of decorum would result in him being removed. Lee apologized that the hat “threatened or offended” Tusler, and stated that Tusler reacted from a position of power. Comparing that to the powers police have, Lee said “what scares me about the decorum set in this room, and the measure tied to this bill, is about power.” 
Lee, speaking directly to Tusler, said that when the hearing was stopped because of Tusler’s feelings, “One of my concerns here is that we are privileging the feelings of law enforcement over the feelings of families who’ve actually lost loved ones to bullets. That’s an important thing to consider here. The whole system is set up to protect a particular part of the state power, and you’ve used your state power to make a message.”

Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) addresses the upper chamber on May 7, 2025. (By Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)A Republican legislator is pushing for the state to lay the groundwork for a four-day work week by establishing a pilot project and a tax credit to encourage participation. 
Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford presented a resolve, LD 1865, to the Taxation Committee on Thursday that would establish a pilot project administered by the Maine Department of Labor to “promote, incentivize and support” the use of a four-day work week and study the benefits and effects of the schedule change.
“This proposal is rooted in a simple principle,” Bennett said. “Maine people work hard and they deserve to thrive, not just survive.”
Bennett said his proposal is not about working less but working smarter, but some Republican legislators on the committee were critical of the plan. 
“Working five days a week, that’s part of being an adult,” said Rep. Tracy Quint of Hodgdon. 
Bennett pushed back. “I don’t think part of being an adult is to have to work in a given rigor that was handed to us by what worked in 1938,” he said, adding that when former President Franklin D. Roosevelt ushered in the 40-hour work week about 80 years ago, critics feared economic disaster but instead it helped usher in an era of prosperity.
“I do not want our state policy making to be governed by fear,” Bennett said. 
The pilot project would be voluntary, open to all private and public employers with at least 15 employees, but selection will be up to a process established by the Department of Labor to ensure a wide breadth of participation. 
Research on four-day work weeks is in its early stages, and not all four-day work weeks look the same.
Bennett said he’d like the pilot to involve a reduction in hours per week to 32 hours, eight hours per day, without any loss of pay, employment status or benefits. Other models compress 40 hours into four days.
An international trial of more than 200 companies that switched to a reduced hours workweek like Bennett proposed found improved worker well-being, retention and recruitment, with most companies choosing to continue the model. 
However, other studies identified some negative impacts, including scheduling problems, more intense monitoring measures and a risk of benefits fading over time.
Some private Maine businesses have implemented four-day work weeks, using varying methods, as well as a handful of municipalities, including South Portland, Lewiston and Biddeford.
In order to encourage participation, the resolve would also establish a tax credit against income taxes owed by that employer. 
The specifics of that credit are not outlined in the proposal. Currently, it states that it would be determined by the department and the State Tax Assessor, but constitutionally tax changes must go through the Legislature, so ultimately such a decision would have to come back to lawmakers. 
Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) questioned why a tax credit is necessary if some municipalities and businesses in Maine have already implemented four-day work weeks, but Bennett said Maine-specific data on effectiveness is lacking. The credit would be an incentive to help the state gather that data, and it is not intended to replace the cost of the additional eight-hour work day.
“I want it to be proven out that the productivity gains and the other possible advancements are achievable and aren’t just replaced by state tax dollars,” Bennett said.
Pressed on the cost the tax credit could incur the state by legislators of both parties, Bennett said he would return with specifics for the work session but anticipates it to be modest. 
He is also open to the committee choosing to fund an incentive in another way, noting that he modeled his plan after a similar bill currently being considered in Massachusetts that uses taxpayer dollars. 
“I hope that you don’t reject it on that basis,” he said. 
The duration of the pilot project in Maine would be at least two years but no more than four years, which would be determined by the Department of Labor.
The resolve specifies that participating employers should be diverse in size, industry location and ownership, including those owned by veterans, women, minorities and people with disabilities. Those participating should also have both employees who are exempt from and subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. 
No one testified for or against the measure on Thursday, but Patrick Woodcock, president and CEO of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, spoke neither for nor against. Woodcock said, if the resolve does pass, the chamber would want to partner with the Department of Labor to make the pilot as effective as possible, noting that it would be helpful to gather data about how a four-day work week would work for salaried versus hourly employees. 
“I think ultimately, for something like this to be successful, you do need the executive buy-in,” Woodcock said. “If this does have a trend of being utilized as a best practice, I think Maine does need to be at the forefront of consideration of this model.”
The department would be required to report annually to the Legislature on the progress and participation levels for the duration of the pilot project and then submit a final report.  
The report would assess the economic and social effect of a four-day workweek on the participating employers and the effect on the wellbeing of participating employees, as well as include recommendations. 
However, throughout the pilot, participating employers must provide the department access to employer data and participating employees including through interviews and surveys on a regular basis, though employees can opt out of those inquiries and any data gathered must be anonymized. 
The State Tax Assessor would also be required to submit an annual report on the tax credit.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)The effects of climate change made severe flooding that inundated West Tennessee and parts of the Central Mississippi River Valley in early April about 9% more intense, according to an analysis published Thursday by an international team of environmental researchers.
From April 3 through April 6, thunderstorms and torrential downpours hovered over a broad swath of the Mississippi River Valley, leading to near-record breaking floods, widespread damage and at least 15 deaths.
Those four days of rainfall are the heaviest recorded for the region in spring since 1950, according to the report published by World Weather Attribution, an international collaboration that analyzes the potential influence of climate change on extreme weather events.

The study used observational data, historical records and climate models to examine how warming temperatures impact storm likelihood and intensity. Researchers also used nonprofit Climate Central’s Ocean Climate Shift Index tool — based on observations and climate model data — to analyze sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico where much of the moisture fueling the storm originated, said Ben Clarke, a researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London. 
Researchers compared how this type of weather event has changed between today’s climate — about 1.3 degrees Celsius hotter due to warming caused by use of fossil fuels and deforestation — compared to a cooler, pre-industrial climate (1850-1900).
“When we combine the evidence, we do find an overall increasing trend in such extremes,” Clarke said. “Similar events have become, we estimate, about 40% more likely, or, equivalently, about 9% more intense.”
Clarke noted that some climate models used in the study showed a more “mixed picture” of the effects of warmer temperatures, meaning the study’s results are “likely a conservative estimate.”
While the methods used in this study are peer-reviewed, the study itself was released in the immediate aftermath of the severe weather event and has not yet been peer-reviewed itself, Clarke said.
Early warnings likely saved lives, researchers say
Over four days in early April, eight states saw “relentless amounts of rain” ranging from six to 12 inches, with some locations exceeding 16 inches, Climate Central Weather and Climate Engagement Specialist Shel Winkley said.
The rain fell on soil that was already saturated from late-winter rain, particularly in the Ohio River Valley, he said. 
In Northwest Tennessee, the small town of Rives suffered severe flooding in February, only to flood again a few weeks later.

Winkley said a ridge of high pressure over the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida blocked the low pressure system producing the storm from pushing forward, essentially stalling the storm front to dump rainfall over the already-saturated ground.
Early warnings from the National Weather Service very likely saved lives, Bernadette Woods-Placky, Climate Central’s chief meteorologist, said.
In Obion County, Tennessee, more than 100 families evacuated their homes during the event. Nearby Dyer County issued a mandatory evacuation for residents of Bogota on April 7 in anticipation of additional flooding.
Woods-Placky noted that layoffs and firings were beginning to roll out in National Weather Service offices across the U.S. as part of cost-cutting measures under the Trump administration around the time these floods were happening.
“This is an example of how critical these employees are and why recent workforce cuts risk undermining their ability to keep people safe and prepared,” she said.
Winkley said post-storm analyses like this are vital for protecting public safety in future events.
“It helps us really understand, is this going to be a place that’s livable in the future, and if it is, how do we make sure that it’s livable and safe?” he said.
Study: ‘Generational’ storms could become more likely
The 96-hour rain event was the second-highest on record for the Obion, Forked Deer and Loosahatchie Rivers (all Mississippi River tributaries), according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Dyersburg, Tennessee — the county seat of Dyer County — is prone to flooding from the North Fork of the Forked Deer River. 
Early April’s flooding marked the third-highest flood in the town’s history, according to Mayor John Holden, who has held the position for 19 years.
The worst flood in Dyersburg’s history occurred in 2010, wiping out multiple homes and trailer parks. The second-highest flood record was set in 1937.

Historical data indicates downpours like this are “expected to occur, on average, about once a century in today’s climate with 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming,” the report states.
Before the storms rolled in, the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center warned the public of “generational” rainfall totals.
But the study’s authors caution that further warming could increase the likelihood that these events will no longer be expected just once in a generation.
“If warming reaches 2.6 degrees Celsius (4.7 degrees Fahrenheit), which is expected by 2100 under current policies, four-day spells of rainfall are expected to become a further 7% more intense and twice as likely,” according to a study summary.
“This is a good moment to remember that we are a water planet, and a warmer atmosphere forces more evaporation, so our atmosphere in general has more water to come down whenever there’s a trigger, wherever there’s a trigger,” Woods-Placky said. “So that’s why we’re seeing an overall increase in heavy rain events, even to places that may not be getting wetter. The distribution of how they’re getting rain is coming in these heavier buckets.”
What does higher intensity mean?
Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas were hardest hit by the early April storms, and each state requested a major disaster declaration to access FEMA assistance.
Damage estimates for public property and recovery in West and Middle Tennessee exceed $26 million, according to post-storm assessments. State and local officials believe this will meet the eligibility threshold for federal public aid. Tennessee has yet to receive a decision from the Trump administration.
The administration approved a major disaster declaration for Kentucky on April 24. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders requested a major disaster declaration to cover the April storms on May 3. Trump denied Sanders’ earlier request for major disaster aid following storms and tornadoes in March.
West Tennessee picks up pieces, awaits FEMA decision after severe storms

The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency estimates around 300 homes and 14 businesses or nonprofits were severely damaged. West Tennessee mayors report hundreds of acres of flooded farmland.
To illustrate the significance of the storm’s 9% higher intensity that the study attributes to climate change, Imperial College London Centre for Environmental Policy Senior Climate Science Lecturer Friederike Otto refers to a separate study on Hurricane Helene.
That study, published by the Grantham Institute of Climate Change and the Environment in 2024, estimated that a roughly 11% increase in wind speed due to climate change accounted for about 44% of the storm’s damage in coastal Florida.
Essentially, Otto said, the increase in intensity by 10% could nearly double the cost of damage. 
“If that hits you (the region) once in a lifetime, I mean … that’s one thing,” Otto said. “But if that hits you twice, and it has the higher impact, that completely changes what … extreme weather can mean for a community.”

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Federal officials announced an ambitious plan Thursday to modernize the nation’s air traffic control system, acting after several recent deadly plane and helicopter crashes ignited public panic and made air safety a sudden priority for the Trump administration.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy outlined plans to replace decades-old technology, build new air traffic control centers and towers, and “supercharge” hiring to erase the current national shortage of more than 3,000 air traffic controllers.
Workers would replace radar, software, hardware, and telecommunications networks, with an eye on reducing outages, improving efficiency, and ensuring safety, Duffy said. The plan also aims to eliminate close calls on runways and in approach airspace by expanding a “surface awareness initiative” to 200 airports.
Duffy likened the current system to a flip-phone, saying it has antiquated telecommunications technology that relies on copper wire instead of fiber-optic cable and air traffic control centers dating back to the 1960s.
“You have to redo it all, simply put,” Duffy said. “We are going to build a brand-new air traffic control system. Full stop … this is the biggest lift, the biggest build that has ever happened in the history of the FAA.”
Duffy announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Washington, D.C., before an audience that included politicians, press, and people who lost loved ones when a plane and Army helicopter collided in January over the Potomac River near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
Sixty passengers, four crewmembers, and three soldiers died in that crash, and investigators revealed more than 15,000 “near-miss” incidents occurred near the airport in the previous four years.
President Donald Trump joined the announcement by phone, referring to ongoing delays and outages at Newark Liberty International Airport as “the flavor of the moment.”
On April 28, a radio and radar outage left air traffic controllers unable to track aircraft or communicate with pilots at Newark airport for 90 seconds.
“That was not a good situation,” Trump said Thursday. “I’m sorry what you’re going through with the terminals, but we’re going to get them fixed up.”
It’s unclear if the proposed improvements will ever happen, as Duffy and Trump had no cost estimate for the plan.
Pressed by reporters, Duffy said administration officials haven’t put a price tag on the plan, although he expects it will cost “billions. Lots of billions.”
“I’m going to leave that to the Congress,” Duffy said.
He added: “Congress has a lot of fights over money. This is one they should not fight over.”
Rep. Sam Graves, R-Missouri, said the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which he chairs, has approved a $12.5 billion “down payment” to get improvements rolling.

Trump said he hopes one company will get “one big, beautiful contract, where it’s, you know, they’re responsible for everything from digging ditches to the most sophisticated stuff. And if you have any ideas as to who makes the best system, we’d love to have it.”
Duffy called the plan a national priority and said it will require “permitting reform” so that whatever companies do the work can bypass regulations that would likely drag improvements out over 10 to 15 years or longer.
Administration officials instead aim to have the work done within three to four years, Duffy said.
The improvements are especially urgent as the skies become more crowded, Duffy added, citing recent upticks in air taxis and delivery drones.
A parade of CEOs from airlines and industry groups took the microphone after Duffy to applaud the plan as long overdue.
“The technology that we use to track our teenagers is more advanced than what we give to our air traffic controllers. That is literally insane. We need to fix that,” said Todd Hopley of the American Association of Airport Executives. “We need better technology. We need better facilities, and we need more controllers. It is as complicated as that and as simple as that. It’s something we can fix, it’s something we should fix, and it’s something we will fix.”
Joanna Geraghty, the CEO of New York-based Jet Blue, acknowledged the families of crash victims in the audience.
“It should not take a tragedy to solve this problem,” she said. “We know air traffic control delays and challenges far, far too well. This has quite literally been our number one priority for decades.”

Jared Polis speaks about a sweeping housing policy that was set to be introduced in the Legislature, in March 2023 at the state Capitol in Denver. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado’s 2025 legislative session, which ended Wednesday, was another mixed bag for those who want to make it easier to build more housing units and solve the state’s affordability crisis.
 
Connecting the news in Colorado to the big picture.

It’s been three years since Gov. Jared Polis embraced the YIMBY movement — short for “Yes In My Back Yard” — and made “More Housing Now” a signature goal of his second term.
Polis’ first big YIMBY priority was an audacious 2023 bill to reform land use policies and require higher-density development across the state, including by abolishing single-family zoning in Colorado’s most populous cities and towns. That proposal landed like a lead balloon in the state Legislature, where it was gradually watered down before being killed entirely in the final days of the 2023 session.
In the wake of the bill’s defeat, proponents have revived parts of it in piecemeal fashion, successfully passing bills last year to require higher-density housing near transit stops, legalize the construction of accessory dwelling units in most circumstances, and prohibit local minimum parking requirements. But resistance to YIMBY policies has remained strong. Skeptical lawmakers have stripped reform legislation of enforcement mechanisms, and local officials in several large Colorado municipalities have signaled they won’t comply with some of the new requirements.

The latest YIMBY disappointment came this week with the defeat of House Bill 25-1169, which would have overridden local zoning codes to presumptively allow faith-based organizations and educational institutions to build multifamily housing developments on their land. The bill, dubbed the “Yes In God’s Back Yard” measure, passed the state House of Representatives in March but stalled in the final days of the legislative session as its sponsors acknowledged it lacked enough votes in the Senate.
The YIGBY bill had a lot in common with other housing bills taken up by the General Assembly in the last few years. Its sponsors included two of the statehouse’s most progressive lawmakers in Sen. Julie Gonzales and Rep. Javier Mabrey, both Denver Democrats. It was backed by a long list of environmental, labor and social justice organizations. It passed the House over opposition from Republicans and a handful of moderate Democrats, and faced hurdles in the Senate, where the business lobby and a larger bloc of centrist lawmakers tend to exert their influence.
This has become a familiar pattern in Colorado politics. But it’s notably at odds with many of the presumptions of an intraparty debate currently flaring up among Democrats and left-leaning commentators at the national level, as they seek a path forward after a stinging defeat in the 2024 election.
A loose affiliation of pundits and politicians, critical of what they see as certain shortcomings of Democratic governance, have sought to articulate an alternative approach under the banner of “abundance.” The buzzword was the title of an October 2024 conference held in Washington, D.C., by influential centrist organizations like the Niskanen Center and the Breakthrough Institute, as well as a best-selling book this year by liberal authors Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson.
Abundance, in short, encompasses what Klein also calls “a liberalism that builds” — more housing to bring down rents and home prices, more industry to create jobs and protect supply chains, more clean energy and transit infrastructure to reduce climate pollution. This vision has resonated with some powerful Democrats: Klein was invited to be a guest at U.S. Senate Democrats’ annual retreat this week, Axios reported, and Polis himself has described his governing philosophy as an effort to bring the “abundance agenda” to Colorado.
Blame for the failure to build, in the abundance crowd’s telling, often falls on what Klein and like-minded pundits have taken to calling simply “the groups” — an epithet of sorts for labor unions, environmental nonprofits and other organizations on the Democratic Party’s progressive left wing. “The groups,” they say, have stood in the way of progress on key issues by saddling Democratic policy initiatives with unpopular ideological goals, or by erecting too many regulatory or procedural barriers via legislation and the courts.
But if three years of battles over housing policy at the Colorado statehouse have proved anything, it’s that “the groups” can be willing, enthusiastic members of the YIMBY coalition, and political obstacles to a drastic increase in housing supply are far more likely to be found on the right and center of the political spectrum than the left.
Beginning with the ambitious 2023 land use bill, virtually every YIMBY-endorsed housing proposal taken up by lawmakers lately has enjoyed the support of a loose network of climate and environmental advocacy groups that includes the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, Conservation Colorado, the Colorado Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, 350 Colorado and others. Other progressive groups focused on economic policy or social justice — 9to5 Colorado, the Bell Policy Center, the Colorado Fiscal Institute, the League of Women Voters, Servicios de la Raza, Together Colorado and many more — have also frequently lobbied for the bills, records show.
The most vocal and consistent opponent of these measures has been the Colorado Municipal League, the organization representing the governments of the state’s 271 cities and towns. In a few cases, influential business groups and local chambers of commerce have supported some of the changes, but in many others they have opposed, sought to amend or taken no position, according to lobbying records.
In floor and committee votes, Republican lawmakers have been nearly unanimously opposed to the most sweeping changes, while skepticism from Democratic moderates has repeatedly resulted in concessions, including the multiple exemptions granted to mountain towns like those represented by state Sen. Dylan Roberts and House Speaker Julie McCluskie.
Though a handful of exceptions and ideological cross-currents may exist, the broad political alignment on these issues could hardly be clearer. As Polis and other advocates for “More Housing Now” continue to pursue that goal, their allies and their opponents are easy to spot — and in Colorado, at least, the abundance crowd seems to have it exactly backwards.

But now, as the Legislature’s powerful budget committee is beginning to work on the budget in earnest, a low-profile plan that never came up in those public hearings aims to turn school vouchers into a statewide entitlement, sucking up all the resources that might otherwise go to public schools and putting Wisconsin on a path to a full–blown budget crisis. 
The plan, contained in two bills that failed in the last legislative session, would stop funding school vouchers through the same mix of state and local funding that supports regular public schools, and instead pay for school vouchers just out of the state’s general fund. 
“It’s certainly something that I personally support. … I’m sure it will be part of the discussion,” Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam), co-chair of the powerful Joint Finance Committee, told Lisa Pugh on Wisconsin Eye when she asked about “decoupling” Wisconsin voucher school funding from the rest of the school finance system.
“Decoupling” would pave the way for a big expansion in taxpayer subsidies for private school tuition. While jettisoning the caps on available funds and enrollment in the current school formula, voucher payments would become an entitlement. The state would be obligated to pay for every eligible student to attend private school. It’s worth noting that most participants in Wisconsin’s voucher programs never attended public school, so what we are talking about is setting up a massive private school system with separate funding alongside the public K-12 school system. That’s more than Wisconsin can afford.
Anne Chapman, research director for the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials (WASBO), has followed the issue closely. “It could come up last-minute, on very short notice,” she warns. 
She worries that Wisconsin is following the same path as other states that have steadily expanded public funding for private schools without accurately assessing what the expansion would cost. In a recent WASBO paper, “The price of parallel systems,” Chapman writes that Wisconsin already ranks third among states with the highest proportion of state education dollars used in private schooling options (9%). The top two states, Florida (22%) and Arizona (12%), she writes, are “cautionary examples.” 
Florida’s universal voucher program will cost the state $3.9 billion this year. The state, which until now has been running budget surpluses, is projecting a $6.9 billion deficit by 2027-28, fueled by the voucher expansion along with tax cuts. Arizona is also facing much bigger than expected costs for its universal voucher program. After projecting it would cost $64 million in 2023-24, the state found that it underestimated the cost of vouchers by more than 650%. The real cost of universal vouchers in Arizona in 2023-24 was  $738 million. The result: a huge budget deficit and significant cuts to public schools.
Wisconsin, which launched the first school voucher program in the nation in Milwaukee 35 ago, has steadily increased both the size and per-pupil expenditures of its system of voucher schools. That’s despite a research consensus that school vouchers have not improved academic outcomes for students and, in fact, have done significant harm.
Testifying recently against a school voucher bill in Texas, University of Michigan professor and school voucher expert Josh Cowen described the “catastrophic” results of vouchers on educational outcomes across the country over the last decade.
‘Horrific’ voucher results
Cowen has been evaluating school vouchers since the 1990s, when the first pilot program in Milwaukee had a measurable, positive impact on the 400 low-income kids who used vouchers to attend traditional private schools. As school vouchers expanded to serve tens of thousands of students and “subprime” operators moved in to take advantage of taxpayer dollars, however, the results took a dramatic downturn. Cowen described the “horrific learning loss” he and other researchers have recorded over the last decade among kids who started in public school and then moved to private school using vouchers. He was used to seeing trends in education that simply didn’t work to improve outcomes, he told the Texas legislators, but “it’s very rare to see something that harmed kids academically.” The worst drops in test scores, he said, came in 2014-15 — the same year that states began taking the programs statewide. He concluded that the smaller programs that had paid close attention to students and offered them a lot of support became something entirely different when vouchers were scaled up. Yet despite the abysmal results, more and more states are moving toward universal voucher systems.
Imagine, Cowen told the Texas legislators, if “30 years ago a vaccine showed some positive effects in clinical trials for a few hundred kids.” Then, when the vaccine was approved and used on thousands of children, “the health effects became negative, even atrocious.”
“No one would say, ‘let’s just hang our hat on the pilot and focus on results from 30 years ago,” Cowen said. But that’s exactly what’s happening with school vouchers. The kids vouchers were originally supposed to help — low-income children in underresourced schools — have suffered the most. 
Studies from research teams in Louisiana, Indiana, Ohio and Washington, D.C., show learning losses for kids who left public school to attend voucher programs that surpassed the learning loss experienced by students in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina or by children across the country from the COVID-19 pandemic, Cowen said.
Instead of helping those struggling students, who often attend the “subprime” schools Cowen discussed, the voucher programs in Wisconsin and other states mostly provide a taxpayer-financed benefit to private school families — 70% of whom have never put their kids in public school.
Anti-government ideologues and school choice lobbyists are selling a faulty product with the rapid expansion of school vouchers.
Part of the scam is the effort to hide the true costs from taxpayers. That’s the part Chapman, the school business expert, is worried about. As school districts struggle with lean budgets, under the current system, at least local taxpayers can see how much they are paying to support the voucher schools in their districts. If the Legislature succeeds in moving the cost of school vouchers into the general statewide budget, that transparency will be lost. And, at the same time, the state will open the door to unlimited spending on vouchers, no matter how expensive the program becomes. 
School choice advocates in Wisconsin have long pushed for “a voucher in every backpack” — or universal eligibility for the private school voucher program.
“Eligibility” doesn’t mean the same thing as “access,” however: In Wisconsin voucher schools have a track record of kicking out students who are disabled, challenging to educate, LGBTQ or for any other reason they deem them a bad fit.
Those students go back to the public schools, whose mission is to serve all students. In contrast, private schools in the voucher system can and do discriminate. Yet, Chapman reports, we are now spending about $629 million for Wisconsin’s four voucher programs, which serve 58,623 students. That’s $54 million more than the $574.8 million we are spending on all 126,830 students with disabilities in Wisconsin, as school districts struggle with the cost of special education. 
Federal tax deduction windfall for voucher schools
As if that weren’t enough, at the federal level, the Educational Choice for Children Act of 2025 (ECCA), currently being considered by Congress, would give a 100% tax deduction on donations to nonprofits known as Scholarship Granting Organizations, which give out private K-12 school vouchers.
Normally, donors to nonprofits can expect a tax deduction of 37 cents on the dollar at most. The 100% tax deduction means financial advisers across the country will push clients, whether they are school choice advocates or not, to give money to voucher schools. Under the bill, contributors would also be allowed to give corporate stock and avoid capital gains tax. “This would allow wealthy ‘donors’ to turn a profit, at taxpayer expense, by acting as middlemen in steering federal funding into private K-12 schools,” the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reports. ITEP estimates that the ECCA would cost the federal government $134 billion in foregone revenue over the next 10 years and would cost states an additional $2.3 billion.
The very least we can do as citizens is to demand accountability and transparency in the state budget process, before we blow all of our money on tax breaks and tuition vouchers for people who don’t need them.

Yet from the beginning, this project has been shrouded in secrecy, half-truths, and outright lies. The supposed economic development we were promised comes at a devastating cost to public health and environmental safety.
The facts are now painfully clear. xAI’s facility is operating with 35 massive methane gas turbines, burning fossil fuels around the clock in the heart of a historically Black, working-class neighborhood already burdened with some of the highest rates of pollution-related illness in the country. These turbines are industrial behemoths, emitting dangerous levels of formaldehyde and nitrogen oxides, which are linked to severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. 
When confronted with concerns over the use of gas turbines, Young falsely stated that 15 turbines were active and that the others were simply stored on-site. But independent thermal imaging done by the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) proved otherwise: 33 turbines were fully operational, releasing pollutants into the air day and night. 
EPA tells South Memphis residents little recourse exists to deal with toxic emissions

This industrial-scale pollution is being generated mere miles from the homes of families who have already lived through decades of environmental neglect and systemic disinvestment. The facility’s location places it in dangerous proximity to the Memphis Sand Aquifer, one of the purest and most vital sources of drinking water in the nation. Our aquifer is already under threat from past industrial activities, and this project only increases the risk of irreversible damage.
At every stage of this process, city officials have treated public concern with contempt and evasion. Public hearings have been scheduled without meaningful outreach, key environmental reports have been kept hidden from public view, and straightforward questions from community members have been met with scripted talking points rather than honest dialogue. The message from City Hall is unmistakable: this project will move forward, no matter what it costs the people of Memphis.
This is an unmistakable act of environmental violence, targeting vulnerable communities that powerful interests believe are too poor, too Black, and too politically marginalized to resist. Southwest Memphis was not chosen by accident. It was chosen because city leaders and corporate executives believed that they could steamroll opposition without consequence.
But they have miscalculated. The people of Memphis are watching, and we are not fooled.
The fight against xAI’s project is about more than just turbines and permits. It’s about the soul of our city. It’s about whether Memphis will continue to allow powerful outsiders — like billionaire Musk — to treat its communities as expendable, or whether we will demand leadership that places the health, dignity and future of its residents above corporate profit.
Memphis deserves better. We deserve leaders who tell us the truth — not after independent investigations force their hand, but from the outset. We deserve a government that places the health of its people and the sanctity of our environment above empty claims of economic progress. We deserve development that empowers communities, uplifts neighborhoods, and protects the environment that sustains us.

City officials must continue to be pressed to disclose all communications, agreements, and impact assessments related to the xAI project. xAI must immediately cease operations until it obtains the proper permits, undergoes a full environmental impact review, and proves that it can operate without jeopardizing the health and safety of Memphians.
Moreover, future projects must not be negotiated behind closed doors with billionaires and developers. They must be driven by community needs, developed transparently, and subjected to rigorous scrutiny. They must center the voices of the people who will be most affected, not exclude them until the damage is already done.
Memphis’ resilience is not in question. But resilience should never be mistaken for consent to exploitation. It does not mean quietly accepting the degradation of our air, our water and our quality of life in exchange for vague promises of “technological innovation” that may never materialize or benefit the communities most at risk.
Memphis has endured too much to be treated as expendable yet again. We must continue to demand accountability, defend our environment and fight for the communities most impacted by these decisions. The future of Memphis must belong to its people — not to outside interests seeking profit at our expense.

Trump’s answer reflects, not ignorance of the solemnity of the oath that he took, but rather the authoritarianism that he is seeking to entrench in the United States, a governing approach that is embodied in a plebiscitary presidency.
The philosophical framework of a plebiscitary presidency toward which Trump is moving, represents the completion of Richard Nixon’s conception of government. The model is not that created by the Framers of the Constitution, nor is it a parliamentary regime.
Trump’s expression of doubt about the binding nature of the Constitution, and his duty to uphold it, cannot be dismissed by his indifference our constitutional system — separation of powers, checks and balances, enumeration of powers — but rather his disdain for it. 
Trump, as we have seen, has usurped fundamental congressional powers — lawmaking, appropriations and appointment, among others —and has unilaterally abolished statutory requirements, defied the U.S. Supreme Court’s order requiring adherence to the commands of due process and engaged in a calculated disparagement of the free press, universities and other bodies committed to free and independent thought. 
Trump has subdued GOP leadership in Congress and party faithful, at his beck and call, are loathe to resist his personality, temperament and judgment. He is in command of the economy, and he has concentrated in his hands, alone, power over foreign and domestic policymaking. At this historic juncture, Trump’s ambitions, moods and perceptions determine acceptable fare for his presidential agenda and the nation.  
Trump’s usurpations are met by stunning silence from members of Idaho’s congressional delegation — U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, as well as U.S. Reps. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher — who refuse to defend the Constitution and their institutional powers. He betrays his oath of office while they betray theirs.  
Trump is engaged in an audacious reconstruction of the Constitution, one grounded in the premises of a plebiscitary presidency, which assumes that democracy is enhanced if the capacity to govern is vested in the White House, undeterred by constitutional restraints. In its glory, it speaks of the investment of the sovereignty of the nation in the chief executive and reflects contempt for the rule of law. As Trump told The Atlantic, “I run the country and the world.”
The plebiscitary presidency is intended,” as political scientist Theodore Lowi observed, “to evoke the powerful imagery of Roman emperors and French authoritarians who governed on the basis of popular adoration, with the masses giving their noisy consent to every course of action.”
Robert Michels’ classic, “Political Parties,” published in 1911, explained the rationale of the “personal dictatorship conferred by the people in accordance with constitutional rules.” By plebiscitary reasoning, “once elected the chosen of the people can no longer be opposed in any way. He personifies the majority and all resistance to his will is anti-democratic. He is, moreover, infallible, for ‘he who is elected by six million votes, carries out the will of the people; he does not betray them.’” 
Imagine how much stronger the president would be if elected by 30 million votes. If the opposition becomes annoying it is for the voters themselves, “we are assured, who demand from the chosen of the people that he should use severe repressive measures, should employ force, should concentrate all authority in his own hands.” The president, having aggrandized the powers of the legislature and judiciary, would become democracy personified.
Trump, it will be recalled, has spoken – repeatedly — in such grandiose terms. Daily, he reminds Americans of his victory in the 2024 presidential election, although baselessly claiming a “landside” victory, for the purpose of swelling his plebiscitary claims and aims. 
In his Meet the Press interview, he shrugged off constitutional limitations, by reiterating that he won the election — “they had their chance” — as if victory confers power beyond authority derived from the Constitution. Of course, the Constitution is the sole source of governmental authority and the president, until constitutional provisions are surrendered or trampled, has a solemn duty to uphold the Constitution.

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois state parks saw more visitors in 2024 than any point in the past 15 years, according to new data from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.

Illinois’ 290 state parks and 56 historic sites recorded more than 41 million visitors last year, which was the most in 15 years, following several significant capital projects to upgrade and improve many of the parks.

Interest in state parks has been growing since the pandemic, IDNR Director Natalie Phelps Finnie said in an interview.

“During COVID, people were stir crazy, shut in, and they once again realized how important nature is to all of us,” Phelps Finnie said.

An aggressive advertising campaign by the state has also helped, she said. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity launched the state’s “Middle of Everything” marketing campaign in 2022, which promotes tourism at the state’s top recreation and cultural attractions in TV commercials, billboards and online advertising.

Starved Rock State Park in LaSalle County topped the list in 2024 with 2.4 million visitors coming to explore the canyons and waterfalls nestled in gorges along the Illinois River in north-central Illinois.

The second-most visited park last year was Illinois Beach State Park, near Zion, with 2 million visitors. IDNR completed a major $73 million project last year to preserve the park from erosion.

“It’s always been a high number of visitors, but certainly the uptick we’ve seen since the beach was restored and since the resort is being invested in once again and remodeled,” Phelps Finnie said.

Beach State Park holds Illinois' only undeveloped stretch of Lake Michigan shoreline, but it’s subject to the ferocious waves of the lake. The conditions have sometimes eroded up to 100 feet of shoreline a year in parts of the park.

To preserve the park’s shoreline, IDNR’s project included building 22 breakwater structures in the lake to decrease the power of the waves hitting the shore. Several of the structures are entirely submerged while others that poke out the surface of the lake are designed to provide nesting for migratory birds.

The project also included extending the public beach further into Lake Michigan. Erosion had diminished the beach to come within feet of the parking lot and hotel at the park.

The state also announced earlier this year it will put $60 million toward deferred maintenance projects. More than half of that will go to Starved Rock for trail improvements, facility renovations and building a new wastewater system.

The department is also working on adding electric vehicle chargers at state parks and renovating the Old State Capitol in Springfield.

This summer, IDNR plans to restore and upgrade the Crenshaw House in Gallatin County to include a visitor center at a location on the reverse underground railroad, where slaves were held. According to IDNR, John Crenshaw used slaves at his southern Illinois home where he manufactured salt. Crenshaw is also believed to have kidnapped freed or escaped slaves to sell them back to slavery in the South.

“We’re excited that the investment is being made and these parks are getting the attention they deserve,” Phelps Finnie said.

Lincoln’s New Salem Historic Site in Peterburg, where the 16th president lived in his 20s, was the state’s most visited historic site last year with 360,000 visitors. The site is in line for funding to repair aging buildings.

IDNR announced in March it will invest $8 million to repair up to 23 replica log buildings at the site that depict how the village looked when Lincoln lived there in the 1830s.

""You have things fall into disrepair and then it dominoes,” Phelps Finnie said. “It builds. So what was once maybe $100 million or so is now a little over $1 billion worth of deferred maintenance” across IDNR’s properties.

Debate over that decision has probably overshadowed other efforts to replenish our coast.
Episode 5 of “The Light Switch” dives headfirst into the conflict with Illuminator reporter Elise Plunk, our Report for American corps member who’s focused on all things water related. She’s taken an up-close look at ongoing wetlands rebuilding and spent a lot of time looking into the science behind coastal restoration. We’ll talk about her recent reporting (see story links below).
 
For our “Swamp Spotlight” segment, Elise interview Tulane University professor Ehab Meselhe, one of the foremost authorities on coastal restoration. He weighs in on the stalled Mid-Barataria diversion, the science behind the project and other wetlands work.
In our “News From the States” segment, we learn about why Rhode Island leaders felt the need to revise their rules on harvesting road kill. Yes, we think that feels like a “very Louisiana” thing, too.

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)In the 30 days after several damaging twisters hit Arkansas on March 14, the state saw nearly four times as many tornado warnings as Texas did.
The National Weather Service issued 144 warnings in Arkansas, compared to 39 in Texas from March 14 to April 14. Mississippi also recorded 144 warnings over the same period and Tennessee saw 125 warnings. Alabama noted 57 warnings. 
It’s an indication that the classic “Tornado Alley” region — the area from central Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, so named because of the number of tornadoes there — is shifting eastward.
The shift is attributed to climate change, the warming of the Gulf of Mexico’s waters and a dip in the cold jet stream pattern.
Arkansas, scientists say, is nearly in the bull’s eye of a new tornado-prone area that’s referred to as “Dixie Alley.”  The region, which has seen a vast increase in tornadoes over the past several years, also encompasses Mississippi, Alabama and western Tennessee.
Weather Service survey teams have already confirmed 35 tornadoes have touched down in Arkansas through April. The state averages 42 twisters per year.
The storms have also been larger.  Arkansas was hit with two EF-4 twisters on March 14 — one in Jackson County and one in Izard County
The last time a tornado of that strength hit the state was on April 27, 2014, when a tornado cut a 41-mile path of destruction through western Pulaski County, Mayflower and Vilonia in Faulkner County, and on into White County. Sixteen people died in that storm.
Victor Gensini, a professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, conducted research about the shift, authoring a paper in 2018 that noted the change. Since then, he’s continued to monitor the trend and says the trend is ongoing.
“It’s still more prevalent in the southeast,” he said. “And we’re seeing more evidence of that each year.”
 ‘Drying up’

Gensini tracked tornado reports from 1979 to 2018 for his initial study, but also noted atmospheric conditions in the areas at the time that were favorable for the formation of tornadoes.
Gensini blames a combination of weather phenomenon for the increase in Arkansas’ tornadoes. A drought in the southwest is taking away needed moisture for the formation of twisters in the traditional Tornado Alley region.
More than 67% of Arizona is experiencing “extreme” and “exceptional” drought conditions — the two highest levels of drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The Drought Monitor is based at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln and records weather conditions and patterns weekly.
Three months ago, only 17% of Arizona was under the same two drought conditions. A year ago, the state was considered free from extreme and exceptional drought.
New Mexico, Texas and Utah have also seen increases in drought in their respective states. Thirty percent of Texas is in “extreme” and “exceptional” drought, an increase from 14% three months ago.
“The most intense levels of drought now cover a broad area from southeastern California, southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah through much of Arizona, New Mexico and the Texas Big Bend, said Richard Tinker, a meteorologist with the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, and the author of the latest drought report.
“The southern Great Plains are drying up,” Gensini added.
 Faster rate of change

The dry atmospheric conditions in the southwest create a dome of high pressure over the western U.S., sapping energy from the atmosphere and forcing potential tornado-producing systems to move further east. The jet stream, a strong current of frigid Arctic air, is also dipping further south into the Mississippi delta region because of the Southwestern drought.
Water temperature in the Gulf has also increased on average by one or two degrees, creating the moist, humid air needed for tornadoes.
 “One or two degrees may not seem much. But think of the difference between 32 degrees and 33 degrees,” Gensini said, referring to the temperature when water freezes. “It’s early in the season, and the waters are warmer. That warm, humid air is heading into Arkansas where the air has been unstable already. It makes things more potent.
“We’re seeing weather pattern changes over the last 70 to 80 years that didn’t happen in 100,000 to 120,000 years before,” he said. “There is such a rapid rate of change, and it’s not lessening.”
Of the 144 warnings issued in Arkansas between March 14 and April 14, not all produced tornadoes, said Dennis Cavanaugh, the National Weather Service warning coordinator in North Little Rock.
In fact, the Weather Service strives to keep its “false alarm” rate of tornado warnings to less than 80%. Warnings are issued when Doppler weather radar picks up rotation in clouds, signature “inflow notches” that indicate the building of cyclonic air patterns, hail cores and other indicators.
The Weather Service also must balance the need to warn people while also not unnecessarily alarming them. Issue too many warnings that don’t produce tornadoes, and the public may become complacent and not heed future warnings as seriously.  John Robinson, a former Meteorologist in Charge at the North Little Rock station, used to say that more people were injured in tornadoes while gawking at clouds for confirmation of those tornadoes rather than seeking shelter when warnings were issued.
On the other side, if the Weather Service curtails its warnings and an unwarned tornado does form, results could be devastating.
“Radar can’t see tornadoes,” Cavanaugh said. “It can see circulation aloft when it’s likely a tornado is forming. If we wait to see the debris cloud from a tornado that’s on the ground to issue a warning, it’s much too late.”

 More hail

Cavanaugh said continued advances in technology should help the Weather Service lower its rate of false alarms. But the service will always rely on trained storm spotters who can see the lowering of wall clouds — a first step in the formation of tornadoes — and any circulation of clouds overhead.
“That’s really not applicable to this year,” he said of the fear that the scores of warnings issued may eventually be ignored. “I don’t think the average Arkansan thought he or she was not warned unnecessarily.”
During a round of storms one April evening, Ryan Vaughn, the meteorologist for KAIT8 in Jonesboro, was broadcasting live storm coverage. At one point, most of northeast Arkansas was placed under a myriad of tornado warnings.
Vaughn took a deep sigh on air. 
“I don’t think I’ve ever said this before, but if you’re anywhere in northeast Arkansas, take cover now,” he told viewers.
Tornadoes are formed by opposing winds at various levels. Strong winds in opposite directions cause a shear and a horizontal column of air circulating overhead. Warm, humid air feeds the twister and eventually the column of air begins tilting vertically and lowering to become a destructive tornado.
And if the increase in tornadoes in Arkansas and the Delta is not enough, Gensini said the ingredients for twister formation should also cause larger hail storms.
Hail is formed inside supercell thunderstorms. The rising air inside a building storm lofts raindrops into freezing air. It causes hail, which falls to the ground. Many times, a frozen raindrop falls in the size of a pea or gravel. But with more convection inside the stronger storms, that pea-sized bit of hail is lofted over and over again inside the system, growing larger as more water freezes on it.
That’s what causes the golf ball- and baseball-sized hail and are indicative of stronger storms and tornadoes.
Gensini is about to embark on a 40-day field study this summer of hail storms.
“Tornadoes get all the attention on the news because of the visual destruction,” he said. “You see a path of destruction with shattered homes. But hail is much worse overall.  It damages roofs, cars and agriculture in a much larger area.
“I think the south and southeast will see a lot more problems in the years coming,” he said.

Patrick Morrisey has signed lawmakers’ key foster care measure into law – an omnibus bill that folded together several pieces of legislation. It includes creating a team to review the death of a foster child that occurred while in state care.,"The West Virginia State Capitol (West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey has signed lawmakers’ key foster care measure into law – an omnibus bill that folded together several pieces of legislation. It includes creating a team to review the death of a foster child that occurred while in state care.
The Republican governor opted to veto other child welfare-related items, including a bill that would have provided pay raises for attorneys representing foster children. He also slashed lawmakers’ funding for a nonprofit that helps foster kids. 
Lawmakers came into the 60-day session saying they must address widespread issues in the state’s troubled foster care system that is serving more than 6,000 children with a shortage of social workers, support services and safe homes for children. Too many children have ended up living in hotel rooms, and the state spent $70 million last year sending foster kids to out-of-state group homes. And, for years, the state hasn’t wanted to answer questions about what’s happening to kids in the child welfare system.
While many of the proposed bills – including one mandating an outside review of the foster system – never made it up for a vote by deadline, lawmakers behind the successful foster care measure say it’s a step in the right direction. 
Foster care is a “glaring area of need in state government,” said Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason, who is a foster parent. 
  Del. Jonathan Pinson, R-Mason
“We made it clear that we are willing and committed to taking action … We’ve tried over the course of several years to identify areas that need attention and need work, and many of those areas got touched by [House Bill] 2880,” he continued. “There’s always work to be done, but when you look at the measure that we did get passed … I’m pleased with where we’re at.”
Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, called it the “most important bill of the session.”
  Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell
“For all the praying we do in the Senate, these are the least among us. These are the most vulnerable people,” he said. “There was a lot of bipartisan work that went into this … It’s a really thoughtful bill. It’s going to help kids.”
But, more should have been done, he emphasized.
“This bill would hit like 20% of what we could have done during the session,” he said. “This is just a screaming issue for the little ones who have no lobbyists.”
During the Legislative Session, a federal judge dismissed a sweeping lawsuit brought by foster children against the state for alleged mistreatment in care. The judge said that the ongoing problems couldn’t be solved by the courts, and the “blame squarely lies with the West Virginia state government.”
 What’s included in the bill

The foster care measure nearly died in the final hours of session last month as Senate and House members struggled to come to an agreement on what it should contain. 
Woelfel told lawmakers in a conference committee hashing out the bill that they couldn’t let the session’s only foster care measure die. Lawmakers eventually agreed to remove a part of the bill that would have regulated in-state behavioral programs for children, and said they’d work on that part in a separate bill for next year.  
House Bill 2880 in its final form folds together several different foster care measures from this session, including mandating that parent resource navigators, who help parents who are seeking to reunify with their children, be included in key meetings about the child’s case. Parent resource navigators are established through the court system. 
West Virginia terminates parental rights at twice the rate of any other state. 
“It’s always about reunification with biological mom and dad, but they don’t always get a lot of resources through navigating the complex system,” explained Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, who sponsored the bill. Burkhammer is a foster parent. 
  Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis
The measure also created a Critical Incident Review Team that will review a fatality or near fatality of a child in the custody of the state Department of Human Services. The team must meet within 45 days of the fatality or near fatality to conduct the review and share a report with lawmakers and online. 
“I think probably the best part of the bill is the Critical Incident Review Team and being able to put an additional set of eyes on these fatalities and near fatalities,” Pinson said, adding the goal is to help prevent future incidents. “Being able to bring in additional resources to address our response to these very serious situations is demanded.”
The bill also included some new requirements for the state’s online Child Welfare Dashboard, including additional information about the state’s Child Protective Service workforce. 
Angelica Hightower, communications specialist for the Department of Human Services, said that the agency didn’t have any concerns with the bill. 
“We recognize the intent of this legislation to strengthen the delivery and oversight of services within our child welfare system and broader human services framework,” she wrote in an email. “As we move toward implementation, the department is committed to working collaboratively to ensure that the measures outlined in the bill are carried out effectively and in alignment with the needs of West Virginia’s children and families.”
Lawmakers also revised childhood immunization rules for foster families in a bundle of rules changes, Burkhammer said. Foster parents will no longer be required to provide the vaccination records of their biological children as an eligibility condition to open their home to a foster child. 
Both Burkhammer and Pinson said lawmakers’ failure to fix ongoing issues with the state’s voucher system, which provides money for their foster kids’ clothes and other items, was the biggest failure in foster care reform this session. 
The current voucher system limits spending to only certain stores and regularly results in foster parents and kinship caregivers spending their own money to pay for clothes, beds, car seats and more. 
“When parents are willing to step up and put themselves out there for foster children, we’ve got to make sure that as a state we can provide the resources that they need,” Pinson said.
 Morrisey vetoes pay raise for guardian ad litems amid shortage 

Morrisey vetoed House Bill 2351, sponsored by Burkhammer, which would have given public defenders and guardian ad litems a pay raise of an additional $10 per hour for in- and out-of-court work. 
The state has a shortage of guardian ad litems, which are required in child welfare cases and represent the best interests of the child. The shortfall has led to cases often lingering in the court system while children await permanency. 
In his veto message, Morrisey said he was “sympathetic to the intent of this bill” but noted that lawmakers had reduced his proposed funding amount for the Public Defender Services.
“I want West Virginia to be a national model for fiscal responsibility, and this bill fails to meet that objective,” Morrisey wrote. “The math does not add up. The Legislature did not fully fund this line item for the ensuing fiscal year, which necessitates the veto of this bill.”
Burkhammer emphasized that the shortage of guardian ad litems has led to “low quality of services.” 
“Ulimateily, the child’s best interest is not getting the attention it deserves,” he said.
Morrisey also cut 75% of lawmakers’ allocated funding to West Virginia’s Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, a program that helps foster children in the court system, before signing the budget bill. 
In his veto message, the governor said the program relies on grants and could seek additional grant funding.  
Woelfel believes that despite the vetoes, Morrisey is committed to foster care reform. 
“I’m taking him at his word,” he said. “I think it has got to be a team effort.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/capitol.jpg,,,2025-05-09 06:00:38.136259

In[...]","The NIOSH Coal Worker’s Health Surveillance Program offered periodic black lung screenings at no cost to coal miners in the U.S. (NIOSH photo)
As the federal government moves forward with a “reorganization” that has left the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) largely unstaffed, attorneys for West Virginia coal miners are asking a federal judge to issue a preliminary injunction to keep the program running and grant miners a protection against developing dangerous black lung disease.
In a hearing Wednesday, attorneys for the coal miners argued that the shutdown of the CWHSP — which operates within the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health — means the government is not meeting its legal obligation to coal miners or others as the work the agency is statutorily required to do is no longer being performed.
Attorneys for the federal government argued that the closure of the CWHSP — as well as other departments within NIOSH — is temporary.
Workers were notified that they were to be on administrative leave on April 1. Last week, some were told to return to work. But this week they were once again moved back to leave and permanent terminations are slated to take place come June.
NIOSH as well as the services performed in it, attorneys for the government said, will eventually return in a reorganized form under the federal Department of Health and Human Services. As such, they contended that the lawsuit on behalf of coal miners was premature.
Those testifying during Wednesday’s hearing in front of U.S. District Judge Irene Berger included coal miners, epidemiologists from the CWHSP and supervisors from within NIOSH.
Coal miners could pay for savings if inspectors lose offices on DOGE list, advocates warn

No one, including the attorneys representing the federal government, provided details or a timeline for when the agency would resume the duties it is required by law to perform.
Laura Reynolds, a supervisor over the CWHSP, was asked if she was aware of any plans or discussions happening to transfer the agency’s services to DHHS.
Her response was one word: “No.”
Scott Laney, who worked as an epidemiologist at NIOSH, said the community of researchers and providers qualified to do the work done by those at the CWHSP is quite small. He hasn’t heard of anyone being asked to do it and has not been included in any plans to train others.
“There is nobody who does the surveillance and breadth of what we do at NIOSH [for black lung],” Laney said.
 Without plan to resume services, coal miners left exposed to dangerous dust

Meanwhile, coal miners who have been diagnosed with black lung — including Harry Wiley, a coal miner in Raleigh County who is the lead plaintiff on the class action suit — are in a dangerous position.
NIOSH plays a critical role in the Part 90 program, which allows workers diagnosed with black lung to transfer to a less dusty part of a mine without facing retribution or negative repercussions from a mine operator. Miners transferred under the rule have their pay, benefits and hours protected while being able to work in an area that is less likely to advance their black lung disease.
In order to qualify for Part 90, miners anywhere must have their black lung testing results evaluated and marked eligible by a NIOSH worker in order to be approved.
But now there are no NIOSH workers. Laney said labs certified to test miners for black lung were instructed to stop in April since there was no one at the CWHSP to evaluate the results.
This leaves Wiley, who was diagnosed with black lung in November and who applied for a transfer under Part 90, without any options to protect himself from the dangerous disease advancing.
Trump calls for more coal as his administration delays new black lung protection for miners

And the disease will advance, said Noemi Hall, another NIOSH epidemiologist.
The best protection to stop the progression of black lung — which has no cure and few treatment options — is prevention and reducing any exposure to coal mine dust, Laney said.
“We know that this intervention [of transferring workers to less dusty areas] works from the science,” Laney said. “[It’s] very clear in the scientific research.”
Debbie Johnson, the black lung program director at Bluestone Health in Princeton, told the court she knows of at least four coal miners from her clinic who are depending on the CWHSP to resume services.
Two have already entered their applications for a Part 90 transfer and two others need their results evaluated and certified.
None have heard from NIOSH.
Anita Wolfe, who retired from NIOSH in 2020 but still worked for the agency on a contract basis, said the CWHSP could see more than 5,000 x-rays a year that need to be evaluated. That’s 5,000 workers who could be at risk of developing a complicated and severe form of black lung disease without intervention.
 Freeze on CWHSP occurs while silica dust rule under threat

While the federal government says its sorting out what a “reorganization” of NIOSH and the CWHSP will look like, it has also delayed the implementation of a federal labor rule that would have limited miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust for the first time ever.
That rule was meant to go into effect in April. It’s been delayed until August, however, partially due to the shakeups at NIOSH and the critical role workers there would have played in its implementation.
Sam Petsonk, a labor attorney representing the miners in their lawsuit against the federal government, said in an interview after Wednesday’s hearing that without the silica rule and without Part 90 transfers, miners are left with little to nothing to protect themselves.
“West Virginia coal miners fought to create these programs because workers here walked off the job, picketed and demanded protections for themselves and miners throughout the world,” Petsonk said. “This whole program was created to protect our miners. And now the government isn’t doing its part.”
Meanwhile, more than just the response actions NIOSH is mandated to perform are going undone. The agency was also responsible for critical research to aid in identifying and preventing black lung in miners.
That’s especially important today in central Appalachia, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of the region’s coal miners are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
“We’re seeing a lot of younger miners who are at that point [of needing a Part 90 transfer],” Johnson told the court Wednesday.
Before being told not to come to work in April, Hall was researching cases of black lung where individuals did not show symptoms but were developing the disease. Hall hoped that research could go toward working with miners to get tested early and frequently throughout their careers in order to stop symptoms from onsetting.
Now, she said, that work has been dropped and she doesn’t expect it to pick back up again.
While on the stand Wednesday, both Hall and Laney were asked two questions by Mike Becher, an attorney from Appalachian Mountain Advocates who is representing the coal miners.
“Do you feel through your work you’ve made a difference in the lives of coal miners?” Becher asked.
“I know that to be the case because of the scientific evidence,” Laney responded.
“Yes,” said Hall.
“Do you feel you’ve saved miners’ lives?” Becher asked.
“I do,” Laney said.
“Yes,” responded Hall.
The class action lawsuit against the federal government was filed on behalf of miners by Appalachian Mountain Advocates, Mountain State Justice and Petsonk PLLC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of West Virginia on April 21, 2025.
On Wednesday, Judge Berger said she would have a response to the plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction to order NIOSH to resume its work “soon.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The House voted under the hammer to advance an emergency measure (LD 1948) that would make the funding in the two-year budget for MaineCare available more immediately (more on that here). The body first voted 69-63 to suspend the rules to bypass the committee process, which will also require Senate approval. Also, for an emergency to pass, it will ultimately require support of two-thirds of both chambers. There will be more on that to come.
Other votes of note: 
Both chambers passed a bill (LD 814) under the hammer that would provide $9.75 million for the next two fiscal years to fund area agencies on aging for community-based services and programs.
Senators voted 22-11 and the House 106-32 to reject legislation (LD 512) that would allow a student whose parent lives in a district with a secondary school with 200 or fewer students to enroll in another school. Sponsor Rep. Stacey Guerin (R-Penobscot) said it would ensure all students, particularly those in more rural areas, have access to educational opportunities. However, Education Committee chair Sen. Joe Rafferty (D-York) said only 17 secondary schools would meet this criteria and said high schools already have a variety of local partnerships, including early college programs, to expand opportunities for students. He argued this approach would destabilize local school districts with the potential loss of funding.
Legislators also rejected (18-15 in the Senate; 74-66 in the House) an emergency proposal (LD 389) from Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) to establish a COVID-19 review commission to evaluate the state’s response to the pandemic. Stewart said he was disappointed the bill fell along party lines and argued it would increase transparency and future preparedness. However, Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York) said while on the surface it’s a good idea, he noted the make-up of the commission would be legislators, not public health experts, and said in other states where such studies occurred they devolved into “political theater.” He said a better avenue is a directive to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a multi-departmental evaluation. 
Both chambers passed without roll call votes emergency legislation (LD 1061) to provide ongoing annual General Fund appropriations of about $1.6 million to the DHHS to provide community support for families and child abuse prevention services statewide.
The Senate voted 21-12 and the House 73-65 for LD 783, which would provide ongoing funds of $190,000 each fiscal year to the Maine Multicultural Center in Bangor for one or more positions to establish a comprehensive program for foreign-trained workers. During the House debate, proponents characterized the measure as a workforce bill. However, Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls) said allocating this funding while neglecting the needs of our “longtime residents” could send the wrong message. 
After passing the Senate under the hammer, the House voted 103-36 to enact LD 461, which would provide funding to the Department of Public Safety for four Maine State Trooper positions to patrol Washington County. While some lawmakers argued the bill was not necessary, given the passage of another bill (LD 477) to add 15 new state trooper positions, others said there is particular need in Washington County. House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) said as a border county, increasing patrol is not only vital to the protection of the county but it would help stop the spread of drugs into the state.
After failing to pass the House, senators voted 18-15 to reject a bill (LD 513) that would allow the spouse of a school board member to serve as a stipend employee within the school board’s jurisdiction.
Both chambers voted under the hammer to back (LD 224), which updates the definition of “terrorism” in the laws governing the Maine Emergency Management Agency to include acts against non-physical infrastructure, including information and telecommunications technology infrastructure, systems or services or critical infrastructure.
Both chambers rejected a bill (LD 1401) to repeal the laws requiring motor vehicle liability coverage for the towing and storage charges incurred as a result of an accident if the vehicle is towed at the request of a law enforcement officer. Supporters of the bill took issue with how the law requires people to buy towing insurance but Rep. Kristi Mathieson (D-Kittery) argued the law is new and the Legislature should wait for more data before repealing it.
More than two-thirds of both chambers backed an emergency provision (LD 489) that provides that the holder of a commercial halibut fishing license may only fish using the vessel named on the license unless the license holder requests authorization from the Commissioner of Marine Resources to use another vessel when theirs is temporarily inoperable.
The House and Senate are at odds over legislation (LD 792) to provide one-time funding of $300,000 to the Christine B. Foundation to support a research project to evaluate the impact of access to specific dietary services on cancer patients. The House backed the committee recommendation against the bill but after several senators argued in favor of the program, they voted for the bill’s passage. The legislation will now go back to the House to reconsider.
Some of the other bills that passed both chambers under the hammer: 

“An Act to Ensure Rent-to-own Protections Apply to Mobile Home Park Tenants” (LD 1183)
“An Act to Enhance Protections Regarding Invasive Aquatic Plant Infestations in Inland Waters of the State” (LD 171)
“Resolve, Establishing the Commission to Study Unregulated Storm Water Pollution (EMERGENCY)” (LD 646) 
“An Act to Require Reporting on the Expenditure of Opioid Settlement Funds by Certain Municipalities and County Governments” (LD 110)
“An Act to Support Municipal Public Health” (LD 650) 
“An Act Regarding the Establishment of Fees and Fee Caps for Dental Provider Licensing and Permits” (LD 448)
“An Act to Amend the Laws Governing the Powers and Responsibilities of the Maine Redevelopment Land Bank Authority” (LD 945)
“An Act to Reinvigorate Maine’s Workforce and Ensure Student Job Readiness by Providing Funds for the Career Exploration Program” (LD 967)
“An Act to Amend the Motor Vehicle Laws”(LD 850)
“An Act Regarding the Confidentiality of Certain Lottery Winner Identities” (LD 404)
“An Act to Employ Mental Health Personnel Within the Maine State Police” (LD 298)

Senate action
The Senate passed without a roll call an amended bill (LD 795) that would establish a waiver process from the permit requirements for the use of explosives in recreational or hobby mining activities.
The chamber also unanimously backed legislation (LD 693) to establish three office specialist positions in the Department of the Secretary of State’s bureau of corporations, elections and commissions.
These are some of the other bills the Senate passed under the hammer this week:

“An Act Regarding Confidential Information Gathered for Forest Fire Emergency Response and Planning” (LD 379)
“Resolve, to Establish the Committee to Study the Use of Sunflower Crops to Produce Biofuels” (LD 1297)
“An Act Regarding School Enrollment for Military-connected Students” (LD 31)
“Resolve, to Create a Working Group to Study the Safety and Use of Nonconforming Vehicles on Maine’s Roads and Highways” (LD 1209)
“An Act to Authorize the Display of an Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal Decal on a Special Veterans License Plate and Authorize Certain Other Service Members to Receive Special Commemorative Decals” (LD 1315)
“Resolve, to Require the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendations of the Lower Road Rail Use Advisory Council” (LD 29)
“Resolve, to Direct the Department of Transportation to Implement the Recommendations of the Portland to Auburn Rail Use Advisory Council” (LD 30)
“An Act to Amend the Law Governing Zoning Ordinance Variances for Persons with Permanent Disabilities” (LD 907) 
“An Act to Protect the Confidentiality of Information of Individual Customers of a Public Utility” (LD 251)
“An Act to Create a Limited Retail Seafood Harvester Certificate” (LD 144)
“An Act to Amend the Laws Governing Fantasy Contests” (LD 33)
“An Act to Include Judicial Marshals in the 1998 Special Plan for Retirement” (LD 794)

House action
Members of the Maine House voted 76-64 to reject a bill (LD 187) that would prohibit public sector labor unions from imposing mandatory service fees on nonmembers, otherwise known as a “right to work bill.” During debate, supporters said the legislation would put Maine in compliance with a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Opponents of the bill, including Labor Committee co-chair Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), argued the bill is an effort to roll back labor rights.
The House voted 72-68 to pass LD 86, which would update several education laws, including the definition of “homeless student” to match the federal definition and update statutes regarding private schools’ receipt of public funds to reflect the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Carson v. Makin.
House members voted 73-67 to reject legislation (LD 174) that would reinstate nonmedical exemptions for school-required vaccines, six years after that provision was repealed. During the floor debate, Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls) argued that current law requires families to choose between their religious beliefs and an education. However, Rep. Sam Zager (D-Portland), a family physician, argued the law and vaccines in general have helped save children’s lives in “incredible numbers.” A similar bill (LD 727) was killed under the hammer. More on both bills here.
House lawmakers voted 74-67 to back the committee recommendation against LD 189, which would eliminate the requirement for health care facilities to obtain a certificate of need for the provision of mental health and substance use disorder services. Proponents argued this would increase access to much-needed services. Rep. Kristi Mathieson (D-Kittery) said it wouldn’t have an impact on community-based services but would rather pave the way for national for profit hospitals to enter Maine’s market and destabilize our already fragile system. A similar bill (LD 743) was killed under the hammer. (You can read about a similar proposal last session.)
Here are some bills that passed the House under the hammer: 

“An Act to Establish the November General Election Day as a School Holiday Applicable Only to Public School Buildings Used as Voting Places” (LD 53)
“An Act Requiring the State to Pay a Retired State Employee’s or Retired Teacher’s Premium for Medicare Part B Under Medicare Advantage” (LD 328)
“An Act to Raise the Cap on Retirement Benefits for Certain State Employees and Teachers to Which a Cost-of-living Adjustment Is Made” (LD 1040)

Appropriations 
Several bills were also moved to the “appropriations table,” where the budget committee can choose to support the measures with any remaining funds. These included: 

“An Act to Appropriate Funds to the Department of Environmental Protection, Lake Water Quality Restoration and Protection Fund” (LD 296)
“An Act to Provide Funding for Low-income Electric Ratepayer Assistance” (LD 995)
“An Act to Provide Funding for Sexual Assault Services” (LD 117)

Kim Hammer, R-Benton, that would change the citizen-led ballot initiative process Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2025, at the Arkansas Capitol. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Over the course of the recently concluded session of the Arkansas Legislature, the media have reported in bits and pieces on various measures passed by lawmakers that infringe on Arkansans’ rights, target marginalized groups, erode the wall of separation between church and state, limit free speech and squash democratic participation, usually with the stated purpose of solving “problems” that only exist in the minds of Republican legislators.
But if we stop and take a moment to look back on their collective handiwork over the last five months, the destructive scope of these pernicious laws — and the expensive litigation they’re likely to trigger — becomes breathtakingly clear.
Elementary school librarians face possible suspension of their teaching licenses if they don’t lock away books about “sexual ideology,” which is not defined but will almost certainly be aimed at books with LGBTQ themes. Schools will be left to figure out how to comply.
Doctors who provide gender-affirming care to transgender patients could open themselves up to malpractice suits unless they read their patients a lengthy screed about their care that contains information that’s untrue, misleading, or merely misguided opinion sprung from the fevered imagination of Rep. Mary Bentley, R-Perryville, who has made targeting transgender Arkansans her pet cause.
The process for collecting signatures for ballot initiatives will now be so cumbersome, convoluted and arduous that direct democracy — a cherished constitutional guarantee in a state whose motto is “The People Rule” — could be a dead letter for grassroots groups without deep pockets.
Voters who choose to vote by absentee ballot because they find it more convenient will now have to find a witness to sign their ballot paperwork, impacting minority, disabled and elderly voters in a state that already has tragically high rates of ballot rejection — but almost no voter fraud.
Schools and public buildings will have to display a mostly Protestant version of the 10 Commandments, a practice the U.S. Supreme Court forbade 45 years ago. And discrimination against LGBTQ people will be protected by state law if done on religious grounds, including refusing to place kids in adoptive homes with LGBTQ parents.
The state plans to start suffocating death row inmates with nitrogen gas, an experimental execution method that’s cruel and unusual, and will trigger years of litigation. And noncitizens without legal documentation who commit crimes will face harsher criminal penalties than citizens, up to 20 more years in prison with no chance for parole. Never mind that, like U.S. citizens, noncitizens are protected by the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.
As you might expect, this tsunami of ill-conceived nonsense is keeping folks at the Arkansas ACLU busy — sorting through which of these new laws are likely to cause the most immediate harm, working with prospective clients, and preparing litigation to counter unwise and unconstitutional laws that state taxpayers will pay to defend.
“Some people ask us what we do to relax and refresh at the end of the session, and I say, ‘File lawsuits,’” jokes Holly Dickson, the ACLU’s executive director, who likens dealing with legislators on civil liberties issues to “trying to do ballet across quicksand.”
Dickson would not comment on when, or over what, the ACLU might sue, other than to say that “we’ll announce any litigation when it’s filed.” But the Arkansas League of Women Voters has already filed a federal lawsuit to strike down the new restrictions on citizen-led ballot initiatives, calling them an unconstitutional restraint on core political speech.
Some of the baloney Arkansas legislators offered up to feed their base this year may have limited effect because it’s impractical, illogical or will be quickly laughed out of federal court.
For instance, even a cursory reading of the 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision Stone vs. Graham that forbade posting of the 10 Commandments in public schools — or the scathing decision by a federal judge in Louisiana last November invalidating a similar 10 Commandments law — would have shown legislators that this bill would lead directly to a spanking in federal court. Yet, all but two Republican legislators plunged ahead, because, as Dickson puts it,  “they know that voting against the 10 Commandments is going to affect their reelection.”
Likewise, the law that prevents the state from taking action against employers who discriminate against transgender people for religious reasons runs straight into a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court decision — penned by that well-known radical leftist Justice Neil Gorsuch — that the Civil Rights Act precludes employment discrimination based on gender identity.
Another new law allowing people to sue if they — gasp — encounter transgender people in a restroom or changing area in a public facility may be difficult to use because, thankfully, legislators didn’t authorize the genitalia inspections necessary to establish someone’s gender identity in a court of law.
The law expanding malpractice suits against doctors providing gender-affirming care was clearly designed to intimidate them into not treating their patients. Rather than forcing them to give their patients inaccurate information — problematic on First Amendment grounds — it merely entices them to do so by providing a “safe harbor” against lawsuits if they comply.
But Arkansas doctors who provide this care have largely stood up to that pressure by ignoring the “safe harbor” provision in a similar law passed in 2023 targeting gender transition. 
“The game of chicken doesn’t really play well with people who aren’t chicken,” Dickson said.
Unfortunately, legal challenges take time, and some of these ineffectual laws may be hard to challenge because until someone can demonstrate actual harm, it could be difficult to get cases into court.
In addition, so-called facial constitutional challenges, which seek to block laws before they go into effect, also have a high bar — made higher by the Arkansas Supreme Court’s recent supineness in standing up to legislative excess as well as a new law that takes original jurisdiction in these cases away from judges in Pulaski County Circuit Court, who have been willing to say no to legislators.
Perhaps the most disheartening thing about all of this is how unnecessary it is. None of this sound and fury does anything to make the day-to-day lives of ordinary Arkansans easier or better; indeed, it wastes money on litigation that could be better spent on things that would.
And what we’ve seen over the past five months also plays fast and loose with the oath every legislator took when they were sworn into office: “I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Arkansas, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of upon which I am now about to enter.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/protesters-2.11.25-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-09 06:00:38.136259

Expanding the powers and size of the state auditor’s office. Allowing the concealed carry of a handgun without a permit.
These are just a handful of the hundreds of bills under consideration by North Carolina lawmakers this session. This week provided a key checkpoint for which of them have momentum, and which are doomed to stall out.
Thursday marked the General Assembly’s “crossover” deadline — the day by which a bill has to have been passed by either the House or Senate. If it hasn’t, it’s considered dead for the remainder of the legislative biennium — through 2026.
Crossover is far from definitive, though. Budget and tax bills don’t have to meet the deadline. And lawmakers have ways of getting around the deadline — like gutting and replacing an eligible bill with a new policy, or stuffing policy proposals into the state budget.
“Nothing is ever dead around here,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters Wednesday evening after the chamber’s final pre-crossover votes.
Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers, have almost always prioritized their own members’ bills. It’s resulted in frustrations for Democrats, particularly in the Senate, where the party leader says they’ve had almost no input.
“It’s supposed to be lauded that this is the higher chamber,” Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) told reporters Wednesday. “But I feel like we act like we’re at the kids’ table half the time, in middle school, where you don’t want to invite individuals who have equal representation in their districts to the table.”
Both the House and the Senate will likely begin taking up bills from the other chamber in the coming weeks. Lawmakers in the House are also expected to begin active debate and negotiations on the state budget, a version of which has already passed the Senate.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Every meeting of a public board in North Dakota will be required to hold a public comment period during each of its meetings beginning Aug. 1.
Senate Bill 2180, signed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong on April 30, requires local subdivisions, school districts, park districts and water resource boards to give meeting attendees the opportunity to make public comments to the board during their meetings.
The bill states public boards may only limit the comment period based on total time of the comments, the time of each individual speaker to deliver their comments, or both. It would also limit the public comment topics to the current meeting’s agenda items or the preceding meeting’s agenda.
Sen. Jose Castaneda, R-Minot, chair of the bill’s conference committee, said the law sets the minimum standard and boards can choose to be less restrictive on public comments.
North Dakota lawmakers approve needs, some wants with $20.3 billion budget

Castaneda told lawmakers that if someone misses a meeting, they should be able to go to the next meeting and have their concerns be heard by that board.
The bill stems from concerns that public entities were not providing adequate public comment periods during meetings and were limiting comments to only items on the board’s current meeting agenda.
Karen Krenz of Williston, who submitted testimony for the bill, said her local school board was limiting comments that could be made at meetings.
“As taxpayers, we should have the opportunity to contribute our input during public meetings,” Krenz wrote. “When public input is limited, decisions may not fully reflect the needs and priorities of the community, leading to policies that are out of touch with public sentiment.”
The law requires boards to craft public comment policies. The policies may require that comments need to be pertinent to the entity receiving the public comments and may “not interfere with the orderly conduct” of the meeting. Comments may not be “defamatory, abusive, harassing or unlawful,” and may not include confidential information.

Castaneda said the goal of the legislation was to find a good balance between giving time for people to address these public entities and not letting the comments hijack the meeting.
Sen. Chuck Walen, R-New Town, a previous school board member, said limiting the comments to the current and preceding meeting was a good balance, otherwise, “you can get into the weeds really, really fast.”
“I see this as a good compromise to have in here,” Walen said.
Previous versions of the bill would have limited comments to only the current agenda items of the public board meeting and would have required a public comment period be offered at only some of the meetings, or once every three months.

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)In July 2020, just several months into the COVID pandemic, Colorado Public Radio published a remarkable story about how the virus was spreading just as a “brain drain” weakened the state’s public health agency and the governor was turning to outside tech entrepreneurs for help with disease testing.
Relying on public records and more than two dozen interviews with officials and experts, CPR produced one of the most illuminating examples of Colorado journalism on the biggest news story of the era. The coverage had no agenda but the truth, and it enriched all Coloradans’ understanding of how public officials at the top of state government handled their responsibilities.
Such accountability reporting has always posed a threat to tyrants, including the tyrants in power today.
President Donald Trump is trying to undermine National Public Radio — of which CPR is a member station — and the Public Broadcasting Service, falsely accusing them of bias. His real objection is that accurate, independent journalism exposes him to scrutiny.
Like all of the Trump administration’s assaults on institutions — in education, science, health, public welfare — the ultimate victim of his attacks on public media is the public. But, at least in this case, a direct form of resistance is readily available to anyone who values the threatened institutions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Public media is grounded in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit established in 1967 by Congress. Lawmakers at the time thought public media “furthers the general welfare” and should “be responsive to the interest of people both in particular localities and throughout the United States.” The act that created the CPB envisioned TV and radio programs that “address national concerns and solve local problems through community programs and outreach programs.” 
Anticipating political hostility to independent programming, the act was careful to ensure that public media has “protection from extraneous interference and control.”
In 1969, CPB established PBS, which delivers beloved educational, news, cultural and family programming with member stations around the country. Rocky Mountain PBS, based in Denver, is the only statewide television network in Colorado.
The following year, NPR was incorporated. The nonprofit and its local member stations reach more than 95% of Americans. The stations provide invaluable, impartial journalism, and they broadcast emergency alerts and public safety information during disasters. The NPR news programs “Morning Edition” and “All Things Considered,” both carried by Colorado member stations like CPR, are irreplaceable components of many Americans’ daily routines.
These public media sources, which are free for all Americans, have a long public-approving, award-winning tradition of fulfilling the vision Congress articulated for public media almost six decades ago. But Trump has actualized the initial fear that public media would be threatened by interference. On May 1, he issued an executive order calling for CPB funding for NPR and PBS to be canceled.
Loss of federal funding would hurt local stations most. NPR member stations — such as KUNC in Greeley and KRCC in Colorado Springs — typically rely more on direct federal funding than does NPR. CPR gets about 5% of its annual funding from the federal government, while NPR gets about 1%. Direct federal money comprises up to 10% of the budget of some local stations.
“The reality of a loss of federal funding would be to weaken or shutter locally owned independent stations particularly in remote and rural communities,” CPR said in a recent statement.
In case 5% doesn’t sound like a lot, it amounts to about $1.4 million, a loss that CPR, an outlet that laid off 15 staffers just last year, would surely struggle to absorb without a noticeable decline. And the threat runs deep. Public media stations use pooled assets such as satellite networks and emergency alert systems, which could be compromised for CPR and other local stations that benefit from them. Also, NPR gets most of its funding from member stations like CPR, so a loss of direct federal funding for local stations could in turn mean a substantial loss of indirect federal funding for NPR. 
CPR and Rocky Mountain PBS get most of their funding from individual, business and foundation contributions. This suggests an answer to a tyrant’s attacks. There’s little that individuals can do to counter, say, Trump’s efforts to shut down the U.S. Education Department. But individual community members who value trusted institutions like CPR and Rocky Mountain PBS can act as a form of immediate, grassroots countermeasure to MAGA hostility.
That support promotes the general welfare, as Congress intended. CPR is the only outlet in Colorado with a Washington, D.C.-based reporter focused on Colorado issues. For almost 20 years, Colorado governors have regularly sat down with CPR for interviews, which often present insights about state policy that are not available anywhere else. Through voter guides, state Legislature coverage and other useful nonpartisan reporting, the outlet consistently elevates the community life of the state, adhering to the highest professional standards and exemplifying the essence of the First Amendment.
This is what Trump wants Americans to believe is harmful to the country. But a weakened public media in the state would mean a weakened Colorado.

(Photo by Mechelle Hankerson/ Virginia Mercury)Virginia teachers are still flying blind months into a new school year — trying to adapt to overhauled history standards without the full set of instructional guides the state promised to help them navigate the change.
Since early April, the Virginia Department of Education has continued to publish its history instructional guides to help ​​prepare teachers to instruct students in the state’s updated history and social studies standards.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson said at the Board of Education’s March meeting that part of the delay stemmed from staff adding web links to primary and secondary sources in the guides. Since then, the agency has been releasing instructional guides for its history and social science courses on a weekly basis.
The department says the instructional guides provide educators with directions for implementing the recently adopted 2023 History and Social Science Standards of Learning, which replace the 2015 version.
Danyael Graham, president of the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium, said teachers have already begun lesson planning and receiving training on the 2023 standards. Educators have also been required to start integrating the standards into their instruction. However, Graham said, it has been difficult to build effective lessons without the necessary guides that clarify what teachers need to know — particularly in preparation for state assessments.
She explained that the 2015 standards, along with their accompanying curriculum framework, provided detailed expectations for what students were supposed to learn. In contrast, the 2023 standards do not include a curriculum framework and instead rely on instructional guides, which teachers are still waiting on to fully adjust their lessons.
As a result, Graham noted that teachers will likely spend unplanned time over summer break or in August reviewing the complex documents and modifying their lesson plans.
“They’re unsure what resources to turn to,” Graham said, “And while it’s great that (VDOE) is putting these links in here (and) is going to be supportive for teachers, it’s very late.”
Graham also worries the delay will also negatively affect elementary teachers who are already juggling other state curriculum changes in math and literacy.
Publishing the documents “earlier” would have been ideal, she said. However, “I at least do appreciate that they’re sticking to their timeline.”
In the meantime, Graham said the consortium is gradually releasing its own document to help teachers craft lesson plans and connect the instructional guides. She said the organization believes it’s important to support educators of all experience levels by offering teacher-facing lessons — educational content and activities designed to enhance their instruction during a time of major transition. 
“We know they’re overwhelmed, we know they’re burnt out, or we know they’re entirely new to the field and need direction,” Graham said. “So we thought that by building out these inquiry-based tasks, we’re providing them with some high-quality instructional materials that they can then use and plug into their classes.” 
In March, Gullickson took over the department after former Superintendent Lisa Coons resigned amid growing pressure from teachers and educational organizations calling for the release of the instructional guides.
Since then, the agency has kept to its rollout schedule. It plans to complete the release of the final four instructional guides over the next two weeks. These remaining courses include Grade 2, Grade 4 Virginia Studies, Grade 10 World History and Geography: 1500 to the Present and Grade 11 Virginia and United States History.

Glenn Youngkin signed it along with several other measures he initially tried to amend.
Youngkin carves out $900 million as Virginia prepares for Trump-era uncertainty

House Bill 1609 by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, will require the Health Insurance Reform Commission (HIRC) to consider coverage for diagnosis and treatment of infertility and procedures like IVF in its 2025 review of essential health benefits covered by health insurance.
“The timing is actually really critical in that HIRC is about to do the essential health benefits plan,” Helmer said, adding that now the state will “have to look seriously” at whether to include infertility care in the health insurance coverage it offers Virginians. 
When the legislature concluded the bulk of its work this past February, Youngkin then reviewed the bills that passed and weighed whether to sign, veto or seek amendments on them. Before signing Helmer’s bill, he tried to tweak it by including a provision for nongovernmental health insurance plan sponsors to opt out of potential coverage requirements for religious or ethical purposes. The legislature rejected this idea, punting it back to Youngkin, who recently approved it in its original form.
In his signature explanation, Youngkin called Helmer’s bill a “balanced approach” to expanding fertility care in the state because it didn’t outright mandate immediate coverage for the treatment. 
Calling it an “interim step,” Youngkin commended the bill and said HIRC’s review of how infertility care coverage could be implemented can “ensure the General Assembly has the data, analysis and necessary input to make an informed decision in the future.” 
Like his previous attempt to amend Helmer’s bill, Youngkin added that he believes it’s “essential” for his exemption idea to be taken up if Virginia does eventually cover fertility treatments like IVF. 
“The conscience clause that my amendment would have added is critical to ensure the expansion of fertility care does not come at the cost of religious liberty,” Youngkin said. 
While some states have passed laws to protect IVF access, members of Congress have sparred over the issue and failed to agree on federal protections. The reproductive healthcare treatment, which was less controversial in past years, has come under scrutiny after Alabama’s state supreme court ruled last year that embryos are people — prompting fertility clinics to suspend the procedure for risk of lawsuits. The state recently passed a law to protect IVF in the state, though questions remain about future challenges. 
Virginia-born Elizabeth Carr, the first person born of the procedure in the U.S., has emphasized that IVF is not “just (to treat) infertility.” 
“There are implications for if you need a surrogate, if you are a same-sex couple, if you want to screen for a genetic disease,” she told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in 2024. “Or, if you are going through cancer treatment and want to preserve your eggs so that after you’re done and you want to conceive, you can use IVF.” 
The use of IVF after a cancer diagnosis hit close to home for Helmer, whose close family member had to leave Virginia because health insurance didn’t cover the treatments in the state. For the past several years, he’s carried some version of House Bill 1609 to bring the state closer to realizing coverage. 
“Nobody should face the choice of having to leave to start a family. I’m grateful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were able to unite” on the measure, Helmer said. “I think the signing of this bill should give a lot of hope to a lot of people that we are going to be there for them, and this is exactly the kind of legislating that we should be doing.”

Despite progress, there is more work to be done. (Photo by Evgeniia Siiankovskaia/Getty)It’s Children’s Mental Health Awareness Week, and we are encouraged to see some positive trends continuing as the pandemic fades into the past.
Back in 2021, the national percentage of high schoolers feeling sad and hopeless rose to 42%, a peak after several years of worsening scores. Since then, here in Rhode Island, key internal indicators we track at Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island have been moving steadily in the right direction for members ages 18 and under. 
From 2021 to 2024, we have seen year-over-year improvements for both inpatient admissions (down 25%) and for emergency department visits (down 13%). 
For those of us working in mental health, the pandemic exposed a problem we had seen growing for years and prompted the U.S. surgeon general to issue an advisory calling on the nation to “step up for children.” Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island had already recognized we had an important role to play. In 2018, we eliminated many prior authorization requirements for mental health services to improve access to care.
After carefully considering how we could best serve our members and their communities, we launched a three-year plan in 2023 aimed at supporting the mental health of 110,000 Rhode Island youths and children, about half of the state’s under 18 population. 
Highlights of the plan include:

Assisting vulnerable populations: We worked with providers in our behavior health network to increase the availability of urgent appointments, potentially avoiding unnecessary visits to hospital emergency departments, and we collaborated with Bradley Hospital on offering clinicians free autism and anxiety training, plus stipends, to help them better serve children and youth.
Early identification and treatment: We increased reimbursement rates for early intervention care, offered incentives to pediatric primary care sites to integrate behavioral health care into their practices, expanded virtual care options, supported behavioral health startup Braver’s use of trained coaches to ramp up its exposure therapy program for children’s anxiety, and provided assistance to school-based mental health intervention programs, including Project SUCCESS and Mood Check.
Prevention and awareness: We coordinated Teen Mental Health First Aid trainings, promoted digital emotional wellness coaching for parents and caregivers through The Greatest 8, seeded the expansion of the Chris Collins Foundation’s school-based peer-to-peer program and supported youth recreation programs run by Recess Rocks in RI and Boys & Girls Clubs.

We’re encouraged by our progress so far. Over the past two years, we estimate that our collaborative efforts have helped touch the lives of about 130,000 youths, exceeding our original goal, and we are likely to surpass 200,000 by the end of 2025. 
New KIDS COUNT Factbook outlines what’s a stake for vulnerable R.I. kids

We’ve named just some of our valued partners here, but they and many others are foundational to the goals of our plan. They share our commitment to building healthier families and communities and we’re proud to support their efforts to launch and grow programs and services that promote the wellbeing and mental health of Rhode Island youths. 
Clearly, there is still much work to do. For example, the just-released 2025 RI KIDS COUNT Factbook noted that there was a significant increase in mental health hospitalizations for children on Medicaid in 2024 and that the number of calls to the Kids’ Link RI triage service, although down in 2024, still totaled 5,386.
We know we join all our partners throughout May in recognizing Mental Health Awareness Month — a time to reflect on the progress we’ve made and, importantly, to recommit ourselves to creating safe and supportive environments, promoting mental health education, reducing, and ensuring access to high quality mental health care.

HB 781 would allow local governments by “majority vote” to designate local government-owned property located within its jurisdiction to be used for a “continuous period of up to one year for public camping or sleeping purposes.” Local governments can renew the one-year period.
Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph) pushed back against claims that HB 781 criminalizes homelessness while introducing the bill.
“This bill does not criminalize homelessness,” Biggs insisted. “It addresses unauthorized public property camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness itself.”
Biggs has said the HB 781 grew out of conversations with municipal leaders who asked for guidance around handling the state’s growing homeless crisis. He said the state can no longer wait to address the problem.
Total homelessness across the state jumped 19% to 11,626 in 2024, according to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development report documenting homelessness in America. That was 1,872 more homeless people than the 9,754 counted in 2023.
“Some people want to kick it down the road two years, five years, but how long are we going to wait until we deal with our homeless population in our own house,” Biggs said. “We need to deal with it now. We need to give guidance.”
Under HB 781, local governments would also be responsible for ensuring safety, maintaining sanitation, policing illegal substance use and alcohol use and coordinating with health departments to provide behavioral health services at designated sites.
A lengthy House debate
The HB 781 debate was collegial. Some bill opponents thanked Biggs for taking on a difficult issue that has vexed cities and towns.

“It [HB 781] falls short in a lot of ways, but it took an act of courage to actually put it out there,” said Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg). “Maybe this is a solution we should consider because doing nothing is not an option. The solutions we’re currently trying to employ in our communities across the state are either ineffectual or not meeting the needs of those they are seeking to house.”
Budd, however, said she could not vote for the bill because it’s tantamount to an unfunded mandate that would create financial and strategic hardships for local governments.
“We cannot ask our local governments to foot this bill because when we do that, you know where they get the money, they get it out of the pockets of taxpayers living in their communities and most of those citizens can’t afford that either,” Budd said.

Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) agreed the state should provide local governments with financial assistance if HB 781 is approved.
“I think we’re going to have to put our money where our mouths are, otherwise, we would be just as guilty as the feds who do this all time; shove it down the line, beat their chest, act as though they did something and they’re sending us no money,” Jones said.
Rep. Jordan Lopez (D-Mecklenburg) spoke forcibly against the bill, contending it would criminalize homelessness.
“It’s not a misconception that House Bill 781 will require local governments to not only punish those that are unhoused, but in a state where affordable housing remains increasingly harder to find, it’s contributing to a rising homeless rate, basically requires local governments to push away or outright hide unhoused people as well,” Lopez said.
Rep. Sarah Stevens (R-Surry) reminded colleagues of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling in the case of Grants Pass v. Johnson that there is “no specific right to housing on public property.” The Court ruled that cities can punish unhoused individuals for sleeping outside in public even if they have nowhere else to go.
  Rep. Sarah Stevens (Photo: NCGA video feed)
“It [the Court decision] said there’s no constitutional right to living on a public park, a public property, so this does encompasses that and said you don’t have the right to live on public property but if a city or county wishes to establish a place for people to live, they need to at least provide sanitation, they need to provide a space and give them some guidelines,” Stevens said.
After the Court ruling, Grants Pass designated camps for people experiencing homelessness. City policy restricts camping to specific locations.
Stevens argued that HB 781 is not an unfunded mandate because the problem of homelessness already exists.
“This is an attempt to start moving forward and getting the cities and counties to say, ‘Yes, this is an issue and we’re going to deal with it,’” Stevens said. “We didn’t create the problem on the state level, so it’s not up to us to fix it. Each of the cities and counties are going to have to do their own thing.”
Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) questioned a provision in the bill that prohibits selected sites from negatively affecting property values of neighboring properties.
“Well, who’s going to determine that?” Butler asked. “Who’s going to do the valuations?”
Like other bill opponents, Butler thanked Biggs for taking on a challenging subject but said HB 781 leaves her with more questions than answers.
“You [Biggs] are well intentioned with this bill, but I think homelessness, being unhoused, is a very tough issue and people in that advocacy space have been trying to figure it out,” Butler said. “Until we can figure it out, and until we commit the dollars and resources to solve some of the underlying challenges, I don’t think we’re going to get there, and I think this bill is going to impede our progress on tackling homelessness.”
Advocates for the homeless decry bill’s substance, question motives of authors
Lawmakers’ concerns about HB 781 largely mirrored those that have been expressed by advocates for people experiencing homelessness.
“Absent state fiscal support, the NC bill diminishes local autonomy while making cities and counties both fiscally responsible and legally liable for the implementation of state-sanctioned encampment policies,” the NC Coalition to End Homelessness [NCCEH] said in a statement earlier this week.
The NCCEH also expressed concern that the bill is being pushed by the Cicero Institute, a conservative think tank, that has led efforts to pass similar legislation in Arizona, Missouri, Tennessee, Iowa, Georgia, Florida, Wisconsin and Kentucky.
The institute was founded by tech-industry capitalist Joe Lonsdale, who is critical of the “housing first” approach to ending homelessness. That model prioritizes providing individuals and families with permanent, affordable housing as the first step in ending their plight.
“While Cicero describes itself as a think tank, its policies promote industries that potentially profit from criminalizing poverty,” said Dr. Latonya Agard, executive director of NCCEH. “States that adopted Cicero laws find they are funneling more public money into incarceration, so while these bills could lead to the financial enrichment of out-of-state investors of privatized jails and prisons and monitoring technologies, they will worsen conditions for North Carolinians without housing.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2914-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-09 06:00:38.136259

Thirty-five people submitted opponent testimony against Ohio House Bill 160, which would reduce THC levels and redirect most of the tax revenue. State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, introduced the bill two months ago and opponents testified against the bill for more than three hours during Wednesday’s House Judiciary Committee meeting. 
“H.B. 160 imposes a litany of negative changes on cannabis users, consumers, growers, and professionals to dismantle key parts of current Ohio law enacted by your constituents,” said Gary Daniels, ACLU of Ohio’s legislative director. “At worst, these changes can be interpreted as purposeful, designed to kneecap Issue 2. At the least, these changes fundamentally handicap the purchase, use, transportation, and sale of cannabis in the state.”

Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative. The state’s total recreational marijuana sales were $479,219,877 as of April 26, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce Division of Cannabis Control. 
H.B. 160 would reduce the THC levels in marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap the number of marijuana dispensaries at 350, and reallocate the bulk of marijuana tax revenue to the state’s General Revenue Fund. It would ban using marijuana in public spaces and offer expungement for prior convictions for marijuana related offenses. 
“I think this bill represents the most thoughtful of the approaches we’ve seen from legislators,” said state Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord. “If we could find some common ground, I think the sponsor has mentioned that he wants to have a fairly stripped down bill.”
H.B. 160 would repeal the Cannabis Social Equity and Jobs Program, which was enacted through the passage of Issue 2. The bill also has an intoxicating hemp provision that would require every THC product to only be sold at Ohio’s regulated marijuana dispensaries. 
During the committee meeting, Callender held up an intoxicating hemp product he recently purchased with the Hawaiian Punch logo on it. 
  State Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord, holds up an intoxicating hemp product during the Ohio House Judiciary Committee meeting on May 7, 2025. (Screenshot).
“This is to show that there is some common ground,” Callender said. “1,000 milligrams of THC, 96.1% THC.  … No ID required to purchase, no ID required to go into the location. … We don’t want children having access. We don’t want false labeling.”
The bill would also make it illegal to purchase marijuana in another state and bring it back to Ohio. 
“But Ohioans can still return home from their favorite out-of-state microbrewery with a can, six pack, or entire keg of beer,” Daniels. 
Many of the opponents were not shy about pointing this out. 
“The Issue 2 campaign was called Regulate Cannabis Like Alcohol,”said Karen O’Keefe, Marijuana Policy Project’s director of state policies. “Yet H.B. 160’s unnecessary and onerous restrictions on cannabis in no way resemble how alcohol is regulated. … Would you ban possessing bourbon purchased in Kentucky?”
Opponents questioned where they would be legally allowed to use marijuana if the bill passed. 
“If people can’t consume at home-and sharing at a friend’s house becomes illegal, where are they supposed to consume safely?” asked Anthony D. Riley, founder of Ohio Cannabis Live and the Ohio Cannabis Expo.
Those opposed to the intoxicating hemp provisions are worried about the ramifications of limiting sales to only marijuana dispensaries. 
“We have concerns that the language in S.B. 160 would ban most types of legal hemp products from retail sales, reducing access for consumers,” said Ohio Grocers Association President Kristin Mullins. 
Instead, she wants lawmakers to incorporate regulatory oversight such as age-restricting products and product labeling. 
Ohio Senate marijuana bill 
The Ohio Senate passed their own version of a bill that would overhaul the state’s marijuana law back in February — shortly before the House introduced their bill. 
There are some similarities between the bills such as lowering THC levels, requiring marijuana only be used in a private residence, and capping dispensaries at 350. 
One of the biggest differences with Senate Bill 56 is limiting Ohio’s home grow from 12 plants down to six. The bill would also combine the state’s medical and recreational marijuana programs under the Division of Cannabis Control. 
S.B. 56 has yet to have a hearing over in the House.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Hundreds of people flocked to Representatives Hall Tuesday to testify before the Senate Finance Committee about the House-passed New Hampshire budget, the last official public forum to do so this year. The atmosphere was emotional — and often testy. 
Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican and the committee chairman, exchanged heated words with some of the testifiers, cutting off those he thought were repeating previous speakers and others he said were veering off topic. The proceedings lasted through the afternoon and well into the evening, wrapping up around 11 p.m.
The Senate Finance Committee will now take up the budget and make a series of changes, beginning on Friday at 1. The Senate has until June 5 to pass the budget, at which point it will likely head to negotiations with the House. The Legislature must deliver the budget to Gov. Kelly Ayotte by June 30, the end of the 2025 state fiscal year. 
Speakers raised the House’s proposed 3% decrease to Medicaid reimbursement rates, the elimination of the State Council on the Arts and Aging Commission, cuts at the Department of Corrections, and education freedom accounts, among other topics. 
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Ayotte said her budget director watched the hearing, and that she had taken note of the public commentary, particularly around the Medicaid cuts. 
“My takeaway is that my budget was a lot better,” said Ayotte, who has opposed many of the House’s proposed cuts. 
Here are some of the voices.

Fears of Medicaid cuts
Many of the speakers decried a 3% decrease to Medicaid reimbursement rates that the House included in its version of the budget. They urged the Senate to reverse it.
“We often think of Medicaid as a benefit, but it really is a part of the infrastructure,” Jeffrey Fetter, chief medical officer at New Hampshire Hospital, said. “The way that we deliver mental health care is more embedded in how Medicaid works than many folks understand or realize.”
The cuts, which were inserted into HB 2, would lower the amount the state’s Medicaid program reimburses providers for medical care purchased through Medicaid.
“I look outside my office at New Hampshire Hospital, I see 2,000 offices in buildings that used to have 2,000 patient beds,” Fetter said, referring to the psychiatric hospital’s history as a mental institution and asylum. “All those patients did not go away with de-institutionalization. They are living good lives in the community, and if our community mental health centers are unable to get the Medicaid funding they need, all those patients come streaming back into New Hampshire Hospital through emergency rooms, and that’s what we don’t want to see happen.”
Doctors and providers fear that when people lose access to Medicaid, they’re less likely to receive preventative care — including for mental health — and more likely to visit the emergency room, oftentimes for things that should be handled by a primary care provider oftentimes sicker than they would be otherwise.
Tiffany Gladu, a registered nurse with Granite State Independent Living, testified about how vital Medicaid is to the clients she works with, who have disabilities.
“Many of the individuals I serve don’t just need a little help,” Gladu said. “They rely on Medicaid-funded care for their very survival. These are not optional supports. They are critical, life-sustaining services that keep people alive, safe, and in their homes.”
She pointed out that many of those she works with cannot bathe themselves, get dressed, or get out of bed safely, without assistance, putting them at risk for pressure sores and infections that can become life-threatening. They also need help preparing meals, grocery shopping, taking their medications, accessing clean drinking water, and using the restroom. Some require physically invasive bowel programs or catheterization. These services are paid for through Medicaid.
“Without this support, their lives would be at risk,” she continued. “The care provided by these services allows people with disabilities to maintain their well being and live with dignity and safety in their homes. While personal care services are nonmedical in classification, they are medically necessary in practice. Without them, people are at risk for hospitalization, displacement from their homes, or death.”
Gladu said this care system is “already stretched thin.”
“A rate reduction in reimbursement means providers will be paid less for the same medically necessary work,” she said. “This does not only impact agencies. It directly impacts the people receiving the care. Lower rates make it harder to retain and hire qualified caregivers in a field that is already underpaid and undervalued. When we can’t find staff, consumers go without care.”
Defending state arts funding
A number of people spoke against the House’s decision to eliminate the New Hampshire State Council on the Arts. 
In Nelson, the Apple Hill Center for Chamber Music educates 300 students each summer on its 100 acre campus, “greatly assisted” by grants from the State Council on the Arts, said Sam Bergman, the executive director. But it doesn’t help just students, he said. 
“In the Monadnock Region, sir, as in so many parts of our state, the tourism economy is critical to everything that we do, and the arts are a critical part of that tourism economy,” Bergman said, addressing Gray. “The people who come to our arts organizations eat in our restaurants, they stay in our hotels, they patronize our businesses.” 
Mary McLaughlin, the interim board chair of the State Council on the Arts, noted that the organization had supported artists and organizations since 1965. And she agreed that the grants help stimulate local economies. 
“The arts are a revenue generator for the state, providing a positive 5-to-1 ratio return on investment,” McLaughlin said. “In 2024 New Hampshire invested 73 cents per citizen in the arts and culture sector, contributing to an estimated yield of over $2 million in in-kind goods and services, and over $50 million in payrolls of grantee organizations.”
McLaughlin noted the organization’s “artisan residents projects,” in which artists receive funding to teach their art in public schools. It’s “often the only arts education that some of our schools can afford to offer,” she said.
And she said that the elimination of the arts council would also result in a loss of National Endowment for the Arts funding.
Funding art is important for more than just economic activity, argued Andrew Pinard, the interim executive director of the AVA Gallery and Art Center in Lebanon and the founder of the Hatbox Theater in Concord. “Art is both important and fragile,” Pinard said. “It should not be taken for granted.”

Speaking up for the Commission on Aging
As another cost-cutting measure, the House budget would eliminate New Hampshire’s Commission on Aging, which was established in 2019 to advise policy related to senior citizens. The commission’s executive director, Lily Wellington, testified Tuesday urging senators to restore it.
“In 1925, the average person could expect to live for 59 years,” she said. “Today, that average lifespan has increased to 79 years, a testament to the power of public health, medical innovations, better nutrition, and wise public policy. This remarkable extension of life now requires a fundamental shift in how we plan and build our shared futures. We must now proactively adapt our systems to support longer lives.”
Wellington pointed to a 10-year blueprint the commission created for how the state can support its aging population and a transportation needs assessment it conducted on senior citizens as ways the commission was helping the state adapt.
Education freedom account expansion draws opposition
Some of the people present spoke against the House’s proposed expansion of education freedom accounts. The House’s budget would raise the current income threshold for the program from 350% of the federal poverty level to 400% in the first fiscal year, and then to all income levels in the second fiscal year.
The program allows families to access state education funds of between $4,000 and $7,000 per child per year to pay for private school or home-schooling expenses.
Some at the hearing argued the state’s Education Trust Fund should be used to increase state support of public schools, and should not fund the education freedom account program. 
“I’m here to ask you today to please support increased school funding in our state budget for public schools, and relieve the pressure on property taxes by ending the voucher system formula for school funding,” said Shelly Gingras, a school guidance counselor in Rochester.
Laura Vincent, a school board member at the Merrimack Valley School District, also opposed the education freedom account expansion. And Vincent warned lawmakers against adding mandatory budget caps for school districts. The House considered adding that measure to the budget, but did not ultimately do so.  
“Together with EFA expansion efforts, this will put our schools in a type of a vise,” Vincent said. “As money flows out to EFAs on one end, the money obtained through local taxes on the other end will start shrinking.”
Speaking against Department of Corrections cuts
One speaker Tuesday testified against the proposed cuts of 190 positions — 149 of them currently filled — at the Department of Corrections. 
Matt Davis, recruitment and retention sergeant for the New Hampshire Department of Corrections, said his job is one that would be eliminated. He said the cuts would create a risk to public safety and to the state’s prison system, which he said had earned national recognition. 
“I’m here today to ask one simple question: Who’s left behind the walls?” 
Davis argued that by cutting positions for training officials, teachers, mental health counselors, and others, lawmakers would not be eliminating the need for those roles. 
“That work just doesn’t go away,” he said. “It shifts to officers already drowning in responsibility and burnout. …That’s not just unsustainable, it’s dangerous.”
Stern rebukes from the chairman
Throughout the roughly eight-hour hearing Gray, the Finance Committee’s chair, chastised speakers who he said were being repetitive in a way that was taking up too much of the committee’s time. His rebukes began with the first few speakers.
“I believe I have the three minutes to finish my statement,” said Pinard, after he was interrupted by Gray’s gavel.
“Sir, I believe I am the chair,” Gray responded. “And if you read the Senate rules, I’m the one in charge. So you don’t tell me what I’m doing and not doing. I’m asking you to summarize your testimony and not repeat. Thank you.”
Gray continued this through the hearing to varying degrees.
“Every time that we have one of these public hearings that last a long time, there are people who come and can’t stay long enough to do the testimony, because the testimony continues, continues, and continues,” he said at one point. “That is one of the reasons we have a time limit. That is one of the reasons we restrict the repeating. That is one of the reasons we don’t want you clapping and stuff. And that’s all in the Senate rules of this committee. So please, with respect of your other people who want to testify and are very low on the list.”
Late in the hearing, Gray got into an argument with Rep. Jonah Wheeler, a Peterborough Democrat who said the Senate Finance Committee’s process for hearing public comment was too limited. Gray urged him to focus his comments on the budget.
“We are in the people’s House,” Wheeler said.
“And you are in a Senate hearing,” Gray countered. “And I am the one who gets to decide who’s talking and who’s not talking, Representative. Back to the bill.”
Gray then asked staff to “cut his microphone please.”

No modern political leader has done more to undermine science and research – both by slashing funding and directly spreading myths and disinformation — than President Donald Trump.
Whether defunding everything from cancer studies to the National Weather Service or placing a troubled conspiracy theorist like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in charge of the nation’s health, Trump has recklessly endangered millions of lives and wreaked havoc that will take many years to repair.
And sadly, Trump has also spurred state and local government in a similar direction. Last week, North Carolina House Republicans advanced a bill to ignore the Food and Drug Administration by allowing the sale of a drug used to kill parasites in horses — ivermectin – without a prescription.
Though touted by some right-wing pundits as a miracle cure, peer reviewed scientific research has repeatedly shown such claims to be bogus.
The bottom line: Ivermectin advocates may be sincere, but by overturning established, science-based drug approval laws, they are setting a very dangerous precedent indeed.

(Photo by Kimberly Fraser/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Flickr)For years, outdoors enthusiasts in New Mexico have pushed to overhaul the state Department of Game & Fish — an agency plagued by leadership turnover, funding woes and the scorn of hunters and tree-huggers alike.
Now, state lawmakers have given the agency a new name, a new mission, new leadership and a boost in funding to expand its role. The sweeping law enacted in March puts New Mexico at the forefront of a growing movement to rethink states’ traditional model of wildlife management.
“We came from a place of extreme dysfunction,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation, an environmental nonprofit that advocated for the new law. “Now, I truly do believe that we’re going to be a gold standard for wildlife management. Over the next few years. you’re going to see an unbelievable shift.”
New Mexico’s new approach expands the agency’s focus beyond hunting and fishing to protect more species and brings in new funding to reduce its reliance on license sales. Other states are watching closely. Lawmakers across the country have introduced bills to change their wildlife agencies, and many have cited the New Mexico measure as an example of what’s possible.
“That’s the biggest game changer,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a national nonprofit focused on overhauling states’ wildlife governance. “That’s the legislation we’ll be pointing to as a model in future years.”
From Oregon to Utah to Florida, legislators have introduced bills that would overhaul their wildlife agencies’ funding, mission and governance.
While the proposals have had varying levels of success, New Mexico leaders say it took years of coalition-building to get their bill across the finish line. Wildlife advocates expect the issue to earn more legislative attention nationwide in the years to come.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Under the traditional model, state wildlife agencies have largely been funded by the license fees paid by hunters and anglers, plus federal excise taxes on equipment such as guns and fishing tackle. The agencies have focused most of their work on species like deer and trout, prized by the sporting groups that provide their revenue.
In New Mexico, as in most states, the commissions that govern these departments have been appointed by governors. They’re often filled by hunting and fishing guides, ranchers and political donors. Critics say this model results in panels that set policy to protect their economic interests.
Today, many wildlife agencies are struggling to stay afloat as fewer and fewer residents hunt and fish. At the same time, plummeting wildlife populations are compelling agencies to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species. And some wildlife advocates are demanding a new governance model that puts more scientists in charge.
This year, state lawmakers across the country have passed or considered a host of major wildlife management overhauls. Some would expand their agencies’ mission to focus on non-game species. Others would provide new funding streams to take on that additional work. And some would change the makeup of the commissions that dictate wildlife policy.
In New Mexico, lawmakers did all three at once.
The state’s agency had faced numerous problems over the years. Hunters and bird-watchers alike were frustrated with the agency’s leadership. In recent years, several commissioners have resigned or been forced out by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. At times, the panel has lacked enough members to form a quorum.
The agency’s budget was in trouble as well. The state had not raised license fees in nearly 20 years, keeping revenue flat even as inflation made the cost of its work more and more expensive.
“We were having to repurpose money from on-the-ground conservation just to make salary adjustments,” said Stewart Liley, wildlife division chief with the New Mexico Department of Game & Fish. “We were getting to a precarious spot.”
In 2023, lawmakers passed a bill to restructure the agency’s commission, which would have taken some power away from the governor. Lujan Grisham declined to sign the bill, killing the effort with a pocket veto.











We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it's the only one we've got.


– Jesse Deubel, New Mexico Wildlife Federation executive director



This year, lawmakers took a bigger swing. The package passed this session renames the Department of Game & Fish to the Department of Wildlife. It expands the agency’s authority to protect non-game species in need of conservation help.
“We wanted to make it clear that this is our state wildlife agency, and it’s the only one we’ve got,” said Deubel, of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “They’ve got a responsibility to work on any species in the state that has conservation need.”
Agency leaders say they were already conducting research and conservation work for non-game species. They viewed that aspect of the bill as a largely symbolic measure that “shined a light” on the need for more restoration work, Liley said. However, the law did provide more explicit authority for the agency to manage insects and regulate the direct “take,” or killing, of certain animals.
The measure raises license fees — a provision supported by many hunting and fishing groups — and allows for inflation-based adjustments in future years. Meanwhile, lawmakers included another $10.5 million from the state budget, spread over three years, to help the agency take on more non-game conservation.
“It seemed only fair that if we were going to ask the department to take on a broader role that they not finance that just through hunting and fishing,” said Democratic state Rep. Matthew McQueen, who was among the key sponsors.
Liley, the agency official, said the new money, along with a separate conservation fund established in 2023, will more than double the state’s investment in helping threatened species. The agency expects to hire up to eight new biologists who will conduct research, determine which species need aid and lead restoration efforts.
“This will help us get a better grasp of where we are with different species across the state,” he said. “There are absolutely projects we have not undertaken because of lack of capacity. This will allow us to do more surveys, to radio-mark birds, to [use that research] and say, ‘Let’s do forest restoration this way for pinyon jays.’”
The package will also change the agency’s governance. The current commission has seven seats, all appointed by the governor. Lujan Grisham’s appointees have included a car dealer, an Exxon Mobil lobbyist and a former lawmaker who owns an oil and gas business.
Under the new model, a bipartisan legislative committee will nominate three candidates for every seat, each of whom must be vetted to demonstrate their knowledge of wildlife. The governor must choose from among those three. One of the seats will be reserved for a wildlife scientist, one for a conservationist, one for a hunter and angler and one for a rancher or farmer.
“These changes add expertise and really important perspectives to the commission,” said Chris Smith, wildlife program director with WildEarth Guardians, an environmental nonprofit. “Our [current] commission was having structural problems and light scandal almost consistently.”
Backers’ one disappointment is that Lujan Grisham used a partial veto to strike a provision that would have protected commission members from dismissal by the governor. She argued that the proposed change relied too heavily on the slow-moving court system to remove commissioners, making it difficult to hold problematic members accountable.
Political appointees set state wildlife policy. Critics say that’s a problem.

Lawmakers say they’re still intent on protecting agency leaders from the governor’s whims, but pleased the rest of the package has gone into effect. While the measure passed with bipartisan majorities, some lawmakers objected to the idea of expanding the agency’s mission to protect species beyond those that can be hunted.
“With all due respect, I don’t want to pay for a butterfly,” said Republican state Rep. Harlan Vincent, according to KUNM. “I’m just being honest with you.”
And some groups are skeptical that the extra funding from the state budget will be enough to cover the agency’s growing conservation role.
“If New Mexico wants to expand the mission of the department, New Mexico needs to pay for it,” Tom Paterson, president-elect of the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association, said during a Senate committee hearing. “The necessary funds should not come on the back of the license fees that hunters and anglers pay.”
While the agency’s new funding and mission are now in place, its name change to the Department of Wildlife won’t take effect until next year. And its current commission will remain in office until Jan. 1, 2027. Lujan Grisham’s successor will then appoint new commissioners under the revised model.
The advocates who backed the New Mexico overhaul say it will take time and investment to make the new model work. They know other states will be watching closely.

(Getty Images)In March, the federal government announced it was revoking $81.3 million in pandemic-related funding from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services that was not expected to expire until 2026.
The funding was being used to support the state’s epidemiological laboratory and testing capacity, outreach to vaccinate residents, efforts to address health disparities in the state, and substance use disorder treatment programming, as outlined in a new report from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
The funding came from myriad federal laws, grants, and programs designed to help New Hampshire, and other states, recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. State officials originally believed they’d be able to spend this funding into 2026, but in a surprise announcement, federal officials clawed back the funding on grounds that the pandemic has ended.
This made a difficult budget year for New Hampshire ever more challenging. The state has been dealing with lagging business tax revenues for the past few years, is being compelled by the courts to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement money after hundreds of children were abused in its juvenile detention centers, and was already running out of pandemic-era federal funding. Amid these challenges, Gov. Kelly Ayotte unveiled a $16 billion two-year budget proposal in February. House lawmakers decided her cuts weren’t sufficient to deal with the aforementioned fiscal challenges and passed a budget in April that spends $643 million less than the governor’s proposal. Now, the Senate is debating the spending plan, and lawmakers will have to figure out how to either find funding for these programs elsewhere or eliminate them.
Roughly two-thirds — $51.1 million — of the revoked funding was set aside for the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases Program, a joint program between the federal government and states that seeks to allow states to respond to disease outbreaks, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute. The money was being spent to increase the capacity of the state’s epidemiological testing and laboratories, and on disease research and surveillance.
About a quarter of the funding — $20.7 million — the federal government revoked was being used to support vaccine outreach efforts. Additionally, about 6% — $5 million — was being used to address health disparities in how COVID-19 affected different populations. Money from both of those segments was used to hire 39 community health workers. Those community health workers, typically members of the community where they serve, helped clients navigate the complicated health care system and connected them to food assistance or child care programs.
Additionally, the revoked money was funding behavioral health programs. A little over 2% — $2.1 million — came from a grant meant to provide community mental health services, and almost 3% — $2.3 million — was being used to support substance use (addiction) treatment, though the money was mostly being used on operational support and not direct patient services. That included programs teaching first responders how to deal with patients experiencing PTSD or other trauma, assisting community mental health centers in becoming federally certified as community behavioral health clinics, and the state’s 24-hour service that provides mental health assistance via phone and in-person to people experiencing crises.

Republish photo only with original article.)Ohio senators heard from supporters Wednesday of a proposal establishing guardrails around media produced with artificial intelligence. The proposal would prohibit the use of AI to create deepfake porn — particularly involving minors. But with provisions requiring watermarks and punishing identity fraud, the bill’s impact could extend far beyond the creation of pornography.
Senate bill 163
The bill’s sponsors, state Sens. Louis Blessing, R-Colerain Twp., and Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, argue the restrictions will “prevent potentially harmful uses” of an emerging technology while protecting Ohioans “safety and privacy.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill goes after AI-generated child porn by expanding the definition of obscenity to include an “artificially generated depiction.” Blessing explained “current laws against child sexual abuse material require an actual real photo of a child to be able to prosecute someone.”
“With AI not being a real photo,” he added, “this leads to issues of prosecuting someone generating these photos. Senate bill 163 will give attorneys the ability to prosecute these people.”
The sponsors argue AI can also be used to engage in fraud for financial, political and reputational purposes. So, the proposal extends identity fraud statutes to include a “replica” of an individual’s voice or likeness. It prohibits the use of a replica persona to defraud, damage a person’s reputation, or depict a person in a state of nudity or engaged in a sexual act.
Beyond its prohibitions, the bill aims to get ahead of deceptive uses by requiring any media created with artificial intelligence to include a watermark identifying it as such. Removal of a watermark is subject to a civil lawsuit for damages, and anyone who removes a watermark faces the presumption that they caused the alleged harm.
Proponents’ testimony
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost praised the measure’s “three-pronged approach.” He argued the watermark requirement “would provide a minimum level of transparency and notice” when an individual encounters AI-generated content.
Speaking about the bill’s identity fraud provisions, Yost brought up a case from his time as state auditor. A scammer successfully mimicked a school district’s email system and then sent a fake funds transfer request to the accounts payable department posing as the district’s financial controller. Best practice, Yost said, would be to call the sender for confirmation.
“But now, in the era of deepfakes with audio,” Yost explained, “you can send that fake email, call up (accounts payable) using the controller’s voice and say, ‘Hey, I just sent you an email asking you to do a wire transfer. This is really important. We need to move it. I wanted to follow up with phone calls so you didn’t have any questions.’”
As for the restrictions on child sexual abuse material, Yost urged lawmakers ensure “these powerful tools are not used for evil,” and added that “these are the kinds of things that keep me up at night.”
Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, pressed Yost on how useful state legislation can be when it comes to addressing a “borderless” crime.
Yost acknowledged he’d prefer to see federals laws and even international treaties governing the use of AI-generated images. But “possession or use within Ohio can still be proscribed by this body and it ought to be.” He added that one way to push Congress to act is for states to pass an array of legislation.
Lou Tobin, speaking on behalf of the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association, noted many states have passed bills to prohibit AI-generated child sexual abuse material or CSAM.
“As of last month,” he said, “Thirty-eight states, including every state surrounding Ohio, have enacted laws that criminalize the creation, possession and distribution of artificially generated CSAM.”
But while many states have taken action, it’s not clear those laws will hold up in court.
“I think a federal district court has found one of these statutes to be in violation of the Ashcroft decision,” Tobin told lawmakers. “The Ashcroft decision was a U.S. Supreme Court decision from the early 2000s that said you could not criminalize artificially generated images of child pornography because there wasn’t a real victim.”
In February, a federal judge in Wisconsin threw out one charge related to possession of “virtual child pornography,” but allowed three others to go forward. Prosecutors in that case have appealed the decision to dismiss the charge.
Tobin explained his office and the AG’s worked with state lawmakers to narrowly tailor S.B. 163 bill to avoid problems with the First Amendment. Regardless of how the case in Wisconsin or others play out, Tobin agued, “We think that’s a fight worth having.”

Medicaid, the federal-state health insurer for low-income Americans, covers nearly 3 million Ohioans. That’s about a quarter of the state’s population.
Particularly in states such as Ohio, Medicaid covers large numbers of working people. That’s because in 2014 the state opted to expand eligibility to people making 138% or less of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of four, that’s $43,000 a year.

About 770,000 Ohioans are covered by expanded Medicaid — a group for which rates of uninsurance have dropped by 62% since 2012, according to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio.
A draft budget making its way through the U.S. House of Representatives would cut federal spending — the primary source of Medicaid money — by $880 billion over 10 years. KFF reported that such a move would require a 29% increase in state spending to maintain the same level of coverage.
The federal government currently covers 90% of the cost of Ohio’s expended Medicaid. In his draft of the state budget, Gov. Mike DeWine included a provision saying that if the feds cut that, the state would end coverage of the 770,000 Ohioans in the expansion group.
In the report it released this week, the Commonwealth Fund said such cuts would harm state economies, with Ohio’s high among them. It said “the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) would decrease by $95 billion and tax revenue would decrease by $7 billion. The states likely to face the most significant economic losses include California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.”
One reason for the losses, the explainer said, is that each dollar in Medicaid spending creates a greater value to the overall economy.
“Medicaid investment is shown to have a “multiplier effect,” meaning that every dollar spent generates over a dollar’s worth of economic activity,” it said. “Medicaid drives employment in the health care sector; generates state and local tax revenue; and saves money for enrollees, allowing them to spend more on items other than health care.”
Medicaid spending also bolsters the economy by making more people healthy enough to work. Research in Ohio and across the country has shown that workforce participation is greater in states that expanded Medicaid, the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy reported in 2023.
The economic benefits of Medicaid spending are manifold, the Commonwealth Fund report said.
“Medicaid coverage helps lift enrollees out of poverty — more effectively, in fact, than federal tax credits,” it said. “In states that have expanded Medicaid, enrollees have benefited from reductions in income inequality, evictions, and bankruptcies, as well as improvements in credit scores. One study found that less than two years after Michigan expanded Medicaid, the average amount of medical bills in collections for enrollees had dropped by over $500, enrollees were 11% less likely to be evicted, and they were 13% less likely to overdraw their credit cards than before expansion.”

(Courtesy of Tillamook County Transportation District)Compared with major American cities, the ridership on public buses in Minot, North Dakota, can seem relatively minuscule.
But the 82,000 rides taken each year allow people without cars to get to work, help those with disabilities get around and connect patients with crucial health care.
“The value of those rides is unmeasurable, because the people that are using our system need our system,” said Brian Horinka, the city’s transit superintendent.
Like in many cities — from sprawling metropolitan areas to smaller and rural communities — the financial future of public transit is questionable in Minot, population 48,000. While increasing, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. Federal funding and state budgets remain uncertain, while inflation is pinching transit services.
For example, Horinka said he’s looking to buy a new 30-foot heavy-duty bus. He expects it will cost up to $700,000 because of inflation. Just five years ago, a similar model could be had for about $400,000, he said.
“We’re in dire straits, from a financial standpoint,” he said.
North Dakota’s four largest cities, including Minot, asked lawmakers for millions in extra grant dollars this year to keep transit buses rolling. The state enacted a new law awarding $2 million in grants — a welcome reprieve, but far less than the $15 million initially requested.














The value of those rides is unmeasurable, because the people that are using our system need our system.


– Brian Horinka, transit superintendent in Minot, N.D.






Republican state Rep. Dan Ruby, a sponsor of the legislation, said cities will likely need to increase local funding for bus systems.
“I don’t think it’s enough,” he said. “I think it is going to just be somewhat of a stopgap for some of them to be able to function.”
The law also calls for a study to develop a proposed funding formula for fixed-route bus systems. Ruby said he would prefer a permanent funding model that doesn’t require cities to continually rely on legislative grants.
“We also want to make sure that they’re not sitting on funds or running inefficiently just because they have the funding,” he said. “That’s the key to get support from most of the legislators, to show that they really do have a need and there’s no way to find any more cuts in their operations without affecting the people that need the rides.”
It’s indicative of discussions occurring in state capitals across the country as public transit faces existential funding challenges.

Public transit systems in major cities including Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco face the potential of deep service cuts without more funding. But the problems also extend to smaller systems that connect people in rural America and smaller cities.
 Partisan debates over transit funding

In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said the transit financial crisis affects residents in all 67 of the commonwealth’s counties.
“Let me just say, we face a dire situation for mass transit agencies all across Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh to Philly and rural communities in between,” Shapiro said at a news conference in April.
Transit funding has been stuck in a partisan battle in Harrisburg.
In November, to stave off cuts, Shapiro ordered the transfer of more than $150 million in federal highway funds to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as SEPTA, which serves the greater Philadelphia area with bus and regional rail lines. He’s also backed legislation to increase transit funding, which has found support in the Democratic-controlled state House but so far has not advanced in the GOP-controlled state Senate.
Late last month, House Republican Leader Jesse Topper proposed partially privatizing the Philadelphia-area transit agency rather than increasing funding, which he said in a statement would “only serve to patch over the problems of a system chronically in crisis.”
“The same old, same old is clearly not working,” he said, according to a report by public radio station WESA.
The transit agency has said it already operates one of the most efficient systems in the nation. On a special website it created to call attention to its $213 million budget deficit, SEPTA said there’s “nothing left to cut from the budget but service.”
The authority has said it may be forced to cut services by 45% and raise fares by 20% without help from the state.
Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents a portion of North Philadelphia, said that would be “catastrophic” for the region.
“It makes this not only a less appealing place to live for people who are considering moving here,” he said, “but it also makes it difficult to live for folks who call this area home.”
Kenyatta, who dismissed the idea of privatization, said the state has a moral and economic obligation to ensure sustainable funding for public transportation.
“We’ve done patches here and there,” he said. “And that patchwork approach is not one that inspires the type of confidence and allows our transit agencies to do the type of long-term planning that they need to do.”
 Transit’s pandemic ‘death spiral’

Mass transit saw some of the most immediate impacts of COVID-19 as people worked from home and avoided public spaces.
The federal government provided nearly $70 billion in pandemic aid to transit programs, which saw revenues drop sharply because of reduced fare collections.
But with the rise of remote and hybrid work, ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels even as costs for labor and equipment skyrocket. A recent Bloomberg News analysis estimates the nation’s largest transit systems are facing a $6 billion shortfall — only heightening fears of a so-called death spiral in which a combination of service cuts and fare increases cause further erosion of riders and revenue.
In Oregon, Democratic lawmakers have proposed increasing the state’s dedicated transit payroll tax. Billed as “a starting point,” the plan would increase the tax from 0.1% to 0.18% — estimated to raise $269 million over each two-year budget cycle.
“That’s appreciated, but it’s nowhere near what it needs to be,” said Brian Vitulli, general manager of the Tillamook County Transportation District in western Oregon. “There could be some service reductions in the near future if we don’t get more funding.”
Aside from rising costs, Vitulli faces major hiring challenges: The district has 19 drivers but could use eight to 10 more. With too few drivers, bus service has been cut to six days a week.
For some riders, the transit services provide a lifeline. After last year’s closure of Tillamook’s only dialysis center, for example, the agency began offering rides to other dialysis clinics well outside its service area.
That has driven up costs and tied up drivers, making services such as the on-demand Dial-A-Ride less available for other residents.
“We’re kind of the only option for these dialysis patients,” he said. “And we’re kind of prioritizing those trips rather than somebody who just wants to go to the Elks Club for lunch or something.”
Vitulli also serves on the board of the Oregon Transit Association, which is lobbying instead for a 0.4% increase in the transit payroll tax phased in over eight years. The association said the current 0.08% proposal could force transit providers across the state to cut services by as much as 25% in the next few years as inflation and decreased fare collections push many into deficits.
TriMet, which operates rail, bus and paratransit services across 533 square miles of the Portland region, said it would still need to cut services even if the lawmakers’ proposed 0.08% funding increase were approved. The agency faces a deficit of nearly $75 million for the upcoming fiscal year.
Oregon lawmakers are broadly concerned about federal spending cuts, which could turn the state’s modest budget surplus into a gaping deficit, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported. Nearly a third of the state’s budget comes from federal money.
Democratic state Rep. Susan McLain said budget uncertainty has heightened scrutiny of all state spending this session. She is one of the authors of the state’s transportation proposal, crafted after nearly two years of meetings across the state. Aside from increasing the transit payroll tax, it calls for boosting the gas tax and hiking vehicle registration costs to help pay for road improvements.
McLain, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Transportation, said budget negotiations are ongoing, with aims of having hearings later this month.
While the state wants to do more to ensure everyone can access medical care, schools and jobs, McLain noted that belt-tightening is imperative for all manner of agencies, including transit.
“We’re really trying to dig in and find ways to do more with less,” she said, “but also to make sure that we’ve got sufficient, adequate types of investment in areas that we value.”

(Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)A confession: I’m trying to quit my podcast habit.
My family and friends know I am the least likely person to write those words. If you were in a conversation with me over the past 20 years, there was an 87.3% chance that my first words would be: “I was listening to this podcast and …”
Baseball. Politics. Soccer. Comedy. Environmental issues. American culture. Entertainment. And science.
This week, my son pondered the possibility of plugging a USB drive into his head to upload knowledge for an upcoming test. For me, that has been the intellectual equivalent of podcasts.
In fact, my writing for Kansas Reflector began as “Audio Astra,” a digest of podcasts about Kansas or related to Kansas. If you didn’t know that, I forgive you. Those columns were even more torturous to read than they were to write — and that is saying something.
For hours each week I would listen to niche-y podcasts about Kansas forests, Midwest farm wives or the history of the Riverside Zoo in Wichita. As I listened to many of them, the audio quality often buzzed and screeched in my AirPods, even more so when I was writing on deadline and had to listen at 2x speed. I considered sending a few different podcasters a new microphone, just to improve my personal listening experience. I was a scribe — perhaps the only one — in the Holy Church of the Modern Podcast.
And yet, here I am today speaking heresy against them.
(Plus, I am writing for a publication with its own podcast. And I just finished judging a podcast contest.)
Even more absurd is the timing of my takedown. Americans are listening to more podcasts each year. While it’s true that counting podcast listeners has been an imperfect task recently, most media watchers see podcasting as a promising and growing media format.
Why my grumpiness toward podcasts then? Some of my malaise with podcasts is just that: my burned-out ears have been fatigued by thousands of hours of listening. My auditory claustrophobia is real.
But there is something else — something about the podcasts themselves. It’s their flabbiness.
Here’s one example. While folding laundry the other day, I turned on one of my favorite mindless podcasts, “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend,” a comedy podcast hosted by the former late-night host. The jovial and absurd interview episode has been a weekly staple of my listening for the last few years. And behold! Conan was interviewing Bill Hader, an actor who I admire so much that YouTube thrusts his content at me each time I log in. With all of that excitement, I clicked play.
After 56 minutes and 44 seconds, the interview ended. The pre/post banter slid into silence. That was two days ago.
Right now, I’ve been sitting at this keyboard for five minutes and I can’t tell you a single thing that was said. That’s an hour of stopping my ears up from hearing anything else. The squirrels chasing on the roof. The dishwasher sloshing. My son talking to friends on the phone in the next room.
All of that was blocked for unscripted celebrity chatter that I have entirely forgotten.
It’s a specific kind of programming. Call them the banter podcasts. Movie stars sit down with other movie stars. Comedians sit down with other comedians. Joe Rogan sits down with anyone and everyone.
Of course, banter podcasts these days are incredibly popular. The top five overall podcast chart, as ranked by Apple, includes Rogan at No. 4, along with actor Amy Poehler’s new show, “Good Hang.” Plus, the No. 1 show, “The Mel Robbins Podcast.”
Rogan is famous for making marathon episodes, like this week’s interview with Cameron Hanes, which stretched for 3 hours and 18 minutes. What does Hanes do for a living? Well, he’s got two podcasts of his own, among other things. Looks like a lot of banter on his channel too.
Podcasts, it turns out, have simply become too easy to make. A quiet room, a microphone and a friend. That’s the recipe for your first episode.
With that rant out of my system, I’m not ready to delete my podcast app yet. Many news podcasts still deliver tight, focused and original reporting and rich, audio storytelling.
Last week, NPR’s “Fresh Air” provided an emotional interview with Noad Wyle about his starring role in my household’s new favorite show, “The Pitt.” From the New York Times, “The Daily” distilled decades of reporting on investment genius Warren Buffett into 28 minutes on Wednesday. So, if I corner you at a cocktail party, watch out, because I remember tons of stuff from each of those episodes. “I was listening to this podcast and …”
But the banter podcasts … they leave me bloated, foggy and listless. My recent peevishness with them was triggered by listening to more audiobooks. While podcasts and audiobooks might seem one and the same, I found audiobooks entirely different when I returned to them after months of endless podcast banter. Podcasts were often the casual and wandering Zoom call between two actors, each promoting recent movie releases on a Thursday morning.
Audiobooks, on the other hand, pack a punch. Authors boil down years of expertise into singular chapters. Audiobooks, especially with the aid of a good book editor, also present the ideas with urgent, concise language rather than the podcast standard: a series of stuttered questions interrupted by leisurely sips of podcast coffee.
My critique might smack of impatience as I strive to mainline terabytes of information into my brain as fast as possible. And perhaps that’s true.
However, my main concern about flabby banter podcasts is the possibility that they are replacing our conversations in real life. How can we give our kids, partners and friends any real attention if we are racing to keep up with Rogan’s 12 hours of audio during a six-day period this week? No matter how extroverted you are, there is only so much conversation capacity there. Maybe we need to save our banter bandwidth for real people.
This is my alert to whomever is tracking podcast analytics: You are about to see a dip. Not because my rhetorical wit and zeal here will sway millions of readers. Instead, with my throttling back on my daily podcast habit, you might notice a hiccup in worldwide podcast listening.
And yes, I would be happy to come on your podcast to explain. I have three hours free after lunch.
