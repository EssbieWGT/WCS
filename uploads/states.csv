(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha has joined a multistate lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump administration’s demand that states share personal information — and even shopping records — from people enrolled in food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).  
A coalition of 21 states and Washington, D.C, filed the complaint Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which manages the SNAP program at the federal level. States run their own SNAP programs but rely on the federal framework for funding.  
The suit seeks to block a May 2025 USDA directive that requires states to provide five years’ worth of SNAP applicants and recipients’ information, such as Social Security numbers, addresses, immigration status, and even “day-to-day grocery purchase information,” according to the suit. 
The USDA reminded states on July 9 and July 25 to send over the information, setting a July 30 deadline that could trigger a “noncompliance procedure” that would leave states without their federal funding for SNAP. 
“USDA demanded that States turn over virtually all of their SNAP applicant and recipient data for the past five years, including detailed ‘transactional records from each household,’ citing vague ‘program integrity’ concerns,’” the 103-page complaint reads. 
The suit argues that USDA’s maneuver is unprecedented and that the feds’ ability to audit state’s individual SNAP records is limited. 
“Once again this Administration is attempting to unlawfully collect sensitive personal information — this time by threatening Americans’ ability to feed their families,” Neronha said in a statement Tuesday, noting that more than 10% of Rhode Islander residents receive SNAP money. 
A total of about 144,200 Rhode Islanders received SNAP benefits in 2024. The state receives about $27 million annually to administer the program. 
“These are our neighbors, our colleagues, our friends. They have children who may go hungry without the program,” Neronha said.
The attorneys general filing the suit are concerned the data collection is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to stockpile personal data across federal databases and agencies, with the intent of using that data for immigration enforcement.  
“Defendants’ sweeping and unprecedented demands for five years’ worth of PII [personally identifiable information] on SNAP applicants and recipients appear to be another step in this Orwellian surveillance campaign,” the lawsuit reads.
USDA initially tried to collect the SNAP data directly from states’ third-party vendors like Fidelity and Conduent, which deliver benefits to recipients through electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards. The contractors refused, so USDA pivoted to asking the states directly.  
The plaintiffs additionally argue that the fraud-finding purpose of the data request is unfounded, noting that USDA itself has called SNAP “one of the most rigorous quality control systems in the federal government.”
The case has not yet been scheduled for a hearing date but has been assigned to Senior District Judge Maxine M. Chesney in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. 
State attorneys general involved in the lawsuit include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is also a plaintiff on behalf of his state. 
This lawsuit brings the number of cases against the Trump administration in which Neronha is participating to 31.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act established a national tax credit scholarship program, but state leaders can decide whether and how to participate. (File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
 State regulations

As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
SC K-12 school voucher program hits 10,000-student cap, with thousands more rejected

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.
The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
 What do these programs look like across the country?

FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
K-12 education voucher bill headed to SC governor’s desk

Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

Andy Beshear on Wednesday questioned Auditor Allison Ball’s right to sue over an unfunded law that would have helped kinship care families. 
During a Wednesday morning court hearing, held over Zoom, Beshear attorney Taylor Payne said the auditor has “zero standing” to push for enforcement of that law. 
This hearing came nearly three months after Ball asked the Franklin Circuit Court to rule that the Beshear administration must implement Senate Bill 151, passed in 2024 with the goal of giving much-needed financial relief to families raising minor relatives. The legislature didn’t fund SB151, which Beshear signed and the cabinet said would cost $20 million to implement. 
Since then, the administration and legislature have argued over what related case law requires of the administration. The cabinet has maintained, citing Fletcher v. Commonwealth, that the state is precluded from spending money the legislature has not appropriated. The parties did no formal mediation in this case.
“Simply auditing a public agency to determine how they’re spending their money, whether they’re being responsible with their money, is a role she’s obviously statutorily assigned to do,” Payne said, “but in this situation, (Auditor Ball) … has no injury due to the cabinet’s inability to enforce.”  
Alexander Magera, an attorney for the auditor’s office, countered that “an investigatory body has the standing to vindicate its investigatory authority in court if it’s being obstructed.” 
Standing is the question of whether plaintiffs’ circumstances meet legal standards entitling them to challenge the law. Ball has maintained that the Beshear administration did not cooperate with her initial inquiry into whether or not the cabinet had the funds (or could access federal money) to implement SB151 without a General Assembly budget line.  
KY auditor sues governor to end impasse over financial help for kinship care families

“It looks like, to me, that you can do an audit, go in there and look at their books, raise 15 cans of cane, do a report, get in front of all these newspapers and tell them everything bad that’s occurring,” Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate said. “I just don’t know if you can sue. That’s where I’m hung up.” 
He later said it “might be creating a bad precedent to allow the auditor to sue.” 
Wesley Duke, general counsel for the cabinet, said the cabinet hasn’t questioned the auditor’s investigative authority or obstructed her audits and, therefore, there isn’t a controversy or case. Furthermore, he said, “the auditor just does not have standing to bring this action.” 
Norma Hatfield, who is raising two grandchildren and is a longtime advocate for kinship care families in Kentucky, took serious issue with the Wednesday arguments. 
“Shame on you. There is a controversy. There is a case here,” she told the Lantern after the hearing, which she attended. 
In 2024, there were around 55,000 Kentucky children being raised with a relative, according to a report from Kentucky Youth Advocates. In 2023, there were about 1,500 new placements.
Government financial support for kinship care families in Kentucky has been lacking, in part because caregivers make an important custody decision hastily, under stress and without all the information they need.
When the state removes a child from a home, grandparents and other family members often choose to take temporary custody rather than have the child go into state custody. State custody is the first step toward foster care. That first decision is permanent under current law which has excluded kinship caregivers who take temporary custody from ever receiving the $750 a month that foster parents receive for each child, the Lantern has reported.
Senate Bill 151, on paper and not yet in practice, gives kinship caregivers 120 days to apply to become foster parents for their minor relatives and allows children who are being removed from homes to request their preferred familial caregivers, if they are able. 
If half the eligible families applied for the assistance, that alone would cost around $15 million, Payne said. 
“There’s just a practical matter: Without money to give direct payments to people, it’s impossible for the cabinet to give those payments,” Payne said. 
  Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate (Screenshot)
Hatfield has asked that the cabinet at least update paperwork and start asking children who need to be placed with families where they would like to go, but isn’t aware of that happening. 
The judge’s concern over setting lawsuit precedent “bothered me,” Hatfield said. “To me, if you follow that, you set a precedent that organizations…have no teeth in what they do.”  
Wingate said he will “probably” dismiss Beshear from the lawsuit. He will then rule on the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, a ruling that he said could take a couple of weeks. 
Hatfield said even if the judge drops Beshear from the lawsuit, she believes the governor “still owns this” issue and “owes” it to kinship care families to do more for them. 
“While the judge might pull him out of the complaint,” Hatfield said, “that does not alleviate the governor from his responsibilities and his promises that he made to the people of Kentucky.”

(Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)On July 17, Congress voted to eliminate federal funding for public media across the United States.
The cuts, called a “rescission” in Congress-speak, are huge: They will take away some $1 billion that the federal government had previously allocated for the next two years to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding for national outlets like NPR and PBS as well as local radio and television stations with much smaller budgets.
That funding is essential to many of Alaska’s local news outlets. It’s no exaggeration to say that losing that money — which was slated to be delivered starting September 30 — threatens the very existence of some stations that provide news coverage and other programming, like emergency alerts, around the state.
To get a sense of how local radio and television stations are responding — and what their leaders expect in the months ahead — Northern Journal correspondent Max Graham sent some questions to two longtime public media employees in rural Alaska: Sage Smiley, news director at KYUK in Bethel; and Lauren Adams, general manager at KUCB in Unalaska.
Below are their responses, lightly edited for brevity.
What have the last few days been like for you and your colleagues? How are you feeling?
Sage Smiley: We’ve spent seven months facing – and trying to publicly push back on – an increasingly likely existential threat to public broadcasting. It’s been exhausting, and demoralizing.
Beyond the threat to our jobs, or even to this station we care so much about and where we’re trying to serve the communities of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, it’s incredibly concerning and challenging to see the attack on journalism and on that pillar of democracy that this and other actions by the Trump administration represent.
In a way, though, rescission of funds has been deeply motivating to the news staff. We may be in the unique position of defining the end of a chapter of KYUK’s newsroom history, and want to do the best job we can, for as long as we can, serving the mission of KYUK and its newsroom.
Lauren Adams: On the day that the vote took place, KUCB’s entire staff was working to inform our community about a tsunami evacuation following a large earthquake in the region. Our entire community, including the fishing industry workers, were evacuated to high ground. Our emergency response went off without a hitch, and we worked in tandem with our community’s public safety department. It was a huge affirmation of our connection to the community and our important mission.
That night, I was very happy to hear U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski speak about KUCB on the Senate floor in defense of Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding. It was incredibly disappointing that her colleagues didn’t hear the message and that they voted in favor of the rescission.
The following days were really low! There was a sadness and a heaviness in the office that I haven’t experienced before. I know my staff was concerned about the future of their jobs and we met as a group the following day to talk through their concerns.
I told them that we will have to make changes in the future but for now we will use reserves to keep our essential services up and running and those services depend on having people on the payroll. In short, we aren’t cutting staff right now.
In my case, I am beyond frustrated and dismayed looking at a budget that’s just not going to balance this year without severe cuts. The federal funding cut comes on the heels of already lean years, given the lack of funding from the state of Alaska, which was eliminated under Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
One silver lining has been seeing donations come in every day from people all across the country expressing their support for the work we do. While the funds won’t fill the gap made by the elimination of federal funding, the sentiment and the comments have been a real morale boost for all of us.
Could you help readers understand how significant federal funding is for your station? What proportion of your budget does it account for, and what does it pay for?
Smiley: KYUK is both a radio and a television station, called a dual licensee, so we receive two community service grants each year from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Together, those grants represent about 70% of KYUK’s operating funds – over $1 million. That money pays for everything from salaries to equipment to travel on bush planes for reporting.
Adams: Federal funding last fiscal year was over $280,000, over 40% of our total budget. We had it budgeted at $289,602 for this fiscal year, which started on July 1. That was 45% of this year’s projected budget. There is no replacement for these funds. Our community is small but residents support us in substantial ways already. We estimate that about 8% of people in Unalaska are KUCB donors and also support us through daily non-monetary acts of generosity. We have consistently done well with local fundraising allowing us to match federal funds with local income. But we can’t expect community members to fill this gap: It’s just not possible.
Funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting supports KUCB’s local news content, a comprehensive community calendar, emergency alerts, health and safety information and government accountability through live broadcasts and streaming of municipal meetings.
What are your expectations for your station moving forward? 
Smiley: KYUK has been a community institution broadcasting to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta for over 50 years, committed from the beginning to uplifting Yup’ik voices. Our call letters, Y-U-K, were picked because Yuk means “real person” in Yugtun, the Yup’ik language. Our ultimate goal is to stay on the air, which we have to do to keep our licenses. KYUK is unique and incredible – the only station I’m aware of in the state broadcasting news and public affairs that provides shows bilingually on a daily basis – and we want to preserve that legacy of support for Yup’ik language and culture, however possible.

Adams: We had a reporter leave the station in June to fill a Report for America position in Texas. Because I was concerned about funding, I chose not to post that position until we had a better sense of federal dollars. That means we started the fiscal year with a little financial breathing room, but also with a newsroom that was down by a quarter of our former reporting capacity. Thankfully, we have a summer news intern funded by Alaska organizations promoting journalism and community development. When she leaves next month, our community will start to notice the reduction in news coverage, which is unavoidable.
At this point, I don’t know exactly what we will sound like. We will have to meet with our board of directors and with community leaders to make changes under their guidance. I imagine that we will have to sacrifice some of our daily news coverage during times when we have a lot going on.
For instance, we are going into our municipal election season and this is a mayoral election year. I am confident that we will hold our usual forums and we will produce a voter guide as we do every year. This is an important responsibility for us because we employ the only reporters in the community. But if our staff is doing this work, we will have to give up the other stories and newscasts in order to prepare for the forums. We need to be mindful of not burning out staff by just piling more work on the two remaining members of the news team.
We are lucky because our studio is located in a municipal building and the rent is free. We also receive an operations grant from the City of Unalaska. Because of this, I don’t fear that our station will go dark. My bigger concern is that we will be more of a repeater station, playing statewide content instead of local content, and that we won’t have the staff to cover the region’s news and events and we won’t be as effective during an emergency.
I imagine news of the lost funding has brought up, or will bring up, some pretty tough conversations at your station about programming cuts and layoffs. Could you shine some light on those discussions if you’ve already had them? Or are you still waiting and seeing what the full impacts will be?
Smiley: There’s a lot that’s still unclear, and I would say that at this point, KYUK’s future is also unclear. Seventy percent of our funding will cease to exist at the end of the federal fiscal year on September 30. That’s catastrophic. We may have to make drastic cuts to staff in order to keep providing basic broadcasting to the communities we serve.
Adams: We are hoping to hold off on layoffs for at least six months using reserves. In the meantime, we will strip our station budget down as much as possible while maintaining as much of our essential content – local news and information – as possible.
Places where we can cut immediately include syndicated programming, interconnection costs, travel, training, dues and subscriptions, computer hardware and software purchases, internet and phone, and potentially utilities. In the future we might turn off broadcast television and focus on our radio operations, but this is a hard choice that requires giving up a broadcast license that we have held locally for 50 years.
I’ve heard some talk that potential funding from philanthropists could make up for the lost federal spending. Is that really a possibility? Or are there other funding alternatives that are giving you hope?
Smiley: Our fall fundraiser usually brings in around $50,000, and our federal grants are 20 times that. As an ardent lover of the public broadcasting system, I would be overjoyed if a philanthropist decided to fund the network in perpetuity. But I don’t think that’s realistic, or a real solution. The whole point of the public broadcasting system is the system, and the commitment of the United States government to supporting that egalitarian, deeply democratic, equal-access system. It’s the fact that public broadcasting reaches 99% of Americans. It’s that it’s free, and available practically everywhere. A patchwork solution, one that doesn’t preserve the entirety of the system, isn’t going to address what will be lost more broadly.
Adams: I am in one of the most remote corners of the state and I might not be the one to ask about major philanthropy donors and the advocacy efforts. We have a small staff and all of us are working daily to keep our systems up and running and to provide the services that our community relies on. I don’t have the resources to go after major donors. At the statewide level, I think we are all doing our best to try to envision a future where there’s increased funding from philanthropists and donors. I don’t know how quickly this could come together or how sustainable the model would be.
I think that federal funding filled a need, and we were a great fit for the funds because we brought crucial health and safety services to our remote community. I am not aware of a viable long term substitute for Corporation for Public Broadcasting funds.
With that said, I would love to see restoration of public media funding in our state budget. We’ve always received bipartisan support for state funding until the line gets vetoed by the governor. Maybe given the new funding circumstances, and the real need for the services that public broadcasters provide in Alaska, we could see restoration of some state funding.
I also know from years of experience at KUCB that building a station’s relationship with a community, and establishing an award-winning news team, takes a lot of time and effort. I also know that while it’s slow to build, it’s very quick to erode. With reduced news staff, fewer editors, reduced equipment maintenance, and cuts to our services, we will see a spiral of reduced local income.
Could you highlight recent work at your station — whether news reporting or other programming — that wouldn’t have been possible without federal funding and that illustrates the importance of your station to your community? 
Smiley: Everything you see on KYUK’s website is supported by federal funding. Our calendar of fisheries openers. The local newscasts in Yugtun and English. Yup’ik Word of the Week. Decades-worth of archival television material from throughout the Delta. Our call-in shows: Fish Talk, River Watch, Talkline, Yuk to Yuk, the Birthday Line. Live coverage of high school basketball games. City Council meetings.
And then there’s all the stuff that goes out over the radio but isn’t necessarily online: radio programming the funding allows us to license, search and rescue messages, boil water notices, public service messages from the local and state governments, emergency alerts.
Adams: Again, I think that the tsunami response earlier this month is an amazing example of the work we do locally — work that is only possible with federal funding. Unalaska is a volcanic island in the middle of a chain of volcanoes, and we experience extreme weather pretty frequently. Emergency alert procedures are essential and a very real part of the work we do.

Read this story in English.Las tuberías de plomo se prohibieron en Estados Unidos en 1986, pero nuevos datos recopilados por las empresas de agua de Connecticut muestran que aún podría haber miles de tuberías de plomo que transportan agua a hogares, apartamentos y algunas escuelas.
Connecticut Mirror obtuvo cientos de informes del Departamento de Salud Pública estatal que indican que podría haber hasta 8,000 líneas de servicio de plomo que conectan los hogares con las grandes tuberías que corren bajo las calles.
Los sistemas de agua comunitarios del estado, que abastecen de agua potable a más de tres cuartas partes de la población, comenzaron a enviar avisos a finales del año pasado advirtiendo a propietarios e inquilinos que su línea de servicio podría contener este metal tóxico.
Todos los sistemas públicos de agua del país deben identificar y reemplazar todas las líneas de servicio de plomo restantes en los próximos 10 años. Mientras tanto, muchos clientes de servicios públicos se preguntan cómo protegerse a sí mismos y a sus familias de una posible exposición al plomo.
Esto es lo que necesita saber.
¿Qué es una línea de servicio de plomo y cuál es el problema?
Las líneas de servicio son las tuberías que conectan los edificios con las tuberías principales de agua que pasan por debajo de muchas aceras y carreteras de Connecticut. Estas líneas pueden estar hechas de todo tipo de materiales, incluyendo plástico, cobre, acero galvanizado y plomo.
Entre finales del siglo XIX y la década de 1930, era común que los constructores de viviendas y las empresas de agua utilizaran plomo para realizar estas conexiones de plomería. En muchas partes del país, el plomo se consideró una opción viable hasta su prohibición federal en 1986.El problema con las tuberías de plomo es que el metal puede filtrarse al agua que circula por las tuberías. Esto es un problema porque ningún nivel de plomo en el cuerpo humano se considera seguro.En los adultos, los niveles elevados de plomo pueden afectar la función renal y contribuir a problemas cardiovasculares, y en los niños puede causar retrasos en el desarrollo, dificultades de aprendizaje y problemas de comportamiento.
¿Cuántas líneas de servicio de plomo quedan en Connecticut y dónde están ubicadas?
Según los datos recopilados por los sistemas de agua comunitarios de Connecticut, podría haber cerca de 8,000 líneas de servicio de plomo aún bajo tierra, aunque es probable que esa cifra cambie a medida que las autoridades continúen inspeccionando viviendas y desenterrando tuberías de agua antiguas.
Sin embargo, estas líneas de plomo no están distribuidas equitativamente en todo el estado. Algunas empresas de servicios públicos están encontrando muy poco plomo en sus sistemas, mientras que otras predicen que cientos o miles de casas, apartamentos y otros edificios podrían verse afectados.
Los datos iniciales proporcionados al Departamento de Salud Pública de Connecticut muestran que lugares como Bridgeport, Waterbury, Willimantic, New London, Middletown y Greenwich contienen una cantidad significativa de líneas de servicio de plomo. Sin embargo, algunas empresas de servicios públicos apenas están comenzando a evaluar cuántas líneas de plomo podrían permanecer en sus sistemas.
La cantidad de líneas de servicio de plomo en un sistema de agua depende en gran medida de los años en que se construyó el sistema público y de los materiales que las empresas de servicios públicos utilizaron a lo largo de su historia para realizar las conexiones.
¿Cómo sé si tengo una línea de servicio de plomo?
Muchas empresas de servicios públicos han creado mapas que permiten a los clientes de agua buscar su dirección para saber si tienen o no una línea de servicio de plomo. Aquarion Water, Connecticut Water Company y muchos de los sistemas de agua municipales más grandes del estado tienen enlaces a esos mapas en línea.
CT Mirror creó una herramienta de búsqueda para los 60 sistemas de agua más grandes del estado.
Las nuevas regulaciones federales exigieron que las empresas de servicios públicos enviaran avisos a los clientes si sospechaban que la línea de servicio contenía plomo o si no estaban seguros de su material.
Algunas empresas de servicios públicos también están solicitando ayuda a sus clientes para identificar las líneas de servicio de plomo. Muchas empresas de servicios públicos han pedido a los clientes que tomen fotos de sus líneas de agua en el acceso al sótano o al espacio de acceso.
Y han proporcionado guías paso a paso, como esta, para investigar el material utilizado en su línea de servicio.
¿Por qué las autoridades están investigando estas líneas ahora y qué harán al respecto?
Si bien las tuberías de plomo se prohibieron a mediados de la década de 1980, la iniciativa para eliminar las tuberías de servicio de plomo antiguas no cobró impulso hasta después de la crisis del agua en Flint, Michigan, en 2014.
Esta crisis se desató cuando las autoridades de Flint cambiaron la fuente de agua potable de la ciudad, lo que provocó que las tuberías de servicio y otras tuberías filtraran cantidades significativas de plomo al agua corriente.
Para intentar prevenir emergencias de salud pública similares, las autoridades federales adoptaron nuevas regulaciones federales el año pasado, que exigen que todas las empresas de servicios públicos que atiendan a más de 25 personas identifiquen cuántas tuberías de plomo tienen y las reemplacen todas en los próximos 10 años.
La Agencia de Protección Ambiental de EE. UU. estima que podría haber entre 6 millones y 10 millones de tuberías aún en uso en todo Estados Unidos.
Reemplazar todas esas líneas de servicio probablemente sea un proceso costoso y lento. Mientras tanto, la mayoría de las empresas de servicios públicos seguirán tratando el agua con inhibidores de corrosión, compuestos que ayudan a evitar que las tuberías filtren grandes cantidades de plomo al agua del grifo.
¿Qué precauciones puedo tomar si mi casa tiene una línea de servicio de plomo?
El Departamento de Salud Pública de Connecticut y muchas de las empresas de servicios de agua del estado recomiendan a los clientes con líneas de servicio de plomo, ya sea sospechadas o confirmadas, que tomen varias medidas de precaución para limitar su posible exposición.
Recomiendan limpiar los aireadores de los fregaderos. Se trata de las pequeñas rejillas que se encuentran en las puntas de la mayoría de los grifos de cocina y baño.
También recomiendan dejar correr el agua durante varios minutos antes de usarla para cocinar o beber.
Sin embargo, la mejor manera de protegerse contra la exposición al plomo es usar un filtro de agua certificado para eliminar el plomo del agua potable. Puede obtener más información sobre la certificación de este filtro aquí.

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)The union representing more than 1,600 Hormel workers in Austin announced a class action lawsuit on Wednesday alleging the meat processing giant violated Minnesota’s earned sick and safe time law for 14 months by forcing workers to use vacation time if they called in sick.
Minnesota’s sick and safe time law, passed under a Democratic trifecta in 2023, requires employers to provide one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked — up to six days per year for a full-time worker. Workers may use the time to recover from an illness, care for a sick loved one, seek safety from domestic abuse or because of weather-related closures.
Tim Louris, the attorney representing the workers, said Hormel refused to provide most of its production, maintenance and quality control employees with additional paid leave when the law took effect in 2024.
UFCW Local 663, the workers’ union, challenged Hormel and a labor arbitrator ruled earlier this year that the company could not use paid vacation to comply with the state law. The union called the lawsuit a “first of its kind.”
Louris said the company began following the law on March 1 but still owes workers compensation for robbing them of the benefit for more than a year. He could not provide an estimate for how much he believes workers are owed.
Hormel said in a statement it does not comment on pending litigation.
Longtime Hormel worker Dan Lenway — lead plaintiff in the lawsuit — said the law has been a lifeline for workers, who used to face disciplinary action for missing work due to illness.
“It means we don’t have to risk our jobs or our wages just to take care of our health or our families,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, stood alongside workers at the Austin Labor Center in support of their lawsuit and the state’s sick leave law.
“I don’t want to have to think about the sandwich that I’m going to eat … I want workers in our food industry to come to work healthy,” Murphy said.
The law has faced stiff resistance from many business leaders and Republicans, who with moderate Senate Democrats pushed to weaken the law this year. That effort largely failed, with the Legislature approving only minor tweaks to the rules.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P1230381-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-30 13:56:37.743738

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
The Rev. Steven Bland Jr., the senior pastor of Liberty Temple Baptist Church and a community activist, will join the Detroit school district’s board as its new member.
Bland’s appointment was approved by the Detroit Public Schools Community District board in a vote during a special meeting Monday night at Martin Luther King Jr. Senior High School.
“I’m humbled to have the privilege to serve, and I’m excited about this season for Detroit Public Schools Community District,” Bland told Chalkbeat after the meeting.
Bland was selected out of 14 candidates who applied for the position, which opened this month following Angelique Peterson-Mayberry’s resignation on July 2. He will finish out her term through the end of 2026.
Bland leads several community-based ministries and youth outreaches, including Project R.I.S.E., which stands for Rigorous Instruction to Supplement Education.
During his interview with the board, the pastor said he’s worked to improve chronic absenteeism through church outreach. He said he will continue to focus on the issue in his new position.
“If we want to educate our students, they need to be present,” he said. “And they need to be not only there physically, but help to make sure that they have proper nutrition, make sure that they have emotional stability, make sure that they have support.”
The candidates included district parents, educators, an administrator currently employed by the school system, a philanthropist, and an attorney.
They were scored on their interviews and application materials by each board member. Board Chair Bishop Corletta J. Vaughn said during the meeting the candidates’ scores were stored in sealed envelopes that were not opened until the Monday night meeting.
Scores for all of the candidates were tallied by independent third party legal counsel live on stage for more than an hour during the meeting.
Once the third party identified Bland as the candidate with the highest score, his name was announced and the board voted on his appointment.
The board voted unanimously in favor of Bland’s appointment. Board member Ida Carol Simmons-Short was not in attendance.
Bland was sworn into office after the vote
Candidate interviews took place in four public meetings last week.
Each candidate submitted a letter of intent, a resume, and responses to survey questions earlier this month. Only the survey responses have been made available to the public.
Chalkbeat asked the district for all of the materials and was told an open records request was necessary to review them. A request was filed last week, and the district responded that it needed an extension until Aug. 11 to provide the documents.
During the selection process, three candidates withdrew their applications before they were interviewed. One person dropped out as questions arose about the use of ChatGPT in application materials attributed to her.
Bland will take Peterson-Mayberry’s seat on the board’s Academic Committee. Board member Monique Bryant will take the position of chair of the committee.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)State and local health officials confirmed the first detections of West Nile Virus in Montana for summer 2025.
Virus activity appears to be widespread across the state, and the Department of Public Health and Human Services is urging all Montanans to take increased precautions against mosquito bites.
Four mosquito pools have tested positive for West Nile Virus, including three in Lewis and Clark County and one in Cascade County. Detection of the virus in mosquitoes is an early indicator that activity is increasing within the state, elevating the risk of human illness.  Additionally, Sheridan, Custer, and Daniels Counties have each reported one confirmed case of the virus in horses, totaling three positive horses in Montana so far this season.
West Nile Virus can cause illness in humans after a bite from an infected Culex mosquito. The increased risk of transmission to humans is expected to continue through October, or as long as mosquitoes remain active in the state.
“Illness caused by WNV can vary significantly in severity,” said DPHHS Vectorborne Disease Epidemiologist Devon Cozart. “Although some people may not experience any symptoms at all, many people experience the onset of flu-like symptoms such as body aches and fatigue that may persist for weeks to months. Severe, neurological cases of WNV also occur every year in Montana, which may lead to death or permanent disability like blindness or paralysis. Don’t take a chance; prioritize avoiding mosquito bites whenever possible.”
Currently, there is no vaccine or targeted medication for the virus in humans, aside from supportive care. Most people who become infected with West Nile will be asymptomatic, but 1-in-5 experience mild symptoms, including headache, rash, body aches, joint pains, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea. Fatigue and body aches may persist for weeks following infection.
About 1-in-150 human infections result in severe disease, referred to as neuroinvasive West Nile. Neuroinvasive West Nile can cause neurological symptoms, including disorientation, stupor, coma, paralysis, vision loss, and convulsions. West Nile Virus can be fatal or lead to long-term neurological complications.
Horses can also be infected with West Nile Virus. Horse owners may contact their veterinarian to obtain an annual vaccine to protect against the virus.
Preventing mosquito bites is important while spending time outdoors in the summer, especially during dusk and dawn, which are peak feeding activity times for female Culex mosquitoes. Permethrin is an insect repellent that can be utilized to treat clothing and gear, including tents. The Environmental Protection Agency also maintains lists of approved insect repellents that can be applied directly to the skin.
Emptying standing water at least once per week is important to keep mosquitoes away from homes. For items such as rain barrels, apply a screen to the opening to restrict mosquito access.
For other mosquito bite prevention tips, check out the 4 Ds of mosquito bite prevention below.
The 4 Ds of Mosquito Bite Prevention include:

DEET: Use insect repellent containing effective ingredients such as DEET or picaridin. To verify the effectiveness of insect repellent, go to the EPA’s website: epa.gov/insect-repellents.
Drain: Drain standing water around the house to prevent mosquito breeding.
Dawn/Dusk: Mosquitoes are most active during dawn and dusk. Stay inside or take extra precautions to prevent mosquito bites during these times. If doors or windows are left open in the summer, make sure they’re fitted with screens to keep mosquitoes out of the house.
Dress: When possible, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants to protect against bites.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Culex-quinauefasciatus.jpg,,,2025-07-30 13:56:37.743738

George Nigh and his wife, Donna, work the serving line at the annual Red Andrews Christmas Dinner at the Myriad in December 1979. (Photo by Bob Albright/ Oklahoma Historical Society)OKLAHOMA CITY – George Nigh, a former governor who opened the door for women to serve on the state’s highest court, has died. He was 98.
Nigh family spokesman Bob Burke said Nigh passed away Wednesday morning at home surrounded by family.
Born June 9, 1927, in McAlester to Wilber and Irene Nigh, George Nigh holds the record for time served in the Governor’s Office. He formally served four times as governor, the most of any politician in state history.
State leaders remembered the Democrat as a man who put his state first and served as a mentor to many.
“He was a great man, but perhaps more importantly, he was a really good guy,” said former Gov. Brad Henry. “Few, if any, have had as significant of an impact on our state for as long as George did.” 
Nigh was a teacher, former state representative and lieutenant governor. He served in the U.S. Navy and as president of the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond.
In 1950, constituents elected Nigh, then 23, to the state House, making him the youngest member of the Legislature.
He was the author of the bill that made “Oklahoma!,” the state song.
Nigh told people he knew as early as the ninth grade that he wanted to be governor.
When he first ran for governor in 1962, he lost, but served in the post for nine days in January 1963 following the death of U.S. Sen. Robert S. Kerr. Then Gov. J. Howard Edmondson resigned to fill the seat.
In 1978, Nigh finally achieved his dream of being elected governor, but when David Boren left office five days early to become a U.S. senator, he became governor a second time for those few days until he was sworn in to begin his own term. 
Voters ultimately elected him to serve two full terms in the Governor’s Office.
As governor, Nigh increased the number of minorities serving on state boards and commissions and in agency leadership roles.
Nigh appointed the state’s first two female supreme court justices, the late Alma Wilson and Yvonne Kauger, who is retired.
“I once asked him if it was really his idea to appoint me or was it (his wife) Donna’s, and he said he was taking credit for it,” Kauger said.
Nigh also appointed Steven Taylor, a now retired Oklahoma Supreme Court justice and McAlester resident, to the district court bench in 1984.
“His passion was to get things done in a bipartisan way,” Taylor said. 
Former Gov. Mary Fallin said Nigh’s leadership was grounded in integrity, bipartisanship and humility.
“He devoted his life not just to governing, but elevating our state’s spirit – whether through promoting Oklahoma tourism, supporting education, or simply being a good neighbor,” Fallin said. “He was the kind of statesman every generation hopes for.” 
Some remembered Nigh as a gifted and sought after storyteller and speaker who wrote some of his speech notes on his hands.
“I will miss his wonderful stories that at the age of 98 he would sprinkle with precise names, dates and places that was simply astounding,” said former Gov. David Walters.
Burke, an attorney and Nigh’s biographer, called him “the modern Will Rogers for his beloved state.”
Nigh in 2009 spoke with John Erling with Voices of Oklahoma about his lengthy career and life experiences.
“I am very fortunate,” Nigh said. “I’ve had a wonderful life. I got to fulfill my dream.”
Nigh is survived by his wife Donna; daughter, Georgeann Duty and husband Steve; sister Mary Cargill; two granddaughters and three grandsons.
The family is expected to announce a public memorial service at a later date.

(Left photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current; right photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)The presumed frontrunners for Rhode Island’s 2026 gubernatorial race continue to flex their fundraising muscles more than a year ahead of a potential rematch between Helena Buonanno Foulkes and Gov. Dan McKee.
The respective campaigns issued statements Tuesday touting second quarter financials ahead of Friday night’s reporting deadline to the Rhode Island Board of Elections. Neither Foulkes nor McKee had yet submitted reports detailing donors and expenses for the three-month period that ended June 30 as of Wednesday morning.
Foulkes, a former CVS executive who lost to McKee by 3 percentage points in the 2022 gubernatorial primary, ended the second quarter reporting period with $2.1 million cash on hand, after raising more than $636,000 in individual donations, Jon Romano, her campaign advisor, said in a statement.
Foulkes’ latest influx of donations is more than triple that of McKee, who brought in $205,000 in second quarter donations to end with $879,000 cash on hand, Rob Silverstein, McKee’s campaign manager, said in a statement. However, Silverstein also noted McKee’s latest account balance is $162,000 more than what he had in the bank at this point leading up to the 2022 election. 
“Governor McKee will be re-elected because he has a strong record of fighting for Rhode Islanders and delivering on the issues that matter most,” Silverstein said. “Our campaign will continue to highlight the governor’s decisive actions on raising family incomes, education, reproductive care, clean energy, and gun safety – all while articulating a forward-looking vision for the state’s future. Governor McKee is running for a second full term to build on these successes through his RI 2030 plan and stand up for Rhode Island values against Washington’s radical agenda.”
While Foulkes has yet to confirm her candidacy, she just tapped seasoned campaign strategist Eric Hyers’ Kentucky-based consulting firm, as first reported by The Public’s Radio Wednesday.  Hyers managed two successful congressional campaigns for the former U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, and led Gina Raimondo to victory in Rhode Island’s 2014 governor’s race.
“We’re excited to have Eric and his team on board as Helena heads toward her final decision,” Romano said in an email Wednesday. “The strong fundraising shows Rhode Islanders are ready for new leadership, and she’ll have the resources to run a strong campaign.”
McKee hired Silverstein as campaign manager and a new campaign finance director in June.
Since announcing his intent to run for reelection in March, McKee’s favorability with voters has fallen. He received a 25% approval rating among voters in two separate polls — from the Pell Center at Salve Regina University and the Civic Health and Institutions Project’s 50 States Survey — both released earlier this month. Linked to his fall from favor was soaring skepticism over the projected cost and timeline to rebuild the Washington Bridge westbound highway, according to the Pell Center poll.
Neither poll asked voters for their opinions on Foulkes. Yet she has faced attacks from McKee’s campaign for potential ties to the opioid epidemic. Foulkes served as president of CVS Pharmacy Inc. for four years during the decade in which the U.S. Department of Justice alleged in a 2024 lawsuit that the pharmacy giant filled fake prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances. The DOJ’s complaint does not name Foulkes, but more broadly blames unnamed executives for developing and enforcing company policies that worsened the opioid crisis.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi is also said to be mulling a run for governor, with $3.4 million cash on hand as of March 31, though he has repeatedly denied it when asked. Shekarchi had also not submitted his second quarter financial report as of Wednesday morning.

A growing list of politicians and groups who received money from the conservative lending firm First Liberty Building & Loan and its founder, Brant Frost IV, are sending donations back after Frost was implicated in a purported $140 million Ponzi scheme that feds say started around 2021 and scammed 300 investors.
A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint says Frost donated more than $570,000 of those investor funds to right-wing candidates and groups across multiple states, though the full number could end up being higher, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s office.
First Liberty targeted right-wing and Christian groups, and its now-defunct website touted efforts to fund food pantries, a crisis intervention program for middle school boys and other good works.
“At First Liberty Building & Loan, we believe that charitable giving is a fundamental part of our responsibility as authentic followers of Christ,” Frost said on First Liberty’s website. “By choosing us for your financial needs, you can rest assured that we prioritize giving back to our community. We support charities and organizations that align with our values, and we are committed to making a positive impact in the lives of those less fortunate among us.”
Instead, the SEC complaint alleges that Frost transferred more than $5 million of investor funds to himself and his family. The complaint alleges Frost took in investor money for short-term loans for worthy small businesses, but instead spent it on luxury items including a Maine vacation home, jewelry and a $20,000 watch.

“We call these affinity frauds, where you base it on a certain group, and this is very religious Christians and Republicans,” said Gregory Hays of Atlanta-based Hays Financial Consulting, who was appointed by a U.S. district court judge to receive the money from those returning the funds. “So most of all the victims are either in politics or very faith-based investors, and all of them that I talked to were influenced by the charitable giving and the feel-good side of the company.”
Frost allegedly painted a rosy picture of the loans’ performance to investors, but in reality the majority of the loans that were made went into default, and Frost was using money from new investors to make interest payments to previous investors.
Now, the investors are left holding the bag.
“It’s just devastating to them,” Hays said. “There’s a lot of retirement money. I talked to one gentleman this morning that put $300,000 in, and he said it was all his retirement money, the $300,000. So it’s having some devastating impact on a lot of people.”
  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. (Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whose office is investigating First Liberty alongside the SEC, issued an earlier statement calling on recipients to return political contributions from the company or from members of the Frost family. Raffensperger told media outlets he personally returned about $8,400 after learning of the allegations.
As of Wednesday, Hays said recipients had returned about $60,000. By Monday afternoon, that number had increased to $130,000. The response has been intense enough for Hays to set up an automated response to emails warning that he may be slow to write back due to the heavy work load as he fields calls and emails from the investors and hundreds of politicians.
“There was a big hurry right after the secretary of state asked for all Georgia Republicans to return the money, and so we had calls from a lot of different politicians wanting to return the money, and that was before we even found a report of some of the donations,” he said. “We haven’t sent out demands to recover money yet from the politicians, it’s just people are searching their own records and returning money.”
Still, Hays said the process will take a long time to play out.
Frost issued a statement through his attorneys earlier this month taking “full responsibility” and asking that “everyone allow the receiver time to sort things out and do his best to repair the damage I created.”

Payback time

State and federal donation records for First Liberty, Frost and his immediate family members show donations to conservative candidates dating back to the early 2000s, with one in 1995, but stepping up around 2021, when the illegal activity is alleged to have begun.
Some of the recipients are well-known conservative firebrands on the national stage, like Colorado Congresswoman Lauren Boebert and former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, who each received $2,900 from First Liberty in the 2024 election cycle, according to campaign records.

One of the top beneficiaries of the First Liberty money was Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell, who is running for Alabama Secretary of State. Frost gave Sorrell $71,000, and Sorrell’s PAC made a loan to First Liberty. Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont and Alabama State Board of Education member Allen Long also received donations. Sorrell and Harrison have both said they plan to return the money.
Members of the Frost family and First Liberty have donated more than $50,000 to the state Republican Party in Georgia since 2001 through numerous donations, some as small as $10. Georgia Republican Party Chair Josh McKoon said last week that the party had searched its records and returned $36,843.97, the amount they determined came in since the start of 2021.
“On behalf of our Party, I am profoundly saddened that members of our conservative movement, along with many others, were misled by false promises of safe investments. This has left countless Georgians facing uncertain futures and financial distress,” McKoon said.
Records show three donations from members of the Frost family to Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019, before the scheme was alleged to have begun, totaling $7,500. Kemp’s campaign said the governor sent $13,800 in donations to Hays’ office.
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who is running for governor next year, received $1,000 from a Frost family member and is sending it to Hays, a campaign spokesperson said.
Several of Georgia’s sitting Republican members of Congress received donations, including Congressmen Brian Jack, Andrew Clyde and Rich McCormick, each of whom records show received thousands of dollars from First Liberty and the Frost family since 2021.
Congressman Barry Loudermilk’s most recent donation of $3,600 came in 2014, records show. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and Congressman Rick Allen received only $80 and $50 respectively from First Liberty in 2024.

A spokesperson for Jack’s office said in a statement he immediately returned two donations and emphasized that they made up a small portion of his support.
“Since announcing his campaign for Congress in March 2024, Congressman Jack has received 28,473 donations,” said spokeswoman Alex Stone. “Just 2 of those donations were from individuals who either identified First Liberty as their employer or are named in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s complaint charging First Liberty.”
Jack won his seat last year, replacing retired GOP Congressman Drew Ferguson in the west Georgia district, which includes Newnan where Frost resides.
First Liberty spent big in that race, also supporting at least two of the men who faced Jack in the GOP primary for that seat, records show, including more than $10,000 to former state Sen. Mike Crane and $7,500 in payments to businessman Jim Bennett.
McCormick’s office also confirmed he plans to return donations, which include $11,600 from First Liberty in 2024, according to FEC records.
Georgia Public Service Commission member Tim Echols, who is up for reelection this year, said he has returned two $1,000 donations to the receiver.
The Frosts also spent on lesser-known candidates, in some cases funding challenges to established incumbents.
State Rep. Jordan Ridley, a Woodstock Republican who is returning $3,000 he received in 2022, said the Frosts were fixtures at state Republican events.
“They were definitely big in fundraising for your more right leaning-candidates,” he said. “They were always a staple at the state party events, with tables and things like that. Definitely very active, very involved and very supportive financially.”
Ridley said he was referred to the Frost family by another member of the General Assembly as a potential fundraising source.
Campaign finance records show that other state lawmakers  who received First Liberty money include Woodstock Rep. Charlice Byrd, Buford Rep. David Clark, Locust Grove Rep. Noelle Kahaian, Columbus Rep. Carmen Rice, Trenton Sen. Colton Moore and Johns Creek Sen. Shawn Still.
Ridley said he’s talked with colleagues in the Legislature who received the donations and most will be ready to give back their donations without much persuasion.
“For anybody to run a Ponzi scheme or take somebody else’s money like that is just completely unacceptable, and I feel for the victims and I hope they get back as much as possible,” Ridley said.
Ridley said Frost may have been a prolific donator, but losing his money won’t hurt Republicans in 2026 or beyond.
“I don’t think they were that big of a donor statewide for that many people that it’s going to have that big of an impact,” he said. “For some candidates, sure, it may be a lot, but for me, I received a donation one time three years ago. For me, it’s not going to be an issue, and for a lot of my colleagues I know who have received money. They weren’t the only donor or a massive donor, they were just a piece of the pie.”

Service Oklahoma announced the change Wednesday after input from residents, lawmakers and others following its implementation of a new.
“We understand that any change to government services takes some getting used to, and I know some Oklahomans were caught off guard by the shift to electronic titles,” said Sen. Chuck Hall, R-Perry.
Individuals without an active lien on their vehicle can obtain a paper copy, the agency said.
On July 1, the agency began issuing most titles electronically based on the new law Hall authored. The change was made to enhance efficiency, lower storage costs, reduce paperwork and risk of loss or theft.
“We’ve listened closely to customers and legislators over the past few weeks and are making adjustments that reflect the feedback we’ve received,” said Jay Doyle, Service Oklahoma chief executive officer. “Offering a paper title option for vehicles without a lien gives Oklahomans the flexibility they’ve asked for while continuing to deliver the advantages of a digital system.”
In Oklahoma, vehicle titles are held by the lien holder until the loan is paid off.
Paper titles may be requested online through the OkCARS website or in person at any licensed operator location.
“I appreciate Service Oklahoma making this transition smoother and offering residents greater flexibility moving forward by giving them the option to ask for a paper title if they want one,” Hall said. “Over time, I’m confident Oklahomans will come to appreciate how electronic titles make the process faster, simpler and more secure.”

The provision was inserted into House Bill 183, which originally focused on wake surfing restrictions on Lake Glenville in Jackson County. But in a last-minute revision, lawmakers added a language that alters how Louisburg, a town in Franklin County, elects its mayor.
The change requires a runoff election if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote. If only two candidates file for the office, however, the winner will be determined by a simple plurality. Town council elections will not be affected by the change and will continue to be decided by plurality. 
The incumbent, Mayor Christopher Neal, said runoff elections create unnecessary burdens for voters, especially those with limited time and resources. He cited studies that have shown a significant drop in voter turnout for runoff elections, often with participation declining by 40% or more between the initial primary and the second round of voting.
“That puts a burden on seniors, single mothers, working people who have to take off and vote,” he said at the press conference. 
Town leaders say they were not consulted and only learned of the provision after the bill had already passed both chambers of the legislature and became law on June 26.
Because the measure was a local bill applying only to specific jurisdictions, it did not require the governor’s signature to become law.
Neal questioned why the provision was added so late and by whom. He noted that the bill was sponsored by Rep. Mike Clampitt, R-Transylvania, whose district is more than 300 miles from Louisburg. A review of the recording of the House session on June 25 — the day the conference report containing the addition was adopted — revealed that no explanation was provided for the provision or the bill before it was voted on. The Senate does not archive recordings of its sessions.
“Only reason that I can come up with this bill being passed is because of Louisburg having an African American mayor… hopefully someone else can offer a much better [explanation],” Neal said. Neal is the only Black mayor in Franklin County.
Local leaders demanded transparency and answers from lawmakers about who pushed for the provision and why it was added without input from the community it affects. 
  Rep. Matthew Winslow (R-Franklin) (Photo: NCGA)
Andrea Woodin, the Franklin County Democratic chair, called for “complete transparency” from Rep. Matthew Winslow, R-Franklin. “The voters deserve the whole story,” she said during the press conference. Winslow and Sen. Lisa Barnes — also a Republican — are the only two lawmakers who represent Franklin County in the legislature.
Newsline efforts to contact Reps. Clampitt and Winslow were unsuccessful.
“There’s a problem with people trying to turn municipality elections, which are supposed to be nonpartisan, into a partisan pony race,” said Deborah Maxwell, president of the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP. “That is not fair.”
The town estimates runoff elections could cost between $7,000 and $10,000, which they say is a burden for a small municipality with limited resources. The Town Council has unanimously passed a resolution opposing the law. “They immediately understood what was going on. They immediately realized that this was done in the dead of night and that we would not want to have this,” Neal said. 
Neal said they are exploring legal and legislative options to reverse the change and prevent similar measures from being pushed through without local consent.

Two members of the New Castle County Council are urging the county to launch an independent audit of its recent property reassessment, citing widespread concerns from residents and community groups about the fairness and transparency of the process.
Councilmembers David Tackett and Brandon Toole announced Tuesday that they want an external review of the reassessment conducted by Tyler Technologies, the Texas-based company hired by the county to carry out the update.
The reassessment marked the first countywide property value review in decades and has drawn significant criticism from homeowners.
“I have heard countless stories from our neighbors who are grappling with property assessments that seem disconnected from market realities and previous valuations,” Tackett said. “Many residents feel that the methodology used by Tyler Technologies lacks transparency, and the appeals process has not adequately addressed their concerns.”

Toole echoed Tackett’s concerns and highlighted what he sees as uneven treatment between residential and commercial properties.
“This significant shift in the tax burden on residential properties requires  careful investigation,” Toole said.
Among the key issues raised by the councilmembers:

Lack of Transparency: Homeowners have expressed confusion about how Tyler Technologies determined property values, citing limited access to the data and criteria used.
Inconsistent Assessments: Reports of similar properties receiving vastly different assessments within the same neighborhoods have fueled frustration. In some cases, high-value commercial properties saw notable decreases in assessed value, lowering their tax burden.
Impact on Vulnerable Residents: Seniors, low-income families, and long-term homeowners on fixed incomes may face disproportionate increases in their property taxes, potentially threatening their ability to remain in their homes.
Flawed Appeals Process: Critics have described the appeals process as inadequate, with many denied or given minor adjustments that don’t fully address their concerns.

Tackett and Toole say the only way to restore public confidence is to conduct an independent audit of the reassessment process.
“An independent audit is not just a request; it’s a critical step towards restoring public trust and ensuring that every homeowner is assessed fairly and accurately,” Tackett said.
The call for an audit comes as the reassessment continues to draw scrutiny from residents and community advocates across New Castle County. County officials have not yet publicly responded to the audit request.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-30-at-12.30.24-PM.png,,,2025-07-30 12:58:25.808436

He is filling the spot vacated by former Chief Shawn Burke, who resigned in March to become interim chief in the neighboring Burlington Police Department. Burke joined the South Burlington Police Department in 2018, becoming chief in 2019 when Police Chief Trevor Whipple retired.
Breault joined the New Hampshire seacoast region city of more than 33,000 in 1998. He has a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice, a Master of Public Administration and graduated from the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Academy in 2018, according to the release.

Breault was chosen by Baker after a nationwide search drew 14 applicants. He is set to receive a salary of $160,000.
“The rigor of the selection process for our new chief was thorough and inclusive. Chief Breault was impressive throughout,” City Councilor Elizabeth Fitzgerald, who was part of the advisory team created for the hiring process, said in the release.
Breault is set to join the department on Oct. 6. Deputy Chief Sean Briscoe, who has been serving as interim chief since February, plans to return to his deputy role at that time, according to the release.

(Courtesy of Senate Democrats)A Republican state senator wants to see Pennsylvania’s minimum wage increased to $11 an hour.
Sen. Dan Laughlin (R-Erie) announced his plan Wednesday to introduce legislation that would gradually raise the wage in three phases.
The first increase would be to $9 per hour, effective Jan. 1, 2026, while the second jump would be implemented on Jan. 1 2027, for $10 per hour, and the final phase would be $11 per hour, effective Jan. 1, 2028.
“This legislation is about catching up,” Laughlin said. “Most employers in Pennsylvania are already paying above minimum wage because they have to in order to attract workers. It’s time the law reflects that reality.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pennsylvania’s minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, which is the same as the federal minimum wage and is lower than all bordering states – New York, Ohio, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and Delaware. Laughlin’s proposal would put the commonwealth’s figure ahead of Ohio and West Virginia, but behind its other neighboring states.
It has not increased in the commonwealth since 2008 and Laughlin said that puts Pennsylvania at a competitive disadvantage. 
“Raising the minimum wage is not just about fairness. It’s also an economic necessity,” Laughlin said. “It helps reduce dependence on public assistance, boosts consumer spending and strengthens local economies.”
There have been multiple efforts to raise the minimum wage over the past several sessions in the General Assembly.
In June, the state House passed a bill along party lines that would increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour for most Pennsylvanians, while smaller, rural counties would see it raised to $12 per hour effective Jan. 1, 2028.
That bill has not advanced in the Republican majority state Senate. Laughlin emailed the Capital-Star following the passage of the House Bill that he would not support a bill with a county-by-county approach.
“While I appreciate that the House is trying to advance the conversation, I do not support HB 1549 in its current form,” Laughlin said at the time. “A minimum wage tied to county size just deepens the economic divides we’re supposed to be addressing. If we’re going to get serious about raising the minimum wage, we need to do it uniformly across the state, not with a patchwork approach that leaves people behind based on where they live.”

This is not the first time that Laughlin, who has also authored bipartisan legislation to legalize adult-use cannabis, has called for increasing the wage. Two years ago, he proposed an increase to $15 per hour by 2026, beginning with $11 per hour on Jan. 1. 2024, and permanently index it to inflation thereafter.
He describes his current proposal as a “modest, phased approach designed to help workers keep pace with the rising cost of living without placing sudden burdens on small businesses.”
Laughlin plans to formally introduce his measure in the coming weeks.

(LRC Public Information)Embattled Democratic state Rep. Daniel Grossberg wants to take his case against the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission to federal court. 
Attorneys for Grossberg of Louisville filed a motion to dismiss his case in Franklin County Circuit Court earlier this month. The commission found “probable cause” that Grossberg, who has been accused of inappropriate behavior toward women, committed ethics violations. 
Grossberg’s attorneys wrote that Grossberg’s constitutional rights under the 7th Amendment were violated, which prompted the request to go to federal court. Their argument relies on a 2024 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said that when the commission seeks civil penalties against a defendant for securities fraud, the defendant has a right to a jury trial. 
Thomas Clay, one of Grossberg’s lawyers, told the Kentucky Lantern Wednesday morning that the 2024 decision says if an administrative agency acts “as judge, jury and executioner on a citizen,” then the citizen has a right to a jury trial. The high court ruling may also impact other administrative agencies with internal trial boards, like the Kentucky State Police, Clay added. 
“It’s one of the most earth-shaking decisions that the Supreme Court has come out with in my practice of law for over 50 years because, basically, it says that so many of these administrative agencies that act as judge, jury and executioner, do it illegally in violation of a person’s constitutional right to a jury trial,” Clay said. 
The Legislative Ethics Commission also wanted to dismiss the case in Franklin County. It argued that Grossberg’s complaint against the commission did not state a claim for the Court to grant relief in the lawsuit and failed to demonstrate standing. Grossberg had initially asked the court to intervene in the case before a closed-door hours-long commission meeting took place in June, but Judge Thomas Wingate denied Grossberg’s motion to halt the meeting. 
Last year, Grossberg was expelled from the House Democratic Caucus and faced calls from within his party to resign his legislative seat. The allegations that he behaved inappropriately toward women came to light through reporting by the Lexington Herald-Leader. The Legislative Research Commission questioned the women about inappropriate text messages sent to them by Grossberg. Later, Foxys Gentlemen’s Club told the Herald-Leader it banned Grossberg for life after he inappropriately touched a dancer.
The ethics commission voted that it had found probable cause Grossberg violated state ethics laws after the hours-long meeting which included appearances by Grossberg and his lawyers, women who work in politics and workers from the strip club. That vote paves the way for a public hearing
Clay said a date for the commission hearing has not been scheduled yet.

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
SD Senate rejects property tax credits for nonpublic education options

For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
State regulations
As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.










If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.


– Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution


The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like across the country?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

An analysis of the federal budget bill was released by the organization on Wednesday.
One of its top-line findings was that the state budget currently being hashed out by Michigan lawmakers will see spending have to increase to more than $1 billion by the 2032 fiscal year to make up for federal cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
  Sources: May 2025 Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference Executive Summary; House Fiscal Agency, Fiscal Brief: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025; Research Council analysis of Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Executive Directive 2025-3 Report.
The bill also implements a favorable tax scheme for certain business expenditures under the federal corporate income tax, and those changes could have ripple effects on Michigan’s corporate income tax collections. That could lead to a large and immediate revenue decline – an estimated $677 million revenue reduction by the 2026 fiscal year.
SBN2025-01-OBBBA_and_its_Impact_on_Michigans_Budget
Those factors could ultimately lead the state to cut $1.1 billion in General Fund appropriations from the governor’s 2025-26 budget recommendations. By the 2032 fiscal year, the federal budget’s provisions would be on track to absorb around 40% of Michigan’s expected General Fund revenue growth.
“For years since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Michigan experienced an unexpected state revenue high driven largely by federal stimulus initiatives,” Robert Schneider, senior research associate for state affairs and lead author of the report, said in a statement. “Even before OBBBA, it was evident that those days were coming to an end and state revenue growth was returning to pre-COVID trends.”
With the enactment of the federal budget bill, Schneider said Michigan now faces an added budget challenge that will be particularly severe over the next few budget cycles.
“State lawmakers should get to work on developing a budget plan that considers these new realities,” Schneider said.

(Getty Images)One rural Tennessee school district’s approach to addressing chronic absenteeism is drawing a growing backlash from local parents.
The Lawrence County Board of Education in June adopted a policy to reject doctors’ notes as a valid excuse for a child missing school.
The new policy, effective for the school year beginning Aug. 4, also requires school officials to refer families to juvenile court if a child has missed eight days of school.
In Tennessee, truancy referrals to courts typically do not begin until a child has 18 unexcused school absences.
Director of Schools Michael Adkins said the district of about 7,000 students needed to find a way to keep kids from missing out on valuable instruction time while instilling values that will one day serve them in the workforce.
“I think we have to take a stand and say this is important,” he said when introducing the policy in June. “It’s important to come to school each and every day.
“And if you’ve got the sniffles, that’s fine. You’re going to have them when you go to work one day. We’ve all gone to work sick and hurt and beat up. I think as a group and society we’re losing that reliability and that opportunity begins in the school house.”
But parents in the district have expressed outrage over the new policy.
More than 2,700 local residents have signed a petition to overturn the policy and plan to protest at the next board meeting, scheduled for August 21.
Many have also aired their anger and concerns on a newly formed Facebook page: “We’re Not Truant! Parents Against the Absentee Policy.”
The district’s absentee policy contains escalating consequences for student absences.
As an initial measure, the school will create a “welcoming environment” in which they connect with students and families, make daily announcements about good attendance and analyze school and student data for attendance patterns in order to identify absenteeism issues early.
After a student is absent for three days, school officials may begin an intervention. The policy doesn’t specify what type of intervention.
After five days, the school would hold a conference with the student and their parents, create an “attendance contract,” hold regular follow-up meetings and conduct a written assessment of why the child has been absent.
After eight absences, the child will be referred to Lawrence County Juvenile Court, the policy says. Parents of children with chronic illnesses may submit a form that authorizes school officials to speak with a child’s doctor.
“It’s outlandish to me. One sickness could easily put you at three to five days,” said Amber Martin, a co-creator of the Facebook group and mother to a rising sixth grader.
“And then I am wasting my time in a courtroom, wasting resources in that court and with DCS and whoever else having these people involved in our lives who have no business being involved in our lives.”
Under a new policy, children who miss eight days of school in Lawrence County will be referred to juvenile court.
Martin’s son was absent five days in the previous school year to visit healthcare providers treating his ADHD, she said. He’s likely to miss school again this year for illness or doctor’s visits.
A message left with the Lawrence County Schools this week seeking comment about the policy went unreturned.
Lawrence County’s chronically absentee rate of 15.4% falls below both the state’s average of 18.7% and the national rate of about 26%, according to data published by the Tennessee Department of Education and federal government.
Whether a student has an “excused” or “unexcused” absence will not change the county’s overall rates of chronic absenteeism, noted Jeremy Singer, assistant professor of education leadership and policy, University of Michigan-Flint and co-author of “Rethinking Chronic Absenteeism,” published this year.
“Whether it’s excused or unexcused it’s still going to count as an absence and that’s still going to figure into the county’s chronic absenteeism rate,” he said.
“Changing this policy relates more to being able to use the levers of truancy law and truancy court referrals, because where ‘excused’ versus ‘unexcused’ matters is the use of those punitive channels,” he said.
Singer said punitive approaches to absenteeism may ultimately be counterproductive.
“This kind of tone and approach to families could end up disrupting or harming the kinds of relationships that schools and districts rely on to try and understand what’s going on with families,” he said.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin). The Executive Council confirmed Caitlin Davis to be the next commissioner of the Department of Education Wednesday, cementing the choice of a department insider whose nomination by Gov. Kelly Ayotte had been widely praised.
In a unanimous vote, councilors confirmed Davis to a four-year term ending in 2029. 
Davis, who most recently served as the director of education analytics and resources, had worked in the department for 15 years. She built a reputation as a neutral, data-driven financial expert, often sitting before lawmakers on the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee or Finance Committee to brief them on complicated budget spreadsheets. And she vowed to lead the department as a nonpartisan executive, carrying out both lawmakers’ and the governor’s policies without injecting her own politics. 
That position won her rare endorsements from Democrats, teachers’ unions, conservatives, and “school choice” supporters, some of whom criticized what they saw as a more openly political approach taken by outgoing Commissioner Frank Edelblut and called for more neutral leadership.
“Caitlin’s collaborative, data-driven approach will help us continue delivering a best-in-class education for all of New Hampshire’s students,” Ayotte said in a statement in June, when she first announced the nomination. 
Ahead of Wednesday’s vote, Councilor Karen Liot Hill, the sole Democrat on the council, noted the unanimous support for Davis at a multi-hour confirmation hearing Tuesday, and said she hoped Davis would represent a fresh start for the agency. 
And Councilor John Stephen, a Republican, said he appreciated Davis’ commitment to parents’ rights and to supporting nonpublic schools in addition to public schools.
Edelblut, who was asked not to seek another term by Ayotte, also endorsed Davis in June, calling her “a respected peer within the state’s education field and a pivotal member of our leadership team.”
On Wednesday, Republican Councilor David Wheeler took a moment to applaud Edelblut’s time in office.
“Thank you for his good work at the Department of Education — all the innovations that he’s brought there with his business and educational experience, helping us with EFAs, making that a reality,” said Wheeler, referring the state’s education freedom accounts.
Ayotte also thanked Edelblut for his service.
“I think it’s a testament to Commissioner Edelblut’s leadership that the new commissioner of education actually comes from within the Department of Education,” Ayotte said. She said Edelblut had been “mentoring a good team as well.”
In seeking the job, Davis styled herself as an experienced administrator. Near the start of a multi-hour confirmation hearing Tuesday, Executive Councilor Joseph Kenney, a Wakefield Republican, asked Davis whether she considered herself a “passionate educator” or a “passionate bureaucrat.”
“I suppose I’m a passionate bureaucrat, but I don’t like the term bureaucrat,” Davis replied. “… When you use the term bureaucrat, I think you take away all of the effort that state employees and the legislators and the citizens are putting into the system.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7294186-Caitlin-Davis-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-30 12:58:25.808436

The Marble Valley Regional Transit District — which operates Rutland County’s main public transportation, The Bus — is relocating Wednesday due to ongoing health and safety concerns at the state-owned Rutland Transit Center. 
For the past five years, the transit district has urged the Vermont Department of Building and General Services to maintain the “basic safety and sanitation standards of the lease agreement,” but no substantial and lasting improvements have been made at the center, according to a letter signed by the transit district’s Executive Director Jade McClallen and Board of Commissioners Chair Devon Neary.

“The conditions within and surrounding the Transit Center have deteriorated to such a degree that (the Marble Valley Regional Transit District) leadership are compelled to take immediate action to protect the health and well-being of its employees and riders,” McClallen and Neary wrote. “The facility, in its current state, is not only a public health risk but a liability that undermines broader efforts to revitalize downtown Rutland.”
In the letter sent to Gov. Phil Scott, the head of the Department of Building and Grounds, the Agency of Transportation and the Rutland City mayor, McClallen and Neary urged the state to assume responsibility for rehabilitating the Rutland Transit Center for public use.
With the support of the Rutland City leadership and the Vermont Agency of Transportation, the transit district will maintain public transportation services at the Rutland Amtrak train station parking lot in the interim, according to the letter.

Joshua Lewis, 37, was sentenced to 84 months by U.S. District Judge Gregory B. Williams following his conviction on charges related to two bank robberies committed in Wilmington and Dover in February 2023.
Lewis, who has multiple prior felony convictions, was also found in possession of a loaded “ghost gun” and additional 9mm ammunition—illegal under federal law due to his criminal record.
According to court records, Lewis stole more than $6,000 during the two robberies.

He was apprehended after attempting to flee law enforcement officers who approached him at his home.
A search of his vehicle revealed the firearm, which had no serial number, and a cache of ammunition.
“Mr. Lewis’s brazen robberies instilled fear in his victims and served only to undermine the security of our financial system,” said U.S. Attorney Julianne E. Murray. “His possession of ammunition within an untraceable gun—despite multiple prior felony convictions—only added to the danger he posed to society. This sentence reinforces the commitment of the U.S. Attorney’s Office to protecting the public and keeping guns out of the hands of people who fail to follow the law.”

Raburn's cellmate, Ladarious Racquez Barbers, has been charged with murder. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from Google Maps street view)TOPEKA — The governor, attorney general and bipartisan leaders of the Legislature agreed to a $275,000 settlement of a lawsuit filed against the Kansas Department of Corrections by the estate of Gary Raburn after he was strangled in a cell at Lansing Correctional Facility.
Attorney General Kris Kobach recommended the State Finance Council make the deal to end the suit filed in Leavenworth County District Court.
In 2024, Gov. Laura Kelly, Senate President Ty Masterson, House Speaker Dan Hawkins and others on the State Finance Council endorsed a separate $150,000 payment to Raburn’s estate to remove state prison health provider Centurion of Kansas from the lawsuit.
The Kansas Bureau of Investigation ruled Raburn’s death in 2023 was a homicide after determining he had been strangled in a two-person cell at Lansing. He was housed with Ladarious Racquez Barkers, who has been charged with capital murder.
Before the attack on Raburn, Barkers had been the subject of dozens of state prison disciplinary reports, including instances of assault, battery, arson, theft, fighting and inciting a riot while incarcerated at El Dorado, Hutchinson and Lansing. His four most recent citations in June were for battery.
Barkers had been sentenced to prison for aggravated battery and aggravated robbery in 2017. He was ordered to serve 15 years for robbing and beating a priest in Kansas City, Kansas.
The lawsuit brought by Raburn’s family alleged the Department of Corrections and Centurion were negligent for failing to protect the 62-year-old Raburn from Barkers.
At 9:30 p.m. Jan. 6, 2023, Lansing Correctional Facility contacted the KBI to report a suspicious death. Corrections department officials said LCF personnel were summoned to the cell by Barkers. Raburn was found unresponsive.
At the time of Raburn’s death, he was incarcerated for violating the state’s offender registry law. He was convicted in 2005 of aggravated kidnapping in Neosho County and served eight years in prison. He was returned to state custody after failing to meet requirements of the registry.

Immigration enforcement, the dismantling of green energy projects, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid, tax breaks for the wealthy — all of these widely discussed initiatives and more were years-long hopes for the Republican Party, and all came to fruition in the one bill.

This story originally appeared on Capital & Main




But how will the bill affect oil and gas development, particularly in New Mexico? The state is the second-biggest oil producer in the country and for decades has relied on federal help to police environmental infractions in the oilfield.
Kyle Tisdel, senior attorney with the Western Environmental Law Center, spoke with Capital & Main from his office in New Mexico about the implications of the Big Beautiful Bill on New Mexico’s most prominent industry, and what those implications could mean for the state’s environment. This interview was originally recorded July 16 for New Mexico PBS for its weekly news program New Mexico in Focus.
The print version of this interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
Capital & Main: The president’s Big Beautiful Bill spends an awful lot of language talking about oil and gas regulations in Alaska and offshore drilling. What is in it that actually pertains directly to how oil and gas operations work in New Mexico?
  Western Environmental Law Center Senior Attorney Kyle Tisdel (Courtesy photo)
Kyle Tisdel: It’s a great question. And I think we should maybe start with the beginning of the Trump administration.
And on Day One, there’s a series of executive orders and energy emergencies that are being declared. And what that did was set this policy agenda for “energy dominance.” And the notion of that is that we are going to prioritize oil and gas extraction above other uses of our public lands and resources.
And so what the bill does is essentially change the fundamental structure of how our lands are managed for fossil fuel extraction. One where for the last 50 years we have balanced — or endeavored to balance — a variety of uses, including oil and gas, but things like timber and water and recreational values and scenic values on our public lands. And what the bill does is it prioritizes and elevates oil and gas above those other uses. And of course, New Mexico has about 42 million acres of public lands that are open to mineral extraction.
So it basically gives industry a blank check to say which of those 42 million acres they want to lease and develop. And it removes the discretion from the agency to tell them no, to tell them that we’re going to prioritize other uses.
It’s also important to note that there are things called split estate lands. This is particularly important for our farmers and ranchers who might own the surface estate, but [the sub-surface minerals are] managed by BLM [the Bureau of Land Management]. And the bill eliminates the consultation requirement for industry to reach out or for BLM to reach out to landowners and say, “Hey, this is a use of your sub-surface estate that we want to use for oil and gas.” And it eliminates the ability for BLM to say no to that.
 










“The energy emergency, as far as I can tell, is something entirely contrived by the Trump administration to prioritize fossil fuel exploitation on our public lands.”


– Kyle Tisdel


So jumping back to the first part of your answer there, are you saying these executive orders sort of work hand in glove with the Big Beautiful Bill? Are they really two parts of the same thing?
And second: What is the energy emergency exactly?
The Trump administration set this “energy dominance” agenda from day one. And what we’re seeing now is the implementation of that agenda through a lot of different ways.
The Big Beautiful Bill is the congressional implementation. It does a lot of things, right, that are probably a lot of awful things.
But when it comes to the energy component of that, it really does aim to implement and fulfill the wish list of the oil and gas industry, everything that they’ve been wanting to do for a long time. Which is, again, to remove the agency’s discretion to limit oil and gas on public lands and give industry the unfettered ability to access our public lands. And it does so in a way that strips the agency of their ability to implement stipulations or mitigation measures to make oil and gas less harmful on our public lands. The bill even strips out those types of minimal protections on our public lands.
The energy emergency, as far as I can tell, is something entirely contrived by the Trump administration to prioritize fossil fuel exploitation on our public lands. And it does so in a way that both then puts its thumb on the scale of oil and gas, but it makes it harder to develop renewable resources on our public lands. And it also even does things like prioritize coal extraction, so that coal can be shipped to foreign markets.
So, if there’s truly an energy emergency, you would think, “Well, this is an all-of-the-above sort of strategy we need to unleash American energy.”
But what it aims to do actually, is unleash a certain type of American energy in a way that will take public goods, resources, minerals and allow those to be privatized for private profit by Big Oil.
You brought up removing a lot of regulations and rules, and that’s been a huge part of the president’s whole agenda going forward.
But another part of that agenda was this whole DOGE agency, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. And what that’s been doing is removing people. So, you get rid of regulations and then you’re getting rid of people as well who would be enforcing the regulations that remain.
I’m wondering if, in your work, you’ve come across a lack of people in places like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Land Management and other agencies within the Department of Interior. Have you seen that so far?
I think what we’ve all seen from DOGE in those efforts is sheer chaos at the federal level in terms of firing of federal employees and then rehiring them, and freezes by the courts. But what it has done, I think more than anything, is a couple different things.
One is that it has eliminated key positions within our agencies. These are individuals who are career employees and who have particular expertise, whether that be a particular species or segment of stream, that biologists might be responsible for tracking and managing. Or they have particular expertise on the regulation of oil and gas and the technologies and techniques that industry employs.
We are seeing this loss of capacity within our agencies. And sometimes those folks are very critical to fulfilling the oversight and management mission that our agencies are intended to employ. The other sort of element of this is that we are losing a lot of these career employees.
But “Who are we left with?” is the other question. And I wouldn’t want to ever disparage the hard-working career employees that we have. But the folks that do tend to stick around are those that are aligned with the president’s agenda in terms of how our public lands should be managed.
And so you also are seeing not only the loss of critical employees, but also this culture shift within the agencies and the loss of, maybe, unbiased folks within our agencies to something that’s maybe a little bit more aligned with the priorities of the administration.
So, this makes me wonder: The feds aren’t the only people out there doing enforcement and regulation. The state has a large role in this as well.
Do you think that the state of New Mexico and its agencies have the ability to pick up the slack where the federal government is laying off? Are there enough people? Do they have the budgets to do this?
Yeah, we have wonderful people at the state at the Oil Conservation Division. We work fairly closely with them on several initiatives. They are good, smart people, but they are also inherently understaffed and lacking capacity.
So, you know, there are very distinctive missions between an agency like the Oil Conservation Division and the responsibilities of our federal government in the management of our federal public lands. Certainly there is overlap, but in terms of analyzing the impacts — the environmental or community or cultural impacts — of oil and gas extraction on our public lands, the Oil Conservation Division is not tasked necessarily with doing that level of analysis or review of oil and gas.
So there is a large and significant role for states, including New Mexico, to fill some of the gaps. But the missions and the directives are distinctive.











“I think the question becomes: How will we emerge from the ruins of the moment that we’re in?”



Along these same sort of lines, there’s a huge amount of funding that’s being cut by the federal government to states in all sorts of different directions.
A sizable portion of both the state’s Oil Conservation Division budget and the Environment Department budget rely on federal funds to hire people in various capacities. Do you see that having a knock-on effect as well?
Certainly. I think there are certain funding streams — oil and gas well clean-up, for example — where there’s a large amount of money coming from the federal government to the states — including New Mexico — to clean up an epidemic of orphaned wells in the state.
Thus far, that money hasn’t stopped flowing, but it certainly is at risk of doing so.
And a lot of the initiatives for things like environmental justice, or outreach to communities, or engagement with frontline communities on really critical issues, that money has dried up, and we have seen a pretty dramatic pullback in terms of the federal government reaching out and engaging with communities.
So all of that money has already been pulled away.
A large part of what you do at the Western Environmental Law Center is sue the federal government on environmental grounds, personal health, grounds to keep the place cleaner. That’s kind of your job.
How do you see things changing at a Justice Department that has been seemingly weaponized against those particular ideas? Are you already seeing the effects of that? Are you already seeing the effects of a lack of people at the Justice Department or people who have been brought in specifically to fight against these sorts of topics?
We’re certainly seeing that in both staffing capacity and the position that the federal government takes on certain matters and litigation. We certainly see a shift from the positions that they took during the Biden administration and shifting course now, during the Trump 2 administration.
But I think that the real question that I’m grappling with as an attorney is there is a tremendous amount of damage that is being done at multiple levels. And we’ve touched on many of those in our conversation today. But I think the question becomes: How will we emerge from the ruins of the moment that we’re in?
And I think that the reality is, we won’t be able to rebuild a lot of the destruction that is already taking place. That would take a generation perhaps to rebuild that. Nor do I think we necessarily would want to, right?
It’s not like before the Trump administration we had intact ecosystems, and we were addressing the climate crisis with the sense of urgency that we should, and we were engaging communities and people like we should have. There’s a lot that we already needed to build upon and shift in terms of our approach to address the crises of the moment.
There’s a lot of progress that we can make in this moment at the state level in New Mexico to help hold the oil and gas industry accountable for all of the exploitation of New Mexico resources over the years, to clean up after themselves and to really set the course for what not only responsible oil and gas development looks like, but really the next stage: How do we transition away from oil and gas as a state? How do we do that financially? How do we do that economically?
And that is the overarching question that I think we’re asking ourselves at this moment: What can we do to really set the course for the type of future that we want to live in, rather than just being so forlorn about the ruins of the moment?",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-30-at-9.43.33 AM-1024x578.png,,,2025-07-30 11:57:34.595337

Josh Stein's administration overseeing Hurricane Helene recovery testify in front of state lawmakers on Thursday, May 22, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina Republican lawmakers remain frustrated at the slow trickle of Hurricane Helene aid money to western North Carolina, they told leading disaster recovery officials Wednesday.
In a committee hearing, 10 months after the record-braking storm tore through the mountains, legislators said they continued to have concerns about efforts to remove debris from roads and waterways, as well as the speed of the state’s homebuilding program.
Matt Calabria, who leads the governor’s Helene recovery office, and Will Ray, the emergency management director, told the committee that the state continued to make steady — and in some cases unprecedented — progress on both issues.
“There’s no such thing as moving fast enough,” Calabria said.
The state’s homebuilding program, Renew NC, is now open. Housing repairs in the meantime have come through a combination of federal household aid, philanthropic efforts and various other programs. And more than 14 million cubic yards of debris have been cleared from roads and rivers.
Calabria confirmed, however, that federal money has been, and continues to be, slow to arrive. And when it does, it will likely be a fraction of that received by the state after past disasters.
“I would settle for a little reckless spending right now, just to get money in the hands of the people,” said Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson).
Lawmakers have approved four total substantive aid packages after Hurricane Helene. Around 80% of the money laid out in the first two packages, passed last October, has been spent or obligated.
Since January, an additional two aid deals have totaled more than $1 billion in state funding. Agencies are working to send out the money from the first of those packages, passed in March.
The state budget office is currently reviewing lawmakers’ most recent aid bill, which totals $575 million and was enacted in late June.
And the state is still waiting on large chunks of federal aid. That includes around $685 million in money from the EPA, Calabria said, and $1.4 billion from HUD to help fund the Renew NC program.
Officials signed a grant agreement for that $1.4 billion bundle of money this week. Several other steps still need to be completed before it is released to the state.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1875-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-30 11:57:34.595337

A municipal court judge in Somerset County who oversaw truancy cases threatened children who came before him and their mothers with deportation, according to a formal complaint issued by a judicial advisory board.


The 13-page complaint released Tuesday includes transcripts of court proceedings overseen by the now-former judge, Britt J. Simon, who was a municipal judge for Bound Brook, Bridgewater, Somerville, and Raritan Borough. It accuses Simon of violating the judicial conduct code by repeatedly threatening the children and using language that created the appearance of bias.


“Your mother’s going to get deported. You are going to end your mother’s life. You want other people involved in your family business? Your mother came to this country to get a better life,” he told one 16-year-old last August, the complaint says.


In January, eight days after President Donald Trump took office for his second term, Simon told a 14-year-old that “there’s a new sheriff in town” and that the courts were a “great place” to find people facing deportation.


“You think I’m kidding? The ICE officials wait outside the door for people like you,” Simon said.


Simon has been suspended from his judicial duties since Feb. 11. The state Supreme Court’s advisory committee on judicial conduct filed the formal complaint against him Monday.


Simon’s attorney did return a request for comment.


The complaint includes details on three truancy cases overseen by Simon. It says he raised his voice, scolded the children in his courtroom, addressed them without a municipal prosecutor present, and roped in their parents for additional scoldings.


On Aug. 13, 2024, he told the 16-year-old that he’s going to be “a beggar, piece of garbage” because he doesn’t go to school. He then asked the student if his mom had legal documentation to be in the United States, to which the student said no.


“So you want to call attention to the school truant officer — two officers sitting here — that you get law enforcement involves (sic) in your lives. Don’t you? So your mother can get picked up and deported by ICE. That sound like a great idea? You’re a wonderful son. I say sarcastically because you’re not,” Simon told the teenager. “You are vile and contemptuous. You want your mother to get deported? You know what’s going to happen if she does, right?”


Simon then said he’d refer the student’s case to child protective services, adding that those workers may report his mother and “at some point, ICE is going to come and pick her up, all because of you.”


“You don’t be late. I am not kidding you. Look at your mother, get ready to say goodbye to her,” Simon said.


In another case that day involving a high school girl who was late to school every day and eventually stopped attending, Simon again turned his attention to her mother’s immigration status (the mother confirmed to Simon that she was not in the country legally).


“How are you going to feel when the law enforcement comes to the house — ICE comes to the house because they get reported this and they deport your mother because of you?” he told the girl.


On Jan. 28, Simon presided over the case of a 14-year-old girl who missed 67 of the previous 91 days of school. In this case, both the student and her parent were undocumented.


“You’re about to get plucked up by the ICE officials and sent back to El Salvador. Do you want to go there?” Simon asked the girl.


“No,” she responded.


“You miss another day for school and I’m going to personally have ICE here to pick you up,” Simon told her.

A coalition of state attorneys general is suing the Trump administration to block it from mining personal data from SNAP accounts. (Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA).A lawsuit filed against the Trump administration by a coalition of attorneys general, including Michigan’s Dana Nessel and Wisconsin’s Josh Kaul, alleges that personal data mined from federal agencies could be used illegally to build a surveillance state unlike the nation has ever seen – putting recipients for things like food assistance at risk if they are being targeted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that the president’s U.S. Department of Agriculture is illegally demanding states turn over personal and sensitive information about millions of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, recipients.
SNAP, known as FoodShare in Wisconsin, is a state-administered, federally-funded program that provides billions of dollars in food assistance to tens of millions of low-income families. Personal information is provided to state and federal administrators in order to receive assistance, with an understanding that the information will only be used for SNAP purposes.
Moves by the Trump administration to force various departments to share that data with unrelated agencies, like ICE, sets up a system where the latter could potentially track deportation targets through information provided for SNAP. The USDA has also suggested that it would withhold state funding if states fail to comply with the information sharing mandate, effectively creating a gambit where states must choose residents’ privacy over vital assistance.
“Sensitive information about people shouldn’t be turned over to the federal government simply because they applied for or received assistance through SNAP,” Kaul said in a news release Tuesday. “It’s troubling that the federal government is working to compile this kind of information.”
Nessel, speaking to reporters in a news conference this week that included California Attorney General Rob Bonta and New York Attorney General Letitia James, said the episode was yet another attempt by the Trump administration to illegally use personal and sensitive data under the guise of fighting abuse and fraud.
“My colleagues and I will not allow this administration to trample on constitutional protections or unlawfully exploit the SNAP program in this way,” Nessel said. “Michigan families deserve to have their personal information protected, and I will keep fighting until they receive exactly that.”
Since taking office, reports have indicated that Trump is amassing a huge database of personal information on Americans using that data for undisclosed purposes, much like immigration enforcement. The USDA demands regarding SNAP information appear to be another step toward that goal, the lawsuit posits.
Bonta touched on the consequences of Trump’s White House having that much personal data on Americans at its fingertips.
“It’s a bait and switch of the worst kind,” Bonta said. “SNAP recipients provided this information to get help feeding their families, not to be entered into a government surveillance database or be used as targets in the president’s inhumane immigration agenda. That’s the reality here. This isn’t about oversight and transparency. This is about establishing widespread surveillance under the guise of fighting fraud.”
Bonta added that the attorneys general in the lawsuit are calling the issue what it is: An illegal data grab designed to scare people away from public assistance programs.
James said the entire framework of Trump’s immigration policies was cruelty on public display, but the new demand regarding SNAP was a new low.
“It is outrageous. It is unacceptable,” James said. “This is not for research or to improve a service that millions count on. They are basically trying to weaponize the SNAP program against immigrant communities in violation of the law, and we collectively will not stand for it. That is the administration’s plans, and they have made it abundantly clear.”
States participating in the lawsuit include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act established a national tax credit scholarship program, but state leaders can decide whether and how to participate. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
State regulations
As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.










If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.


– Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution


The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs looks like across the country?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.

Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

USAID led the world in improving global health and eradicating diseases before they crossed U.S. borders; provided disaster relief to people facing extreme crisis, conflict, and poverty; and promoted education, economic development, environmental protection, and democratic governments around the globe. Furthermore, USAID did this on a relatively small budget: 0.6% of the 2024 U.S. budget.
USAID also directly benefitted the United States. USAID bought $2 billion annually directly from U.S. farmers to distribute around the world. USAID directly employed almost 4,500 Americans and indirectly supported tens of thousands of others. In North Carolina alone, USAID provided nearly $1 billion to North Carolina nonprofits and universities annually. Because of USAID’s destruction, its contractors—including research institutes, faith-based charities, and non-governmental groups in North Carolina—have laid off thousands of staff, with some closing their doors completely.  
What does USAID’s closure mean to the world? Boston University has estimated that nearly 300,000 people around the world—about 103 an hour, mostly children—have died in just the past six months as a result. Cuts to USAID could cause 14 million deaths by 2030, An estimated 1,500 babies a day are being born HIV-positive because USAID cuts stopped their mothers’ medication, and millions of doses of medicines—medicines that were donated by pharmaceutical companies—are sitting, expiring. Nearly $800,000 worth of food intended to go to starving families has already been destroyed because it expired, sitting in warehouses.  Looking to U.S. economic and security interests, we are already seeing China filling voids where USAID has withdrawn. 
Where, then, do we go from here? Claims that fraud, corruption, and waste were rampant in the agency are not accurate, and the myths about USAID that social media perpetuated are misinformed and erroneous. However, there certainly are ways in which foreign aid can be reimagined to be even stronger and have even greater impact. Transforming America’s approach to international development from a cumbersome bureaucracy to a more nimble, dynamic, and collaborative enterprise could be a silver lining to emerge from USAID’s abrupt closure. 
Whatever the form in which U.S. foreign aid exists moving forward, the cost of not reaching out to our global neighbors, of sitting by when we could save lives and make those lives healthier and more fulfilling, when we could prevent crises rather than using military might to stamp them down, is too great to fathom.
 As the richest country in the world, we must be more generous than that. Political tides inevitably turn, and when they do, we must be ready to embrace fresh opportunities and to rebuild our approach to international engagement with more diversity, deeper humility, greater equity, and a joyful commitment to liberty, peace, and justice for all citizens of the world. 
In the meantime, asking our congressional representatives for an accounting of where the funds will go that have been stripped from USAID—and how those funds will be even better used to improve lives here in the U.S. and to strengthen our economic, political, and security presence in the world— seems a fair question to ask.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/USAID-logo-1024x395.jpg,,,2025-07-30 11:57:34.595337

WILMINGTON — Bayard Hogans, formerly the president overseeing Enstructure’s Mid-Atlantic operations including Delaware, has departed the company, according to a recent announcement from the Port of Wilmington operations. 
Hogans’ departure comes nearly two years after he was appointed to the role in October 2023, following the state’s termination of its contract with previous port operator Gulftainer.
Enstructure stepped in with plans to revitalize the long-struggling port, including a major expansion project at the Edgemoor site.

Enstructure Co-CEOs Matthew Satnick and Philippe De Montigny issued a joint statement thanking Hogans and outlining the company’s next steps:
“We thank Bayard for his contributions to Enstructure Mid-Atlantic and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. Enstructure is actively working to ensure a smooth transition and will continue to focus on delivering innovative supply chain solutions for our customers without interruption.”

As part of its agreement with the state announced in 2024, Enstructure committed to investing $335 million in infrastructure improvements to complete the Edgemoor expansion by 2027. The state is also subsidizing a new container terminal as part of that effort.
However, the project has faced multiple challenges, including labor disputes, stalled permitting processes, and political friction over governance of the Diamond State Port Corporation.
Disagreements between Governor Matt Meyer and the Delaware General Assembly regarding board appointments have further complicated progress, prompting the legislature to revive a task force to review port management.

A team from Delaware will head to Indianapolis this August to compete in a landmark event for inclusive sports: the first-ever Women’s 3×3 Unified Basketball Tournament.
Hosted by Special Olympics North America (SONA). The tournament will be held August 7 at Bicentennial Unity Plaza, adjacent to Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the home court of the Indiana Fever.
The event is part of the 2025 SONA Conference, which will bring nearly 1,000 Special Olympics staff and supporters from the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean to Indianapolis.
Delaware’s team includes:

Elizabeth Shea, 21, a Sussex Riptide Unified Partner
Ashley Ohmott, 33, a MOT Tigers athlete
Elizabeth Nolan, 37, a Wilmington Wizards athlete
Sara Perrotta, 22, a Sussex Riptide athlete
Ella Gordon, 21, a Wilmington Wizard Unified Partner
FEIF Gallagher, Coach

“I am very excited to try the 3X3 basketball and competing with other special olympic female athletes,” Ohmott said. “It is going to be lots of fun.”
Nolan said the event means a lot to her and she’s excited to play basketball.

This year’s conference marks the 25th anniversary of SONA and carries the theme “Voices of Victory,” highlighting the diverse individuals who have shaped the inclusion movement over the past quarter-century.
The tournament will feature nine Unified basketball teams—each comprised of athletes with and without intellectual disabilities—competing side by side.
The goal is to elevate women’s participation in Unified Sports especially among girls and women with intellectual disabilities.
“Being able to represent Special Olympics Delaware is truly an honor,” Perrotta said. “I played unified basketball during my junior and senior years of high school, and at that time, I didn’t really know how Special Olympics worked outside of the school setting. Once I got involved in the community program, I was able to branch out into other sports. Doors keep opening, and I now participate in over six sports. My time spent around such a strong group of girls who are compassionate and always willing to get better makes it worthwhile. Each week, I look forward to playing alongside my teammates. Everything has come full circle, and it’s been an awesome experience! We are so excited to be competing in Indiana.”
The Women’s 3×3 Unified Tournament is more than just a competition—it’s a celebration of empowerment, leadership, and the unifying power of sport, organizers state.
Held in partnership with Pacers Sports & Entertainment and the Indiana Fever, the tournament will serve as a centerpiece of the larger SONA Conference.
In addition to the sporting event, attendees will take part in three days of workshops, networking sessions, and collaborative forums aimed at advancing the goals of the Inclusion Revolution.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-30-at-11.02.05-AM.png,,,2025-07-30 11:57:34.595337

(Photo: John Partipilo)Memphians in the predominantly Black Whitehaven and Westwood are asked to celebrate a 25% “community benefits agreement ” tied to Elon Musk’s  xAI project. But we need to be honest: what does that number really mean, and how did we get there?
This isn’t about the spirit of the Community Benefits Ordinance. I believe in the idea of codifying corporate accountability and setting a floor for how developments should reinvest in the communities they impact. That’s progress. But the substance of what’s been agreed to in this case falls short.
The percentage of the ordinance feels arbitrary. To be clear, the target isn’t grounded in Memphis precedent, nor is it tethered to a formal Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) model as seen in other cities where tax subsidies or public-private partnerships are involved. In fact, the figure appears to be more aspirational than accountable. It feels like more of a marketing metric than a mandate.
The number isn’t tied to the racial and economic demographics of the neighborhoods most affected. It hasn’t been publicly unpacked or defended in ways that help everyday people understand the math. 
And if we’re talking about environmental and economic justice in places like Westwood and Whitehaven — neighborhoods that are over 90% Black and still healing from decades of environmental harm and economic divestment — then why 25%? Why not 50%? Why not 65%, the percentage of Black people in Memphis?
What we’re being asked to accept feels like a floor built more on political pragmatism than moral clarity and monetary necessity.
NAACP, others appeal xAI turbine permits for Memphis data center

This is not an indictment of city or county leaders. I know many of them are working in good faith and under complicated circumstances. But that’s exactly why we must pause and assess the deeper patterns that keep repeating themselves. Because once again, we’re in a position where Black communities are expected to celebrate symbolic wins that don’t fully reflect the weight of what we’re being asked to carry.
We’re told xAI is a win for Memphis. But the Shelby County Health Department granted permits for Colossus I and the plant was activated before most of the public even understood what was happening. Colossus II is already underway. The permitting process, though technically legal, has clearly failed to ensure sufficient environmental oversight or community protection on the front end. That’s a policy problem, not just a public relations one.
And it’s why I support the legal challenges currently underway, led by the Southern Environmental Law Center, the NAACP, Memphis Community Against Pollution (MCAP) and Young, Gifted & Green. Their collective efforts to appeal the air permits are not just about slowing a development, they are about protecting people. About pushing for the kind of procedural integrity that should’ve been there in the first place.
We need more elected officials to stand with them, not just in press conferences, but in policy. We need laws that close the loopholes that allow corporations to go 364 days without regulation, exploiting silence, confusion, or lack of clarity. Because without clearer laws, stronger oversight, and enforceable timelines, what’s to stop this from happening again?
That’s where the CBO falls short. The financial figure, in theory, is a step in the right direction. But without transparent particulars and processes, it’s just a number. A decent move, yes, but dangerously incomplete.
Groups petition EPA to act as ozone levels in Memphis exceed national health standards

I also have a lingering unease about how this CBO framework might end up intersecting with broader issues of public safety. In a city still reeling from the Department of Justice report on the Memphis Police Department’s pattern and practice of excessive force and racial bias, it’s hard to separate the enthusiasm around corporate expansion from the silence around state-sanctioned violence. 
Community members deserve more than job training and infrastructure improvements.  We deserve protection, transparency, and a political apparatus that prioritizes their safety as much as it does Silicon Valley’s satisfaction. We must ensure the funds for this initiative are not absorbed by an already burdensome budget item allocated to public safety. 
Because here’s the hard truth: these projects are not guaranteed to last. If the economics stop working in billionaire Musk’s favor, he can — and likely will — leave. The infrastructure, the environmental risks, the political fallout? That stays with us. And unless we’re willing to build protections before the damage is done, we’ll continue being stuck in this cycle of reactive outrage instead of proactive justice.
This is why transparency, not just transaction, matters. The public deserves to understand how these deals are made, how these numbers are chosen, and what accountability mechanisms are in place. We deserve more imagination and courage from our leaders about what “benefit” really means in Black communities that have historically been treated as bargaining chips instead of partners.
This isn’t about being anti-progress or anti-technology. It’s about being pro-people. It’s about making sure that innovation doesn’t mean exploitation. That equity is more than a buzzword. That justice is built into the system, not tacked on as a press release.
Because if we don’t ask deeper questions now, we’ll keep getting answers that leave our people behind.
And I, for one, am not willing to accept that. 
Not now. 
Not ever.

(Matt Vasilogambros/Stateline)The Trump administration is pushing to involuntarily commit more people to psychiatric hospitals in an effort to keep them off the street, according to a new executive order issued Friday.
“Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order,” the memo states. It also calls for defunding “housing first” programs, which prioritize quickly getting people into stable housing with fewer restrictions.
With the order, the new Trump administration is entering an ongoing debate over nationwide crises in mental healthcare and housing, and the intersection of the two. In recent years, even some blue states and cities like New York and San Francisco have moved to increase the use of involuntary treatment. Proponents of these policies say that people with severe mental illness are often too sick to accept help and can pose a threat to themselves or others when left untreated. Critics argue that these approaches are ineffective, costly, and in violation of patients’ civil rights.

This story is part of “Trump Two: Six Months In,” a Marshall Project series taking stock of the administration’s efforts to reshape immigration enforcement and criminal justice.

Some housing advocates say the president’s order is a deflection. “Some people experiencing homelessness have mental illness,” said Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center. “That’s not the cause of homelessness. The cause of homelessness is that housing is too expensive. Institutionalizing folks doesn’t treat the root cause of the problem.”
Standards for when someone is eligible for involuntary treatment vary state by state, and attorneys say much of Trump’s order is beyond his authority. But the order could have an impact on the distribution of federal funding and gives support to cities and states looking to crack down on homeless encampments.
To better understand the potential impact of this directive, The Marshall Project spoke with Jennifer Mathis, Deputy Director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, which advocates against “unnecessary institutionalization” and for increased voluntary mental health treatment in community settings instead. This conversation was edited for length and clarity.
Were you surprised by this move by the Trump administration?
There had been chatter for a while about this happening. It was somewhat consistent with the rhetoric the president has used over the years in his campaigns and while in office. I think it’s entirely misguided.
It’s unusual, at best, for the president to tell the Justice Department to actively seek to undermine established law rather than to enforce it. There is Supreme Court precedent on civil commitment. [The state cannot involuntarily commit someone who doesn’t have mental illness and isn’t a danger to themselves or others.] That’s the law of the land. There is no legal support for what they are advocating. If there were, they would not need to try to overturn judicial precedents.
What makes it “misguided,” in your opinion?
It is a little peculiar to suggest that the primary goal of this administration — when it comes to people with mental health disabilities — is not to help them in the community, but to focus on civilly committing them. And then what happens? Are they going to civilly commit them on a long-term basis? You can’t commit your way out of a problem of not having sufficient community services. That’s the root cause of many of the issues they are addressing in this executive order.
It seems like a very backward vision of a system that resembles the one we came from many years ago, and that we got away from because it was not only destroying lives — it was destroying budgets as well. It is very costly to keep people institutionalized. If you don’t focus on creating the services that people need to avoid it, or to be discharged and free up other beds when people need them — you will continue to have people showing up at the front door. Civilly committing everybody doesn’t solve that problem. You can’t create hospitals ad nauseam. This is not serving people or treating them. It’s warehousing.
How does this order square with research on reducing homelessness or the use of involuntary treatment?
These provisions about using discretionary grants to expand civil commitments and involuntary outpatient commitments, to stop supporting housing-first policies or harm reduction policies — all of that seems to signal a shift away from evidence-based practices. There is a mountain of evidence supporting housing-first, that it works, and that it’s been a very effective and important strategy to meet the needs of people who often have the highest needs. Housing-first had bipartisan support for many, many years. It was started during the George W. Bush administration. That is a really effective strategy.
To say we’re not going to house people who — by virtue of their situation or disability — are not going to be able to comply with certain requirements, and therefore we’re going to leave them on the street, has not been very effective. So what will happen to the people who will remain unhoused? They’re going to be civilly committed then? And then what? Hospitalization is not a magic pill. They don’t seem to have a plan for what happens after.
On assisted outpatient treatment [the practice of providing someone with involuntary mental health or addiction treatment in the community under a court order], this executive order seems to be promoting it and suggesting agencies should use all means available to expand it. But the Government Accountability Office just issued a report saying evidence is inconclusive that assisted outpatient treatment actually does anything.
How did increasing involuntary commitment and ending housing-first policies become a conservative talking point?
I don’t think this has become a priority issue among most conservatives. I think there are particular groups for whom this has been a priority. It’s not like Republicans broadly are clamoring for this.
There have been efforts to demonize people with mental health disabilities and portray them as violent, even despite a lack of evidence. All the data over all the years shows that people with mental illnesses account for 3 to 5% of violence. There was a specific effort to create these associations in the public mind of mental health and violence, because it was a convenient narrative. Some people did it because fear was a good way to generate support for mental health services, since otherwise, people didn’t seem to care. There were other actors who had other motivations and were happy to take advantage of those increasing public fears to scapegoat people with mental health disabilities to divert from gun control conversations. Whether it’s right or left, both have been guilty of perpetuating those stereotypes.
There has been a trend over the years to lower civil commitment standards. Apparently, the president thinks they should be [even] lower. Certain groups exist in states across the country who have beaten the drums for lowering [them]. It becomes a politicized issue where legislatures feel pressured to do something in the wake of a [violent] incident, and the answer is painted as “if you just lowered civil commitment standards, then this wouldn’t happen.”
What does it mean to issue this order just as Congress approved significant cuts to Medicaid and other social services?
That’s the absurdity of it.
Hospitals are the most costly services we have in our system — that is why state mental health systems moved away from psychiatric hospitals. Also, because it was much better for people to live a life in the community.
We are in an era where Congress has made historic cuts to the Medicaid program, and states are going to face massive shortfalls in their mental health service systems. The idea of encouraging states to bypass interventions that would help people avoid hospitalization and to live in the community, and instead spending historically scarce resources on the most expensive interventions … seems completely flawed. They would be able to serve far fewer people. It makes no sense.

Our survey, which we debuted on July 15, has been taken by more than 4,700 people so far. This far exceeds our expectations in such a short period, but the response is proving incredibly helpful to our journalists and research partners as we work to find solutions to the state’s brain drain problem.

Take the survey

Whether you’ve stayed in Mississippi, you’ve left, or you’ve considered leaving the state, we want to hear from you. If you’ve moved to Mississippi from elsewhere, or even if you’ve never lived here at all, your input is valuable. Brain drain in Mississippi affects all of us, and we believe hearing from people of any and all backgrounds and perspectives can only help us better grapple with the problems and develop some solutions.
The short survey asks everyone about the factors that influenced their decision of where to live, whether that’s in Mississippi or not. It follows with tailored discussion questions based on where you’re from and where you live now. We ask you to reflect on what has pulled you away or what has kept you rooted here, as well as the potential changes that could improve the chances that you live in the state in the future. We purposefully left plenty of room for you to share your own thoughts with us.
So how can you help? First, take the survey! If you’ve already done it, you can help even more by sharing it with as many people as you can. As laid out above, we need responses from anyone and everyone.
Over the next few weeks and months, we’ll spend dedicated time and energy with the results of the survey. We’ll dispatch journalists at Mississippi Today to dive deeply into issues that matter most to you, and we’ll work closely with our expert partners to dissect and share findings — all with potential solutions to the crisis at top of mind.
All of the stories, analyses and essays related to this work will be published on our new page at Mississippi Today called Brain Drain. Click here to access and bookmark the page.

The New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute at NM Highlands University comprises one-third of the Southwest Ecological Restoration Institutes — SWERI —a collaborative that includes Colorado State University and Northern Arizona University.
As the United States Forest Service slashes spending on research and other scientific endeavors, SWERI’s funding decreased from about $6.6 million to $3 million for the remaining few months of the federal fiscal year. Highlands’ piece of that is $1 million, according to Gilbert “Buddy” Rivera, the chief of staff of the institute at the university in Las Vegas, NM, said during a presentation Tuesday afternoon to the interim legislative Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee. 
The upcoming fiscal year budget eliminates all SWERI funding, according to Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz’s exchange with U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich early last month. During the June 11 exchange, Schultz defended the cuts to SWERI as a necessary money-saving measure.

Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire hub:
HPCCHub.org


“The funding in the future is going to have to come more from those universities themselves and other grant opportunities,” Schultz said. “The Forest Service is going to be shifting its funding away from [research and development] in general in the budget.”
Rivera’s comments on the institute’s fiscal future came during a hearing in which he and colleagues demonstrated to lawmakers the wildfire maps they developed that aim to compile “critical” wildfire information for New Mexicans dealing with wildfires. The institute created its first map during the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire in 2022, compiling multiple different data sources into a single map with fire boundaries, satellite imagery, smoke forecasts, building footprints and more, Rivera said.
The map has been viewed more than 300,000 times, according to Rivera’s presentation. A similar map the team made for the South Fork and Salt Fires in Ruidoso last summer has received more than 175,000 views. 
The maps constitute just one component of the work at the institute, Rivera said, which employs between 22 and 26 full-time staff, along with up to four students and interns. The institute also performs ecological monitoring with the help of a field crew and research on “the fire-vulnerable human and ecological systems of the Southwest,” according to the presentation.

Heinrich, in his exchange with Schultz, asked the Forest Service to reconsider the cuts because institutes like the one at Highlands “have really provided the Forest Service an enormous amount of science” amid rapidly changing forest conditions. 
Rivera said the institute is staying afloat this summer with the help of outside grants. Going forward, the New Mexico Higher Education Department’s Research and Public Service Projects could help provide a funding stream. The agency recently provided guidance to universities on finding funding for projects the federal government just cut.

The post Nicoti[...]","MASSACHUSETTS LAWMAKERS are again trying to take away your civil liberties – but a growing number of cities and towns are saying “no.”
In an era where transparency, government accountability and personal freedoms are in peril every day, it is rather stunning that state legislators want to impose bans on tobacco and nicotine products that will forever prohibit anyone born after January 1, 2006, from being able to purchase legal adult products.
The more people learn about the deceptively named Nicotine Free Generation law, the less they like it. Most recently, Bellingham town meeting voters rejected NFG, while in Manchester-By-The-Sea, town meeting voters decided to rescind an NFG bylaw quietly implemented by the appointed board of health. Similar NFG bylaws have been rejected in Worcester, Peabody, Milton and Westfield.
The fact is, voters are tired of nanny state policies and lawmakers legislating their version of morality. Supporting programs to curb smoking and youth tobacco use is good public policy, but NFG will accomplish neither. Instead, it will only eliminate adult rights, harm small businesses, strip away millions in tax dollars from Massachusetts, support criminals and push sales to other states and unregulated markets.
It is ironic that some lawmakers want to pass this first-in-the-nation policy that strips away adult rights, when historically the state has been on the forefront of protecting rights and liberties. Massachusetts is the birthplace of democracy and has led the nation in expanding freedoms for the LGBTQ and immigrant communities.
Massachusetts lawmakers have legalized cannabis and sports gambling, expanded the availability of alcohol licenses, funded free hypodermic needle programs and are constantly pursuing other “harm reduction” policies for hard drugs. Yet on tobacco and nicotine, the state is moving in the opposite direction ignoring proven harm reduction strategies to improve public health and imposing bans – despite clear data that prohibition does not work – especially for adults.
The truth is, NFG is about government overreach and control. The federal government has set the age for tobacco purchases at 21, just as it is for alcohol. If passed, Massachusetts adults would be free to purchase all the booze they want, bet on sports, buy cannabis cigarettes and edibles but not a nicotine pouch as an alternative to a cigarette or a cigar for a round of golf or a wedding.
Elected officials are not supposed to pick winners and losers. They are supposed to be the stewards of freedom – not gatekeepers of subjective morality. But this is exactly what they are doing by arbitrarily imposing a generation-based ban on tobacco and nicotine – federally-legal and regulated products.
If the state wants to do something positive for youth, it should double down on tobacco education programs instead of the misguided NFG
What’s next? Caffeine? Sugary treats? Soda? Fried foods? Where does it end? Anyone who does not think the Legislature would use the precedent set by banning tobacco and nicotine to target alcohol, cannabis, sports gambling or other products they deem harmful, is dangerously ignoring an inherent threat to civil liberties in Massachusetts.
It’s been proven time and again, most notably with alcohol and marijuana, that it is best to keep legal adult products in regulated, licensed environments. Tobacco is no different. The ban on menthol and flavored tobacco implemented in 2020 did nothing to reduce smoking habits. It merely pushed sales into New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and online, in the process siphoning away hundreds of millions in tax dollars from Massachusetts that could have been used for anti-smoking efforts.
The flavor ban also created a robust and troubling illicit market run by gangs who are cashing in by selling cartons of menthol cigarettes on the street at exorbitant markups. The same will happen with all nicotine and tobacco products if this ban is passed.
Simply put, bans do not work and more communities are realizing that and will continue to as the facts are revealed. NFG is anti-democratic, government hypocrisy at its worst – and many communities have already weighed in against it, seeing through the rhetoric and choosing instead to protect the rights of adults.
Massachusetts is the birthplace of freedom. Many communities take that seriously and are recognizing that what’s on the line with NFG is our very civil liberties.
Allowing this sort of egregious government overstep into our personal freedoms is a slippery slope that must stop now – before it’s too late.

Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law, promising that in America, access to healthcare would not depend on the size of a person’s bank account. In the decades since, these programs have transformed that promise into reality for hundreds of millions of people. But just weeks ago, the administration, backed by 268 legislators, passed a law that will kick at least 10.5 million people off Medicaid by 2034. And it’s exactly in moments like these that showing up for one another becomes critical.
These lives are not just numbers; they are mothers recovering from childbirth, children with asthma, seniors who rely on home care aides, and people managing chronic illnesses like diabetes or cancer. Before Medicaid, if someone couldn’t afford it, they went without health care. Doctors could—and did—turn people away if they couldn’t pay up front. Hospital doors were closed to too many, and especially to Black, brown, rural, and working-class communities.
Medicare and Medicaid changed that. They made health care a right, not a privilege. Today, Medicaid covers one in five Americans and nearly 45% of births in Michigan, providing critical care for older adults, people with disabilities, and low-income families.
Experts have repeatedly warned that cutting Medicaid will have deadly consequences on the pre-existing black maternal health crisis. My story is one of many: when I had my first child, Medicaid covered my birth but ended my support soon after. I was uninsurable during that critical postpartum period. That is exactly why Michigan’s extension to 12-month coverage was such a hard-won victory. Nationwide, Medicaid covers over 64% of births by Black moms. Nonpartisan groups, like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, advocate for closing the Medicaid gap to improve black maternal health, not busting it open. Now, that gap will be wider than ever.
It’s clear that for some politicians, the mandate to represent all people is one they’re not interested in fulfilling. These so-called “leaders” are willing to throw poor people under the bus if it means they can help the health insurance industry continue to profit. They know exactly how devastating these cuts will be, delaying the inevitable consequences until 2027 to avoid political consequences before the next election. Even as families face the risk of losing coverage and hospitals struggle to remain open, their elected representatives have their eyes on the next election.
When politicians represent business interests and not people, hospitals close, everyday Americans undergo unnecessary hardship, quality of life suffers, and people die. What might have been a drive to a nearby hospital for a treatable emergency is now a death sentence, the closest ER hours away.
Already, three Michigan hospitals that serve rural communities are at “immediate risk” of closing under these cuts, and many more are endangered. These cuts will hit working families the hardest. Picture a mother in Flint, Michigan, skipping her own meals because she needs to afford both food and insulin for her child. Or a home health aide in Detroit, not only losing her coverage but the job that provided it.
Medicare and Medicaid didn’t happen by accident. They happened because people demanded a better country. Protecting them now will take that same relentless energy. At Mothering Justice, we have been fighting for families for more than a decade. We know that this fight will be long and that it will take all of us. But, we’re organizing, we’re advocating, and we’re amplifying voices in every statehouse and on Capitol Hill.
Our elected officials need to hear directly from us – our political will and the demand that we be heard is what makes change. Even if we don’t use Medicare or Medicaid ourselves, our communities are only as healthy as the neighbors who live within it. When we use our political power to stand up for one another, we make it easier to create that world together.
Now is the time to show up at legislators’ town halls, call council members’ offices, write letters, and organize in your neighborhoods. Vote. And bring others along the way.
To all the mamas who are exhausted, worried, and doing their best in a system that is failing all of us: we are not powerless. When those in power won’t stand for us, we can — and will — stand for each other.

Despite seeming widespread support and no public opposition, Massachusetts's menstrual equity bill has stalled over two sessions in the House Ways and Means. 
The post Despite widespread support, ‘menstrual equity’ bill has stalled for two sessions in the House   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","TWO YEARS AGO, Senate President Karen Spilka called it a “simple” proposition to make menstrual products available in public spaces like schools, prisons, and homeless shelters. At a 2023 hearing on a bill that would do that, Sen. Julian Cyr, the vice chair of the Joint Committee on Public Health, called it “absurd that menstrual products aren’t readily available in every and all public locations.” 
But getting a “menstrual equity” bill across the finish line has been anything but simple.    
In two consecutive legislative sessions, the Senate passed a version of a bill that would provide disposable menstrual products at no cost in prisons, emergency housing hotels, homeless shelters, and public schools, but the legislation stalled both times in the House Ways and Means Committee.  
Advocates are hoping the third time will be the charm. The bill was favorably reported out of the Joint Committee on Public Health earlier this month and sent to the Senate Ways and Means Committee.    
There isn’t public opposition to the bill, according to advocates, legislators, and lobbying records. The Women’s Caucus, a bipartisan group of 60 lawmakers, listed the policy among its top five priorities. The Senate version of the bill has 22 cosponsors. The House bill has more than 50 lawmakers petitioning in support of the bill.  
House Speaker Ron Mariano’s office did not comment when asked why his chamber has not acted on this bill in the last two sessions. A spokesperson for Mariano said that he will review the bill this session if it is advanced by the House members of the public health committee.  
When the Senate approved the bill two years ago, Spilka suggested its passage should be an easy call. “I don’t say that very often for bills coming through the Legislature, but this one is simple,” Spilka said at a press conference following the October 2023 vote. “If we truly believe in equality for women and menstruating people, then making period products accessible is something that we absolutely need to do.”   
In a statement this week, a spokesperson for Spilka said, “Menstrual equity – and women’s issues more broadly – remain a top priority for the Senate, especially at a time when the federal government is intent on rolling back protections and rights.”  
The twice-stalled menstrual equity bill – called the I AM bill by its advocates – is cosponsored by Sen. Pat Jehlen of Somerville, Rep. Jay Livingstone of Boston, and Rep. Christine Barber of Somerville.  
Two other bills have been filed this session that would also increase accessibility to menstrual products. One bill, filed by Rep. Marjorie Decker of Cambridge and Rep. Jeff Roy of Franklin, would make free menstrual products available in public schools. The other, filed by Jehlen and Rep. Mindy Domb of Amherst, would require any public building owned, rented, or occupied by the state and any public higher education institution to provide free menstrual products.  
“[Menstrual equity] is a relatively simple public health issue and it’s an equal rights issue, but mostly it’s just a simple, basic human need,” said Jehlen. As for why the bill hasn’t made all the way through the legislative process, Jehlen said, “If a bill doesn’t have an enormous lobbying push behind it, it can get lost because there are 6,000 bills and it just takes work and sometimes it takes persistence.”  
Sasha Goodfriend, the executive director of Mass NOW, a feminist non-profit advocacy organization, suggested that the issue is a matter of competing priorities in the Legislature.  
“At every point in the session we have the same talking points, but it just needs to be said over and over again because it’s forgotten about because it’s not top of mind for most people,” said Goodfriend. “We’re not used to thinking about periods because they’ve been stigmatized and made invisible for so long.”  
Advocates say that providing menstrual products in public facilities like prisons, schools, and shelters will involve minimal cost but they have not provided an exact estimate. Goodfriend said that when bought in bulk, menstrual products cost only cents per product.  
Decker, who co-chairs the Joint Committee on Public Health, said that she is looking into drafting legislation that threads together the different menstrual equity bills.    
“In the Legislature, nothing’s ever simple,” Decker said, when asked about why the bill has twice stalled in the House. “We have to do our due diligence. It means talking to stakeholders,” she said, citing the need for conversations with those overseeing public facilities, education officials, and those in charge of the state shelter system.  
Livingstone – who has filed the I AM bill for four sessions – sees the number of menstrual equity bills this session as an encouraging sign that the issue is gaining momentum.   
“This happens a lot with bills, where they pass one [legislative] body or another and then ultimately, they’re successful at another time, so I remain hopeful,” said Livingstone. 
Advocates say people who menstruate face significant negative impacts when they do not have ready access to menstrual products in public spaces like prisons, schools, and homeless shelters. Lack of these essential products, they say, can lead to physical discomfort, poor hygiene, increased risk of infections, and emotional distress due to stigma and shame.   
According to the Alliance for Period Supplies, a national organization of community-based non-profits, one in nine women and girls in Massachusetts lives under the poverty line and therefore may struggle to afford basic necessities, including period products.  
For students in schools, this can result in missed class days and hindered academic performance. In prisons and shelters, where individuals often have limited control over their environment, advocates say the absence of free and accessible menstrual products exacerbates their vulnerability.   
In a 2024 survey conducted by Mass NOW, 70 percent of the 187 school nurses who responded said that they have seen students miss classes due to a lack of menstrual products.   
Stocking bathrooms with period products or making products available upon request has gained traction with individual school systems, including in Boston, Brookline, Somerville, and Medford. Boston also has a program that offers free period products at six Boston Public Library branches.   
Private higher education institutions like Harvard University, Brandeis University, Boston University, and Northeastern University have all launched initiatives to make free menstrual products available in campus bathrooms.   
Advocates have tried to fill some of the gaps by distributing menstrual products to people who can’t otherwise access them. Mass NOW has worked with other groups across the state to give out more than half a million period products in the last seven months, according to the group.   
Goodfriend said Mass NOW previously depended on an annual state grant of $270,000 to support its menstrual equity efforts, but because of cuts to the program, it will receive only half that amount in 2026. 
“This is a reminder of why relying on charity and short-term grants to meet menstrual products needs is not sustainable in the context of the current federal environment and we now especially need a permanent solution not just temporary goodwill,” said Goodfriend.

Mari-Lynn Poskin speaks with attendees at the Kansas House Democrats’ “Fight Back” event in Pittsburg, Kan., in July. Statehouse Democrats across the country are aiming to link their Republican counterparts to President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending cuts package (Jonathan Shorman/Stateline).PITTSBURG, Kan. — Amid a summer swelter last week, more than 80 people crowded into a trendy gastropub in downtown Pittsburg, Kansas, for cold drinks and hot talk.
The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.
Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
 ‘Not a bumper sticker bill’

The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”
In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
 Democrats ‘fight back’

This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.
In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

Advocates’ early afternoon rally on the Grand Staircase came just ahead of a Joint Committee on Municipalities and Regional Government hearing that featured lengthy testimony on a Sen. Pat Jehlen bill (S 1447) to enable cities and towns to limit rent increases to the rate of inflation and with a cap of 5 percent. It also bans no-fault evictions.
Homes for All Massachusetts, which represents “housing justice” groups statewide, said tenants came from a slew of so-called Gateway Cities, including Springfield, Worcester, Lynn, Brockton, Somerville, New Bedford, Fall River and Taunton.
Jehlen, a Somerville Democrat who was joined by Mayor Katjana Ballantyne, asked ralliers to raise their hands if they think Massachusetts has a housing “emergency.”
“We need immediate solutions. This is it,” Jehlen said. “Building more housing is not fast enough. It costs too much. It’s not happening fast enough, and it won’t solve the problem.”
Jehlen’s proposal incorporates exemptions for owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units, public and subsidized housing, college dorms, newly constructed buildings for five years, and facilities that provide residential elderly care. Seventeen lawmakers have signed onto the bill.

Healey’s capital investment plan for fiscal years 2026-2030 calls for housing investments totaling $2.34 billion. The administration says CIP funding in fiscal 2026 will drive down housing costs by helping to create more than 6,000 new units.
But to end the housing crisis, Massachusetts needs to produce 222,000 new homes by 2035, according to the statewide housing plan released in February.
Mindy Perry, a small landlord in Boston who testified on a panel with the Small Property Owners Association, offered the opposite argument of Jehlen during the hearing Tuesday afternoon.
“Rent control is not going to solve the problem of housing, of rent price. It’s going to do the exact opposite,” Perry told lawmakers. “It’s going to devastate the housing supply and drive the rent price even higher. The only way to solve this is (to) increase the housing supply.”
Tony Lopes, who also spoke on the SPOA panel, argued Jehlen’s bill “reaches for the wrong tool.” Lopes invoked rent control lessons from San Francisco and New York City, which he claimed led to the loss of rental units and discouraged investment and maintenance.
“This bill may be well-intentioned, but the outcome will have fewer available units, deteriorating housing conditions, and owners walking away from reinvestment in all the housing stock that needs care,” Lopes said. “And it penalizes the small property owners who make up 60 percent or more of (the) commonwealth’s rental market, including the immigrant and minority property owners who are seeking just to get ahead. We need to consider real solutions, zoning reform, more state-level housing production, and accountability for the rising cost of insurance.”
Committee member Rep. Mike Connolly bristled at the property owners’ testimony, and defended rent stabilization as a “moderate policy.” The Cambridge Democrat noted the Legislature passed the state’s first rent control measure in 1920, a policy also in place during World War II.

“We had it in the 1950s, we had it from 1970 to 1994, and so as a matter of fact, the longest period we’ve ever gone without rent stabilization is the current period. And I think we would all agree, the housing emergency is worse than it’s ever been to our knowledge,” Connolly said. “I looked at New York City since the time they started implementing rent control, and we know there’s a partial form of rent control in New York City. They’ve added over 1 million housing units, so you can’t tell me that we can’t balance the need to protect tenants with the need for growth.”
The House companion rent stabilization bill from Reps. Dave Rogers and Samantha Montaño (H 2328) was initially also sent to the Joint Committee on Municipalities and Regional Government, though it was redirected to the Housing Committee earlier this month and is awaiting a hearing.
Rent control legislation was sent to study last session, part of a longstanding trend in which top Democrats have eschewed such measures, including a Boston home rule petition. A 1994 ballot referendum banned rent control in Massachusetts.

Renters recently gained some relief after the fiscal 2026 budget banned renter-paid broker’s fees, seen as a burdensome, additional moving cost for many tenants.
“I think the fact that we got broker’s fees through is a changing of the tide, and I’m hopeful that we can continue to advance something during this time,” Montaño, a Jamaica Plain Democrat, told the News Service. “But I’m very, very stressed about housing, especially in my community.”
Montaño said her office has fielded a “significant” volume of unemployment cases recently.
“I think we’re starting to see incredibly dire repercussions from the federal administration,” Montaño said.
Carolyn Chou, executive director of Homes for All Massachusetts, framed the rent stabilization bills as a “no-cost solution” that will support residents who are bracing for the personal impact of federal funding cuts. Hundreds of thousands of Bay Staters are expected to lose access to food assistance benefits and health insurance coverage, unless state government steps in with additional resources for safety net programs.
“This is not going to increase the state budget — it’s regulating market-rate rents,” Chou told the News Service. “Housing is fundamental for people to be able to live, and survive, and thrive here in the state. As other benefits are being cut, we need to make sure that people’s rents are not ballooning at the same time.”
At the rally, which was moved indoors due to the heat, Boston City Councilor Ben Weber held a sign demanding “Rent Control Now” on the Grand Staircase. Some 5,000 Boston Public Schools students experience homelessness each year and that situation is only worsening, Weber said, as he pushed for policies to reduce evictions.
“If elected officials aren’t doing something to prevent it, we’re not doing our jobs,” Weber told the News Service.

Some 441,000 low-income households across the state lack access to an affordable rental home, according to research released in April from Housing Navigator Massachusetts, Inc. and the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. That translates into the existing affordable housing stock serving just 32 percent of low-income households.
“Imagine if cities had the legal power to do what already we know work: Stabilize rent, stop displacement,” Ballantyne, the mayor of Somerville, said at the rally. “Inside this building, lawmakers are deciding whether we can take that step, whether we can pass rent control and finally give cities and towns the tools to protect their people. But out here, we’re making it clear: The people are ready, the cities are ready, the time is now.”
At the hearing, Revere City Councilor Juan Pablo Jaramillo said he believes housing development is a tool to lower rents — but with a caveat.
“That’s not something that we’re benefitting from in the working-class community of Revere,” said Jaramillo, who’s also deputy legislative director at SEIU Local 509. “It’s time to pass S 1447 and level the playing field for working-class people. This bill is about doing away with the power dynamic that is encouraged by the law that discourages and inhibits working people from choosing if rent control is right for their own community.”

If successful in the primary, he would likely again face Republican Kris Kobach, who prevailed in their 2022 showdown. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Democrat Chris Mann said Wednesday the time had come to declare his candidacy for attorney general in a bid to unseat Republican incumbent Kris Kobach in 2026.
Mann, who had his law enforcement career cut short when struck by a DUI motorist, lost the 2022 campaign to Kobach by 1.6 percentage points with 1 million ballots cast. Kobach’s 15,000-vote victory was the closest margin for a Kansas statewide race in that election cycle.
After conclusion of his work as a police officer, Mann went to law school and served as a prosecutor in the Wyandotte County District Attorney’s Office. He subsequently worked as an attorney with the Kansas Securities Commission before opening a private law practice in 2016.
“In times like these, Kansas families need a law enforcement officer defending our communities and our rights, not a politician focused on their own personal ambition,” Mann said. “Instead of focusing on what’s best for Kansas families, Kris Kobach has focused on his own personal agenda, and what office he can run for next. Kansans deserve better from their attorney general.”
Mann said the Kansas attorney general’s office needed to be reoriented to concentrate on basics of law enforcement and to “defend the rule of law, protect our rights, protect our families and make Kansas a safer place to live.”
Kobach, who served as Kansas secretary of state prior to election as attorney general, would be the presumed Republican candidate for reelection. In 2022, he prevailed in a three-candidate GOP primary against state Sen. Kellie Warren and attorney Tony Mattivi. Kobach later appointed Mattivi to lead the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.
Mann was 21 years of age when he became a police officer during his junior year in college. In 2002, he was struck during a routine traffic stop by a drunk driver. His injuries made it necessary to retire from the force at age 25.
“Because of that crash, I was forced to start over,” he said. “With the help of my faith and family, I found a new way to serve the public and protect our communities in the courtroom instead.”
He prosecuted a broad range of cases while at the Wyandotte County District Attorney’s office. Over time, he volunteered with Mothers Against Drunk Driving and was appointed to the MADD National Board of Directors in 2014. He served as the organization’s national chair.
In Kansas, he advocated for the law that required vehicle ignition locks for DUI offenders.
“Working in Kansas and across the country to change DUI laws and penalties is a critical way I can help victims and stop offenders from hurting more families,” he said.
He said he has continued to collaborate with organizations supporting victims and first responders struggling with PTSD.
Mann, who has not held elective office, lives in Lawrence. His wife, Ashley, is a surgeon practicing medicine in Olathe.
His campaign treasurer is Jill Docking, who was a 2014 Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. She was on the ticket with Paul Davis, which lost to incumbent GOP Gov. Sam Brownback.
“Never before has it been so clear that we need leaders who will honor the rule of law,” Docking said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/P9020618-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-30 09:56:27.233162

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump signed the mega bill, he gave leaders in Pennsylvania and other states — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
State regulations
As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Rapidly expanding school voucher programs pinch state budgets

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.

The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like across the country?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.

The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

Alberta Florence (Hill) Bundy, age 86 of Jericho, Vermont passed away peacefully surrounded by her loving and supportive family on July 25, 2025.
Alberta was born in Sharon, Vermont on Sept. 8, 1938. She was one of ten children born to Hervie and Florence (Phillips) Hill.
Alberta was married to Warren A. Bundy. Together they built a life in Essex Junction and raised six children. Alberta spent her life devoted to raising her family by being a stay at home mom. When her children were old enough to be self-sufficient, she began working outside the home. Alberta enjoyed working in the restaurant industry. She enjoyed cooking for her family and for others. She made many delicious home cooked meals, canned many jars of pickles, sauces and vegetables, and mended many pieces of clothing. She worked hard to make a great home for her family. She knew how to stretch that all mighty dollar with raising six children. She really enjoyed conversations with people and oh boy, she sure loved to talk and could talk for hours. Alberta was well known for a woman who always spoke what was on her mind. She gave us advice or opinions even when we didn’t want it or it was hard. She always had our best interest at heart. She was always doing her best to help her family with her kind heart. She knew how hard it was to be a mom and she was always there to babysit our kids or clean our houses to help us out. Her children got their strength from her. She taught us how to love our children well, create a great home for our families and when things got tough, to be strong and persevere through it. She taught us to never give up.
In her elderly years, Alberta enjoyed putting together countless puzzles, watching CNN, watching Dateline and documentaries especially about her country music artists. Recently, when she became ill and could no longer watch TV or put her puzzles together, she found great peace and enjoyment listening to good old country music. Alberta was a fighter. She battled many health complications over the last few years. She had a strong will and a spunky attitude. She thought of her family right up to the end and did not succumb to her diagnosis of cancer until she made sure her family was going to be okay with her leaving. She leaves her family with some great memories and lots of love for her.
Our mom loved doing things to give back to her community. One way she did this was to collect soda can tabs to help others receive funding for illnesses. It filled her with great joy when she was able to fill a grocery bag full and bring it to the Ronald McDonald house in Burlington. If someone was in need of something, she would always start collecting items for them. She even enlisted others to collect items for the cause. Another and final way she gave back to her community was fulfilling her life long goal of donating her body to the UVM Anatomical Gift Program. It gave her family a tremendous amount of peace knowing that this wish was fulfilled. Now, she will continue to help doctors discover new ways to help people.
Alberta is survived by her children Deanna Fischer and her husband, Brad, Wanda Loven and her husband David, Ronald Bundy and his wife Melody, Brenda Campbell and her husband Clint and Cindy St.Amour. She is survived by 12 grandchildren and several great grandchildren. She is survived by her brother, Hervie (Tinker) Hill and his wife, Phyllis. She was predeceased by 8 siblings, her ex-husband, Warren Bundy and her daughter Deborah Ann Gaboriault.
As per her request, there will not be any public service. Her family will celebrate her life by sharing her love, interests and our memories but most of all finding ways to give back to others as she did. The family would like to request a card shower. If you would like to express your condolences, please send a card to The Family of Alberta Bundy at P.O. Box 66 Jericho, Vermont 05465.

Her family wishes to thank her faithful and loyal caregivers, Deanna, Brad, Wanda and David for always being there to give our mom the best care and life she could have. Our mom gained more appreciation and was grateful for the end of life care and support she received. We would also like to thank the doctors and staff at Alderbrook Family Health Center and UVM for their great care. We would like to thank Bayada Home Health Care for giving her a peaceful end of life journey and for the wonderful support that was given to her family during this time. We would like to thank Corbin and Palmer Funeral Home in Essex, Vermont for helping us with final arrangements. Most importantly, we would like to thank the UVM Anatomical Gift Program for accepting her body to science.
It was an honor for us to walk her through the journey home, peace, dignity and comfort. She is at peace and looking down at all of us with love and joy. We love you Mom and we will miss you dearly.

(Photo by Dr. Igor Smolyar/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)The potential to develop the backcountry west of the Susitna River has taken a step forward, as the state’s economic development agency applied for a key federal permit needed to build 78.5 miles of road into the area, which holds mining potential.
The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority submitted an application for the West Susitna Access Project to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is applying for a permit required by the Clean Water Act for construction in wetlands. The application was submitted on July 24, said Robyn Reyes, an AIDEA spokesperson.
In all, the proposed road would be about 100 miles long. The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities is pursuing the initial segment, which would run about 22 miles, while AIDEA is pursuing the remainder.
AIDEA is a state-owned development corporation.
State and Matanuska Susitna Borough officials describe the West Susitna Access Project as important to economic development. The road would lead to state lands that hold mining claims and the potential for extraction of gold, coal and other resources.
“This project presents a fantastic opportunity for Alaska to expand and generate revenue. I am dedicated to this initiative and to unlocking resources that will benefit all Alaskans,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement released by AIDEA.
Supporters also tout the road as a way for residents to gain access to hunting, fishing and recreational sites. The project is supported by the Alaska Outdoor Council, an organization of sport hunters, fishers, trappers and other outdoor users.
The project is highly controversial, however. Residents in the region are divided on the project, and opponents argue that it would degrade habitat that currently supports fish and wildlife.
“Building a 100+ mile industrial road would cause irreversible harm to rivers, wetlands, and other critical fish and wildlife habitat across the Susitna watershed and waste millions of dollars the state cannot afford. That would be just the beginning of the devastation and disruption,” says the website of Defend the West Su, one of the groups opposing the project.
American Rivers, a national conservation organization, earlier this year cited the West Susitna Access Project when it included the Susitna in its annual list of the 10 most threatened U.S. rivers.

For California prisoners who committed crimes when they were young and received life sentences without parole, few opportunities exist to get a second chance. The possibility of a parole review is slim, while the likelihood of dying behind bars is all but guaranteed.
But one bill — which the Legislature is holding for consideration until 2026 — could change that if passed.
As CalMatters’ Joe Garcia explains, state Sen. Susan Rubio’s bill would open parole eligibility for some prisoners serving life sentences without parole for crimes they committed when they were 25 or younger. The individual would have had to have served at least 25 years of their sentence already, and eligibility for parole does not guarantee release, according to the West Covina Democrat.
If signed into law, the measure could help Nathan Gould become eligible for parole. He is one of the more than 5,000 California prisoners serving life without parole. Gould turned himself in for a murder he committed in Bakersfield in 1994. Since then, he joined self-help groups, rehabilitative programs and is on the way to earning his third associate’s degree.

Gould: “It’s definitely giving me a light. There’s hope. I’d have a purpose now. I’d have a goal. There’s an ending.”

Jennifer Schaffer, who was an executive officer of the Board of Parole Hearings for 13 years, supports the bill. Though she acknowledges that parole hearings can retraumatize crime victims, giving people a chance to show that they have been rehabilitated is “important for humanity.”

Schaffer: “Hope can be really powerful — and the absence of hope can be very dangerous.”

But critics of the bill remain unconvinced, including Senate GOP leader Brian Jones of San Diego, who spoke in opposition during a Senate floor vote in June.

Jones: “The bill not only removes the finality of the sentences in our justice system, but it prioritizes the killer’s well being over that of the survivors of the victims.”

Two updates on lawsuits against President Donald Trump’s administration:

Planned Parenthood: California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Tuesday that the state is suing the administration over its policy to ban Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving federal Medicaid payments. California’s 114 Planned Parenthood clinics stand to lose about $300 million from the new rule, and five clinics in the state have already closed. The lawsuit is ongoing as the federal judge who issued a preliminary order last week restoring federal funding for some clinics expanded their decision Monday to shield all Planned Parenthood clinics from defunding.

Sensitive SNAP data: Arguing that the federal administration is targeting immigrant communities, California is joining 18 other states to sue the administration over its requirement that states hand over sensitive information about recipients of federal food vouchers. If states don’t provide the info by today, they risk losing federal funding to administer the food stamp program, known as CalFresh in California. The state receives $1.3 billion a year in federal funding to operate CalFresh. About 5 million California residents, or 13% of the population, rely on the aid.

Could this handgun get banned?

State legislators are considering a bill that would make California the first in the nation to ban one of the most popular handguns, writes CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
The measure would prohibit the sale of new Glock-brand handguns. These semi-automatic handguns can become fully automatic guns — which are already illegal under state and federal laws except for special permit holders — if you unlawfully insert a converter into the gun. These converters can be created illegally using a 3D printer.
Proponents of the bill say that it targets a narrow type of gun, which is becoming more popular in violent crimes. California and more than two dozen other states already ban the converters, but no state has yet to ban the gun.
Gun rights advocates argue that the bill would set a precedent for more restrictions on semi-automatic handguns. More than 1 million Glocks are in circulation in California, and only a small fraction, advocates say, have been illegally modified.

(Photo by McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) has joined in another lawsuit, this time against the Trump administration’s ban to block Medicaid funds for Planned Parenthood and similar health care providers.
The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts challenges a provision that eliminates Medicaid reimbursements for one year to health care providers that provide abortions and received more than $800,000 in federal and state Medicaid funding in 2023.
The suit centers on a provision of the expansive tax and spending cuts package the Republican-controlled Congress passed this month. The bill signed by Republican President Donald Trump on July 4 bans Medicaid funding from health care providers “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care.”
The lawsuit, joined by 22 Democratic attorneys general and Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, claims more than 1.1 million patients could lose access to care and nearly 200 Planned Parenthood health centers in 24 states could close.
Karen Nelson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Maryland, said earlier this month about one-third of the patients at its seven centers located throughout Maryland are Medicaid recipients.
State analysts estimate that it would cost the state about $2.5 million to make up for federal funds lost as a result of the provision that prohibits Medicaid funding for any reproductive health care.
“Attorney General Brown and the coalition are asking the court to block the Trump administration from implementing this devastating and unlawful provision, which will lead to widespread disruptions in preventive care and increase healthcare costs if allowed to stand,” Brown’s office said in a statement. “The States should not be co-opted into executing this unconstitutional provision.”
The defendants are the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and its administrator, Mehmet Oz.
Emily G. Hilliard, a spokesperson with the department, said in a statement Tuesday evening, that “States should not be forced to fund organizations that have chosen political advocacy over patient care. It is a shame that these democrat attorney[s] generals [sic] seek to undermine state flexibility and disregard longstanding concerns about accountability.”
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani of Massachusetts granted Planned Parenthood’s preliminary injunction to block the provision that would bar funding from the organization and its health care affiliates.
The judge wrote that the provision “runs afoul of the First Amendment and the Bill of Attainder Clause.” The clause is within the U.S. Constitution that prohibits Congress and state legislatures from passing laws to punish, or simply “singling them out” or “discriminating against individuals or groups” without a judicial trail, the judge wrote.
“The court is not enjoining the federal government from regulating abortion and it is not directing the federal government to fund elective abortions or any healthcare service not otherwise eligible for Medicaid coverage,” the judge wrote. “Instead, this order grants preliminary relief that prevents Defendants from targeting a specific group of entities—Planned Parenthood Federation Members—for exclusion from reimbursements under the Medicaid program where Plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood that they will succeed in establishing that such targeted exclusion violates the United States Constitution…”
Planned Parenthood Federation of America, along with two of its affiliates in Massachusetts and Utah, filed a lawsuit three days after Trump signed the tax cut and spending plan into law July 4.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/planned-parenthood-slc-2-scaled_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-30 09:56:27.233162
,California,2025-07-30 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,This group has one of California’s highest graduation rates. So why are they skipping college?,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/07/inland-empire-college-rates/,Inland Empire high school students have a higher graduation rate than their peers in California but are below average when it comes to enrolling in college.,"In summary
Inland Empire high school students have a higher graduation rate than their peers in California but are below average when it comes to enrolling in college. 


Inland Empire students graduate at slightly higher rates than their peers in other parts of California. So why do they lag in college enrollment and graduation?
A report by the Public Policy Institute of California looked at why Inland Empire students fall behind and what educators can do to get more students on the college track. 
“You have the lowest college-educated but our county has the highest (high school) graduation rates,” Catalina Cifuentes, executive director for college and career readiness with the Riverside County Office of Education said in an online forum of the report. “So our students are very capable, but it’s that connection between information and putting it into practice.”
About 88% of Inland Empire high school students graduate from high school, compared to 86% statewide, the report found. But the numbers flip after that. 
It starts with the coursework needed to attend a Cal State or University of California campus, known as A-G requirements. While some school districts require the state minimum for high school graduation, others call for extra courses in subjects such as math or foreign languages, so all graduates are college-ready.
Throughout Riverside and San Bernardino County, 48% of students complete the A-G requirements. Statewide 60% of high school graduates meet those standards.
Without those classes under their belts, students have to play catch-up before entering a state university.  As a result, just 57% of Inland Empire graduates attend college, while 65% of high school graduates throughout the state pursue higher education.
Most Inland Empire students start higher education at community colleges. But just 31 percent of those students transfer to a four-year school do so within six years, compared to 40 percent statewide.
That adds up to lower college graduation rates. A quarter of Inland Empire residents ages 25 to 54 hold a bachelor’s degree, compared to 41 percent of Californians in that age range.
The regional economy plays a part in that gap. Wages in the Inland Empire are almost 40% lower than the state average, the report found. But key sectors in the region pay better than minimum wage without college degrees, attracting high school graduates to jobs with solid paychecks but limited career potential.
“In the past decade, most job growth in the Inland Empire has been driven by transportation, logistics and healthcare industries and most workers in these industries do not have or need a college degree,” said Kevin Cook, a policy researcher with the Public Policy Institute of California.  
Those jobs became a draw during the pandemic, when many students graduated without clear direction, university administrators told CalMatters.
Professional jobs still pay better than those, but the trade-off between educational investment and returns isn’t always clear to students and their families, he said.
“The lack of clear pathways from college to a career, the cost associated with attending college and the fact that returns to a college degree, although significantly higher than just a high school degree, might take years to come to fruition and that can be generally discouraging to students and their families,” Cook said.
Moreover, speakers said, the region is huge, with 4.6 million people and a geographic area bigger than most states. 
“The size and scale of the region and unique population and cultures within it, means developing a single set of policies to improve college outcomes is difficult,” Cook said.
In the past parents were skeptical about the need for a college degree, Cifuentes said, but recently some seem hostile.  Parents tell her: “You just want to get my child into loan debt. You just want them to be a socialist.”
“They’re taking information in bits and pieces and making judgments about higher education that have nothing to do with education, quality of life, or getting a high paid job and health benefits,” she said. 
To counter that, she said parents need more accurate information and “college enrollment and admissions really has to be a family decision.”
There are several things schools can do to boost college enrollment, the report found. 
Starting college preparation early is key, experts said. CalMatters reported on the Middle School Initiative at UC Riverside, which introduces seventh graders to the university.
If high schools align graduation requirements with California’s A-G standards, students will finish high school college-ready, speakers said. That might just mean adding one more math class or an extra year of foreign language.
Dual enrollment, which allows high school students to take some community college classes can also move the needle, by allowing students to get a jump on college coursework while completing graduation requirements.
And helping students complete college registration and financial aid applications during the school day, rather than offering optional after hours appointments, can spur more students to apply for college, Cifuentes said. 
“We can control it when the students are with us,” she said. “We’re already seeing immediate returns on that. We got over 23,000 more students so far already committed to CSU than in the past. But we did that all during the school day.”
Imperial County wants to halt solar farm development
Imperial County farmers are fighting to keep agricultural land in production as the state pushes to build solar farms, CalMatters’ Dan Walters reported.
The Imperial Irrigation District called for a halt to the conversion of agricultural fields into solar panel farms early this month. With more than 13,000 acres of fertile land already converted, the water district asked the Imperial County Board of Supervisors to protect productive farmland.
The conflict illustrates the state-wide decline in agricultural land, which declined by more than 1.6 million acres between 1984 and 2018. Some of that land has gone to solar farms, to meet state mandates for alternative energy sources.
California’s nearly $60 billion farm sector produces a third of the country’s vegetables and over three-quarters of the country’s fruits and nuts, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
False ICE reports spread fear
As ICE crackdowns disrupt the Inland Empire and other parts of California, mistaken reports of immigration action are causing chaos, the Press Enterprise reports.
Community groups have posted warnings of suspected ICE raids, ranging from a white law enforcement van at a Riverside McDonalds to officers in an SUV at a Jurupa Valley tire shop, as. But in those cases they got it wrong. 
There’s often confusion between immigration action and other law enforcement activity, and many alerts are well-intentioned but false. Others are malicious attempts to get attention or scare people, a political organization representing Mexican Americans stated. That can keep people from work, school and other daily activities.

Now I help others make the journey,Tommie Trevino,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/homelessness-and-addiction-journey-california/,Tommie Trevino knows how to make a comeback.  He says treating mental health and emotional harm are keys to recovery for addicts.,"Guest Commentary written by

Tommie Trevino
Tommie Trevino is a drug and alcohol abuse counselor at UC Davis Medical Center. 


My life changed 20 years ago, when my friend and I were floating down the Rogue River in Oregon.  Suddenly the motor fell off the boat, which tipped over. I slipped into the icy water. Some young children threw a life jacket over to me but I gave it to my friend.
As I sank into the river, my lungs began to fill up with water. My hands reached out to a branch on the side of the bank. As I looked up, I saw clouds moving in the sky and birds flying by. I heard a powerful voice say, “This is a little of my power and what I can do to you.” At that moment I knew it was my creator. 
When an ambulance arrived, the emergency medical technician told me it was a miracle  I survived the frigid water.
I had been an addict for over 30 years. I began my addiction at 17 years old, and until I was 47 years old, it was meth, marijuana, cocaine and alcohol.  The last two years of my addiction, I suffered from homelessness. 
But after surviving that fateful accident, I began my recovery. The first year was very difficult, fighting the impulse to go back to my addiction. When the year passed, my mind seemed to clear. I attended two years of college, studying mental health and addiction. The courses taught me how the brain works with addiction and the mental health challenges that perpetuate this disease. 
I also worked as a DUI counselor for 10 years and worked for five years in mental health along with drug addiction. After I received certification, I joined UC Davis Hospital to help support the emergency department in training the medical staff on how to treat homeless people who come off the street or the families that bring them into the emergency department to find help with the disease. 
There is a brief moment where we have the opportunity to help those individuals change. That person may come into the emergency department one time or 50 times. We always have that opportunity to help them change their lives forever.
Through training, a medical team member learns to treat the individual with care and respect, to connect with them without judgment and to build trust. Then a counselor can help the person find a treatment plan that best suits them. 
In the past, recovery consisted of treating the addiction. We have since found that mental health needs must be addressed for the recovery process to take place. 
There is a pain that drives the addiction in each individual. The discovery of that black hole, and working on healing from that emotional pain, is the key to recovery.
My goal is to help recovering addicts like me get clean. I want to be an example, to inspire people to begin their journey to recovery.  
I used drugs on-and-off for over 30 years. Those 30 years snuck up on me and passed so quickly.  I lost all that time. 
I want to help the suffering person to not have their toes sticking out of their shoes, being hungry every day — not only for food but for family and shelter. I want to help those suffering to not have to sleep on the street or on a stranger’s couch, with hope that someday things will change. I want to help those suffering to overcome feelings of shame, sadness, and hopelessness. I want to help them to not feel that deep hole of loneliness. 
Each person can have their awakening. It may be spiritual, physical, or emotional. There is recovery, and it is a hard road to begin, yet it’s so worth the journey.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/073015-Drug-Rehab-LA-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-30 08:56:11.845485

In Los Angeles, a Latino family sued their landlord and a real estate agent over illegal eviction, only for an attorney to suggest they were likely to be detained by immigration agents before the case could go to trial.
In Oakland, renters have been asked if they were “legal” by a landlord seeking to push them out.
Across the state, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, has scooped up swaths of household breadwinners, leaving their families scrambling to afford rent while grieving their absent loved ones. But the impact of those operations stretches further: The fear of deportation alone has discouraged many immigrants from exercising their rights as tenants.
It’s hard enough to be a tenant in California, where rents are among the highest in the country. Immigrants who are living illegally in the country often lack a reliable credit history and work low-paying jobs with tenuous benefits. They already find it harder to secure housing, pay more for the housing they do get, are more likely to live in overcrowded conditions and may be more likely to face eviction.
President Donald Trump’s intensifying immigration crackdown leaves those renters more vulnerable to eviction and exploitation, which could plunge more immigrants into homelessness or overcrowding, or even lead some to “voluntarily” leave the country, housing rights attorneys and scholars say. 
The fear of retaliation from landlords has created what advocates describe as a chilling effect on immigrant renters, which “substantially undercuts” California’s strong tenant protection laws, said David Hall, co-directing tenants’ rights attorney with Centro Legal de La Raza, a nonprofit legal aid group in Oakland. 
“You can have the most protective laws in the world, but if people are afraid to enforce those laws … it’s like for those people, those laws don’t exist,” he said.
Immigrants already face higher housing barriers
Finding a house. Making the rent. Warding off eviction. Every stage of navigating California’s housing market is already more challenging for California’s immigrant renters compared to their U.S.-born counterparts. 
Undocumented immigrant renters have access to far fewer public benefits than U.S. citizens. Even when benefits or services are available, there’s a “lower rate of uptake” among those who are living illegally in the country, due to a lack of awareness and fear of accessing those resources, said Thai V. Le, a research scientist at the USC Equity Research Institute. 
Those immigrants are therefore more likely to be rent-burdened, which experts define as paying more than 30% of a household’s income in rent. As of 2021, two-thirds of undocumented renters statewide were rent-burdened, compared to 57% of all immigrant renters and 53% of their U.S.-born peers, according to the California Immigrant Data Portal by the USC Equity Research Institute.
Once they find a place to rent, tenants without legal immigration status are less likely to assert their tenant rights and more likely than others to cram into overcrowded housing leased by friends or family members. Such arrangements often expose tenants to subpar living conditions, deprive them of legal protections because their name is not on the lease, and puts them at higher risk of homelessness should even one of their housemates lose income, said Melissa Chinchilla, a researcher with the Latino Policy and Politics Institute at UCLA. 
Seventy percent of foreign-born Latinos in California who are homeless lived in housing they did not hold the lease for, compared to 46% of U.S.-born Latinos, a June 2025 study by the University of California San Francisco found.
And once an undocumented immigrant becomes homeless, it is harder for them to regain housing, Chinchilla said.
“They may not be able to provide a credit check,” she said. “They may be paid cash. So they may not have that history of their income.” 
‘Do they want to create waves?’
All those fears and barriers have been dialed up to 11 as Trump has returned to the White House with more force and focus on aggressive, indiscriminate immigration enforcement.
Under his administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development have agreed to share residents’ personal data with ICE, which will soon see unprecedented levels of funding. Proposed cuts to immigrants’ access to public benefits such as early childhood education, health care and housing programs threaten the livelihood of families who rely on those services.
“Unfortunately, people’s worst fears are being confirmed,” said Cynthia Moreno, a senior data analyst with the Equity Research Institute.

The Trump administration’s widely publicized deportation blitz “creates a much more vulnerable environment for people who already, in the landlord-tenant relationship, have a disadvantage,” said Marie Claire Tran-Leung, an attorney at the National Housing Law Project, a tenant rights advocacy group. 
California’s tenant protection laws are among the strongest in the nation. They include a statewide cap on how much landlords can hike the rent each year, limits on application fees and security deposits and strict terms and conditions when a landlord moves to kick a tenant out. On paper, those rights apply to tenants, regardless of immigration status.
A 2018 state law bars landlords from asking about or disclosing a tenant’s immigration status to anyone, including federal immigration agents. It’s also illegal for housing providers to harass or threaten tenants over their immigration status.
But not every tenant is aware of or willing to exercise their rights.
“Even if a tenant has a really good landlord, if in the back of their mind they are always worried that (the landlord) could get them on the radar of ICE, a tenant might be deterred or chilled from enforcing these rights,” Hall said.
In the Central Valley, attendance at tenants’ rights workshops has dropped as immigrants fear being targeted by ICE at large events, said Daniela Juarez, a registered legal aid attorney with California Rural Legal Assistance.
“Organizations have stopped advertising their Know Your Rights Workshops and counting on word of mouth instead — for fear of becoming a target. Others are choosing to only do workshops by appointment to not expose their clients,” she wrote in an email. “Overall, they have all seen a chilling effect in services and are worried it will only get worse.”
Families are also afraid to appear in court for housing-related issues as immigration agents regularly detain people at courthouses across the country. In March, news of such an arrest outside the Sonoma County Probation office rippled through the immigrant community in Santa Rosa, said Patrick McDonnell, a housing attorney with Sonoma County Legal Aid.
“We have a lot of clients who are basically willing to take a deal that is not the best deal that we could get them in order to not have to be present in a courthouse,” said McDonnell. 
That’s been true even in cases where he and his colleagues believe a landlord’s allegations are “bogus or legally insufficient,” he said. “That person nevertheless is going to have to move out, just because we know that we don’t have a client who we’re going to be able to take to court.”
The fear doesn’t stop there: Asking for a repair. Making an informal complaint. Attending housing rights workshops. Seeking a routine accommodation. For undocumented immigrants, families with mixed immigration status or anyone who might otherwise be concerned about drawing the attention of immigration enforcement agents, such routine interactions have become more fraught. 
“Folks are really having to have a risk assessment,” Juarez said. “Do they want to create waves? Do I want to make my landlord upset?”
‘No silver bullet’ to financial hardships
Fear of deportation is also dissuading immigrants from going to work or receiving public benefits, which experts say could risk economic repercussions across the state.
During Trump’s first administration, immigrants withdrew from federal food benefits due to fear of getting targeted by immigration enforcement or hurting their chance at becoming citizens. Chinchilla said she fears history will repeat itself. Already, Trump is asking states to share information about food voucher recipients, prompting a lawsuit from California and 18 other Democratic-led states. 
“This fear was already there. I can only imagine how much more heightened it is now that we know it’s a reality that people’s information is really being shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” she said.

In Santa Rosa, a woman named Karen, who asked to be identified only by her first name because of her immigration status, lives with four of her six children in a two-bedroom apartment. The monthly rent is $2,299, according to the lease she shared with CalMatters. After ICE deported her husband — who earned the bulk of the family’s income as a gardener — back to Honduras in April, she said, she has scrambled to keep her family housed.
She contemplated asking the property manager to move the family to a smaller apartment. That would mean packing all five family members into a one-bedroom unit, but it would technically be affordable, she said. But Karen, who said she overstayed her visa from Honduras, worries that the mere request might provoke her landlord to initiate eviction proceedings. She said she’s also reticent to look for work herself, given her lack of legal status. Instead, she said, the family is scraping by on the income of her one working-age daughter and on money borrowed from family members while she considers her options.
There aren’t any obvious legal ones.
For renters like Karen who, as a result of a deportation, simply don’t have the funds to pay the rent, California’s expansive tenant protections don’t offer a remedy, even if she were willing to go to court, said McDonnell at Sonoma County Legal Aid. 
“The reality is there’s no silver bullet or solution to a lack of money to pay the rent,” he said.
Some local governments, such as Los Angeles County and the cities of Long Beach and Los Angeles, are establishing donation-funded programs to help immigrants make rent and other payments. The state also has several immigrant assistance programs, and California lawmakers authorized a $25 million boost earlier this year to provide legal services to immigrants through nonprofit organizations. 
But those dollars get spent down really fast, and “there’s always more need than there are dollars in the account,” Hall said.
In rural California, resources are scant and more scattered and hard to reach without a car, Juarez said.
“There’s evictions everywhere — there’s just less help to combat them in our rural communities and we could use all the help we can get,” she said.

Vance Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse on July 29, 2025. (Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)A panel of federal judges seemed split Tuesday on whether Alabama’s past resistance to a congressional map giving Black voters a better chance of electing their preferred leaders should subject the state to judicial review of future maps.
The three-judge panel — U.S. Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, and U.S. District Judges Anna M. Manasco and Terry F. Moorer, both appointees of President Donald Trump — heard arguments Tuesday over the request from plaintiffs in a lawsuit to put Alabama back under “preclearance,” which would subject any future congressional maps for approval by the court. 
Alabama was under preclearance under the Voting Rights Act from 1965 to 2013, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the part of the law that required preclearance for states with histories of voting discrimination like Alabama. If not preclearance, another option floated by lawyers for plaintiffs was to give the federal court jurisdiction for at least 60 days after new congressional maps are drawn in 2030, which would allow plaintiffs to challenge any new congressional maps drawn after the 2030 census based on the claims they already argued and won.
The court ordered the state to draw a new congressional map in 2023 after nearly two years of litigation with two appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. The panel ruled that the Legislature-approved map did not give Black voters the ability to choose their preferred leaders, and ordered a majority-minority congressional district and a district with a near-majority of Black voters to be drawn. After a trial earlier this year, the court ruled in May that Alabama had intentionally discriminated against Black voters by approving a map in 2023 that initially only had one majority-Black district.
Deuel Ross of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, representing plaintiffs who originally challenged an Alabama congressional map approved in 2021, said Tuesday that federal oversight, or at least giving the court jurisdiction for some time after 2030 — which would allow plaintiffs to ask the court to review any map passed by the Legislature based on claims previously made — is necessary to keep Alabama from “backsliding” on voting rights.
“We have the Legislature engaging in intentional discrimination when given the option to remedy the map, and that is, again, from our perspective, exactly why we need preclearance. It’s exactly the kind of concern that we want to prevent the state from doing, again, that kind of backsliding,” Ross said to the three-judge panel.

Preclearance would shift the burden of proof to the state and require it to demonstrate that any new map does not diminish the ability of Black voters to elect their chosen representatives. Ross said that the state’s past actions, including its initial resistance to drawing a second majority-Black or Black-opportunity district, were evidence of a pattern of “intentional discrimination.”
Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour argued against any oversight, referring to it as a “preclearance regime.” LaCour suggested that a mandatory injunction legally binding the state to use the court-ordered special master’s map through the 2030 census, would be sufficient. He argued that an injunction would be enforceable and that the case could be reopened if the state were found to be in violation.
“I think again, the question is, is an injunction going to get the job done? Injunction has got the job done up to this point, and would it in the future as well,” LaCour said to the judges.
LaCour argued that federal oversight would be appropriate if Alabama committed several constitutional violations, saying that preclearance is an “extraordinary remedy warranted only upon a finding of multiple violations of 14th or 15th Amendment,” and that the current situation is unlike historical “unremitting and ingenious defiance that made it nearly impossible for black voters in the south to register to vote.”
“One violation alone is not a pattern,” LaCour said.
LaCour declined to comment after the court hearing.
Marcus did not seem convinced by LaCour’s argument, and asked LaCour if he was “trying to make an argument that Alabama should be completely divorced from its history?”
“You stood in front of us and essentially asked us for time, which we gave you, and then your clients chose not to enact a remedy in compliance with our work. So, I hear you that to a certain extent, states should be given some ability to be viewed as actors with clean hands, but the state of Alabama shouldn’t be divorced from its history, should it?” Marcus asked.
LaCour said that there’s “a lot of history yet to be written,” again arguing that it would be hard to predict what a new elected state government would do after 2030.
Moorer indicated that he believed the injunction is sufficient to provide relief at least through 2030. Should the state try to pass new maps before the 2030 redistricting cycle, plaintiffs could ask the court to intervene again.
“So you would agree that through the remainder of the cycle, it’s a matter of no moment in terms of the relief the plaintiffs have sought and obtained,” Moorer asked Abha Khanna, an Elias Law Group attorney representing plaintiff Marcus Caster.
Khanna said that “it makes a theoretical difference in a world in which, for instance, in 2027 there is an attempt to redistrict again, notwithstanding the state’s assurances before this court.”
Manasco seemed more neutral and focused more on the procedural implications, though she was still focused on the “least intrusive way” of providing relief to plaintiffs.
“What if you had in hand a final judgment ordering the Secretary of State to administer all Alabama congressional elections through until the Alabama Legislature enacts a map after the 2030 census, according to special master map three and something happened,” Manasco asked Ross. “Circumstances unfolded such that the Legislature redistricted in ‘27 or anything like that. Why, in that case, do you need bail in instead of a retention of jurisdiction?”
Ross said that without court oversight, specifically under a process like preclearance, Alabama could engage in “gamesmanship,” potentially question and continue to challenge the special master’s map.
“I think that the retention of jurisdiction, the clarity of what [preclearance] does and doesn’t require, is really important, even if the court only wants to retain jurisdiction through the 2030 election,” Ross said.
Leticia Jackson, one of the plaintiffs present at the hearing, said she strongly supports preclearance and she’s cautiously optimistic Alabama may be placed under oversight, pointing to Alabama’s history of resistance to voting rights.
“The state has a history of this. They actually stood in court and told the court they did not have to abide by their order,” Jackson said in an interview after the hearing. “Preclearance is important for that very reason.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PXL_20250729_213242024.MP2_-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-30 08:56:11.845485

July 29, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceCommunity and environmental justice advocates from all across the state gathered in Lansing on Tuesday as lawmakers from the state House and Senate discussed revived legislation intended to address the cumulative impacts of pollution in communities with high concentrations of industry. 
Several speakers argued the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy’s process for evaluating air pollution is broken, and fails to consider the combined health impacts on community health.
However, Senate Bill 479 and House Bill 4742, put forth by Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) and Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit) respectively, would require EGLE to consider the full impact of these pollutants on the community, rather than evaluating them individually. 
“We breathe pollution from all the sources around us, not one at a time,” said Kathryn Savoie, director of equity and environmental justice at the Ecology Center, noting that communities of color and communities with lower-levels of income bear a disproportionate burden from pollution.

Alongside requiring the state to consider the cumulative impacts of multiple pollutant types, the act would require the agency to take into account social and economic factors that put communities at greater risk of harm, Chang said. 
EGLE would have clear authority under this law to deny an environmental permit application if there is a negative impact on overburdened communities and there’s no compelling need for the project, Chang said, with the agency utilizing its environmental justice screening tool in making such a determination. 
Additionally, the policy would require permit applicants to publish information about the permit’s public hearing in at least two newspapers within a community, including a local non-English paper, giving the community 60-days notice about the hearing and information about the project’s impact.

While Southwest Detroit is often used as an example of the impacts of cumulative pollution due to the large number of industrial facilities in the area, alongside pollution from vehicle traffic, Raquel Garcia, executive director of Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision, noted that these issues are present in several other Michigan communities, including Waterford in Oakland County, and Wyandotte and Flat Rock in Wayne County. 
Deirdre Nieves, director of climate solutions and justice for the West Michigan Environmental Action Council, called attention to federal efforts to roll back pollution protections, including limits on mercury and air pollution and the good neighbor rule, which is intended to limit smog in communities located downwind from power plants and industrial facilities.
President Donald Trump’s administration has also offered a variety of polluters exemptions from Clean Air Act regulations.

While there’s nothing that can be done at the state level to completely alleviate the harm brought on by these federal rollbacks, Chris Gilmer-Hill, policy associate for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition said the state at least has a lot of power to say no to pollution
“Even though that [federal] backstop is gone, this bill would let us say that we’re still going to protect our communities from those overlapping sources. And certainly anything that now gets allowed at the federal level would and must be taken into account,” Gilmer-Hill said.

The new law signed by Gov. Joe Lombardo last month allows construction work on highways, roads, and commercial infrastructure to start as early as 5 a.m. — about two hours earlier than what most local noise rules previously allowed. 
The earlier start times will only be permitted during the hottest months of the year – from April 1st through September 30th – and must be at least 300 feet from any occupied home. 
Still, more Nevadans can now expect to wake up to heavy equipment, not alarms.
Before the new law passed, commercial construction projects near residential areas were prohibited from starting before 7 a.m. due to strict local noise ordinances, forcing construction crews to work into the late afternoon when temperatures are highest.
Construction workers are at an elevated risk of heat stress, due to the strenuous nature of the work, high temperature work conditions, and a changing climate. Commercial and infrastructure projects are also typically done over super-heating materials like pavement and asphalt, making temperatures even hotter. 
Some areas of Clark County allow construction to start as early as 2 a.m. in non-residential areas. 
Vince Saavedra, the executive secretary-treasurer of the Southern Nevada Building Trades Unions, recalls getting regular calls from contractors working near residential areas desperate to start earlier in the day. One particular project to build a wall along a freeway was a prime candidate for an earlier start time to avoid the summer heat, but its proximity to homes made it impossible for crews to start before the sun rose. 
“It’s a difficult situation and I think elected officials are tasked with a difficult happy medium,” Saavedra said. 
The bill, AB478, was widely supported by the construction industry, including the Nevada Contractors Association, the Southern Nevada Building and Construction Trade Unions, and the Northern Nevada Building and Construction Trades Council. It passed unanimously in both the Assembly and Senate.
Lawmakers said the new law was spurred by a dramatic increase in heat-related complaints and workplace injuries reported to the Nevada Occupational Health and Safety Administration starting in 2021.
In 2024, Nevada OSHA received 485 heat-related complaints, the largest number of complaints in the agency’s history. About 5% of those complaints were from the construction industry.
That same year 526 people died of heat-related causes in Clark County alone — a record that highlights why labor and industry groups pushed for earlier work hours.
Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can lead to heat stroke, heat exhaustion, or other health emergencies that can affect a worker’s ability to operate heavy equipment or machinery safely.
Extreme heat can also cause other safety issues for construction workers, as palms get sweaty, safety goggles fog up from perspiration, and skin burns from coming into contact with hot metal. In a cruel twist, the same personal protective equipment that keeps construction workers safe on job sites can also increase the risk of heat-related illnesses.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health emphasizes that one of the most effective strategies to mitigate heat-related risk is scheduling high risk tasks during cooler parts of the day. 
Democratic Rep. Sandra Jauregui was instrumental in helping advance the bill after backing similar bills in 2021 and 2023. 
However, both bills focused largely on prohibiting common-interest communities, counties, and cities from restricting the hours residential construction work could start in the summer.
During hearings for the bill, Jauregui said the bill was necessary to cover commercial construction.
“It’s not fair that those working on pavement to build our highways and roads and infrastructure aren’t protected like our construction workers who are building our homes,” said Jauregui in May.
“Those in the commercial construction industry are uniquely susceptible to heat related injuries. The work comes with inherent risks, which are amplified by exposure to direct sunlight during the hottest months of the year,” she continued. 
Representatives for Clark County, while not opposing the bill, noted the most populous county in Nevada was always under construction and would most certainly attract noise complaints under the new law. 
Summer Pellett, a former member of the Storey County Planning Commission, said she was involved first-hand in the municipal process that imposed work hour restrictions on the construction industry for her county, but has since changed her views after running a construction company. 
“I was simply just trying to reduce noise pollution to residents that were adjacent to construction activity. However, I do believe that I was ignorant to the fact that these noise restrictions came at a cost and needlessly required these construction workers to perform manual labor during the heat of the day,” Pallett said in May.
“It is imperative that we understand that noise pollution related to construction activity is temporary, while heat presents serious health and safety issues to our workforce,” she continued. 
Nevada is not the only state that implemented statewide restriction on construction hours this year.
Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law in May that will allow construction to start as early as 5 a.m. from May 1st through October 15. Companies can begin pouring concrete, whether for new developments or a neighbor installing a new driveway, an hour before construction starts.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image018.jpg,,,2025-07-30 08:56:11.845485

[…]","David Lee Roberts, 59, was convicted of the 1992 murder of Aneetra Jones in 1992 and sentenced to death. A judge in Marion County suspended Roberts' execution earlier this month pending a psychological exam. (Alabama Department of Corrections)An Marion County circuit judge stayed the execution of David Lee Roberts earlier this month pending the results of a psychological examination.
Judge Lee Carter issued an order on July 10 suspending the scheduled Aug. 21 execution of Roberts after his attorneys filed a motion saying Roberts is mentally incompetent, which would prohibit his execution.
“The court has received information from petitioner’s attorney indicating that the petitioner may lack the understanding of why the state seeks to impose that punishment and upon motion for examination having been filed by the state of Alabama,” Carter said in his order.
Roberts was convicted of capital murder for the death of Annetra Jones in April 1992. If his execution proceeds, he would be the fourth person put to death this year, and the third executed by nitrogen gas.
Roberts’ attorneys stated in their filing that he currently suffers from schizophrenia and was diagnosed by a psychologist with the Alabama Department of Corrections in February, who said Roberts was hearing noises.
A psychologist from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill met with Roberts in April and provided the same diagnosis, saying Roberts does not understand why people keep discussing his conviction of capital murder.
“He also becomes myopically focused on and distressed by his delusional beliefs and auditory hallucinations, rendering him unable to meaningfully discuss these important topics,” the psychologist said in the report following the examination.
Roberts’ attorneys also said that the death row inmate was diagnosed with delusional disorder in 2002 and placed in a safe cell in 2009 after writing a letter that the warden of his prison viewed as a suicide threat.
Carter ordered that Roberts undergo a mental health exam administered by the Alabama Department of Mental Health to determine if Roberts suffers from a mental illness, if he understands the reason that Alabama is having him executed and he understands that he has been convicted of capital murder and is sentenced to death.
To be declared mentally fit to be executed, a person must understand the nature of the proceedings and be able to communicate and assist counsel in the defense. Roberts’ attorneys argued that he is unable to meet either of those requirements.
“In fact, when counsel met with him in mid-April to attempt a discussion about the State’s pending motion to set his execution date, he was so overwhelmed by delusions that his tattoos were manipulating his mind, he had attempted to burn them off his skin,” his attorneys said in the motion.
Civil rights groups have called for Ivey to commute his sentence of death.

“While it is positive that Marion County Circuit Judge Talmage Lee Carter issued a temporary stay of execution on July 10 for a mental health evaluation, Roberts’ mental condition is far from the only alarming aspect in his case. He had ineffective legal representation at trial, and the judge imposed the death penalty against the jury decision, a practice now outlawed,” Amnesty International said in a statement on Tuesday. “We urge Alabama Governor Kay Ivey to commute David Roberts’ death sentence.”

Gov. Kay Ivey earlier this month set a September execution date for Geoffrey Todd West, who was sentenced to death for the murder of Margaret Parrish Berry in March 1997.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/David-Lee-Roberts-horizontal-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-07-30 08:56:11.845485

John Larson  in a 90-second video posted on social media at 5:30 a.m.,"Luke Bronin, the former two-term Hartford mayor who raised $1 million to unseat an incumbent a decade ago, formally began a challenge Wednesday morning to 14-term U.S. Rep. John B. Larson for the Democratic nomination in the 1st Congressional District in 2026.
Bronin, 46, who recently tried to coax the 77-year-old Larson into retirement, made his anticipated announcement in a 90-second video posted on social media at 5:30 a.m., becoming the third and best-known challenger to an incumbent untested since winning the open seat in 1998.
“I’m running for Congress, because we have to change the way we’re doing things, and we don’t have time to wait,” Bronin said.
Sleeves rolled up and looking straight into camera, Bronin presented himself as a needed jolt of energy and purpose for a Democratic Party at a cross-roads, controlling every congressional seat in Connecticut, but struggling nationally after Donald J. Trump won a second term.
“I’ve got three kids, and I’m scared for their future and for our country, and I’m worried about our Democratic Party, too,” he said. “If we’re going to win back what we lost to Donald Trump, we need a party that makes sense to people, that’s not trying to defend the system that’s broken, but trying to fix it, a party that you’re energized and excited about because we are aggressive and clear about what we’re fighting for and who we’re fighting for.”
Bronin is a Navy veteran of Afghanistan who worked in the Obama administration and served as general counsel to former Gov. Dannel P. Malloy before winning the first of two terms as mayor of Hartford in 2015, taking control of a city government then on the verge of bankruptcy.
“As mayor, I was honest about problems and serious about fixing things. You saw me work 24/7, 365, for eight years fighting for my city every way I knew how,” Bronin said. “And that’s the kind of energy and urgency the Democratic Party needs in Congress from every single leader — not someday in the future, but right now.”
That was the essence of his initial pitch for unseating Larson: It’s time.
Bronin offered no criticism of Larson, nor did he highlight any differences in issues with the liberal congressman or mention him by name. But he essentially offered a tip of the cap to Larson and repeated a message he delivered in person to the congressman over coffee less than three weeks ago.
“I respect people who’ve served in Congress for decades, but at a certain point it’s just time to let some new voices in. Join me and let’s make the change we know we need,” Bronin said. “It’s time.”
With the help of significant state aid, Bronin succeeded in stabilizing Harford’s finances. He did not seek a third term and exited city hall in January 2024. He and his wife, Sara Bronin, have since announced a separation and intention to divorce.
School board member Ruth Fortune, 37, of Hartford created a campaign committee to challenge Larson on July 3, and Councilman Jack Perry, 35, of Southington followed suit on July 22, vowing to spending $500,000 of his own money in a safe Democratic district centered on Hartford and its suburbs.
Larson, a lifelong resident of East Hartford whose political career began with election to the town’s school board in 1977, began July with $262,467 in cash on hand and the expectation of an easy summer before kicking off a promised reelection campaign in the fall.
Bronin, who grew up in Westchester, N.Y., and settled in Hartford after attending Yale as an undergraduate and law student, will not have access to all the same Hartford-area donors challenging Larson as he did in running for mayor. But his financial base is broader than Hartford County.
The early filing by Fortune was a harbinger of things to come, but Larson says he nonetheless was stunned when Bronin suggested in person it was time to pass the baton. A fourth potential challenger, state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, has been making calls gauging support.
Democrats say a rattled Larson has been making calls shoring up support among potential delegations to a nominating convention next year. His last competitive race was the primary he won in 1998 over Secretary of the State Miles Rapoport for the seat Barbara B. Kennelly was leaving to run for governor.
Larson suffered a “complex partial seizure” that caused him to freeze and abruptly stop speaking while delivering a speech in the House of Representatives in February. He had a briefer, similar episode at a press conference in April.
Larson remains the favorite at prevailing in a nominating convention, but Bronin is capable of testing him in a primary. 
Qualifying for a primary requires winning 15% of the convention vote or gathering signatures from 2% of registered Democrats in the district.

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA).A lawsuit filed against the Trump administration by a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general, including Nevada’s, alleges that personal data mined from federal agencies could be used illegally to build a surveillance state unlike the nation has ever seen – putting recipients for things like food assistance at risk if they are being targeted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is illegally demanding states turn over personal and sensitive information about millions of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, recipients.
SNAP is a state-administered, federally-funded program that provides billions of dollars in food assistance to tens of millions of low-income families. Personal information is provided to state and federal administrators in order to receive assistance, with an understanding that the information will only be used for SNAP purposes.
Moves by the Trump administration to force various departments to share that data with unrelated agencies, like ICE, sets up a system where the latter could potentially track deportation targets through information provided for SNAP. The USDA has also suggested that it would withhold state funding if states fail to comply with the information sharing mandate, effectively creating a gambit where states must choose residents’ privacy over vital assistance.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, speaking to reporters in a news conference Monday that included California Attorney General Rob Bonta and New York Attorney General Letitia James, said the episode was yet another attempt by the Trump administration to illegally use personal and sensitive data under the guise of fighting abuse and fraud.
“My colleagues and I will not allow this administration to trample on constitutional protections or unlawfully exploit the SNAP program in this way,” Nessel said. “Michigan families deserve to have their personal information protected, and I will keep fighting until they receive exactly that.”
Since taking office, reports have indicated that Trump is amassing a huge database of personal information on Americans using that data for undisclosed purposes, much like immigration enforcement. The USDA demands regarding SNAP information appear to be another step toward that goal, the lawsuit posits.
Bonta touched on the consequences of Trump’s White House having that much personal data on Americans at its fingertips.
“It’s a bait and switch of the worst kind,” Bonta said. “SNAP recipients provided this information to get help feeding their families, not to be entered into a government surveillance database or be used as targets in the president’s inhumane immigration agenda. That’s the reality here. This isn’t about oversight and transparency. This is about establishing widespread surveillance under the guise of fighting fraud.”
Bonta added that the attorneys general in the lawsuit are calling the issue what it is: An illegal data grab designed to scare people away from public assistance programs.
James said the entire framework of Trump’s immigration policies was cruelty on public display, but the demand regarding SNAP was a new low.
“It is outrageous. It is unacceptable,” James said. “This is not for research or to improve a service that millions count on. They are basically trying to weaponize the SNAP program against immigrant communities in violation of the law, and we collectively will not stand for it. That is the administration’s plans, and they have made it abundantly clear.”
States participating in the lawsuit include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

Community health centers could be especially hurt by major cuts to Medicaid included in President Donald Trump’s tax cut and spending bill. And a now-delayed federal rule change barring some immigrants from accessing certain health care services could force clinics to reject patients.
Washington has 27 such health centers, half of which serve rural communities, according to the state Health Care Authority. In the state’s 2024 fiscal year, they received $666 million in Medicaid payments.
“Community health centers really are a backbone of the primary care safety net,” said Dave Pearson, the CEO of the Washington Association of Community Health.
The clinics provide a range of services, from behavioral health care to dentistry.
And they don’t turn anyone away, regardless of insurance status. But if more and more uninsured people come in, that’ll mean community health centers bearing those costs, even with federal grants that help subsidize care.
The new law, signed July 4, is expected to cut around $900 billion of federal Medicaid spending nationwide over 10 years. Much of this reduction is tied to stricter work requirements that are expected to push people off the insurance program for low-income Americans.
Cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplace could leave nearly 10 million people without insurance by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Estimates of how many people could become uninsured in Washington vary. According to Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office, 250,000 would stand to lose Medicaid coverage, known here as Apple Health.
Meanwhile, this month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced a new policy barring many lawfully present migrants and immigrants without permanent legal status from accessing a number of federal benefits, like Head Start education programs, federally funded mental and behavioral health services, as well as community health centers.
Nationally, three in 10 immigrant adults say these health centers are their usual source of care, including 37% of lawfully present immigrants and 42% of immigrants who likely don’t have legal status, according to a 2023 survey.
Washington and 20 other states sued over the policy change, leading the federal government on Friday to agree not to enforce it until at least September.
Combine cuts to Medicaid with eliminating services for immigrants, and the changes will affect every patient at community health centers, Pearson said. 
“We’re really causing a perfect storm, if you will, for these health centers to be able to continue to provide their services in a way that is both highly accessible and high quality,” he said.
Medicaid
As of June, over 1.9 million Washington residents, including over 850,000 children, were enrolled in Apple Health, according to the state Health Care Authority. That’s roughly a quarter of the state’s population, though the total number of enrollees has been dropping for months.
Community health centers serve over a third of those 1.9 million-plus residents, Pearson said, noting that Medicaid patients make up 61% of the care delivered at these clinics.
Yakima Neighborhood Health Services, for example, served 25,000 people last year, said CEO Rhonda Hauff. Of those, 65% to 70% of patients are on Medicaid, and about 20% don’t have insurance.
“There’s going to be tough choices in the days ahead with regard to which kind of services are we able to sustain. Are we going to need to make staff changes and essentially just reductions in workforce across these centers and potentially even closing locations?” Pearson said.
Community health centers serve an especially important role in rural areas, where hospitals could be hit hard by Medicaid cuts. If those hospitals close or cut back, the health centers could be the only nearby option left for some people in the state, Pearson noted. 
The biggest change for Medicaid is new work requirements to maintain coverage. Starting as soon as 2027, enrollees will consistently have to prove they’re working, volunteering or attending classes at least 80 hours per month or show they qualify for an exemption. The mandate would apply to healthy adults up to age 64 without dependent children under 13 years old.
States have experimented with work requirements but ran into paperwork issues and added costs. In Arkansas, for example, the requirements didn’t increase employment but did result in people losing Medicaid coverage. 
“It’s not the fact that people work,” said Hauff, with Yakima Neighborhood Health Services. “It’s the administrative burden of putting the documents together and being able to produce the documents on a regular basis.”
Hauff has some experience with this. When the federal public health emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic ended in 2023, states had to restart reviewing Medicaid eligibility after a multi-year pause. 
At Yakima Neighborhood Health Services, 10,000 members needed help to renew their eligibility. Of those, 1,900 lost coverage within a year, mostly due to providing incomplete information. Another 6% voluntarily disenrolled.
“The time and the effort that was involved in finding these folks and helping them get health coverage, that was significant,” Hauff said. “We see that just multiplying.”
She worries newly uninsured patients will forgo care until their needs get serious and they end up in the emergency room. This is particularly an issue in Yakima, where hospitals are already stretched. 
“It’s very dangerous when they’re that backed up for the people that are really needed to be able to get in there,” Hauff said.
Immigrants
The federal policy change on serving migrants in community health centers could compound that issue.
These patients will likely instead be forced to seek care in emergency rooms. 
“It will be devastating if we have to change our practices,” Hauff said.
In a statement announcing the new rule last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said it “restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people.”
“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” he said.
Health centers don’t ask patients about their immigration status, so the change also poses an administrative hurdle.
The rule rewrite appears to conflict with federal statute requiring community health centers to serve patients regardless of immigration status.
“We’re required by federal statute and by mission to serve everyone who walks through our doors,” Pearson said. “So the policy change definitely lies in contrast with our understood mission as primary care providers.”
The new tax cut law also restricts subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage for some lawfully present immigrants, like asylum seekers and refugees.

Vermont cannot reach its long-term goals without embracing the potential of all Vermonters.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Franklin and Kevin Chu: Addiction recovery contributes to economic recovery.","This commentary is by Daniel Franklin, executive director of the Vermont Association for Mental Health and Addiction Recovery, and Kevin Chu, executive director of the Vermont Futures Project.


Vermont’s future depends on a pivotal choice: Embrace growth and abundance or succumb to stagnation and scarcity. 
This is not just about economics. It’s about the social fabric of our communities and the well-being of Vermonters. A healthy economy merely enables affordability and ample services.
One lever for inclusive economic growth is investing in recovery services for Vermonters affected by substance use disorders. These investments are not just compassionate. They’re strategically aligned with the Vermont Economic Action Plan’s goal to increase labor force participation rate to 70% by 2035. 
To get there, we must remove the barriers that keep tens of thousands of Vermonters sidelined from the workforce, including those in recovery.
The economic and social toll of substance use disorders is profound. Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated the cost of the opioid epidemic in the U.S. exceeded $1 trillion in 2017, which encompasses health care expenses, lost productivity and criminal justice costs. 
In Vermont, rates of overdose deaths are higher than the national average, and 34% of adults with mental health issues report an unmet need for counseling or therapy compared with 28% elsewhere. 
Within these numbers is an opportunity. Every Vermonter in recovery represents untapped potential to strengthen our communities.
Recovery programs work. They reduce recidivism, ease the burden on the criminal justice and health care systems, and, most importantly, reconnect people with purpose. 
The Vermont Association for Mental Health and Addiction Recovery’s important work — advocating for treatment access, supportive housing and recovery-friendly workplaces — helps people overcome stigma and reintegrate as employees, neighbors and contributors to society. These are efficiency strategies aligned with the Economic Action Plan to address Vermont’s workforce shortage by increasing labor market participation and productivity of current Vermonters.
Recovery also intersects directly with another urgent need in Vermont: housing. Stable housing is a cornerstone of recovery, and developing recovery residences adds to Vermont’s housing stock while supporting human and community transformation through economic growth.
Vermont cannot reach its long-term goals without embracing the potential of all Vermonters. Investing in recovery is an economic development strategy — it reconnects individuals to work, adds to housing abundance, reduces public costs and expands the tax base. Without inclusive growth, Vermont faces a path toward scarcity where rising costs or cuts to services become the only options.
The Vermont Futures Project Economic Action Plan charts a better path, one that’s rooted in affordability and abundance. Supporting recovery is a strategy that expands opportunities, while economic growth generates resources to sustain the services. It’s a virtuous cycle that benefits individuals, employers and communities. 
Choosing abundance means valuing every Vermonter’s potential. By embedding recovery into our statewide economic strategy, we move from managing crises to building a more resilient and inclusive future.

Kennedy’s last act before he was assassinated was to sign a bill to create a community mental health system across the U.S. (Photo by Getty Images)Our nation’s federalist system was designed to divide power between federal government and the states. It has been an uneasy balance, and while it has tended toward greater federal authority over time, there remains substantial variation in how states govern themselves. 
Human services policy is one area where such variation between states is alive and well, with widely varying levels of benefits and services across the country, depending on what state you live in. 
Our current system is best described as a federal-state system, where funding and responsibilities are divided between the federal and state levels. 
President Donald Trump’s domestic policy bill recently passed by Congress represents a retrenchment by the federal government, another sloughing off to the states, another retreat from our nation’s commitment to provide for all people regardless of where they live. 
This matters because the most significant advancements in human services have been driven by the federal government. Only the federal government has the fiscal capacity to support the sizable investments needed for health care, behavioral health, income support and long-term care.
The first federal foray into human services was less than a century ago, but it was a big one: The Social Security Act of 1935. The SSA included Social Security, a national system of unemployment insurance and income support for people with disabilities. 
Prior to that, most states had various state laws and programs undergirded by local governments — systems of town, county or parrish relief that were established by states in the 18th and 19th centuries. 
The federal role continued to expand after the SSA, including the Great Society programs of the 1960s, like Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for people with disabilities and the poor.
At the time, the progress made through the 1960s and 1970s seemed to represent a move toward a more comprehensive national system of services, which is the model common in other developed countries. 
But since that time there has been no clear direction. The Reagan administration pulled back on the trend of the previous decades. But there has also been progress, such as the addition of prescription coverage to Medicare, the expansion of tax credits for low-income earners and the Affordable Care Act. 
Medicaid has also evolved, providing opportunities to cover more people and expand services. But these expansions are mostly state options, perpetuating differences in access to health care coverage and the breadth of services between states.

Do we need a more nation-wide system? 
To answer this question, we should consider why we created federal programs in the first place. The Social Security Act included Social Security because the number of older Americans living in poverty had become a national shame. It wasn’t a state-by-state problem; it was a nationwide problem. 
Likewise, the SSA created a national system of unemployment insurance because the Great Depression demonstrated that workers across America needed protection from economic cycles. And Medicare was created because seniors across the country could not afford health care. 
And so on. 
These were understood to be national problems, affecting all communities and all Americans, and requiring national solutions. And, importantly, requiring the level of investment that only the federal government can bring. 
Without this federal commitment, we get a patchwork across the country, and individual states struggle to create truly comprehensive and effective services. 
Every decision to step back—  and rely on the under-resourced states — has consequences, some of them long lasting. 
Mental health is a good example.
President John F. Kennedy’s last act before he was assassinated was to sign a bill to create a community mental health system across the U.S. Over a decade later, it had become clear we had failed to fully develop that system. In response, Congress passed the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980, which provided federal funds to support and build out a community-based system. 
A year later, in 1981, the Act was repealed, the funding cut and combined with other funds in the creation of a social services block grant for states.  
Lack of adequate treatment and services for mental health is a problem across all states; a crisis in many. Yet we have a patchwork across states and fragmented systems in most states. 
We have come to accept — like gravity — that Americans in different states have access to different services. But this reality is the result of choices. 
We sit at another crossroad. Is Trump’s new law just another salvo in the back-and-forth of the last four and half decades, or is it the start of a broader effort to push more responsibility for human services back to the states?
States can be the bulwark against this tide, but even wealthier states lack the fiscal capacity of the federal government. And the differences between states will likely worsen. 
But perhaps there is a hopeful note. 
Consider this:  The big federal human services programs – Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, the Affordable Care Act — all have something in common: 
They were controversial when they passed — but quickly became widely popular. 
Once you create them, these programs are hard to get rid of. People – voters – like them because they do a decent job addressing national problems that rightly shamed us, and because sooner or later nearly all of us and our loved ones will need them.
 So, maybe in another century we’ll have a nationwide system of human services.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-3321635.jpg,,,2025-07-30 07:56:24.177136

(Getty Images)In 2017, more than 2.2 million children were identified as having a parent navigating opioid use disorder. In Indiana, that included more than 57,500 K-12 students. Indiana ranked 13th in the country per capita with 35 of every 1,000 K-12 aged students that had opioid affected parents.  
These children are not addicts themselves, but have had a parent who misused opioids, was incarcerated for opioid use, or died due to an opioid overdose. Their parent’s addiction to opioids has left this population of students to be raised by a sober single parent, a grandparent, the foster care system, or some other form of kinship. 
Essentially, our state lost a notable portion of the parenting population to the opioid crisis. 
This parenting void has left their children, their families, the schools, and their communities struggling to cope with the aftermath. The children of addicts are overwhelming schools with higher rates of special education and behavioral health needs, the welfare service system, the health care system, the justice system, and Medicaid. They experience higher rates of abuse and neglect than children who do not have a parent with addiction issues and are at an increased danger of not graduating high school. 
Specifically, children of addicts have lower rates of attendance and academic achievement, while also experiencing higher rates of behavior issues. These young Hoosiers are the innocent victims of the opioid addition crisis, and they currently have no voice in policy making or the advocacy landscape. They are the second generation of the opioid crisis and their cries for help have gone unheard for too long.  
Settlement Support for Victims?
To date Indiana has obtained more than $1 billion dollars from the nation Opioid Settlement Funds. During the first two years of the opioid settlement fund distribution, former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration focused the primary allocation of these funds to on the ground community based organizations to save the lives of the addicts themselves. Unfortunately, none of those funds have gone to supporting the children of addicts as they desperately try to navigate life without a healthy parent to support their academic or behavioral development. 
Even though evidence-based practices in schools are an allowable expense per the settlement fund agreement, Indiana’s 2023 and 2024 plan and expenditures left these children, their caregivers, and their schools holding the bag without any funding or support. 
While schools in Indiana scramble to navigate dwindling budgets, chronic absenteeism, excruciating incidents of escalating behaviors, and lagging academic achievement, the lion share of the very dollars that could help them were not even spent in 2023 and 2024. 
Specifically, Indiana’s 2024 Annual Opioid Settlement Report depicts a painfully slow or dysfunctional system of fund distribution. While Hoosier students, schools, and families are struggling to make it thru the day, 80% of restricted funds and 82% of unrestricted funds have not been allocated. Worse yet, 79% of community committees designated to allocate the funds have not even been created.  
 Indiana’s $10.5 Billion Question
The opioid settlement is billions of dollars over multiple years, because the crisis ravaged our country. For almost five years in a row, 58 Indiana counties had 100 opioid prescriptions for every 100 residents. A crisis of this scale and scope didn’t just hurt addicts, it damaged generations of Hoosiers. 
Indiana’s students that have a parent navigating opioid addiction are on track to cost the state $10.5 billion by 2030 in special education services, Medicaid expenditures, and social services. Cleaning up the fallout of the opioid crisis will take an aggressive and generational strategy. To solely spend settlement dollars on opioid users and often ineffective prevention programs is reactive and leaves the second generation of innocent victims left scrambling for answers. It will also leave state agencies continuing to scramble to meet the needs left by a lost generation of parents.
We only have $1 billion to curb a $10.5 billion problem barreling toward us over the next five years. We need to invest in the innocent victims who offer us the most promise of a bright future. We need a new approach that ensures that students with a parent navigating opioid addiction attend school, learn to read, graduate high school, and are prepared for careers that ensure they can live healthy adult lives.

Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law, promising that in America, access to healthcare would not depend on the size of a person’s bank account. In the decades since, these programs have transformed that promise into reality for hundreds of millions of people. But just weeks ago, the administration, backed by 268 legislators, passed a law that will kick at least 10.5 million people off Medicaid by 2034. And it’s exactly in moments like these that showing up for one another becomes critical.
These lives are not just numbers; they are mothers recovering from childbirth, children with asthma, seniors who rely on home care aides, and people managing chronic illnesses like diabetes or cancer. Before Medicaid, if someone couldn’t afford it, they went without health care. Doctors could—and did—turn people away if they couldn’t pay up front. Hospital doors were closed to too many, and especially to Black, brown, rural, and working-class communities.
Medicare and Medicaid changed that. They made health care a right, not a privilege. Today, Medicaid covers one in five Americans and nearly 45 percent of births in Michigan, providing critical care for older adults, people with disabilities, and low-income families.
Experts have repeatedly warned that cutting Medicaid will have deadly consequences on the pre-existing black maternal health crisis. My story is one of many: when I had my first child, Medicaid covered my birth but ended my support soon after. I was uninsurable during that critical postpartum period. That is exactly why Michigan’s extension to 12-month coverage was such a hard-won victory. Nationwide, Medicaid covers over 64 percent of births by Black moms. Nonpartisan groups, like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, advocate for closing the Medicaid gap to improve black maternal health, not busting it open. Now, that gap will be wider than ever.
It’s clear that for some politicians, the mandate to represent all people is one they’re not interested in fulfilling. These so-called “leaders” are willing to throw poor people under the bus if it means they can help the health insurance industry continue to profit. They know exactly how devastating these cuts will be, delaying the inevitable consequences until 2027 to avoid political consequences before the next election. Even as families face the risk of losing coverage and hospitals struggle to remain open, their elected representatives have their eyes on the next election.
When politicians represent business interests and not people, hospitals close, everyday Americans undergo unnecessary hardship, quality of life suffers, and people die. What might have been a drive to a nearby hospital for a treatable emergency is now a death sentence, the closest ER hours away.
Already, three Michigan hospitals that serve rural communities are at “immediate risk” of closing under these cuts, and many more are endangered. These cuts will hit working families the hardest. Picture a mother in Flint, Michigan, skipping her own meals because she needs to afford both food and insulin for her child. Or a home health aide in Detroit, not only losing her coverage but the job that provided it.
Medicare and Medicaid didn’t happen by accident. They happened because people demanded a better country. Protecting them now will take that same relentless energy. At Mothering Justice, we have been fighting for families for more than a decade. We know that this fight will be long and that it will take all of us. But, we’re organizing, we’re advocating, and we’re amplifying voices in every statehouse and on Capitol Hill.
Our elected officials need to hear directly from us – our political will and the demand that we be heard is what makes change. Even if we don’t use Medicare or Medicaid ourselves, our communities are only as healthy as the neighbors who live within it. When we use our political power to stand up for one another, we make it easier to create that world together.
Now is the time to show up at legislators’ town halls, call council members’ offices, write letters, and organize in your neighborhoods. Vote. And bring others along the way.
To all the mamas who are exhausted, worried, and doing their best in a system that is failing all of us: we are not powerless. When those in power won’t stand for us, we can — and will — stand for each other.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The number of Wisconsin county sheriff’s offices participating in a collaborative program with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has jumped from nine to 12 this year, with other forms of cooperation with ICE growing across the state, according to a report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin. 
The report shows more sheriff offices joining the 287(g) program over the last three years. The program carves out dedicated immigration operations within the sheriff’s offices, shares data with ICE and increases local participation in ICE detention requests. 
The ACLU report, released Tuesday, is an update from its 2022 report on Wisconsin’s “Jail-to-deportation pipeline.” 
“Immigrants have been an important part of the fabric of Wisconsin for many years,” said Tim Muth, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Wisconsin, in a statement released by the ACLU, along with the updated report. “They are a part of our families. They are our coworkers, friends, and neighbors, and the public should know what their local law enforcement agencies are doing.”
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
In 2022, there were eight law enforcement across the state participating in the 287(g). The program allows ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) to partner with state and local law enforcement agencies, who are empowered to dedicate their own resources to pursuing people living without legal immigration paperwork in the United States. 
“ICE recognizes the importance of its relationships with law enforcement partners to carry out its critical mission,” states a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) webpage. 
Agencies can participate in 287(g) under a few different models including a “jail enforcement” model that focuses on people without legal immigration status already in local jails on other criminal charges, a “task force” model that gives local law enforcement officers limited authority to enforce immigration law and a warrant service program which allows local law enforcement to serve administrative warrants to people without legal status within county jails.
The participants in 287(g) include the sheriff’s offices of Brown, Fond du Lac, Kewaunee, Manitowoc, Marquette, Outagamie, Sheboygan, Washington, Waukesha (which is listed twice on the DHS website’s “pending agencies” portion), Waupaca, Wood, and Winnebago counties. 










A growing number of Wisconsin sheriffs continue to opt into this program, actively contributing to the jail-to-deportation pipeline. 


– ACLU of Wisconsin


Six of those sheriffs (Kewaunee, Outagamie, Washington, Waupaca, Winnebago, and Wood counties) joined the program between from March to June of this year. The rest began participating in 287(g) in 2020, according to the ACLU report,
While some law enforcement agencies have joined the program, others have distanced themselves from immigration enforcement. The Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office does not participate in the 287(g) program, and both that office and the Dane County Sheriff limit or prohibit their participation in immigration activities. The Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) also has policies limiting its own involvement in immigration enforcement in the interest of preserving a trusting and cooperative relationship with the community, the policies state.
“The expansion of these agreements enables ICE to further embed its enforcement presence within local jurisdictions, often circumventing community-driven policies against immigration enforcement,” the report states. “These partnerships not only divert local resources from community safety initiatives but also significantly heighten the risk of racial profiling and erode trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities.”
The ACLU has also found that between 2021 and 2024, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC), along with 29 counties, received over $7 million in federal funds through the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). The ACLU states that the funds were “in exchange” for data sharing with ICE. Wisconsin Examiner reached out to DOC, the story will be updated with any reply from the the state agency regarding data sharing.

That data is just part of a growing immigration enforcement and detention network across the state. From Oct. 2021 to June 2025, according to the report, ICE sent over 3,300 immigration detainers to Wisconsin. These are situations in which ICE requests that a local jail hold individuals for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release, the ACLU report states. “Although these detainers are often not accompanied by a warrant signed by a neutral judicial official and lack authority under Wisconsin law,” it explains, “most sheriffs across the state continue to honor them.”
Although over 3,300 individuals have been held between Oct. 2021 and June 2025, the biggest jump in detainer requests occurred this year. Between Jan. 1 and June 10, there were 1,065 ICE detainers in Wisconsin. By comparison there were 942 ICE detainers during all of 2024, 853 detainers during a 12-month period between October 2022 and September 2023 and 474 in the 12 months before that. 
“These numbers demonstrate that even without a judge-signed warrant, ICE continues to issue these ‘requests,’ and a significant number of Wisconsin jails continue to comply,” the ACLU’s report states. “This practice is problematic as federal deportation proceedings are civil, not criminal, matters and Wisconsin law does not provide legal authority for law enforcement to act on civil immigration detainers.”
Some sheriff offices are even taking it a step further than 287(g) and SCAAP. New financial agreements have also been arranged with counties such as Brown, Sauk and Ozaukee. In Brown County, the sheriff maintains a $90,000 contract for detention and transportation services, carrying a $70.00 per detainee, per day reimbursement, and another $36.00 per hour, with mileage and funding, for transportation services. Sauk County receives a $106.00 per-diem rate for housing ICE detainees, and Ozaukee County gave ICE the ability to purchase cell space in its jail by building off an existing contract with the U.S. Marshall Service. The ACLU calls this a “concerning trend” of local sheriffs “not only passively complying with ICE requests” but also “actively entering into benefiting from direct financial arrangements to house and transport immigrants for ICE removal activities.”
The report also highlights recent legislation which would require more cooperation with ICE. Republican lawmakers have introduced bills that would compel sheriffs to work with ICE regardless of their own priorities, mandate citizenship investigations of jail detainees, mandate compliance with detainer requests, and other policies.
To counter these advancements, the ACLU is calling on community members to reach out to their local sheriffs and police chiefs to learn more about where they stand on ICE cooperation, push agencies to prioritize community trust over obedience, and engage with lawmakers on the proposed bills. 
“These cozy relationships between ICE and many sheriffs are disrupting our communities and funneling immigrant community members into the federal deportation machine,” said Muth.

Across Michigan, thousands of voters are getting new precincts — and in some cases new polling places — as officials redraw their maps to take advantage of a new state law that allows for more consolidation of precincts.
The new law, which increased the maximum size of a precinct from 2,999 to 4,999 voters, is a consequence of recent voter-approved initiatives to expand access to early and absentee voting, which Michiganders have embraced. The law went into effect early last year, and some communities put changes into effect before the 2024 general election. Others, including Livonia in Wayne County, will run their newly consolidated precincts for the first time next week during local primaries. The shift could eventually save communities a lot of money, experts say.
But realizing those savings will take some time, and voters could encounter challenges as they get reassigned to renumbered precincts, different precincts, or new polling places, especially if clerks don’t equip consolidated polling sites to handle a larger pool of voters.
Clerks aren’t required to consolidate precincts, but many have chosen to. Clinton Township in Macomb County, for instance, cut its number of precincts from 42 to 20, which will allow for an estimated 30% savings in wages. Livonia is down to 26 from 44, which it said would lead to a “smoother voting process on Election Day.” Communities from Algonac, in St. Clair County, to Walker, in Kent County, have also made cuts.
 Grand Rapids expects cost savings from fewer precincts

Grand Rapids, the state’s second largest city, is going from 74 precincts to 59. City Clerk Joel Hondorp said the new requirement makes sense in an era and in a city where most voters are casting ballots absentee or during early voting.
By 2027, Hondorp said, the city’s voting machines will be a decade old and due for replacement, at an estimated cost of $10,000 to $15,000 per precinct. With fewer precincts, he said, the city will “save money in the long run on maintenance, on equipment, on all the stuff that goes with it.”
But Grand Rapids is taking some time with the transition. Hondorp said he didn’t want to risk making any changes before the 2024 general election that could confuse voters.
Hondorp said that in addition to redrawing precinct lines in a diversifying city, his staff had to send new voter information cards to nearly every voter in the city that show their new precinct or precinct number. The office also had to notify people whose regular polling place changed.
 Effect of precinct consolidation on voter participation

Some people have warned, and still worry, that new precincts could disenfranchise some voters because their polling place might be farther away or otherwise less accessible.
Kelsey Purdue, a Grand Rapids city commissioner who represents the city’s 3rd Ward, was the lone vote against the consolidation of precincts. Purdue represents significant Black and Latino populations in the city, and she told the Michigan Public radio station before the commission’s vote that she was worried about voters losing access to nearby polling places. In an April Facebook post, she said that consolidation could be “a step backward for voting access and participation.”
But an analysis by Michigan Public found that for most voters, the distance to their polling places would stay about the same or perhaps get a little shorter. Votebeat’s own analysis confirmed that and did not find a strong correlation between the racial makeup of a precinct and the distance to its polling place under the approved reorganization.
Purdue did not respond to requests for comment from Votebeat.
John Willette is a Grand Rapids voter who wrote to several city officials citing concerns similar to Purdue’s. He told Votebeat that at a time when mistrust of elections runs high, he believed that the city was lax in communicating with voters about the consolidation, and the reasons behind it.
The city’s explanation that the consolidation was an expected consequence of voter-backed measures in 2018 and 2022 to allow no-excuse absentee voting and early in-person voting “felt dismissive” toward voters who may not draw the connection between today’s changes and things they voted for years ago.
 Risks of consolidating precincts and polling places

Precincts serve mainly as an administrative unit for election officials to group a set of voters based on where they live and assign them the correct ballots. How they are grouped may not mean much to the voters themselves, said Nate Persily, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied how new voting methods have shifted behavior.
The bigger concern is the movement of polling places, which can often house multiple precincts.
“When you move polling places, there are some people who will not vote,” Persily said. To avoid that, he said, election officials must be sensitive to the burdens that administrative changes put on voters.
That’s why Michigan’s law largely delegated the actual drawing of the new lines to clerks, who are “best suited to make informed decisions about consolidation and … would not make decisions leading to long lines or other obstacles to the voting process,” according to a bill analysis from the Senate Fiscal Agency in 2023.
When not done well, consolidation of precincts and polling places can lead to longer lines. Since the 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision that removed longstanding federal oversight of election rule changes in states that historically discriminated against minorities, Georgia voters have often faced long lines. A 2020 investigation by Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica found that polling places had been cut by roughly 10% since the decision, despite the state’s voter rolls growing by nearly two million people.
But Michigan cities aren’t facing that same level of growth — not even Grand Rapids, one of the state’s fastest-growing cities. And if larger precincts draw more voters, officials can mitigate waiting times by providing more places for people to check in, said Charles Stewart, director of MIT’s Election Lab.
Moving a polling place can lower a voter’s odds for casting a ballot, Stewart said, but research has not yet made clear whether absentee voting or other methods might help fill in that gap. He said it’s up to local clerks to examine voting patterns closely and make decisions about maps and resources that don’t create new barriers to voting in the name of cost savings.
“The danger, as I see it, is there may be places where the number of people voting early is relatively minor and clerks there will nonetheless take advantage of the law and close a few precincts,” Stewart said. “Then that polling place is not sufficient to handle the actual traffic on Election Day.”
In Grand Rapids, officials say they aren’t looking for cost savings upfront.
“Our staff spent a lot of time going through and coming up with the best recommendations that could affect the fewest number of voters,” Hondorp said. “Now we have that, and in future elections when we’re purchasing equipment or paying for preventative maintenance, we’re already ahead.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)New Jersey faces an existential threat in the form of climate change, state environmental officials warn, a threat that has them pushing new regulations that would force builders to take future sea-level rise into account.
But not Netflix.
The streaming giant won an enormous favor from Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration this month when a revised set of new and controversial flood rules included a Netflix exemption. The new rules will not apply to its new film studio in Monmouth County.
The studio, located on the old Fort Monmouth property, will span nearly 300 acres, include 12 soundstages, and cost $1 billion. Homeowners and businesses looking to build around Fort Monmouth and other flood-prone areas will have to protect against future sea-level rise by elevating four feet, but that apparently would be too darn difficult for Netflix.
The Netflix exemption is one of those rare times when New Jersey’s progressive activists and business leaders are on the same side, if for different reasons.
When the new flood rules were released, environmental groups criticized them for not going far enough, while businesses said they remain too stringent. Both groups, however, are ticked that Netflix gets to play by different rules.
Doug O’Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, told me the Murphy administration should not weaken flood rules even for a development considered one of its chief achievements.
“Netflix may be exempt in these coastal flooding rules, but they’re not going to be exempt from a storm surge. Climate science cares little about political science,” he said.
Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, has issued numerous statements opposing the new rules, called Protection Against Climate Threats Resilient Environments and Landscape Rule, or Pact Real for short.
The Netflix exemption, Cantor said, is evidence that the state should take Pact Real back to the drawing board. Cantor said the next governor (Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, leaves office in January) should be tasked with making New Jersey resilient — and affordable.
“To carve out something like Netflix, an economic development endeavor we support, or any business development or affordable housing project, highlights a larger problem with this proposal — that it was not thought out well and was not sufficiently stakeholdered before it was proposed,” he said.
The Murphy administration defends the move, saying the exemption is not just for Netflix but for other film production companies that have made a “long-term commitment” to build production studios here in the Garden State. A studio helmed by Lionsgate in Newark and another in Bayonne called 1888 Studios will also get to play by the old flood rules (in addition to winning unrelated tax breaks).
The argument is that the developers of those projects had to make plans for them based on the old rules, so is it fair to make them change their plans now?
To that I say: Yes, it sure is. Netflix just reported $3.1 billion in net income in its second quarter, and Lionsgate in May reported quarterly revenue of $1.2 billion. If everyday New Jerseyans with plans to build homes or improve their businesses must adjust them to suit the state’s climate resiliency plans, then surely monied Hollywood interests can as well.

(Photo by Lance West/Provided by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections)OKLAHOMA CITY — Eric Cotter has finally found something that gives him hope that there’s a place for him outside prison when he’s released after serving his two-decade prison sentence.
Incarcerated at the Clara Waters Community Corrections Center in Oklahoma, Cotter is one of the inmates participating in R.I.S.E Program Inc., a pioneering cosmetology and barbering project. It aims to set prison inmates up for success once they’re released, and, by extension, reduce the state’s recidivism rate.
“Every day I come here, this program gives hope,” Cotter said. “It lets me know that I don’t have to come back to prison, and I can do something different and be a part of society.”
Supporters say this program is a bright spot in a state that releases nearly 217,000 people a year from its prison and jails, but sees over 1 in 5 prison inmates re-offend within a few years and get sent back. 
Since launching in 2017, not a single one of the R.I.S.E program’s over 180 participants has returned to prison.
It’s that 0% recidivism rate that gives Cotter, who is serving prison time for kidnapping, an extra confidence boost that he’ll be set up for success when he’s released. Prison officials said that could happen in August 2026. He said the program has allowed him to dream of the day he’ll be trained as a color specialist and to develop a business plan to one day open his own salon. 
“(R.I.S.E) gives you something that you can do outside,” he said. “There’s a lot of programs in DOC where they don’t get you to the point of being licensed, but here you get to walk away with a cosmetology or barber license, but for me, I am going all the way to master instructor. It’s going to open so many doors for me.”

The mission of the program is simple: teach incarcerated men and women serving time in two state prisons — McLoud’s Mabel Bassett Correctional Center and Oklahoma City’s Clara Waters — cosmetology and barbering skills that will allow them to re-enter society with a useful skill set and achieve financial independence.
The program has seen so much success that a third location is set to open at the Jess Dunn Correction’s facility in Taft, which is just west of Muskogee. 
The faith-based program was founded by Christie Luther, who was also once incarcerated, and is funded by donations. 
Luther selects the inmates that participate after requiring them to complete an application process.
Recently, there were seven men and 20 women participating, and inmates are able to apply at any time during their sentence, said Stephanie Adams, administrator of programs at the Department of Corrections.
The program originally only served women because Luther knew of their situations from firsthand experience. But Adams said she suddenly received a call from Luther who felt compelled to open the opportunity to men at the Clara Waters in Oklahoma City.
The second location opened a few months ago. 
The Clara Waters facility houses inmates who are nearing release and is open to outside customers to get their hair or nails done.  The Mabel Bassett location, which is located inside Oklahoma’s largest women’s prison, is only for staff, inmates, or volunteers who have signed up.
Adams said she believes the selective application process is one of the reasons the program’s recidivism rate is at zero along with the fact that inmates have a guaranteed career and housing upon release.
“One of the biggest successes that you can have is the ability to make a living for yourself and that really reduces recidivism rates,” Adams said.
She said participants can also earn “achievement credits,” which can knock time off their sentences. There is also mental health support within the program using faith and prayer, and participants are encouraged to treat each other like family. That can help improve the mental health of an incarcerated individual and get them the motivation they need, Adams said.
Participants provide services on Mondays through Fridays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the weekends. The State Board of Cosmetology and Barbering requires at least 18 hours a week of practice.

Great Clips partners with the program and guarantees participants immediate job placement once they have graduated and obtained their license. 
Adams said R.I.S.E is the only program that she knows of that has a partnership with a company that can give job opportunities.
AJ Watkins, the program’s educational coordinator and teacher at R.I.S.E, received her education in cosmetology through the program while incarcerated. She later pursued an instructor’s license so she could begin teaching others in prison.
Watkins said the program is free, and Luther provides any resources needed such as  “industry tools, clothing, housing.”
She said programs like R.I.S.E should be available in every prison because it is important to educate and prepare inmates for the outside world. 
“There’s just everything that you need to get off your feet when you come out and be able to be a stand alone, productive citizen,” Adams said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Backers of legislation that would block drivers from app-based rideshare and delivery businesses from being declared employees are making a full-court press to persuade Gov. Tony Evers to sign the measure into law.
If enacted, AB 269 would automatically classify drivers for Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and similar businesses as independent contractors — bypassing current Wisconsin laws that differentiate independent contractors from direct employees. It would exclude those drivers from Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance, workers compensation and minimum wage laws.
The bill would also allow those businesses to set up payroll plans to fund benefit programs for drivers, but it would not require them to do so.
Along with other bills that passed both houses after May 8, the Legislature’s calendar requires the independent contractor measure to go to Evers on Thursday, Aug. 7. Evers hasn’t spoken publicly about the bill, but opponents contend it deprives drivers of worker protections in return for meager benefits.
“It just seems to be a PR move to entrench drivers’ status as independent contractors,” said state Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), who drives for Lyft and who voted against the bill in the Assembly. 
A heavy lobbying campaign for which DoorDash has been the most visible sponsor has put all the attention on the benefits provision. On Tuesday, Chamber for Progress, a tech business lobbying group, organized a press conference in the state Capitol to urge Evers to sign the bill.
State Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin), the bill’s Senate author, said it would allow the driving-app companies “to voluntarily contribute to portable benefit accounts that travel with the worker and allow them to use the funds for health care, sick time or retirement without stripping workers of their independence.”
Gig workers “want to be independent,” said Ruth Whittaker, of Chamber for Progress. “We should protect their independence and the flexibility of gig work, and we should also give them access to benefits.”
Joe DeRose, a retired state employee, said his work driving for DoorDash provided “flexible income to help with rising costs” without tying him to a fixed schedule.
“I strongly support portable benefits,” DeRose said. “These accounts would let app-based workers save for unforeseen events or retirement without giving up the flexibility that makes this work so appealing.”
Rachel Smith of New Berlin said she delivers for DoorDash while building an online wellness business.
“The reality is, like many entrepreneurs and independent workers, I don’t have access to traditional benefits, so this portable benefits legislation would change that,” Smith said. “Portable benefits would let me plan for my future without giving up the freedom that makes this work possible in the first place.”
“Without this offer, there are no portable benefits,” said state Rep. Sylvia Velez-Ortiz (D-Milwaukee), who cast the only Democratic vote for the bill in the Assembly. “This is something that the platforms are wanting to do on their own, and government should not stand in their way of doing what they know is right.”
While Evers hasn’t said whether he’ll sign or veto the bill, its passage with only Republican votes — besides that of Ortiz-Velez — has almost always been a precursor to a veto.
Wisconsin labor laws include a series of tests to determine if a worker is an independent contractor or an employee.
An employee is covered by unemployment insurance, workers compensation insurance and state labor standards that include minimum wage, work hours and overtime regulations. An independent contractor is not.
The worker-business relationship must meet each one of nine qualifications to be exempt from workers comp law. It must meet 6 out of 9 qualifications to be exempt from unemployment insurance. And it must meet all six qualifications to be exempt from the state’s wage and hour laws.
The bill would make the app-based rideshare and delivery companies automatically exempt from all three areas of employment law. 
They could lose the exemption only if they flunked all four parts of a new four-part test — by prescribing when drivers must be logged in; terminating a driver for turning down an assignment; restricting drivers from working for other app-based companies; and restricting drivers from any other lawful job or business.
“This is a dangerous bill for working people,” Stephanie Bloomingdale, president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO, said Tuesday.
“It is a bill that will carve out our existing tests to determine unemployment, workers’ comp, wage and hour [standards] with a very simplistic four-part test that would forever remove drivers’ ability to access those kind of benefits that we fought for for decades,” Bloomingdale said in an interview.
“They could offer benefits without taking away these tests,” she added. “And what they’re really after is taking away these tests.
Although Bradley described the bill as giving Wisconsin gig drivers “access to benefits like health care, dental and retirement savings,” critics say that those kinds of benefits are unlikely to accrue under the system the law describes. 
In Pennsylvania, DoorDash has established a trial benefits program without a law in place there. A report commissioned for the program found that participants on average were able to save about $400 over the course of a year.
“It’s just a savings account with a very meager contribution from the companies,” said Laura Padin, director of Work Structures at the National Employment Law Project (NELP). “Real employment-based benefits are worth so much more than that.”

Idaho Falls Power officials say they are on track to receive a shipment of electric vehicle charging equipment as soon as this week and plan to open the first of four EV charging stations this fall. 
The majority of the funding for the $3.75 million project comes from a federal U.S. Department of Transportation Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program corridor grant that Idaho Falls Power applied for in 2023. 
Idaho Falls Power officials received word they were selected for the grant in early 2024 and immediately began working to get the grant agreement signed, get the project under contract and begin designing the charging sites. 
“We were working as fast as we could to get through this because we knew there could be a new (presidential) administration coming up at the end of year, so we wanted to get the agreement signed as quickly as possible,” Idaho Falls Power Chief Financial Officer Josh Roos said in a phone interview Tuesday.
 Idaho Falls Power worked hard to get electric vehicle stations agreement signed 

Being able to develop the sites on city-owned land saved time and avoided additional expenses for land acquisition. 
State of Idaho has paused all work on federal program developing sites for EV charging stations

“Once we had it signed, the new administration put a pause on everything and we were afraid we would not get it,” Roos said. “But in working with the Federal Highway Administration, since we were able to get an agreement signed beforehand and all ready to go, we were still good to move forward. A majority of people who received grant funding didn’t get it signed in time. So we feel pretty lucky to be one of few to be able to move forward with a project.” 
That means Idaho Falls Power is able to move forward with its project at time when the state of Idaho has paused all work on a related, but separate program – the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI program – that had been seeking to develop a connected network of electric vehicle charging stations situated every 50 miles of interstate highway. State officials paused work on the NEVI program in February after Federal Highway Administration officials rescinded all previous guidance for the NEVI program and suspended approving state plans.
Funding for both the NEVI and Charging and Fuel Infrastructure Grant Program grants was provided by the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act signed into law by former President Joe Biden.

The grant provides just over $3 million for the charging stations, while Idaho Falls Power is responsible for a cost share of $750,714, Roos said. 
The first charging site will be located on Memorial Drive in Idaho Falls, near downtown and the Idaho Falls River Walk along the Snake River. Idaho Falls Power also plans to open three additional electric vehicle charging sites on city-owned property during next spring or summer. Idaho Falls Power External Affairs Manager Sarah Wheeler said.
Each of the four sites will feature four fast-charging stalls and be located within one mile of a major highway off-ramp, said Reese Lawley, a U.S. Department of Energy research fellow who helped with the Idaho Falls Power grant.
Wheeler and Roos said eastern Idaho doesn’t have as high of a rate of EV drivers as other areas and states like California, Oregon or Washington. But the Idaho Falls Power officials said they are seeing more EV and plug-in hybrid drivers and have seen an increase in public interest after Idaho Falls Power installed charging stations at its office and outside of Idaho Falls City Hall. 
There is also an economic development piece to the EV charging program. Wheeler and Roos know the Interstate 15 and U.S. Highway 20 corridors are busy with summer tourists heading to Yellowstone National Park and winter tourists flocking to nearby ski resorts.
By building out electric vehicle charging stations and locating them near Idaho Falls downtown district and River Walk, officials hope more tourists driving EVs and plug-in hybrids will stop to charge up in Idaho Falls and will support local businesses or enjoy a scenic stroll along the Snake River while they wait.
“It’s really impressive to watch how they looked at grant opportunities and where growth is happening and where new resources need to be put and capitalized on that,” Wheeler said. “Not everyone drives electric vehicles, but we are still a transportation corridor where we want to provide services to not only residents, but people visiting our city as well.”

Federal agents arrested at least 9 people in a recent Equality State operation, spurring fear and uncertainty.
The post Detaining Jackson Hole immigrants, ICE agents target western Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Immigration agents stopped Juan Barranco Castro on Wednesday morning in the parking lot of Jackson’s Community Bible Church as he drove to work. 
People who know the 56-year-old say Barranco Castro wasn’t the agents’ intended target. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — better known as ICE — was seeking someone else who drove a similar-looking vehicle.
“He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,” a friend said. “It happened by accident.”
Staging in Pinedale, ICE detained at least nine people, including Barranco Castro, as agents fanned out across Teton County and western Wyoming last week in a multi-day operation to arrest and transport people — first to the Sweetwater County Detention Center in Rock Springs and then into federal detention facilities, including those in Denver and El Paso, Texas. 
ICE did not respond to questions about Barranco Castro’s arrest and the overall number of arrests from last week’s operation was unconfirmed as of press deadline Tuesday. Steve Kotecki, public affairs officer for ICE in Denver, was unavailable for comment, and emails to a general ICE information line went unanswered. 
Barranco Castro has lived in Jackson for 26 years, according to three friends who spoke anonymously for fear of ICE retribution. 
Those friends said Barranco Castro regularly sends money home to his wife in Tlaxcala, Mexico, where she is reportedly ill and relies on his financial support. Available court documents did not indicate whether Barranco Castro was undocumented, held a valid work visa or had applied for asylum. He is not charged with any crimes in state or federal court records.
Tlaxcala — where Barranco Castro is originally from — became a sister city to the town of Jackson in 2024. Jackson officials formally recognized the link between the two cities to honor what they see as the significant contribution migrants from Tlaxcala have brought to Jackson. 
According to those close to him, Barranco Castro was allowed one phone call during the arrest, which he used to ask a friend to retrieve his car before he was transported to the Sweetwater County Detention Center.
Friends also expressed concern that he may have been taken without his diabetes medication.
“I am so worried about him,” a friend said.
In a video widely shared online, Barranco Castro is seen in the church parking lot as two ICE agents handcuff him and place him in leg irons and belly chains.

In a different video posted Saturday by the statewide news outlet Cowboy State Daily, ICE agents defend the use of such restraints by citing “an 800% increase in assaults against ICE officers.” Some police agency policies, however, limit use of leg irons and belly chains to instances when a suspect is behaving or expected to behave violently.
The percentage increase captures a jump from 10 reported assaults on ICE during a six-month period in 2024 to 79 assaults over the same period this year. The increase in reported assaults on ICE officers comes during a significant increase in the agency’s field activity, including controversial raids in left-leaning cities where ICE is unpopular. 
Since the late 1960s, immigrants from Mexico have been coming to the Tetons, drawn to the rugged, rural landscape that mirrors native homelands. These Teton immigrants found work, built homes and families, and helped shape Jackson into the community it is today.
Through the decades, however, they have weathered political headwinds — most recently from U.S. House Republican Rep. Harriet Hageman, who suggested in November that Teton County law enforcement was working against ICE’s efforts. The Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which controls the House of Representatives, made similar accusations.
“Now — and historically — ICE has targeted Jackson for enforcement,” Wyoming Immigrant Advocacy Project founder and immigration attorney Rosie Read said Monday. Jackson is “known to have a substantial immigration population, and we are sitting ducks. 
“We are supportive of our immigrant community and ICE is looking to send a message and rattle the cage,” Read added. 
High crimes or misdemeanors? 
During last week’s Jackson operation, ICE agents arrested some individuals with misdemeanor DUIs, but not other criminal charges, according to court records.
That crime falls below Homeland Security and Trump’s stated enforcement priorities of removing the “worst of the worst” — people with criminal histories that include aggravated assault, domestic violence, gang-related crime or sex assault. ICE officials have also said they’ll detain undocumented immigrants with lesser criminal histories if they’re encountered during their enforcement activities.

During last week’s operation, an ICE agent said they were looking for people with “serious criminal convictions,” according to the YouTube video documenting part of the operation posted last week by Cowboy State Daily. 
But, reporters for the Jackson Hole News&Guide and WyoFile found that ICE detained three people who had only traffic citations in Wyoming court records. 
Court documents, including a search in Jackson’s municipal court that handles speeding and parking tickets, show that Barranco Castro has no criminal history in the state of Wyoming. 
Reporters were also unable to find any record of past convictions or pending charges for another detainee, Alpine resident Janeth Jazmin Jaldin Loza, who agents arrested July 23. 
In that sense, the operation was in line with the broader themes of ICE’s operations in Wyoming, six months into President Donald Trump’s second administration. 

Since Trump returned to the White House on Jan. 20, the majority of people ICE has arrested in Wyoming have not had criminal convictions, a review of five months of the agency’s arrest data by WyoFile and The Colorado Sun found. 
That’s a shift from the same four months in 2024, when the majority of people ICE arrested in Wyoming did carry criminal convictions. In both years, DUIs were the most common convictions on ICE detainees’ records.
Agents operate on assumptions
In a briefing included in Cowboy State Daily’s video, ICE agents acknowledged that they were working off incomplete information.
The team was heard in the video preparing to approach a residence near Alpine when one agent said aloud: “Potentially, this may not be the right address.” Another added: “We may have a different address for our target. We’re going to do a ‘knock and talk’ to determine if our target lives here.”

Referring to a Romanian national, one ICE agent stated, “international travel from the U.S. to Romania, 2018, travel between Mexico City and Romania … I would assume he came here illegally.”
That man was 27-year-old Alberto Banicescu. He was taken into custody July 21 outside his Jackson apartment.
In the Cowboy State Daily video, ICE Field Office Director Robert Guadian is seen asking agents what Banicescu was doing in Jackson. 
“Drinking in Jackson and having a good time?” one agent replied.
Banicescu had a misdemeanor DUI citation from January and was on probation, according to Jackson Municipal Court records. In the video, he is seen being placed in belly chains and leg irons before transport to the Sweetwater County Detention Center.
ICE ops fuel fear
ICE does not maintain a permanent presence in Jackson and operations like last week’s take place with little or no public notice. “We come out to Jackson pretty [regularly] — a couple times a year,” Guadian said in the video.
The News&Guide has reported on ICE activity in the community, and multiple Jackson Hole residents have been placed on ICE holds at the Teton County Jail after being detained for other reasons, including traffic violations.
Residents often don’t know who is being targeted or why. A video sent to the News&Guide shows people from one worksite fleeing into nearby forests after they heard ICE was in the area. 
Still others avoided community events altogether, such as the Teton County Fair. An evening event last week that caters to Jackson Hole’s Hispanic community experienced sharply decreased attendance as word of ICE’s operation spread and people stayed home out of fear. 
“I think it was an event that we were all looking forward to in the community,” Rubi Castro, who attended the concert, told a News&Guide reporter in Spanish. “And the truth is that it’s very sad to see that people didn’t attend, because we’re all afraid.”
Access granted, denied
In May, hoping to better understand the situation, the News&Guide asked to follow along with ICE while its agents operated in Teton County. The agency did not grant the paper access.
A writer from the Cowboy State Daily has, however, participated in at least two ride-alongs with ICE in the last few months, including last week’s operation. Cowboy State Daily agreed to keep agents involved with the operation anonymous as a condition for documenting the operations, according to its story. The outlet blurred out ICE agents in the video. 
ICE has increasingly moved to make its officials anonymous – agents often wear masks or decline to identify themselves during street operations, and spokespeople in the Denver office have sought anonymity for making statements to media outlets. 
Comments made by ICE agents in the video indicate Cowboy State Daily had knowledge of the Jackson operation prior to that of Teton County Sheriff Matt Carr. 
Carr declined to comment for this story. 
ICE’s western Wyoming operation took place as the agency appears to be accelerating its presence in the Equality State. In recent weeks, ICE has increased its use of county jails to hold immigration detainees, shipping more than 40 people from a detention center in Aurora, Colorado, run by a for-profit prison company, to the Natrona County Detention Center. 
Those inmates remained in the jail 10 days later, according to the county’s inmate roster. The Natrona County Sheriff’s Office signed an agreement with ICE to hold people in its detention center as long as space is available, and there is no indication how long the current group might be held there, an agency spokesperson told a WyoFile reporter. 

On Monday, Gov. Mark Gordon, who has previously expressed a reluctance to engage local law enforcement officers in federal immigration enforcement, announced a new agreement between ICE and the Wyoming Highway Patrol. The agreement allows state troopers to receive training in investigating people’s lawful presence in the country, and use that training while patrolling Wyoming highways. 
Gordon, for now, is not concerned about increasing immigration enforcement affecting economic drivers like Wyoming’s tourism industry, or the fabric of its small communities, a spokesperson for the governor said. 
“Wyoming’s economy and our communities are always at the forefront of the governor’s mind,” spokesperson Michael Pearlman said. “But that also includes things like public safety and ensuring our business community is complying with immigration laws.”
A base in Pinedale
ICE agents who detained people in Teton and Lincoln counties last week based their operations out of a Hampton Inn in Pinedale. Fourteen agents were spotted by other hotel guests on July 20, six witnesses told The Pinedale Roundup. They requested anonymity to describe the federal agents’ activities because they did not want to draw ICE’s attention or jeopardize their own stays at the hotel.
That night, a Sunday, the agents gathered together outside the hotel, handing documents around and discussing the week’s plans, the other guests said. “They had a box,” one guest told the Roundup. “They took out paperwork and handed it out to every single one of them. It looked like they were looking for certain immigrants. They had flyers with people’s faces on them.”

Two ICE agents, approached by The Pinedale Roundup, declined to share their names when approached because they were worried about their safety and that of their families.
One agent said he was a Campbell County resident, and the other said he had traveled from Colorado to western Wyoming.
“People don’t like us,” said the agent. “We are trying to do the right thing, and some people don’t like that.”
When asked about the families separated from loved ones they detain for deportation, the agent said, “sometimes families get caught in the crosshairs.” 
Though the agents stayed in Pinedale, it’s unclear whether they arrested anyone in Sublette County. On July 22, Sublette County Sheriff’s Deputy Lt. Travis Bingham told the Roundup he wasn’t aware of ICE operations in the county. He said the federal agents usually inform his department when they’re working in the area. 
Meanwhile, ICE agents spent the week embedded in the town during their off time, where Roundup reporters observed them eating in local restaurants on different nights throughout the week. On Saturday, the day the agents appeared to have left town, a group of around 20 residents gathered on Pine Street to protest the Trump administration with signs that included the message “STOP KIDNAPPING OUR NEIGHBORS.” The protest group has gathered regularly near the county courthouse since Trump’s inauguration, in varying sizes.
But like the majority of Wyoming, Sublette County leans conservative, and many residents likely welcomed ICE’s stop in the town. 
“The media — not only locally but on the national level — wants to portray [immigrants] as victims,” Big Piney resident Gary Garlick told a Roundup reporter. “We elected Donald Trump for security. I happen to be one of those people who really supports the administration and what they’re doing.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Imagine this: a TV drama where a patient is being pushed through an emergency room by people in scrubs. Lights are blinking, alarms are sounding. Rounding the corner, the camera zooms in on an operating theatre ready to receive its patient. Except, the person waiting to spring into action isn’t a trained physician; it’s a politician in a suit with an unqualified idea to make the patient healthier.
If this seems inconceivable, consider the events of June 26.
Gov. Kevin Stitt welcomed U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to the Oklahoma Capitol for the “Make Oklahoma Healthy Again” rally. It served as a dramatic photo op, but behind the cameras, the policies promoted were anything but healthy.
As one of the unhealthiest states in the nation, Oklahoma cannot afford anti-science distractions that move us further from real solutions.
As a physician who dedicated her career to practicing evidence-based medicine and advocating for patients, I wanted to see the assembly in person. I was not alone, joined by dozens of my colleagues, many of whom canceled vital appointments so they could be on hand to advocate for the medical perspective that seemed to be ignored.
While Stitt and RFK Jr. rallied against fluoride in drinking water — a safe, proven public health measure — our coalition came prepared with something of value: a list of practical, data-backed solutions capable of improving the health of Oklahomans. Unlike politicians, our coalition is not interested in political gains; we’re focused on actionable solutions and real results designed to strengthen the health care system.
Our list includes prioritizing investments in health care infrastructure and education by properly funding hospitals in both rural and urban parts of the state, increasing educational opportunities for doctors and dentists, and growing incentives for them to practice in underserved communities. You simply can’t make a state healthier by undercutting its essential health care workforce, facilities and resources.
Evidence-based preventive health care is also critical. Routine wellness visits, dental cleanings, immunizations, and continued fluoridation of public water are some of the most cost-effective, scientifically-proven tools for improving health and reducing healthcare costs.
We’re concerned that recent DOGE-OK cuts have taken funding out of Oklahoma’s hands and sent it elsewhere, weakening our resources to care for our own citizens. DOGE-OK slashed $15 million in “wasteful” immunization funding while we battle new cases of measles and tuberculosis coupled with the lowest immunization rates in years. We support putting Oklahoma tax dollars back in Oklahoma by restoring the funding cuts to health care.
Our current health care process is burdened by a cumbersome insurance review process which leads to delays and denial of care recommended by a doctor or dentist. These practices are designed to save corporations money, but patients pay the price with their wallets, health, and in some instances, their lives. Legislation that promotes prior authorization reform and provides legal protection for those negatively affected by claims delayed or denied in bad faith would help.
Medicaid is critical to Oklahoma’s health care system, serving as the foundation of care for more than 900,000 Oklahomans, including low-income veterans, pregnant women, children and people with disabilities. Cuts to Medicaid aren’t the answer and will simply shift the burden elsewhere, putting further strains on hospitals, physicians and taxpayers.
The problems we face, such as declining immunization rates and high occurrences of preventable diseases, will not be fixed by scapegoating fluoride. This is simply a distraction from the actual work that needs to be done. While we can find common ground on issues like promoting exercise and proper nutrition, we must make these things affordable and accessible to everyone by investing in public health and food programs, rather than cutting those essential lifelines.
Oklahoma doesn’t need slogans borrowed from Washington. We need policies rooted in science, not conspiracy. If we’re serious about making Oklahomans healthy, we have to stop performing for the cameras and start listening to the experts.

Rep. Christopher Knapp says the mandate is too costly for ratepayers and it hasn't resulted in a coal plant retrofit.
The post Wyoming’s carbon capture mandate withstands legislative repeal effort appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—An effort to repeal Wyoming’s controversial coal carbon capture mandate failed Tuesday on a vote divided between the Senate and House members of the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee.
Seven of eight representatives in attendance voted in favor of the committee sponsoring the “Low carbon energy standards-repeal,” draft bill, while only one of five senators — Rock Springs Republican Sen. Stacy Jones — voted for the measure. The division suggests a rift between the powerful Freedom Caucus in the House and their Senate counterparts over the value of cutting carbon dioxide emissions from coal while tapping Wyoming ratepayers to cover the cost.
The Freedom Caucus took to social media shortly after the vote, noting that the panel voted to continue the state’s carbon capture mandate on coal on the same day that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would rescind its 2009 “endangerment finding” in an effort to roll back emission regulations on coal.
“Trump’s EPA is repealing woke carbon capture mandates on our coal producers,” the Freedom Caucus posted on Facebook. “As this announcement was made, liberal Wyoming republicans voted to keep state-level mandates in place, killing a bill to repeal them.”

Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp brought the legislation to the committee after a similar measure he sponsored earlier this year failed.
“I’m going to bring it, probably, as a personal bill again in the session,” Knapp told WyoFile. “It may not pass, but we won’t give up, because we’re exposing the [ratepayers] to increasing costs that maybe we never needed.”
So far, Rocky Mountain Power — the largest utility operating in Wyoming — has tapped its Wyoming electric customers for about $3.9 million to conduct technical and economic feasibility analysis to comply with the state’s mandate, according to a Wyoming Public Service Commission report. Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power has tapped its Wyoming customers for about $883,000.
After several years of analysis, both utilities say they still don’t have a commercially viable path to retrofit any of their Wyoming coal-burning power units with carbon capture technology.
Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power’s parent company, Black Hills Energy, said the most viable technology it found would come with a price tag of about $500 million — a huge expense to pass on to its approximately 45,000 customers in the Cheyenne area. Plus, the retrofit — at the Wygen II power plant outside Gillette — would knock down the coal plant’s electric generation capacity by more than 30%, forcing the company to replace about 30 megawatts of lost power.

“It just wasn’t economically feasible to bolt on a carbon capture unit to the Wygen II power plant,” Black Hills Energy Governmental Affairs Manager David Bush told the committee.
Rocky Mountain Power officials noted that they have reduced the carbon capture surcharge for their Wyoming customers because the utility found a partner to cover part of the cost of the mandated research and analysis effort. But so far, it still hasn’t found an affordable carbon capture technology for its aging coal units in the state.
“We believe there is some value in completing the work that we’ve begun,” Rocky Mountain Power Vice President of Government Affairs Thom Carter testified. “There’s some value in finding out, as the Public Service Commission discussed, if this technology is viable because of the whipsaw [in federal coal emission policies] that we are experiencing.”
How we got here
Lawmakers, with enthusiastic support from Gov. Mark Gordon, passed House Bill 200, “Reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standards,” in 2020. Also known as “Low-Carbon Energy Standards,” the mandate requires regulated electric utilities to evaluate the economic and technical viability of retrofitting their coal-burning power plants in the state with carbon capture.
The goal at the time, according to Gordon and other proponents, was to prove that American utilities that burn Wyoming coal could lower their carbon dioxide emissions to comply with federal and state standards rather than retire the units. Even with President Donald Trump rolling back federal regulations on coal emissions, many utilities that buy Wyoming coal still must contend with state-level emissions standards, Gordon’s policy director, Randall Luthi, told committee members. Eleven of the 24 states where Wyoming coal is shipped have renewable portfolio standards that add pressure on utilities to retire coal-burning power plants, he noted.
“If those states are concerned about their CO2 footprint, Wyoming can help with that solution,” Luthi said, “if we get the technology and the cost of that technology to come down.”
But lawmakers have come under increasing pressure in recent years to stem double-digit cost increases that have hit most electric ratepayers in the state. Adding a surcharge on top of those rising rates, Knapp said, for a technology that might still be years from commercial viability, doesn’t make sense.
“Why are we continuing to charge the end user for something that probably will not pan out?” he said.

Time to take off the tinfoil Stetson and dust off the BS detector, columnist Rod Miller urges.
The post Conspiracy theories 101 appeared first on WyoFile .","Hulk Hogan died mere hours after Ozzy Osborne’s demise, and conspiracy theorists are having a field day. 4Chan is all a-twitter about the CIA taking them out because they knew too much about the Epstein files. 8Chan is chock full of deepfake memes of Hulk and Ozzie on the grassy knoll with JFK Jr. and J.

Opinion

Conspiracy theories are metastasizing through our body politic here in our latter days. They seem to be poised to supplant baseball as our national pastime. And that’s totally understandable. Subscribing to a conspiracy theory requires far less intellectual rigor than understanding the elegance of the game of baseball. Case in point is the theory that the designated hitter rule is a commie conspiracy against American League pitchers.
Conspiracy theories are the junk drawer of the intellect, the demolition derby in the life of the mind. They attract folks who, in high school, sat in the back of history class and ate crayons.
It’s easy to see the allure of conspiracy theories. When presented with a set of facts that don’t immediately align with a set of preconceptions, a lazy mind will grasp at anything that ties things together with a neat little bow. Instead of applying logic and reason, the conspiracy theorist will blame the conundrum on the evil machinations of deep-state puppet masters from Area 51.
And, voila, the Gordian knot is neatly tied!
Historically, when trying to explain the unexplainable, humans have resorted to science or religion. For instance, we have always wondered what happens to us when we die. Religion taught us to believe that our afterlife would be spent in either Heaven or Hell. This used to be an article of faith.
Reliance on conspiracy theories has turned millennia of religious belief on its head. Now, through conspiracy theories spread through social media, we are told that there is no Heaven or Hell, there is only Washington D.C. When you think about it logically, it requires a greater leap of faith to accept a conspiracy theory as gospel than it does to believe in the mystery of an afterlife.
If science and religion are intellectual and spiritual disciplines meant to make sense of a confusing world for all of us, conspiracy theories are the calculus of booger-eaters, seductively appealing to the least common denominator among the tribe.
Conspiracy theories are the modern-day QAnon Ghost Dance, meant to banish trouble from our midst and bring back the buffalo.
Politicians who have learned to be adroit in their manipulation of conspiracy theories to inflame the masses are existential threats to our civic order. We should know better. When a politician tells us to switch off our bullshit detectors, put on our tinfoil Stetsons and believe their fantasies, red flags are popping up all over the place and we should pay attention.
For my money, the ills of modern American society arose because we citizens didn’t think things all the way through, and instead we took attractive intellectual shortcuts. We got lazy.
Demagogues saw our laziness and took advantage of it with conspiracy theories. They placed bright, shiny objects along the trail to distract us from our true mission as citizens. Pizzagate. Stolen elections. The moon landing was faked. January 6 was a peaceful demonstration. Elvis lives and is in charge of the Illuminati. And the list goes on.
We have stopped contemplating the world around us by employing our God-given rationality, and instead, we stare at the sky, wondering if “chemtrails” are giving us COVID and cancer. We embrace clues revealed in the chicken entrails of goofball conspiracy theories.
I think our job now is to regain the use of our noggins and to recognize conspiracy theories as having zero value beyond the comedic. If we have allowed our minds to atrophy to the point that conspiracy theories make sense, we can also reinvigorate our gray matter to call out bullshit when we see it.
But we’ll have to get up from the couch, switch off the idiot box and start thinking for ourselves again. We’ll have to overcome our comfortable mental inertia and start working out in the real world once more. Powerful demagogues will fight us every step of the way. Their very existence depends on our intellectual complacency.
It’s hard work, thinking for yourself, but nobody can do it for you.

(Courtesy of Gary Stone)LINCOLN — Nebraska and Iowa tied for the states with the largest losses of Gross Domestic Product in the first quarter of 2025, of 6.1%, according to a report from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Most remaining states also saw their GDP’s shrink, though by smaller amounts, while a handful saw modest increases. GDP represents the total market value of goods and services produced during a specific time period.
The analysis compared Nebraska’s GDP to what it was one year ago. The report revealed that declines in agriculture played the biggest role in Nebraska and Iowa’s rates.
This is a rare economic output decrease for the U.S. as a whole — the first decrease during the first quarter since 2022, according to Stateline reporter Tim Henderson.
However, Nebraska State Budget Administrator Neil Sullivan said the drop is not as severe as it might appear. He said the percentage is based on projections from the last quarter of 2024. He offered competing numbers claiming Nebraska’s actual GDP difference quarter-over-quarter was down about 1.5%.
John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, said he believes the country is facing the worst farming financial crisis since the 1980s. He helps run a crisis hotline for farmers, and said he’s fielded high-stress calls from people struggling financially.
“There’s desperation in their voices,” Hansen said. “They’re up against the wall.”
Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies this year. Row-crop farmers took a hit, and that accounts for much of Nebraska’s agricultural output, including wheat, corn and soybeans.
Sullivan said prices for these products are the lowest in a decade. But on the flip side, he said the market is also stable, making it safer for farmers to produce. This is primarily because of protections added to the federal budget reconciliation bill, he said.
Ernie Goss, a regional economist and professor at Creighton University, said prices for these top Nebraska products have gone down, while prices of farming resources like fertilizer have not. This has ripple effects, namely that farmers are pushed to cut costs and aren’t spending as much on ag equipment, he said.
On the bright side, livestock prices have remained good, Goss said, which is a relief to Nebraska’s ranchers. He said many of these factors are impacting farmers across the U.S. — it’s just felt deeper in Nebraska because the state is a top ag producer.
“It’s like Michigan having a downturn in the automobile industry,” Goss said.

It’s not just agriculture contributing to Nebraska’s lower GDP, Goss noted. The state’s manufacturing industry has also taken a hit, primarily due to job losses that have been prevalent across the country over the last year.
Brad Lubben, associate professor of agricultural economics at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said he expected record farm income in Nebraska for 2025, largely because of emergency government assistance that rolled out at the start of the year. However, he noted that uncertainty with federal policies on farming, taxes and trade can detract from production.
“Farm programs and tax policy have since been largely resolved with the recent reconciliation bill, although the impacts start to accrue in 2026,” Lubben said in an email. “The trade outlook however remains quite uncertain and volatile, hurting prospects or at least sentiment looking forward.”
Goss agreed that global trade has slowed. China, a top pork buyer, has slowed its trade with the U.S. due to tariffs, he said as an example. Goss said President Donald Trump seems to think of trade as “a zero sum game,” though in reality he argued that both parties can benefit when it’s done well.
Gov. Jim Pillen sang a different tune in a social media post on Monday, praising Trump for his recent trade deal with the European Union. Among other things, the deal imposes a 15% tariff on European goods in exchange for EU companies buying $750 billion in American energy products over three years.
“POTUS makes trade a priority — and agriculture keeps winning,” Pillen wrote in the post on X.
A 6.1% GDP drop is cause for concern, Goss said. In a good year, he said Nebraska sees GDP growth of between 6-7%, adjusted for inflation. This level of decline could result in additional job losses and cuts to government services, he said.
Sullivan said he does not foresee the need for cuts in Nebraska’s budget due to the GDP drop.
However, Lubben noted that with the state being a top ag producer and the continued strength in the cattle market, he still expects Nebraska to outperform the U.S. ag sector as a whole.
Kenny Zoeller, director of policy research for Pillen’s office, said Nebraska is in a strong fiscal position. Though he acknowledged Trump’s tariffs contributed to the state’s GDP drop, he said he expects that to improve over time.
Hansen said it’s too early to say what the impacts of Trump’s tariffs will be. He was more confident in saying Nebraska consumers will pay higher prices because of them.
Zoeller said Nebraska is in a similar position to 2017, when the state faced a more than $1 billion budget deficit and uncertainty in global trade. He argued that Nebraska has solid financial flexibility and decent reserves that should carry the state through safely.

Motorists will face higher fines for driving below the speed limit in the left lane of a Louisiana highway starting Friday. 
A new state law, Act 24 from this year’s legislative session, will require a person driving less than the speed limit to stay in the furthest right lane of a multilane highway. People driving in the left lane must be either passing another vehicle or turning left off the road. 
Current law only requires drivers to stay in the righthand lane if they are driving at least 10 mph below the speed limit. Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, sponsored the new statute and said the current restriction has been difficult to enforce and is rarely used. 
He hopes the new requirements will garner more compliance. 
His new law will also increase traffic fines for people driving too slowly in the left lane. The penalty is going from $100 or up to 30 days in jail to $150 for a first offense, $250 for a second offense within a year of the original offense and $350 or up to 30 days in jail for a third offense within a year of the original offense.

Luneau said he brought the bill because he was stuck behind slow drivers during his two-hour commute between the Capitol in Baton Rouge and his home in Alexandria. 
“I think this is something that we all encounter on a weekly basis,” Luneau told lawmakers during a hearing earlier this year. 
Slow highway driving is also a safety hazard that causes incidents of road rage, he said. 
A handful of lawmakers opposed the proposal. 
“I don’t think we need a new reason to pull people over and give them traffic tickets,” Rep. Mike Bayham, R-Chalmette, said before voting against the bill on the House floor. 

Overall, the new law was popular with lawmakers. The Senate approved it with a 35-3 vote and the House favored it 78-16. 

Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, suggested a song from Ludacris, encouraging people to “Get out da way,” become the statute’s new theme music.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7-18-23_overridesessions_MP-16-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-30 06:57:02.383714

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The state of Tennessee will lease underground property to Elon Musk’s Boring Company over roughly 50 years for construction of a 10-mile tunnel to transport riders from downtown Nashville to the airport, according to a state lawmaker.
“It would be more like the choice lanes where it will be always under state ownership, but it would be leased to them,” state Sen. Becky Massey, chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, said Tuesday. “The lease would be in lieu of us having to pay for it.”
The project is to tunnel under existing state highways and would use Tennessee’s right of way under the ground, according to Massey.
Gov. Bill Lee said Monday the project will be privately funded and that no tax breaks would be given to the Boring Company. He also said environmental permitting will be done at the state’s normal pace.
Boring Company President Steve Davis projected the project could take two years. Yet the Governor’s Office said in a Monday statement the tunnel could be operational as soon as fall of 2026.
Tennessee leaders back Musk tunnel plan to Nashville airport

In light of that, the state is expediting the project. 
The State Building Commission is set to approve a no-cost lease Thursday to Boring Company for a state-owned parking lot on Rosa Parks Boulevard as a staging ground for the tunnel boring machine and construction.
Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell, a Democrat, didn’t attend Monday’s announcement, but Lee downplayed the absence, saying the mayor supports it.
O’Connell released a statement Tuesday saying, “We are aware of the state’s conversations with the Boring Company, and we have a number of operational questions to understand the potential impacts on Metro and Nashvillians.”
Massey, a Knoxville Republican, said the Boring lease for the Vegas Loop where it constructed a 2.2-mile tunnel as part of a bigger project is for 50 years, a standard length for those types of agreements. 
Tennessee also is preparing to take bids for a “choice lane” road project from Nashville to Murfreesboro that motorists would pay to use. The contractor would lease the property and highway from the state under a 50-year agreement, Massey said.
  “We’ve got to be creative,” said Sen. Becky Massey, a Knoxville Republican and chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“The model’s there. The only difference is it’s underground instead of above ground,” Massey said of the Boring project.
Massey and House Speaker Cameron Sexton attended a Monday announcement for the tunnel plan at Nashville International Airport. No Democrats from the Davidson County legislative delegation were invited.
The Tennessee Department of Transportation declined to confirm a lease agreement, referring questions to the Governor’s Office. A spokesperson for the governor did not respond Tuesday to questions.
Transportation Department spokesperson Beth Emmons said the Boring Company announced its plan to file a permit application for the Music City Loop, and once that is done and review processes start, the department could release more details. 
Neither Boring nor Lee announced the cost of the project Monday. Yet Republican lawmakers are excited about the prospects, saying it could cut traffic congestion as Nashville grows.
Leery Democrats are raising questions about the potential impact on the environment and Nashville’s aging stormwater and wastewater systems, as well as property along the route. They also criticized the governor and Department of Transportation for not taking bids.
Massey, though, described the contractor as a “unique” company and pointed out the state isn’t hearing interest from other private firms looking to build a tunnel under the city.
“When somebody says we’re willing to pay for all of it if we can go under your roads, to me that’s pretty enticing, because … we’ve got to be creative,” she said. 
Massey added that contractors aren’t offering to build light rail across the city, either, and taxpayers don’t want to fund such a system.
Light rail was part of a 2018 transportation plan by former Nashville Mayor Megan Barry that failed in a public referendum.










This isn’t public transportation – it’s a privatized vanity tunnel for Elon Musk, a man with a long trail of broken promises.


– Sen. Heidi Campbell, D-Nashville


State Rep. John Ray Clemmons, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, criticized the tunnel project Monday, saying the Lee administration granted the Boring Company “exclusive access rights” beneath Nashville and a “monopoly to profit in perpetuity.” Clemmons, of Nashville, said the project could cost state taxpayers a “significant amount of money” at some point and endanger the economy because of threats to stormwater and wastewater systems by unregulated underground boring.
Democratic Sen. Heidi Campbell of Nashville accused Republican leaders of “prioritizing sweetheart deals for out-of-state billionaires” instead of investing in roads and transit that benefit all Tennesseans.
“This isn’t public transportation – it’s a privatized vanity tunnel for Elon Musk, a man with a long trail of broken promises,” Campbell said.
Davidson County lawmakers are planning to send a formal letter to Economic and Community Development Commissioner Stuart McWhorter requesting transparency on any state incentives or subsidies for the proposed tunnel.

(Preston Keres/USDA/Public domain)The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to relocate thousands of Washington, D.C., employees to five regional hubs including Fort Collins could be a boon for Colorado-based research while undercutting the department’s overall workforce, agricultural economists said.
The department wants to relocate up to 2,600 of its 4,600 D.C.-area employees to regional offices in Fort Collins; Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis; and Salt Lake City. The planned move would also phase out the USDA’s nine regional U.S. Forest Service offices primarily into a single location in Fort Collins. 
Although the move will bring more experts and resources to Fort Collins, it will also mean turnover at the USDA, Colorado State University agricultural economics professor Dawn Thilmany said. The department, which researches and regulates sectors like farming, food safety and natural resources, employs about 100,000 people. 
“I think there’s a lot to be said for the USDA being more locally organized, and it will benefit my grad students, having so much more of the talent affiliated with USDA in our backyard,” Thilmany said. “But, regardless of how many people actually leave the department, because we don’t know what the number will be, it looks like it will be a significant disruption.”

The department is making the move “to bring USDA closer to the people it serves while also providing a more affordable cost of living for USDA employees,” according to a statement from the department.
The statement said that Fort Collins was chosen as one of the relocation hubs “based on its existing USDA and Forest Service presence, proximity to agricultural communities and affordability relative to the Washington metro area — one of the most expensive in the country.”
Opportunities for northern Colorado
Some Colorado lawmakers have expressed their approval of the planned move. Sen. John Hickenlooper said in a post on X that “Fort Collins will be a great home for USDA’s new hub. Done correctly, this will harness Colorado’s agricultural communities’ expertise and help better connect USDA’s research to the folks on the ground.”
If a sizable chunk of the USDA workforce chooses to keep their jobs and relocate to Fort Collins, it would benefit Colorado through the department’s agricultural research, said Dana Hoag, a resource economics professor at CSU.
“Even when it’s national research, if you have a federal researcher in Colorado, it’s most likely going to be relevant to Colorado and Colorado will probably benefit more than anybody else,” Hoag said.
The Colorado-based research that the USDA conducts is often in partnership with CSU, meaning that this move may yield more opportunities for CSU faculty and students, Hoag said.
Department turnover expected
The USDA statement did not specify a timeline for the employee relocation, but it said that “some aspects of the reorganization will take place over the coming months, while others will take more time.”
Thilmany said USDA employees near retirement and those raising families in the Washington, D.C., area would be the least likely to relocate, based on the results of previous departmental relocation efforts. During the first Trump administration, the USDA pursued a narrower relocation directive, at that time moving some employees to Kansas City, Missouri, which Thilmany said led to disruptive changes at the impacted agencies. 










Ph.D. economists with the right skills aren’t just hanging on fruit trees, and when you have to hire a whole bunch of them, it could take a while.


– Dana Hoag, resource economics professor at CSU


She said there are two ways this new, broader directive could play out: It will go smoother this time, because there are five cities instead of one, or it won’t, and significant turnover results.
“Last time, there were a lot of delayed grants and programs and I was really concerned,” Thilmany said. “They definitely lost some people I thought were super clever people, but they also hired really well. The problem again is, I am worried about if they’d be able to rebuild like that this time.”
If the department decides to bring in new hires to replace employees who choose not to relocate, it could pose challenges, Hoag said.
“Ph.D. economists with the right skills aren’t just hanging on fruit trees, and when you have to hire a whole bunch of them, it could take a while,” he added.
The union representing federal workers said the relocation plan is another harmful way to cut federal jobs. More than 90% of USDA workers are already based outside of the Washington, D.C., area.
Fort Collins cost of living
The USDA cited affordability as a reason for the relocation. Federal employees receive increased pay based on the cost of living in the city where they work, and Washington, D.C., has one of the highest pay bump rates, at 33%.
Fort Collins has a cost of living bump that is slightly lower, at 30%. This is comparatively high in relation to the other hub cities, like Salt Lake City and Raleigh, with 17% and 22% boosts, respectively.
Hoag pointed to Fort Collins’ rising cost of living and tough housing market as concerns about the USDA’s plan.
“I don’t see a lot of downsides, except for the personal lives that are going to be disrupted and the real estate market,” Hoag said.
Changes at the USDA
Pete Kolbenschlag, the executive director of the Colorado Farm and Food Alliance, said the benefits of the employee relocation to Fort Collins should not distract from the harms of sweeping reorganization at the USDA.
Agencies within the department, including the U.S. Forest Service, have faced mass layoffs during President Donald Trump’s second term. Kolbenschlag said staff reductions are concerning, and so is the Trump administration’s rollback of several climate-friendly focuses at the USDA and other departments. 
“It’s important not to look at these things through just the framing of jobs in Colorado or more research being done out of our flagship ag school,” Kolbenschlag said. “Those are good things, but that’s a pretty narrow way of thinking when we’re talking about a massive reorganization of a major federal department that impacts everything from food security to renewable energy on rural lands to climate change and water policies.”

But the window for individuals to apply for aid is drawing to a close — homeowners and renters can submit applications for FEMA support until Aug. 19. 
The agency is preparing to close three of its Disaster Recovery Centers, which help disaster victims with aid applications and provide connections to other resources. Centers in Dyer, McNairy and Montgomery counties will close at 6 p.m. on Aug. 1, according to FEMA. Centers in Hardeman and Obion counties will remain open until FEMA announces otherwise.
Since President Donald Trump’s administration declared Tennessee’s April storms a federal disaster on June 19, FEMA has approved 728 applications for a total of nearly $5.2 million. This includes $2.8 million in housing assistance and $2.3 million in assistance for other needs, as of July 29.
Housing assistance can help affected individuals cover temporary housing costs and pay for structural home repairs not covered by insurance. Funds may also be available to help replace wells, furnaces and septic systems. 
FEMA public assistance available to 3 more counties; Individual payouts top $3M

FEMA’s “other needs assistance” can help homeowners and renters cover the cost of uninsured out-of-pocket expenses caused by the disaster. This can include medical expenses, funeral expenses, cleaning, moving and storage, childcare, repair or replacement of vehicles and replacement of essential items like clothing, furniture, appliances or tools used for work, according to the agency.
Homeowners and renters in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties can apply for individual grants for temporary housing and home repairs and low-cost loans for uninsured losses. 
The agency does not cover losses already covered by insurance, and the agency recommends individuals file a claim with their insurance company before applying for FEMA aid.
FEMA assistance is not considered taxable income and will not affect individuals’ eligibility for other federal programs and benefits, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), according to the agency.
Affected individuals can apply for individual assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov, through FEMA’s mobile app or by calling 800-621-3362. 
Help with applications is also available at remaining Disaster Recovery Centers at Safe Haven Storm Shelter at 530 Madison Avenue W in Grand Junction in Hardeman County and the Obion County Library in Union City.
Centers offer assistance information from FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration. Hours for each center as well as additional resources can be found at fema.gov/disaster/4878.

(Greg Jordan | Bluefield Daily Telegraph) West Virginia is partnering with the federal government to perform two flood mitigation studies in regions known for widespread and often devastating flooding events, according to a news release from Gov. Patrick Morrisey.
The studies will be led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and will focus on communities in Wyoming County — Mullens, Pineville and Oceana — as well as the Kanawha River Basin watershed. The goal, according to the news release, is to evaluate the potential benefits of projects that could help mitigate the worst effects of flooding events in the future.
“We know all too well the dangers that floods pose to West Virginia,” Morrisey said in the news release. “These disasters have disrupted lives, damaged infrastructure, and devastated entire communities. With these new initiatives, we are investing in data-driven, long-term solutions that will help us better protect our people and prepare our state for challenges ahead.”
In the Kanawha River Basin, researchers will study “a comprehensive array of flood risk management strategies” in 20 total counties. Fourteen of those counties, per the release, were directly impacted by the historic floods in June 2016.
The communities being studied in Wyoming County as part of the Upper Guyandotte Flood Study are among those in the state at the highest risk of flooding, per the release. 
According to a 2023 study from researchers at West Virginia University, more than 24% of structures in Wyoming County are considered to be in a “Special Flood Hazard Area” — the fourth highest ratio for any county in the state. About 90% of those structures are residential.
Representatives for the Federal Emergency Management Agency have said that flooding is the number one disaster to hit West Virginia annually. Between 2018 and 2022, according to West Virginia’s hazard mitigation plan, 21 flooding events across West Virginia cost the state more than $26 million in property damage.
At large, residents in the state’s southern coalfields are the most vulnerable in the state for both minor and major flooding events. And every time a flood hits, floodplains in affected areas expand leaving more residents and structures at risk come the next heavy rain due to soil and rock erosion around rivers and other waterways.
The new mitigation studies will be funded through both state and federal dollars. In Wyoming County, costs for the project will be split evenly with the state and the federal government both contributing $1.5 million. The Kanawha River Basin Feasibility Study will also total $3 million and be split 50/50, but several communities labeled as “economically disadvantaged” will qualify for reduced state costs, bringing the state share down to just 10% in those areas.
A spokesperson for Morrisey said the state’s share of funding for these studies will come from the governor’s civil contingency fund, a pot of money that serves as the state’s main resource for handling natural disasters as well as for the governor to use in any way he sees fit.
It’s one of the only flood prevention investments made by the state in recent years despite flooding events becoming more frequent largely due to consequences of climate change.
In 2023, the state created a flood prevention fund under the State Resiliency Office to help protect communities affected by flooding events and implement recommendations included in the state’s flood plan. 
Since its inception, however, the Flood Resiliency Trust Fund has never been allocated money.
Under former Gov. Jim Justice, the Republican-controlled Legislature repeatedly opted against sending money to the fund despite requests from Justice, even while leaders boasted about record-setting revenue coming into the state.
In the House of Delegates this past legislative session, only 19 lawmakers — every Democrat in the House and 10 Republicans — voted in support of an amendment to the proposed state budget that would have put $50 million in the fund.
Morrisey, in his initially proposed budget, also included no funding for the measure.
So far this year, two deadly flooding events — one in the southern coalfields and another in the northern part of the state — have hit West Virginia, costing at least twelve lives and millions of dollars in property damage.
Following the flooding in northern West Virginia last month, where nine people died, Morrisey said he plans to have “additional discussions with the Legislature and others about the importance of flood prevention.”
“I want to make sure we’re learning from the past,” he said.

He began touring with Jake Blount, a fiddle and banjo player with a national following, and got to play at venues as storied and distinct as the Grand Ole Opry and NPR’s Tiny Desk.

It’s as promising a career as a working musician could hope for – and the kind of career that has supported countless New Orleans musicians over the decades. But in recent months, Williams, a lifelong Louisianian, has been questioning whether staying in New Orleans makes sense for him anymore.
Williams, who recently got engaged, rents a two-bedroom apartment in Mid-City and makes about the same as an early-career schoolteacher. He and his fiancée will look at homes on Zillow, but despite the fact that the local housing market has slowed in recent years, homeownership feels out of reach and risky, largely due to the cost of insurance, which skyrocketed in southeast Louisiana after a series of hurricanes in 2020 and 2021.
“I keep thinking, if I stay in New Orleans, can I even afford a home?” Williams told Verite News. He’s watched insurance premiums climb, pricing some of his friends out of their own homes, and, at the same time, he has grown frustrated with the fact that musicians like him are not being paid enough to afford the rising cost of living.
“It just feels really hard and disappointing that homeownership, which is part of the quote-unquote ‘American dream,’ can be so out of reach,” he said.
If Williams does choose to leave, he will join the tens of thousands of others over the last five years – making the New Orleans metropolitan area one of the fastest shrinking in the country. Since 2020, the greater New Orleans area has seen its population shrink by about 40,000 residents, a net loss of almost 4% of the metropolitan area’s population. Much of that loss was driven by the city proper, which lost an estimated 20,000 residents during the same period.
Population decline carries real consequences: Fewer residents mean lower tax revenues for schools, libraries, trash pick-up and other basic services. Long-planned and necessary infrastructure upgrades can go underfunded. And population decline can slow the economy. As skilled and working-age adults depart, the city loses its lifeblood — from workers and small business owners to renters and homeowners.
Still, for many like Williams, the calculus is simple: It is simply too expensive to live in a city where there aren’t enough jobs – especially jobs that pay well enough to keep pace with the cost of living.
As the city heads into the 2025 election, this demographic exodus is part of what’s shaping the race to succeed LaToya Cantrell as mayor. Population loss is now an urgent political issue. But can whoever is elected mayor meaningfully reverse this trend and bring people back to New Orleans?
For its 2025 election guide, Verite News asked all four leading mayoral candidates about what they would do to stymie this population loss. They discussed the need for more housing, stronger infrastructure and public services, and more and better jobs.

Royce Duplessis: “I have committed to working with public and private sector stakeholders to build 40,000 affordable housing units. We should also leverage public and private dollars to provide better access to capital for our small businesses. … For too long, we have put all our economic eggs in one basket. … We need to make the Port of New Orleans the leading Port of America. … Revitalizing our port will help us create and sustain new jobs and grow our economy while we diversify it.”
Arthur Hunter: “We’re going to put serious investment into neighborhood infrastructure, public safety, and housing. We’ll clean up our streets, fix broken services, and make sure the resources go where they’re needed most.”
Helena Moreno: “I would create the conditions for businesses and citizens to thrive. That means streamlining permitting, prioritizing business retention, bringing retail to neighborhoods, and reinvigorating our Office of Economic Development. I want community and business leaders at the table, along with stakeholders like GNO Inc., to help my administration support the growth of key industries, such as healthcare and bioscience, green energy, logistics and trade, film and hospitality, clean energy, and tech.”
Oliver Thomas: “As mayor, I’ll focus on the basics that make people stay: affordable housing, good-paying local jobs, safer neighborhoods, and stronger infrastructure that protects communities from flooding and storms.”

But hanging over the entire race is an uncomfortable truth: there is only so much that a mayor can do to solve the core problems driving people to leave. The ongoing threat of hurricanes, flooding and extreme heat, all exacerbated by climate change, are leading to higher insurance premiums.
But the mayor has no regulatory control over homeowners’ insurance companies. That is a state matter. And while the city government can exercise control over some locally generated greenhouse gas emissions and work to mitigate the effects of a warming planet for its residents, those measures won’t do much to stem the worst impacts of climate change.
The mayor and the New Orleans City Council are not even empowered to demand that local employers pay more so that residents can better afford to live in an increasingly expensive city. A so-called state “preemption law” prohibits city and parish governments from raising the local minimum wage that private employers must pay above the federally guaranteed minimum, which is currently $7.25 per hour.
It’s not just New Orleans that is at a crossroads; it’s all of Louisiana.
“The entire state is losing population with very few exceptions,” Allison Plyer, chief demographer at The Data Center, told Verite News. “Every time people talk about population loss in New Orleans, they should be talking about population loss across Louisiana.”
Plyer said that the data available cannot tell us specifically why people are leaving Louisiana, but a lack of economic opportunity is the number one reason nationwide why Americans move long distances. And the fact that Louisiana is failing to grow its economy is corroborated by the data.
According to a report by The Data Center, since 2000, Louisiana has experienced one of the lowest rates of job growth in the country at just 2%. By way of comparison, in that same period, Florida has grown jobs by 41%, Georgia by 25% and Alabama by 13%. The national average job growth was 20%. Louisiana, meanwhile, has struggled to keep college graduates in the state, with many young professionals leaving for Texas and other nearby states for better opportunities.
“Clearly, there needs to be a different way of thinking about how to grow an economy,” Plyer said, noting that the kinds of industries supported by state leaders, such as oil and gas, job growth in the industry has been on the decline. “We continue to be dominated by industries that are shedding jobs, and those continue to be part of our economic development plan.”
New Orleans’ economy remains heavily tied to tourism, hospitality and low‑wage service jobs, a market that can highly vulnerable to economic downturns and volatile even in a relatively good economy. Nearly two dozen restaurants and bars have already closed in 2025, many citing increasing costs paired with decreasing revenues.
Even when the city hosts major events — a stretch from fall 2024 to early this year included three nights of Taylor Swift concerts, the Sugar Bowl, the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras — some business owners don’t feel like they benefit.
Skyrocketing premiums
Sandra Green Thomas, who is chief of staff for New Orleans City Councilmember Eugene Green, said that although she has chosen to stay in New Orleans, she has encouraged her adult children to leave for better opportunities, and they have.
“Their educational, work, and social experiences have exceeded their experiences here,” she told Verite News.
But talk to anyone who has left – or is considering leaving – and it is clear that it is not just a lack of jobs that is causing people to leave the city or the state. Many cite the impact of climate change, both existentially and financially, as driving their decision to leave.
“I am a lifelong New Orleanian, but my wife and I have had serious conversations about moving to the Northshore or maybe another city, due to the outrageous cost of homeowners’ insurance,” resident Charlie Hurst told Verite News. “My wife and I love New Orleans and its culture. We grew up knowing the dangers that hurricanes present to this part of the country. However, it is becoming difficult to justify the expense of living here.”

Hurricanes in 2020 and 2021 bankrupted several property insurers, causing insurance prices to skyrocket.
High property and flood insurance premiums, combined with climbing interest rates nationwide, have rendered the local real estate market softer over the past few years, according to Ginger Wiggins, president of the New Orleans Metropolitan Association of Realtors. Even with lower sale prices, however, the cost of insurance has made “affordability impossible” for property owners, she said.
And according to Wiggins, if fewer homes sell, there could be economic ramifications for the state.
“The average sale of one house in Louisiana brings in like $85,000 on average into the local economy,” Wiggins said, pointing to money spent on commissions, moving expenses, home repairs and furniture and appliance purchases.
The insurance crisis has also had downstream impacts on the rental market. As premiums climb, some landlords have to increase the rent for long-term tenants in order to cover their increasing monthly payments, helping to push up rental prices.
‘It got harder and harder to defend living here’
Hurricanes have also revealed the extent to which local infrastructure, from the sewerage system to the electric grid, might not be prepared to meet the new reality of quickly intensifying hurricanes defined by both high winds and more rain. Even without storms, New Orleans’ infrastructure is often in disrepair. Potholes, water main breaks, sinkholes and unstable roads feed a sense of neglect.
“If you poll people, the biggest issues for them are always going to be housing and infrastructure,” said Monique Blossom, policy director at the Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center. “Yet we’re not investing at a level to even do damage control, much less in the crisis we’re facing.”
It’s a sentiment echoed by current and former residents. Courtney Fricke, who was born and raised on the Northshore, moved to New Orleans three years ago. Now, she and her husband have decided to leave the state.
“It truly has been death by a thousand cuts,” Fricke said.“It got harder and harder to defend living here, so we decided to move.”
The city’s next mayor will be contending with a difficult political environment. It is a Democratic city in one of the most conservative states in the country. Gov. Jeff Landry, a conservative Republican, has often made a point of using the city as a political punching bag, at one point even holding up funding for a critical New Orleans infrastructure project after local leaders said in 2022 that they would not prioritize enforcement of the state’s abortion ban. The reelection of Donald Trump, bringing with it the prospect of massive cuts in federal funding for city priorities, as well as the loss of federal employees who work in the region, only further complicates things for the local government.
“Leaders across the state really need to be working together to look at why the state is losing population and what they’re going to do about it, because the mayor could pull every lever in his or her power, but if the state is continuing to lose population, they’re not going to be able to turn it around,” Plyer said.

Plyer said local and state leaders should also be wary about Trump’s immigration crackdown. One of the few mitigating factors to population loss is international immigration, which drove a modest growth in population last year.
But city leadership does not have any say over federal immigration policy. And the state legislature has sought to erode what little power it had — enacting local policies that prevent police from working with federal immigration authorities — by passing laws that ban such “sanctuary” policies and even making it a crime for local law enforcement agents to refuse to assist in immigration investigations.
“Louisiana’s population would be declining even faster if it weren’t for international immigration,” Plyer said.
Williams, the musician who moved here in 2020, recognizes that a mayor alone cannot solve all the problems facing the city. But he still thinks tackling bread-and-butter issues, from building better bike infrastructure to continuing to regulate short-term rentals,  would help him feel more committed to staying in town.
“So much of how I think about myself and what I do musically is tied to New Orleans,” Williams said, noting that the city has a long history of being a home to Black musicians like him. It’s a lineage he would like to continue to be a part of – if he can afford to.
“It’s like, man, could I ever afford to live in this city I love so much and that has given me so much?” Williams mused. “If I want to have that type of thing, then I have to leave the city to find it.”

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers  from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture where officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, though most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health issues in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health issues.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would negatively affect an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers also disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that –– to provide those services,” Archbold said.

(Photo: Getty Images)One rural Tennessee school district’s approach to addressing chronic absenteeism is drawing a growing backlash from local parents.
The Lawrence County Board of Education in June adopted a policy to reject doctors’ notes as a valid excuse for a child missing school.
The new policy, effective for the school year beginning Aug. 4, also requires school officials to refer families to juvenile court if a child has missed eight days of school. 
In Tennessee, truancy referrals to courts typically do not begin until a child has 18 unexcused school absences. 
Director of Schools Michael Adkins said the district of about 7,000 students needed to find a way to keep kids from missing out on valuable instruction time while instilling values that will one day serve them in the workforce.
“I think we have to take a stand and say this is important,” he said when introducing the policy in June. “It’s important to come to school each and every day. 
“And if you’ve got the sniffles, that’s fine. You’re going to have them when you go to work one day. We’ve all gone to work sick and hurt and beat up. I think as a group and society we’re losing that reliability and that opportunity begins in the school house.”
But parents in the district have expressed outrage over the new policy.
More than 2,700 local residents have signed a petition to overturn the policy and plan to protest at the next board meeting, scheduled for August 21. 
Many have also aired their anger and concerns on a newly formed Facebook page: “We’re Not Truant! Parents Against the Absentee Policy.” 










And if you’ve got the sniffles, that’s fine. You’re going to have them when you go to work one day. We’ve all gone to work sick and hurt and beat up. I think as a group and society we’re losing that reliability and that opportunity begins in the school house.


– Michael Adkins, Director of Schools, Lawrence County, Tennessee


The district’s absentee policy contains escalating consequences for student absences. 
As an initial measure, the school will create a “welcoming environment” in which they connect with students and families, make daily announcements about good attendance and analyze school and student data for attendance patterns in order to identify absenteeism issues early. 
After a student is absent for three days, school officials may begin an intervention. The policy doesn’t specify what type of intervention.
After five days, the school would hold a conference with the student and their parents, create an “attendance contract,” hold regular follow-up meetings and conduct a written assessment of why the child has been absent.
After eight absences, the child will be referred to Lawrence County Juvenile Court, the policy says. Parents of children with chronic illnesses may submit a form that authorizes school officials to speak with a child’s doctor.
“It’s outlandish to me. One sickness could easily put you at three to five days,” said Amber Atkins, a co-creator of the Facebook group and mother to a rising sixth grader. 
“And then I am wasting my time in a courtroom, wasting resources in that court and with DCS and whoever else having these people involved in our lives who have no business being involved in our lives.”



				Under a new policy, children who miss eight days of school in Lawrence County will be referred to juvenile court.			


Atkins’ son was absent five days in the previous school year to visit healthcare providers treating his ADHD, she said. He’s likely to miss school again this year for illness or doctor’s visits. 
A message left with the Lawrence County Schools this week seeking comment about the policy went unreturned.
Lawrence County’s chronically absentee rate of 15.4% falls below both the state’s average of 18.7% and the national rate of about 26%, according to data published by the Tennessee Department of Education and federal government.
Whether a student has an “excused” or “unexcused” absence will not change the county’s overall rates of chronic absenteeism, noted Jeremy Singer, assistant professor of education leadership and policy, University of Michigan-Flint and co-author of “Rethinking Chronic Absenteeism,” published this year. 
“Whether it’s excused or unexcused it’s still going to count as an absence and that’s still going to figure into the county’s chronic absenteeism rate,” he said.
“Changing this policy relates more to being able to use the levers of truancy law and truancy court referrals, because where ‘excused’ versus ‘unexcused’ matters is the use of those punitive channels,” he said.
Singer said punitive approaches to absenteeism may ultimately be counterproductive. 
“This kind of tone and approach to families could end up disrupting or harming the kinds of relationships that schools and districts rely on to try and understand what’s going on with families,” he said.

Krista and Kendra Slaubaugh, sisters from Hazen, recently debuted a new anthem inspired by North Dakota, “Call It Home,” written in partnership with the North Dakota Department of Tourism. 
Officials say the goal is to share Tigirlily Gold’s connection with North Dakota on a national stage.
“I’ve watched these women grow up and seeing them use their platform to celebrate and support our state has been really inspiring,” said Sara Otte Coleman, tourism and marketing director for the North Dakota Department of Commerce in a news release. “We’re super excited to work with them.”
The partnership is a two-year commitment to promote the state that ends on Jan. 31, 2027, according to the Department of Commerce. It included a July 10 performance at North Dakota Country Fest in New Salem, where the duo performed the North Dakota anthem for the first time.

The partnership also included a free performance during the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament in February as part of North Dakota’s Find The Good Life campaign, which aims to attract workers to the state. 
Other events may be scheduled in the future, according to the Tourism Department.
“We’ve always dreamed of working with North Dakota Tourism,” the duo said in a news release. “This collaboration is truly full circle, and we’re honored to share what makes our home state so special.”
North Dakota Tourism also has partnered with North Dakota native and actor Josh Duhamel to promote the state. His most recent two-year partnership, which ended in 2024, cost the state $75,000.
“Both Tigirlily Gold and Josh Duhamel have large fan bases and serve as authentic ambassadors for North Dakota, each bringing pride, unique personal connection and platforms that amplify North Dakota’s awareness,” the department said in an email in response to questions. “We are lucky to partner with these influencers to help increase that awareness, as they love to talk about their home state.”
Tigirlily Gold performed an acoustic set, including the new song, on the steps of the Capitol on Monday night to wrap up the first day of the 2025 North Dakota Governors’ Cup, a golf and shooting tournament that raises money for scholarships and student loan repayment. 
That event, which included a drone show, was not supported by any state funds, according to the North Dakota Office of Management and Budget. It was organized by North Dakota Governors’ Cup, the nonprofit that puts on the tournament.

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.










There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink on Monday gained support from a pro-democracy veterans organization in her bid to take Michigan’s 7th Congressional District seat.
The group, Veterans for Responsible Leadership, in its endorsement of Brink, said that she was “tailor-made for this moment and this district.”
“We need leaders in Washington who have the courage to stand up for what is right, and Bridget has proven she has exactly that, most recently when she resigned and spoke out against the Trump Administration,” said Bobby Jones, the group’s president, in a statement. “Over 28 years of service under five Presidents – both Democrat and Republican – Bridget has spent her life fighting for freedom and protecting democracy, and we can trust her to bring principled leadership and real results to Congress.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Brink thanked Jones and the organization for their support.
“Our grassroots campaign continues to build momentum and together we can take on the chaos coming out of Washington to tackle our toughest problems and deliver real results for hard working Michigan families,” Brink said in a statement.
Brinks will face Michigan State University professor Josh Cowen, former Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam, Alexandra Prieditis, Muhammad Salman Rais and Elyon Badger in the August 2026 Democratic primary.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-30 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi broadband expansion moves forward despite federal changes,Katherine Lin,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/30/mississippi-broadband-expansion-federal-changes-cuts/,There have been concerns that the Trump administration would make cuts to the Biden era program to expand internet access.,"Despite twists and turns, Mississippi took a step forward this week in expanding broadband access in the state. 
There have been concerns that the Trump administration would make cuts to the Biden era program.
While there have not been cuts to the bulk of the money, the changes to the federal program have caused concern for advocates about the program’s affordability, technology/stability and community engagement. 
Internet service providers submitted over 300 applications for grant funding to provide internet to underserved areas according to Sally Doty, the director of the Office of Broadband Expansion and Accessibility of Mississippi. BEAM is responsible for managing the $1.2 billion the state plans to receive from the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program.
BEAD is a $42-billion program passed by Congress in 2021 as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. But on June 6, the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration altered the criteria to select providers. The notice eliminated the preference for fiber broadband and requirements for labor, community engagement, climate resilience and low cost/affordable plans. It did not change the amount earmarked for each state.
“Shelving the previous Administration’s unnecessary burdens, and opening access to all technology types, connects more Americans to broadband more quickly, and at a lower cost to the American taxpayer,” said Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Commerce, in the June notice about the changes. 
Areas in need of coverage were identified by asking providers to report what areas and technical capabilities they provided.  Mississippi received $1.2 billion to map underserved and unserved areas and to provide grants for providers to extend coverage to these areas. At the time of the June announcement, BEAM had not awarded any contracts.
In 2022, 80% of Mississippians had broadband service. At the time it was the lowest percentage in the nation. Broadband can open up business opportunities, provide access to telehealth care and more jobs, especially in rural areas that often have the lowest rates of high speed internet availability.
“The most marginalized, rural communities would benefit from this large infrastructure investment in the state,” said Harya Tarekegn, Director of Advocacy and Policy at the Mississippi Center for Justice. 
Grants will be given out based on who can build the infrastructure the cheapest, how fast they can set it up and if they’re able to meet the technical requirements, such as upload and download speeds. The new technology neutral plan may mean that more satellite contracts will be awarded to satellite companies, such as SpaceX and Amazon’s Kuiper. 
Advocates are concerned that the elimination of the preference for fiber and the ability for states to consider affordability will result in worse technology at a higher price for individuals. 
“We feel strongly that fiber is the best way to build out connectivity, especially in rural communities,” said Kyra Roby, a consultant with the Children’s Defense Fund. 
To install fiber broadband, cables are run along utility poles or underground up to or close to a house. The upfront cost of fiber is higher and more time consuming than other technologies, such as satellite and fixed wireless. However, fiber is generally considered the fastest and most reliable broadband technology with lower long term costs for maintenance and to consumers. 
Under the previous policy, states could use the end cost to consumers and providers’ low-cost programs as part of their decision making process. Now they cannot. 
“The affordability issue is a major issue. Internet service costs are ridiculous and a lot of people are not going to be able to afford market rates,” said Oleta Fitzgerald, the Southern Regional Office Director of the Children’s Defense Fund. 
There are no cuts to BEAD, but in May of this year, the federal government ended the Digital Equity Program. This included $10 million for Mississippi’s Digital Skills & Accessibility Capacity Grant Program to provide digital skills training and education. However, there is more concern about the future of the BEAD program and its ability to reshape internet access. 
Over the next few weeks, BEAM will review applications and make the final proposal available for public comment before submitting it to Commerce’s NTIA. 
“Communities still have a vital role to play in ensuring reliable, affordable access. There has already been significant community engagement around these issues to help get us to where we are now, and we expect even more in the months ahead,” said Roby.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/06075905/computer-1867758_1280.jpg,,,2025-07-30 06:57:02.383714

In many cases, the attorney that someone desperately needs is a public interest attorney, people who put their invaluable legal expertise to work not to make millions of dollars for themselves, but rather to uphold justice, defend marginalized communities, and make society healthier as a whole. 
These are people who work hard to get through law school, all while taking on enormous amounts of debt to make their dreams of defending the powerless a reality. Unfortunately, provisions in the so-called Big Beautiful Bill recently passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump have the power to crush those dreams and deprive the public of accessible legal advocacy. 
Law school isn’t merely tuition — it’s a mound of expenses including, but not limited to, rent, books, health insurance, bar prep and daily living expenses. 
The introduction of a $200,000 lifetime borrowing cap in the budget bill puts students in a financial chokehold, restricting opportunities before students even have a chance to crack open a casebook. In West Virginia for example, tuition alone can cost more than $131,000 for out-of-state law school students and more than $78,000 for in-state.
To applaud the $200,000 cap is to fundamentally misunderstand the scope of a law student’s financial reality. For students pursuing clerkships or public interest careers — roles that prioritize impact on society over becoming wealthy — their aspirations may be thwarted not by a lack of passion, but a lack of sustainable funding. We often hear talk about “good debt” and “bad debt,” but in a profession built to serve justice, why should the burden be placed so steeply on those who seek to uphold it? 
The consequences of this legislation will be immediate and unforgiving. Students will reach the $200K borrowing cap before graduation, federal aid will be cut off, and they’ll be forced to scramble for thousands to cover remaining tuition and living expenses. 
Some may be forced to reduce their course load, delay graduation, or even drop out entirely — not because they lack drive, but because the safety net beneath them has vanished. Private loans often come with predatory interest rates and far fewer consumer protections. The GradPLUS loan once offered short-term relief, but now students will be left trading it for long-term instability. 
Not only does this cap freeze funding, but it also freezes momentum, fostering an elitist educational system where only the privileged can afford to finish what they’ve started. 
Diversity in law isn’t just a buzzword or a box to check; it’s the bedrock of an equitable justice system. It means having attorneys and judges who understand the lived realities of the very communities they serve. By capping federal loans without taking into consideration actual law school expenses, we run the risk of homogenizing and narrowing the pipeline to the legal profession more than it already is. 
This big beautiful burden will create seismic shifts in law school as we know it — slamming doors that many have spent years trying to open, implicitly favoring wealthier students, and systematically edging out those whose brilliance isn’t backed by a bank account.

(Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)This weekend, Kentucky politicians hoping to make an impression with voters will travel to far West Kentucky for the annual Fancy Farm Picnic. 
However, Kentucky’s top Democrats will skip the event this year, meaning Republicans will largely dominate the stage at the political speaking event. But with a few Republicans also skipping this year’s event, some political strategists worry the time-honored tradition is losing its relevance.  
 
Political speeches will begin Saturday at 2 p.m. local time under the shaded pavilion in Fancy Farm. The town is about a 40-minute drive southwest from Paducah. Barbecue goes on sale by the pound starting at 8 a.m, with $17 per pound for mutton and $13 per pound for pork. A fish fry and races, including a 5K, are held the Friday evening before the picnic. 

	The barbecue picnic, a fundraiser for the St. Jerome Catholic Church in Graves County held the first Saturday in August, has become a premier Kentucky tradition for elected officials and election hopefuls. In front of a fiery crowd politicians take to the stage to trade verbal jabs with their opponents, typically seated behind them watching the spectacle themselves. 
Kentucky has no statewide elections this year, but the top three Republican candidates for next year’s U.S. Senate race — U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, former Attorney General Daniel Cameron and Lexington businessman Nate Morris — will give speeches this year. The primary is in May. 
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said in a Spectrum TV interview that he will not attend the picnic this year because of a scheduling conflict. He did not attend last year, but was still the target of jokes from Republican speakers. The only Democratic candidate for the Senate, state Rep. Pamela Stevenson, has declined to attend this year, along with Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman. A spokesperson for Coleman told the Kentucky Lantern that she believes the picnic “should be reserved for candidates who are currently on the ballot so they can share their vision for the commonwealth with our neighbors in west Kentucky.”
John “Drew” Williams, who is challenging Comer, is slated to be the lone Democrat on the stage this year. 
In addition to the Republican U.S. Senate candidates, speakers for the afternoon are Republicans state Rep. Kim Holloway, state Sen. Jason Howell, U.S. Rep. James Comer, Attorney General Russell Coleman, Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell and Treasurer Mark Metcalf. 
Some Republicans — U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, Auditor Allison Ball and Secretary of State Michael Adams — are not attending. 
“It always bothers me when people skip unless there’s a really good reason, and usually there isn’t a really good reason,” said Trey Grayson, a former Republican secretary of state who has spoken on the Fancy Farm stage several times. 
The picnic puts a political spotlight on a rural region of Kentucky that doesn’t always get the most attention from Frankfort, which is hours away. Grayson said that the picnic gives politicians a chance to interact with not just people in the region, but party activists, press and others from across the state. Before the Saturday speeches, both political parties have dinners and festivities to build up excitement and organize. 
“There’s still elections in Western Kentucky,” Grayson said. “I always thought when Republicans didn’t go that it was a loss for our party, that we were letting down our party activists. So when Democrats who can otherwise go choose to not go, they’re letting down their Democratic activists.”
Grayson added that he does worry about the future of the event if politicians continue to skip. He noted that governors of both parties have skipped on occasion in recent decades.

Fancy Farm came about in a time before the “viral” moment that candidates can now use, said Morgan Eaves, the executive director of the Kentucky Democratic Party. She added that while candidates are out on the ground to meet Kentuckians across the state, “they also have a lot of digital media opportunities to grow their fundraising and their name ID and influence voters and their opinion of that candidate.
“So looking at it through today’s political lens, it’s simply just a lot less relevant because there are a lot more opportunities for folks to get out in different communities in the state, and those events are covered on a much thorough basis than they were kind of in Fancy Farm’s heyday,” Eaves said. 
Democratic candidates should be “everywhere a voter is, particularly in an election year,” but they should not “put themselves in a position in which they will be unfairly targeted, either by the other individuals on stage or or by the audience,” Eaves added. This year, she predicted that the Fancy Farm audience will see “a Republican bloodbath” as they rib each other heading into the primary or attack the record of U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who isn’t seeking reelection and has not yet confirmed if he will attend this year. The three top candidates have tried to distance themselves from McConnell. 
Because of its long history, Eaves said she expected Fancy Farm to continue, but some alternative ways to connect with voters exist, like town halls. 
“There are already alternatives to Fancy Farm, but Republicans are throwing them (away). Republicans aren’t showing up to them. Republicans aren’t going out in their different communities in their districts throughout the state,” Eaves said. “They are instead just using one standalone event in Western Kentucky when they should be using alternatives and listening to people across the state. They’re just not that interested.”

Belle Townsend, Kentucky State AFL-CIO spokesperson, told the Lantern that the labor union respects that it’s a fundraiser for a local church, but “the format of the event is more about political theater than substance.” Union organizers would rather focus on “working people and real economic issues affecting their lives, and that is rarely what is at the center of what happens on that stage.”
“This is not the only place to get angry,” Townsend said. “We can get angry on the picket line, in places where the energy can be put towards something that, once again, builds long term change.”
The event has become less important for Democratic candidates because they’ve been outnumbered in recent years, said Jonathan Miller, a former Democratic state treasurer who has also appeared as a speaker. He said it was hard to even hear himself speak at times because of the crowd’s yelling. 
“It is just an unreal experience, and it becomes something that I think is helpful in character building for many candidates, but in other ways, really is not reflective of true policy or political reaction, because it is so, so loud, so angry and so noisy, so it’s become a bit of a a spectacle, as opposed to have a meaningful political exercise,” Miller said. 
The events leading up to the picnic are “the best of Kentucky politics, the best of American politics,” Miller said because people are coming from Frankfort and other parts of the state to an area “that’s often ignored, and having kind of traditional handshaking, baby kissing, types of interactions with grassroots political supporters.”
Up and coming candidates who want to make a name for themselves might find more value in going to the Fancy Farm Picnic, Miller said. 
However, the event mainly featured Democrats when they were the dominant party in Kentucky. Republicans gained control of the state Senate around the turn of the century and the state House in 2016.

McConnell, a Republican from Louisville, began attending the event in the 1980s and was ultimately elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984. Republican Party of Kentucky spokesperson Andy Westberry said that at the time “you could fit nearly every elected Republican in Kentucky into a phone booth.” 
“It’s a shame Democrats no longer see the value in showing up,” Westberry added. “It wasn’t that long ago when we were the ones outnumbered. But no matter how hostile the crowd was, Republicans always showed up. That’s one of the reasons we now dominate Kentucky politics.”
The “event is just as important today as it was over 40 years ago,” he said, calling it a “a litmus test that shows voters in west Kentucky their support matters.”
Eaves said McConnell’s early attendance happened “when times were really different.” 
“Social media wasn’t around,” she said.” People’s news sources were much different. The news cycle itself looked a lot different, and the opportunities for candidates and voters alike looked a lot different.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/fancyfarmweekend_113-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-30 05:56:44.720882

Advocates for people experiencing homelessness were stunned last week when President Donald Trump signed an executive order to make it easier for states and cities to remove homeless individuals from the streets and force them to receive mental health care and into treatment for drug addiction.
The order was unexpected and raised concerns that it could lead to mistreatment and mass institutionalization of people with mental illness and drug addictions and criminalize people experiencing homelessness. Similar actions have been taken by local and state governments to remove individuals experiencing homelessness from encampments and public streets.
Trump’s order signals a federal retreat from the “Housing First” strategy, which advocates contend has proven effective in fighting homelessness. The Housing First approach prioritizes access to permanent housing and supportive services for mental health and substance abuse issues as the best strategy to address the nation’s growing homelessness crisis.

 A misguided policy reversal
In an interview with NC Newsline Editor Rob Schofield, Samuel Gunter, executive director of the North Carolina Housing Coalition, said incarcerating people experiencing homelessness and hiding them from view will not resolve the nation’s homelessness crisis. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s annual Point-In-Time Count found 770,000 people experiencing homelessness on a single night in January. That represented an 18% increase over the previous year.
“We know in homelessness intervention that the answer is housing,” Gunter said. “It’s always housing. The carceral state solutions are always more expensive. You’re spending more money to not even solve the problem instead of funding the things we know solve the problem.”
The mishandling of the nation’s homelessness crisis cuts across political lines, Gunter said. He expressed dismay that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has also embraced policies that advocates believe are insensitive to people experiencing homelessness and fail to resolve the problem.
“The Trump executive order; it’s awful,” Gunter said. “But this one is not Republican or Democratic — no one is good in this.”

Trump’s executive order seeks to follow-up on a promise he made on the campaign trail in 2023 to address homelessness and to remove individuals from the streets.
“We will use every tool, lever, and authority to get the homeless off our streets,” Trump said. We want to take care of them, but they have to be off our streets.”
The president’s order, which is entitled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” is makes us of less civil language than his campaign pledge. The executive order contends that “endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sudden confrontations and violent attacks” have made the nation’s streets unsafe.
“The overwhelming majority of these individuals are addicted to drugs, have a mental health condition, or both,” the executive order states. “Nearly two-thirds of homeless individuals report having regularly used hard drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine, or opioids in their lifetimes.”
Punishment is not the solution
Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said Trump’s order is the most harmful policy proposal on homelessness to be advanced during her 30-year career.

“At a time when unaddressed housing costs are driving record numbers of people into homelessness, this order demonstrates a lack of focus and understanding on what our communities — both red and blue — need to address this crisis,” Olivia said. “Instead, it largely focuses on punishing people for being homeless and denying desperately needed funds to overwhelmed and under resourced frontline workers.”
Executive orders are different from laws passed by Congress. However, federal agencies and the officials who run them are expected to implement and enforce them. The order also ties federal dollars flowing to states and municipalities to compliance.
“Our local leaders will have to face a crucial question, and that question is which is more important; is it more important to ensure that we protect our most vulnerable citizens and be innovative and find ways that we can do that with state dollars, or do we comply with what the intention of what this order is and whatever laws come out of it and began to round people up?” said Dr. Latonya Agard, executive director of the NC Coalition to End Homelessness.
The order is designed to allow states and municipalities to remove people from encampments and to fine them, jail them or involuntarily commit them, which will likely further exacerbate their condition, Agard said.

“So what we find is that people experiencing homelessness are caught in a huge dragnet that intends to make it even more difficult for them to find and maintain permanent housing,” she said.  “Unfortunately, permanent housing appears to be a non priority with this administration.”
Trump’s executive order prioritizes punishment and dehumanization, Agard said, and characterizes people experiencing homelessness as dangerous and unwell.
“That is simply not true based on the evidence that we have,” Agard said.
Expanded use of involuntary commitment poses practical problems
Undoubtedly, enforcement of the executive order will rely on involuntary commitments. In North Carolina, that legal process is used when someone is believed to be a danger to themselves or others due to a mental illness or substance abuse disorder.
Anyone with first-hand knowledge of the individual’s condition can initiate an involuntary commitment proceeding by filing a petition with a magistrate. If a magistrate finds probable cause, a custody order is issued, and the individual is taken to a facility by a commitment examiner.
Agard said North Carolina doesn’t have the facilities to safely place people suffering from mental illness or drug addiction.
“We don’t have the capacity, we don’t have the space, to provide people with that kind of treatment if we’re simply pulling them off the street and trying to place them where ever we can find,” Agard said. “We have a very limited mental health provision system here and we lack the funding for people who are voluntarily seek mental health.”
There are also risks of civil rights violations in a system in which people haven’t been adequately trained to make such assessments, Agard said.
“How will they determine who should be involuntarily committed?” Agard asks. “I have concerns about profiling. I have concerns about biases that we all hold. But when your biases impact whether someone is involuntarily committed or is arrested, I think that warrants a second look, a different approach.”   
Disability Rights North Carolina recently published a report on involuntary commitments that found an “overwhelmed mental health system where people of all ages, with serious behavioral health needs, languish in EDs [emergency departments] without court-appointed legal counsel or adequate mental health treatment.”
“Once detained in an ED, the child or adult who is the focus of that order cannot leave; their liberty is quite literally in legal limbo because the law does not provide for an attorney or hearing in the ED,” the authors wrote. “Forced detention in an ED can last for days, weeks, and even months while awaiting an available bed for psychiatric hospitalization (commonly referred to as ‘ED boarding’).”
The National Homelessness Law Center (NHLC) quickly condemned Trump’s executive order, which it said, “deprives people of their basic rights and makes it harder to solve homelessness.”
Specifically, the NHLC said it’s concerned that the order will expand the use of police and institutionalization, prioritize funding for states that treat homelessness as a crime, and cut funding for programs that have proven to save lives.
“The safest communities are those with the most housing and resources, not those that make it a crime to be poor or sick,” the NHLC said. “Forced treatment is unethical, ineffective, and illegal. People need stable housing and access to healthcare.”
Trump’s actions will force more people into homelessness, divert taxpayer money from people in need, and make it harder for local communities to solve homelessness, the NHLC said.
“Sadly, but not surprisingly, Trump continues to focus on deeply unpopular policies like handcuffs and jail, which hurt Black and Brown people most,” the NHLC said. “Laws and budgets that make homelessness and poverty worse negatively impact us all. To build truly safe, healthy, and just communities, we need housing and healthcare, not handcuffs and budget cuts.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_2889-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-30 05:56:44.720882

(Photo by Gerville/Getty Images)If data is the new gold, city leaders in Little Rock and Conway have grabbed their metaphorical picks and pans to join the gold rush, competing — apparently with each other — to land a $1 billion data center that’s being billed as one of the biggest economic development projects in Arkansas history.
The two cities have even offered to forgo two-thirds of the project’s property taxes for the next 30 years.
Despite the significant financial and environmental implications of this enormous project, the wrangling to land the data center is being done in secret, to the extent that Little Rock actually approved an annexation and rezoning needed for the project under a code name, Project Boar.
The absurdity wasn’t lost on Little Rock Planning Commissioner Jimmy Brown at a June hearing where the mystical data center ran into a buzzsaw of opposition: “We need to know what’s really going to happen because we have to think of the citizens of Little Rock … Just tell us what’s going on, guys.”
Secrecy is, of course, antithetical to democracy. It’s also antithetical to good public policy. But it’s not at all unusual in the aggressive competitions between localities to land economic development projects, where politicians with dollar signs in their eyes ignore the fact that the primary beneficiaries are large, profitable corporations that wind up escaping taxes they could easily afford to pay.
This is corporate welfare, on an industrial scale. And cities and counties across Arkansas and the nation are rushing to play the game so they’re not left out, often discounting legitimate questions about whether this competition is necessary or wise, or if the economic benefits are large enough to justify the tax subsidies being handed out.

In late April, Little Rock city directors met in special session to approve a “memorandum of understanding” with Willowbend Capital — a firm representing a secret data center owner — to allow for construction of a 300,000-square-foot data center along the Arkansas River at the Port of Little Rock, with an investment of $1 billion that would generate 50 jobs.
Earlier in April, the Conway City Council met in special session to approve a “memorandum of understanding” with Forgelight Ventures — representing a secret data center owner — to allow for construction of (wait for it) … a 300,000-square-foot data center along the Arkansas River on Lollie Road, with an investment of $1 billion that would generate 50 jobs.
Because of the secrecy, we can’t know for sure that this is the same project. But the two memoranda use similar language, and records from the secretary of state’s office show Willowbend and Forgelight were both incorporated by the same man, Michael Montfort, and share the same Little Rock address.
So it’s a good bet that Little Rock and Conway are competing with each other, and who knows how many other jurisdictions, for this project — no doubt delighting the mystery owner pulling the strings.
In their rush to win this race, both cities promised to forgo 65% of the property taxes that would be collected on the data center for 30 years, for the creation of just 50 jobs. They also agreed to extend this exemption to future expansions, a commitment that could stretch these tax breaks beyond the 2050s.
The cities would recoup some of the forgone revenue with a franchise tax on the massive amounts of electricity consumed by the data center, from which Entergy Arkansas and Conway’s city-owned utility, Conway Corporation, would also benefit. But that raises a separate set of issues about the potential impact increased electricity consumption would have on the environment.
Economic development has become a self-sustaining industry, and promoters argue that incentives given to secure projects are more than offset by the economic benefits they provide. In essence, in the case of the Little Rock and Conway data center projects, 35% of a loaf is better than no loaf at all.
But 35% of the loaf is not better than the whole loaf. This merry-go-round is based on the premise that incentives are the primary driver of facility location decisions, and localities that don’t offer them will miss out. But researchers who looked at the data found that 75% of the time, the company would have made the same decision without the incentives.
Factors such as location, real estate prices, and availability of workforce and infrastructure are more important drivers of these decisions. None of those factors are fixed by incentives, but they can be improved long term to make a community more competitive.
If Little Rock or Conway have the attributes the data center owner is looking for, the tax breaks could turn out to be an unnecessary giveaway; if they don’t, the tax breaks won’t do any good.
Companies that have already decided where to locate a facility also have a perverse incentive to create an artificial competition to extract more concessions from the locality they have already picked. And the secrecy they demand makes this impossible to detect.
There is also a question about whether, in the long term, the economic benefits generated by these new facilities outweigh the costs of the services they require and the incentives handed out to lure them. Researchers who have crunched the data have concluded they don’t, in part because companies awarded incentives frequently don’t follow through with the promises they made.
When Little Rock planning commissioners pushed for more details on the impact the data center might have on city finances, they were assured that even with the property tax abatement, the project would generate “millions” of dollars in taxes.
But when they pressed for details on the costs the city might incur for infrastructure and services needed for the data center, officials involved in the recruitment effort said those details weren’t available for a project that’s still theoretical — a catch 22 that frustrated commissioners and demonstrates why public entities negotiating deals in secret is so problematic.
“Give us the information and the data that we need to make an informed decision, not a ‘oh, well, you know, maybe one day somebody might do something cool here.’ That’s not what this should be,” Commissioner Jeremiah Russell said.
Because this mystery company demanded its identity be kept hidden, meaningful public input on the data center project is impossible unless and until a deal has been reached and unveiled by politicians, who will no doubt gush about all the jobs and economic largesse they’ve created.
At that point, how likely is it that those same politicians will willingly reverse course if the public raises legitimate concerns about the wisdom of the project or the fairness of the deal?
Economic development and recruiting new businesses to strengthen the economy are legitimate undertakings for local governments. The question, though, is whether that really requires negotiating tax breaks in secret and binding a jurisdiction to a corporate welfare scheme that stretches beyond the lifetimes of everyone involved. Or opening up the candy store to compete for these projects just because everyone else is.
It’s worth remembering that prospectors who rushed into the goldfields in haste often wound up with more regrets than gold.

(Photo courtesy Chesapeake Bay Foundation).Since the Chesapeake Bay watershed agreement was signed over a decade ago, more than 2,200 acres of oyster habitat in the bay stretching from Maryland to Virginia have been restored.
The tributaries fully restored in Virginia include the Lafayette, Piankatank, Great Wicomico, Lynnhaven, Lower York, and Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth rivers. The program has already expanded past the original goals with recent reef building projects taking place in Hampton River.
“The Chesapeake Bay is proud to be home to one of the most successful examples of oyster restoration in the world,”  Chris Moore, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia, said. “Now it’s time to keep the momentum going, not only for the health of our waterways but for the health of people, other species, and local economies.”
The Chesapeake Bay Program used historical data to find where oyster reefs had been in these tributaries in the past that were lost either to disease, over harvesting, or pollution. The oysters in these restored areas will not be for fishing but serve as a critical part of the bay’s ecosystem.
“Things like blue crabs, things like red fish, striped bass, all of those different species tend to spend some part of their life cycle or aggregate at different different times on oyster reefs,” Moore said.
Oysters also naturally filter the water to eat, which helps with cleaning the bay. Their reefs provide living shorelines that help maintain marshes that have been eroding over time. The marshes serve a critical role in not only housing habitats but protecting against flood waters.
The restoration of oyster habitats was already occurring before the 2014 watershed agreement. But the plan helps focus resources, both state and federal, into specific projects in the 10 tributaries. Now with the agreement concluding at the end of 2025 and a new agreement in the works, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation hopes to expand their reach with the oyster habitat restoration.
“Exceeding the oyster restoration goals in the current Bay Agreement is a testament to the power of the federal/state partnership and following a shared plan to save the Bay. To build on that success, it is critical that the next Bay Agreement include clearly defined targets for every goal — from water quality to oyster restoration — with a hard deadline of 2035,” said CBF senior policy director Keisha Sedlacek in a statement.
The new agreement will focus not only on restoring new tributaries for oyster reefs, but maintaining what has already been rebuilt. Communities and waterways that may have been left out in the original agreement will get a chance to propose projects in those areas. They also hope to expand the proposed additional 1,800 acres of habitat restoration in the draft and to set deadlines of 2035 to have better accountability for the goals in the agreement.
“Oysters are still a pretty small fraction of what they were historically. As we continue to refine our restoration techniques we think of new things like living shorelines and include oyster components as well,” Moore said. “This is an area where we can make big strides in Bay restoration, not only by increasing the number of oysters, increasing the amount of habitat out there for other fin fish species but also helping the Chesapeake Bay region become more resilient to climate change as well.”
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation is taking comments on the current draft of the updated watershed agreement through Sept. 1. They hope to expand the proposed additional 1,800 acres of habitat restoration in the draft and to set deadlines of 2035 to have better accountability for the goals in the agreement.

In June, Coleman Ferguson was driving home to Virginia Beach after seeing comedian Nate Bargatze at the Norfolk Scope when an idea took shape.
Ferguson said it irked him to make the trip to the Scope or across the bridge to the Hampton Coliseum to see major sports events or big indoor performances.
“I’ve seen it, talked about my whole life, and I’m like, ‘Why don’t we have it?’ And then, after my research, I’m like, ‘We should have an arena. We should have a sports team. This is just kind of silly,’” he said.
So Ferguson said he’ll do it himself.
He launched a website earlier this month with a vision for a 20,000-seat arena that would be made possible in part by crowdfunding from the community and wouldn’t rely on any money from the city.
The site includes several AI renderings of potential arenas, locations and even a mockup of uniforms for an NBA team – the Frogmen, tying it in with the region’s military pedigree.
Ferguson said he’s a big sports fan. Virginia Beach is one of the biggest cities — and Hampton Roads, one of the largest metro areas — without a major league sports team, despite the area turning out home-grown talent in just about every major sport.
Virginia Beach already has the 20,000-seat Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater, but Ferguson said an outdoor venue like that can’t attract the kinds of shows with big productions that major artists like Beyoncé are putting on now.
The 36-year-old told WHRO he has no experience with development or projects of this scale. He runs a wedding venue in Virginia Beach called Gala 417, as well as Superheroes Ice Cream near Lynnhaven Mall. He went to Princess Anne High School, got his GED and never went to college.
But he argues his passion for the project makes him the right person for the job.
“While everybody’s sleeping, I’m reading more articles. I’m reading how arenas generate revenue, reading about how sports teams relocated,” he said. “I sleep this project, I wake up and that’s all I do is I study and do everything that I can to learn more about this project and how I can make it happen.”
So how does someone with no backing make a big enough splash to move this forward? Get the community in on it.
Ferguson wants to sell shares to locals to raise $80 million, and then use that to secure bank loans.
“That way, they have skin in the game. That’ll make them want to attend events, and they could potentially make money off the profits that the arena makes, so to me, when you got that big of involvement, we can see the city really everybody getting behind it.”

He submitted his pitch to Virginia Beach’s economic development office.
He hasn’t started collecting any money yet — he’d have to file with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission to do the kind of stock sale in the business plan published online — but he said by mid-July he had more than $4 million pledged. Ferguson said what he’s envisioning will cost somewhere around $700 million to develop.
Attracting a major arena — and a professional sports team to fill it — has long been a dream for many in Hampton Roads. But despite multiple false starts, that particular white whale has never been reeled in.
Virginia Beach got as far as having a deal in place with a developer to build an arena at the Oceanfront in 2017, but the effort fell apart when the developer failed to secure financing.
Seven years later, Ferguson thinks it’s time to try again.
Ferguson blamed the need for public funding or tax incentives from the city for tanking previous efforts and said his project shouldn’t need them.
“I don’t think those really sat well overall. I think that put a lot of pressure on both parties involved, the city and the developers, and that’s why they’ve all kind of crashed and burned over time,” he said.
He has, however, been talking with the city about using city-owned property, he said. They’re discussing lots at the Oceanfront and at other “opportunity zones.” Ferguson said he’s also spoken with private landowners who have expressed interest.
Operating an arena without a permanent tenant like a sports team is possible. Ferguson points to Oklahoma City’s Paycom Center, which was open for six years before the Seattle SuperSonics became the Oklahoma City Thunder and relocated in 2008.
Ferguson said he’s reached out to two different NBA teams to discuss possible relocations, but he can’t say more due to non-disclosure agreements. He also said he reached out to the National Hockey League’s San Jose Sharks. The team’s lease on its arena in San Jose is ending.
His website — some of which Ferguson said was written by artificial intelligence applications — lists several “Sponsors and Partners,” including Dominion Energy and Mortenson, an international arena development company. A representative from Dominion said the company “is not involved in the project.” A representative from Mortenson said the same, though Ferguson insisted he had been in touch with someone from Mortenson since the project launched, though he couldn’t recall the person’s full name. A representative from the company later confirmed, “No one from our Sports group is in contact with Coleman Ferguson.”
Ferguson said that the list of companies, which also included international sports and music event company AEG, was intended to be aspirational and show the kinds of companies that could partner with the Virginia Beach Arena Project, not a listing of groups actually signed on.
He also said he moved on from Mortenson and is now talking to Manhattan Construction Group, which built AT&T Stadium in Dallas, where the NFL’s Cowboys play.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha has joined 21 other attorneys general and one governor in a federal lawsuit challenging part of Republicans’ tax cut and spending law that blocks funding to Planned Parenthood. 
Among the many provisions of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” law signed by President Donald Trump last month is a clause that blocks federal Medicaid funding for essential medical services such as cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing, and wellness exams-provided at Planned Parenthood health centers.
Nationally, this “Defund Provision” could affect at least 200 health centers and more than 1.1 million patients, according to the complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
The coalition is asking the court to stop the Trump Administration from implementing the provision, which it argued would lead to widespread disruptions in preventative care and increased health care costs if allowed to stand.
Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island provides essential health services to about 10,000 patients per year, and about 25% of those patients are Medicaid recipients.
“Rhode Island’s health care system is already in crisis, and this targeted funding cut will make it exponentially worse,” Neronha said in a statement. “Health care must be affordable and accessible for all Americans, and we will continue to fight against those who enact policies to the contrary.”
Neronha joins the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, as well as the governor of Pennsylvania, in filing the lawsuit.
The complaint names the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and its current leader, Dr. Mehmet Oz. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is the only signatory serving as governor.
The plaintiffs said the Defund Provision is likely to increase spending in Medicaid programs by $30 million over the next five years and $52 million over the next 10 years.
A May study from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health, found that other clinics for low-income patients lacked the capacity to absorb patients that get care from Planned Parenthood.

(Ethan DeWitt | New Hampshire Bulletin). When Frank Edelblut vied to lead the New Hampshire Department of Education in 2017, the confirmation process was far from amiable. Then-Councilor Andru Volinsky, a Concord Democrat, excoriated the nominee, deploying an easel and notepad to prosecute what he called Edelblut’s lack of experience with public schools. 
Eight years later, at the request of Gov. Kelly Ayotte, Edelblut is departing the agency after two terms as commissioner. And his likely successor is receiving a much different reception.
At an Executive Council hearing Tuesday, Caitlin Davis, Ayotte’s pick, received unusually warm endorsements from lawmakers, school leaders, and advocates across the political spectrum. Many of them welcomed the prospect of evenhanded, nonpartisan leadership at the state’s education agency. 
“Maybe you’ve figured it out, but the support today in the public hearing, both written and in testimony, is unanimous,” said Councilor David Wheeler, 90 minutes into the event. “No opposition.”
That praise has all but assured Davis’ confirmation to the role when the council takes a vote Wednesday. And it could herald a pivot for the state agency. Edelblut ran the department as an outsider, focusing on building up school choice options and turning a critical eye toward diversity, equity, and inclusion practices in public schools. Davis, a 15-year department employee and the current director of education analytics and resources, has embraced her position as a data-driven insider looking to execute lawmakers’ policies and keep the department running. 
“As I sit at this table with you today, I do so with the belief that a commissioner of a state agency is not a political platform,” she said. “It is a position of public trust and operational responsibility.” 
On Tuesday, that position earned her applause.
“I wouldn’t know what her political beliefs might be if she has them privately, because she simply does the work, providing information that’s needed to make decisions,” said Rep. Hope Damon, a Croydon Democrat and member of the Education Funding Committee.
The change in leadership comes at a crossroads for education in New Hampshire. In the years since Edelblut assumed office, the state made a number of conservative reforms to education, many championed by the commissioner. Lawmakers launched — then expanded, then made universal — the education freedom accounts program, allowing families to access state funding to pay for private and home schooling expenses. They sought and received federal funds to help double the state’s public charter schools, and passed a law regulating how educators can talk about race, gender, and oppression, which has, for now, been struck down by a federal court.
Today, many of those reforms are finished. And both Davis and her supporters have advocated for calmer, less politically charged leadership. 
“This role is an opportunity to bring stability and practical leadership to an agency that plays a critical role in the lives of our students and families across the state,” Davis said.
In her opening remarks, Davis promised to support both public education, which she noted is the education model for 90 percent of New Hampshire families, as well as other education pathways such as charter schools, home education, career technical education, nonpublic schools, “or a new alternative model yet to be developed.”
“We know that education is not one size fits all,” Davis said. “Every student has different strengths, challenges, and aspirations.” 
But Davis also drew a slight contrast between Edelblut’s leadership and her proposed approach. Edelblut styled himself as an innovator, Davis said, and continually invented programs to promote to students and schools, such as an AI tutoring program.
“I would like to spend a lot of time looking at some of those programs — understanding some of the ones that are working, some of the ones that are not working,” Davis said. 
She received an unlikely sweep of endorsements. A number of superintendents, including Rob Malay of Keene and John Fortney of Kearsarge, showed up in support. And Deb Howes, the president of the American Federation of Teachers of New Hampshire, said the organization backed Davis’ nomination, even as she pressed Davis to take teachers’ perspectives into consideration before changing major policies. 
“I would like to see the intentional seeking out of educator and community input before (new) rules are heard,” Howes said. 
Rep. Ken Weyler, the fiscally conservative Republican from Kingston who has long chaired the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee and the House Finance Committee, lauded Davis for transparency, particularly when it came to annual financial reports. Those became clearer when Davis began making presentations, he said.  
“For most of those semi-annual analyses of the department budget, the norm was evasive or incomplete information,” Weyler said. “The refreshing change came with Commissioner Frank Edelblut and then Caitlin Davis.” 
And Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and the chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, highlighted Davis’ attention to detail and proficiency in answering questions about the Department of Education’s budget. 
“I have worked very closely with Caitlin, and we ought to figure out a way to clone her 10 times over. She is a solutions-oriented person, and she’s not political, as we have been in the last several years here, and I think that’s really important.”
Though people in both parties endorsed Davis, there were ideological differences in what they hoped she would do in office.
Republicans and conservatives expressed hope that Davis would continue supporting alternative programs to public schools, with some councilors asking how she would promote them to New Hampshire families. 
Ladd also noted that New Hampshire is facing potential reductions in revenue in the coming years, and said Davis’ financial expertise could help the department manage with less. 
Progressives, teachers unions, and Democrats, meanwhile, asked for a more frequent seat at the table. Many have complained in the past that Edelblut did not often meet with them or consider their concerns. They said Davis could change that perception. 
“There’s a lot of district-level trust rebuilding that must happen based on historical interactions with our outgoing commissioner,” said Michaela Demeter, a member of the Dover School Board who said she was not speaking on behalf of the board. “I can’t stress enough how much I’m looking forward to building a good relationship between a new commissioner based on honesty and best intentions and asking questions.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7294197-Caitlin-Davis-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-30 05:56:44.720882

“It’s the most truthful and easiest thing to say that Oct 7th in Israel was horrific and all hostages must be returned, but so is the genocide, humanitarian crisis, and starvation happening in Gaza,” the Rome Republican posted on social media Monday.
The death toll of Israel’s war topped 60,000 Monday, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, with women and children reportedly making up around half of the dead. In recent days Gazans have been dying of malnutrition in what critics call a deliberate campaign of starvation on Israel’s part, a claim Israeli officials deny.




The United Nations’ definition of genocide:
In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

   Killing members of the group;
    Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
    Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
    Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
    Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.





Greene’s comments were in response to her House colleague, Florida Republican Congressman Randy Fine, who in a social media post called stories of malnutrition “Muslim terror propaganda.”
“Release the hostages. Until then, starve away,” Fine wrote.
Support for Israel was once a no-brainer for both parties, but support among the Democratic base has taken a nosedive since the war began in 2023 after the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an attack on Israel, killing 1,200 and abducting another 251.
A recent Gallup poll found 60% of U.S. adults expressing disapproval for Israel’s military action in Gaza compared with just 32% approving. Only 8% of Democrats and 25% of independents in the poll said they approved, while 71% of Republicans were in favor of Israel’s actions.
Still, skepticism of the war – and especially U.S. bankrolling of it – has taken hold among some prominent conservative politicians, especially Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, while conservative thought leaders and influencers like Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Theo Von and Joe Rogan have increasingly questioned Israel’s actions.
Greene is considered one of President Donald Trump’s most stalwart allies, though in recent weeks, she has publicly disagreed with the White House over topics including artificial intelligence regulations, funding for the war in Ukraine and whether to release the Epstein files.
Trump acknowledged the hunger crisis in Gaza on Monday, saying there is “real starvation” there – comments that represented a break from ally Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who had said Sunday that “there is no starvation in Gaza.”
On Tuesday, 43 Democratic senators, including Georgia’s Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock along with one independent, signed a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling for a large-scale expansion of humanitarian aid into the enclave.
State Rep. Ruwa Romman, a Duluth Democrat who is Georgia’s first Palestinian lawmaker, said she hopes Greene’s remarks will help put the plight of Palestinians into focus but also expressed puzzlement that she made them.
“I cannot speak to the Congresswoman’s motivations considering her past comments about Jewish, Muslim, and Arab community members,” Romman said. “Although this is attention grabbing, it’s another indicator that people oppose the genocide in Gaza. But, I hope people remember that Palestinians have been saying this for almost two years and moving forward will center the community impacted instead.”
Greene has faced criticism for statements and social media posts deemed Islamophobic – after Zohran Mamdani, a Muslim man, won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, she posted a picture of the Statue of Liberty dressed in a burqa – as well as antisemitic – she has been mocked as believing in “Jewish space lasers” after a 2018 post in which she suggested California wildfires may have been caused by a satellite owned by the Rothschild family.
Only a handful of sitting members of Congress have used the term genocide to describe Israel’s actions. Greene joins Democratic colleagues including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
Greene previously sponsored a resolution to censure Tlaib for comments opposing the war.
On Tuesday, Georgia Congressman Hank Johnson, a Lithonia Democrat who has long been a vocal critic of Israel’s actions, joined that cohort with his own statement condemning the killing.
“To date, the Israeli military has killed 62,000 people in the war on Gaza — the overwhelming majority being women and children — not Hamas fighters. Now, in addition to aid convoys, even churches where Christians are huddled for safety are being bombed. Meanwhile, the people of Gaza are literally being starved to death,” Johnson said in the statement.
“Silence is no longer an option. What is happening in Gaza is genocide. U.S. military support for genocide in Gaza must end. NOW!”
U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, an Atlanta Democrat who has pushed for more information about Israel’s plans to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, called the situation a “humanitarian crisis.”
“Nowhere in the world should children be dying of starvation or forced to live in the conditions the people of Gaza have endured,” Williams said in a statement Tuesday.
“This is a humanitarian crisis — one that deserves investigation and should be subject to the same level of scrutiny that Rep. Greene referenced. The focus of members of Congress should be how we resolve this crisis, bring all hostages home and reach lasting peace and stability in the region.”
The Recorder reached out to all members of Georgia’s House delegation Tuesday for comment.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
State regulations
As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Rapidly expanding school voucher programs pinch state budgets

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.











If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.


– Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution



The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like across the country?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/30/ct-tax-revenues-swell/,Legislators who watered down several initiatives in the new CT budget on the assumption finances weren’t as rosy remain frustrated.,"Connecticut’s coffers have continued to swell since the legislative session ended in early June — but now it’s too late for legislators to spend the money.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration recently reported tax revenues for the fiscal year that ended June 30 would be almost $400 million greater than it believed on June 4, when the General Assembly wrapped its regular 2025 session.
Coupled with revised estimates for federal grants, gaming receipts, fines, fees and other miscellaneous revenues, Lamont’s budget office now says Connecticut collected $420 million more in the fiscal year that ended June 30 than it had anticipated pre-June 4.
That’s more than double the $190 million post-session revenue surge the administration disclosed on June 20. And surging revenue just before the fiscal year closes on June 30 typically translates into extra revenue in the next year or two.
Legislators, who watered down several initiatives in the new budget they wrapped on June 4 — on the assumption finances weren’t as rosy — remain frustrated.
But an administration spokesman offered perspective Tuesday and said analysts made their best projections amid many unknowns.
“There remains significant international macroeconomic uncertainty over the past several years, including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, tariffs, wars and uncertainty in the stock market as a result of President Trump’s ever-changing economic policies,” Lamont’s budget spokesman Chris Collibee said, adding that “missing by a modest percentage with all that analysis is unremarkable.”
An extra $420 million represents a little less than 2% of General Fund revenues.
But given that more than three-quarters of Connecticut’s budget is largely fixed by contract or other legal obligations, $420 million or 2% can be huge.
Legislative leaders said they needed at least $75 million extra this fiscal year to begin bolstering long-neglected Medicaid payments to doctors who treat the poor. They settled for $15 million.
An $84 million increase in grants for K-12 schools to mitigate a special education funding crisis became $30 million.
And a $600-per-child state income tax credit aimed at hundreds of thousands of households, which would cost government about $300 million per year, was deemed unaffordable.
Lawmakers instead approved a flat, $250 credit — regardless of the number of children in a household — but only to families making about $67,000 per year or less. It will cost the state $35 million annually.
The latest surge also is happening while Lamont is sparring with state employee unions over raises.
Four bargaining units have broken off talks with the administration since July 2, arguing they either were offered no raise or a lesser increase than Lamont and the legislature granted state police troopers in mid-May.
That agreement authorized a 2.5% cost-of-living hike plus a step adjustment for all but the most senior workers. A step adds roughly 2 percentage points to the value of the raise.
And these last-minute revenue surges, legislative leaders say, happen too frequently.
Since Lamont took office in 2019, his budget staff has upgraded revenue estimates by an average of $304 million in the first 2 ½ months after lawmakers leave the Capitol.
It’s also more than three times the $92 million average gap lawmakers dealt with between 2011 and 2018 under then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, according to state budget records.
“It’s occurring year after year,” Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, told The Connecticut Mirror in late June. “It’s a pattern now.”
Administration officials note budget caps might have blocked more spending anyway, but lawmakers used several accounting maneuvers to work around those, often collaborating on them with the governor.
Democratic legislators aren’t the only ones concerned.
The House and Senate minority leaders Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford and Stephen Harding of Brookfield both have said unsuccessful GOP efforts to block tax hikes on corporations would have been aided by the knowledge that revenues already were on the rise.
Under the new budget, corporations will pay an extra $213 million in taxes over the next two years combined due to changes in income reporting and other rules. And a corporate tax surcharge that was supposed to expire would be extended to 2028, raising another $128 million over the coming biennium.
But even as corporate tax burdens rise, Connecticut closed the 2024-25 fiscal year with a projected $2.5 billion surplus, the second-largest cushion in state history and a windfall equal to almost 11% of the General Fund.
Chris DiPentima, president and CEO of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said that while he can appreciate “trying to be ultra-conservative” with revenue projections, asking corporations for an extra $340 million per year that appears unnecessary won’t help business confidence.
“Obviously we get concerned when there are business tax increases that are just going to a surplus as opposed to funding programs that are an absolute necessity,” DiPentima said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CANON-LAMONT-BIG-BILL-0707-DE-611-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-30 05:56:44.720882

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)News of a block in a Trump administration attempt to “defund” Planned Parenthood won’t impact a decision to close clinics in Southwest Ohio.
Two clinics in the Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region will still close, despite a federal judge’s ruling on Monday indefinitely allowing Medicaid reimbursements to continue to health clinics nationwide who provide abortion services. The ruling went against the Trump administration’s Congress-approved tax bill, which sought to end Medicaid payments to providers of abortion for a year.
The District Court judge in the case had already issued a preliminary injunction earlier in July saying the health clinic organization had a “substantial likelihood of success” on an argument that its equal protection rights and First Amendment rights were being violated.
The national Planned Parenthood organization have said the cuts to funding could mean closures of clinics across the country, even those who don’t provide abortion services.
Southwest Ohio to lose two health clinics over federal, state budget Medicaid cuts

Two clinics in Springfield and Hamilton were among those citing the Medicaid cuts as the reason they would be closing their doors. Those clinics did not provide abortion services, focusing instead on primary care services and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted infections.
Local clinics were preparing to tighten their belts when news of potential budget cuts started coming out of D.C. earlier this year, as the third anniversary of the overturning of Roe v. Wade came around as well.
Medicaid funding in Ohio was never used for abortion services, according to Nan Whaley, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio. When she announced the closure of the two clinics in her area in mid-July, she said the decision to cut the Medicaid funding specifically for clinics like the ones she leads was “driven by politics, not by public health” and “harms real people who already face immense barriers to care.”
The two clinics that do provide abortion services in that area, located in Dayton and Cincinnati, will remain open and still provide the same services, Whaley said at the time.
While the Southwest Ohio affiliate expressed relief at the court decision, a spokesperson told the Capital Journal on Monday it would not impact the closure decision.

“From the Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio perspective, unfortunately for many smaller affiliates, the risk of the federal government requesting back pay if the injunction expires is still too great,” said Maya McKenzie, communications manager for the Southwest Ohio clinics.
McKenzie said the first course of action the U.S. Department of Justice promised should they ultimately win the lawsuit was to request “fund repayment” from the organization.
“We’re trying to mitigate that risk to preserve our capacity to offer the other critical services southwest Ohioans and hundreds of patients from the South come to us for, that cannot be accessed anywhere else,” according to McKenzie. “In many states, and for affiliates operating in small communities like ours, we are the only option for folks seeking services like abortion and gender affirming care.”
The Southwest Ohio provider previously said no other closures are anticipated as a result of the funding reductions. No other Planned Parenthood affiliates in the state have announced closures due to the funding cuts.
The Greater Ohio affiliate of the organization said it will continue to accept Medicaid patients for certain services, adding that the federal decision “ensures that thousands of Planned Parenthood patients continue receiving necessary and life-saving care, and that Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio health centers can continue to provide public health services to our patients.”
The group will not be providing “long acting reversible contraceptives,” like the Nexplanon implant and intrauterine devices, “given the Trump administration’s position in the litigation that Planned Parenthood affiliates would have to pay back claims if the court’s order is reversed on appeal.”
“We will continue to monitor the case closely and make decisions on the care we can provide going forward, taking into account the financial risks to the organization,” the affiliate said in a statement to the Capital Journal.

In 2024, the Governor’s Energy Office commissioned a report detailing the capital investments needed to expand clean energy infrastructure and the existing efforts from the state. The report also looked at the potential risks to such investments and what state and federal programs could mitigate those. This information was gathered through the lens of trying to meet the state’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2040, which was recently enshrined into Maine law. 
The study behind the report was completed before President Donald Trump signed the federal budget reconciliation bill that phases out clean energy tax credits while making it cheaper to drill and mine for fossil fuels on federal land. The state energy office said it is too early to understand the full impact of that law on the clean energy financing landscape, but it is expected to slow the transition to renewable energy and create “significant uncertainty within Maine’s burgeoning clean energy economy.”
However, the report from the GEO is still useful for understanding Maine-specific challenges, potential solutions and other factors that could make large clean energy projects successful in the state. 
The report found that projects costing $5 million or more that are directly connected to the energy grid — such as onshore wind farms, hydropower facilities or utility-scale solar —  will be critical to meet the state’s goals and reduce price volatility for ratepayers. The public can download a draft copy of the findings and provide feedback to the Governor’s Energy Office by August 8. 
“Maine is at a pivotal moment in its clean energy transition,” the report says.
By 2040, Maine will need roughly 24,000 gigawatt hours of energy per year to meet the state’s power demand, and the report said the state is well-positioned to expand clean energy production thanks to its significant offshore wind potential and existing renewable resources like hydropower, onshore wind and solar. Currently, the state uses about 12,000 gigawatt hours of electricity annually.

The report also outlines the barriers Maine faces to building out clean energy projects and recommendations for how to overcome those. 
While there is federal uncertainty and roadblocks to developing more clean energy infrastructure under the Trump administration, including a pause on new wind permits, there are also a number of Maine-specific risks to investing in renewable energy in the state. 
Some of these challenges are beyond the scope of policy, such as Maine’s rural geography and limited construction season due to its short summers and harsh winters. 
There’s also the challenge of filling the construction jobs these clean energy projects require since Maine already has a workforce shortage, like many other parts of the country, worsened by an aging population. To build a 100 megawatt solar project, for example, would create about 1,100 construction jobs, whereas constructing a similar size wind farm requires about 400 workers, the report says. 
However, there are some barriers that have the potential to be overcome by policy changes. For example, Maine takes a home rule approach, leaving many decisions around land use, permitting and taxation up to local municipalities. That local control structure may provide flexibility for a town’s individual needs, but it also means there isn’t a centralized permitting process for clean energy projects. 
This means whether a community supports a clean energy project can help to stall or fast-track the process, the report says.
Additionally, large-scale projects need to work with the regional grid to assess the impact of connecting the new resources. ISO-New England, which operates the grid, has historically had a cumbersome process for these assessments; however, there have been recent efforts to streamline the process and make it more cost-effective. Since parts of the grid have relatively low interconnection volume, they can require cost-intensive upgrades that can make it difficult to bring new projects online.
Clean energy projects also come with high upfront costs and rely heavily on debt financing — securing debt against the project’s assets and cash flows — to fund the construction. That’s why state incentives and other mechanisms such as renewable energy credits are vital for creating favorable conditions for large-scale projects. 
The report outlines a handful of programs the state can turn to to financially support large clean energy projects. While there are benefits to using these funding mechanisms — such as creating new jobs and enhancing energy affordability — a significant portion of their resources have already been allocated.
For example, the Maine Technology Institute, which was founded by the Maine Legislature to provide grants, loans, and other investments to foster the state’s innovation economy, allocated $8 million to support certain electric grid upgrades. As of 2024, $6.5 million of that had been disbursed. A footnote in the energy office report also says that the program was active when it initiated the study, but as of this month, it has been moved to the “Completed Programs” page on the organization’s website and may no longer be available. The website also notes that the grants had to be used by March 2026.
After reviewing the risks and barriers associated with clean energy projects, the report also outlines a set of solutions to overcome those challenges. Some of those suggestions are aimed at supporting local communities and developers through technical assistance and state policies. Others want to streamline the procurement process and expedite project timelines to better incentivize the private sector and foster more competition among developers. 
For example, it suggests modifying the request for proposal (RFP) process for renewable energy projects through the Maine Legislature to allow for more timely procurements and minimize the potential of a project failing.

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)Only a dozen states have laws establishing suicide prevention offices or coordinators, and just 11 — including New Hampshire — have task forces or committees dedicated to suicide prevention efforts, according to a new report.
The report comes amid sweeping cuts at federal agencies that offer mental health support. They include significant slashes in staffing and funding at the nation’s largest mental health and substance use agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants to fold SAMHSA into his new Administration for a Healthy America.
Released last week, the report was conducted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials with support from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The analysis is part of an online resource breaking down details of suicide prevention efforts at the state level.
As of Jan. 1, just a dozen states had offices or state coordinators focused on suicide prevention: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia. Some states have these offices mandated by law and others were established through executive orders.
Eleven states (Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, and Washington) plus Puerto Rico have laws requiring a task force, commission, or advisory group focused on suicide prevention.
The report notes prevention efforts are most effective when they are focused on higher-risk populations, areas, age groups, and occupations. Suicide risk is higher among rural residents, older adults, American Indian and Alaska Native people, people with disabilities, veterans, and groups that identify with a sexual minority. The federal administration recently pulled the plug on LGBTQ+ specialized supports under the national suicide hotline, 988.
About 60% of states — 29 states and Washington, D.C. — have laws that establish some form of fatality review committees that specifically include suicide deaths in reviews. Areas of focus varied among the states. Some had statewide teams and others were on the local level, according to the report.
The report notes that another 11 states assign prevention responsibilities within other offices. Minnesota law, for example, assigns such tasks to the state commissioner of health, rather than toward a special suicide prevention office or coordinator.
In 2023, the nation saw 49,000 deaths by suicide, according to the CDC. Firearms are involved in more than half of suicides.

Four years after the Cleveland Indians announced they would change its name to the Guardians, many Ohio high schools have retained their Native-themed names and mascots.
More than 80 Ohio high schools have Native-themed names and mascots, according to an Ohio Capital Journal analysis of high school team names. The “Warriors” and “Indians” were the most common, followed by “Redskins” and “Braves.” 
“The fact that Ohio high schools still use mascots like Braves, it tells Native youth that their identity is still seen as a costume or a symbol as something not real and not human, it reinforces systemic disrespect, and it tells students — both Native and non-Native — that racism can still be rationalized,” said CC Hovie, a spokesperson for the Association on American Indian Affairs.

Ohio has the most high schools that use Native-themed names and mascots, said Homer Shadowheart, administrative and office manager at the Urban Native Collective in Cincinnati.
“It’s sad,” he said. “I think that part of the reason is that the original tribes that were here have been removed or killed, so they don’t think there are Natives here anymore, but we do live here. We are here.” 
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to all schools and districts with Native-themed names and mascots, but many did not respond by deadline. Those that did respond said they are not considering changing their team names. 
President Donald Trump recently called on the Cleveland Guardians and the Washington Commanders to change their team names back to the Indians and Redskins. 
The Cleveland Indians changed to the Guardians starting with the 2022 baseball season and the Washington Redskins changed to the Washington Football Team in 2020 before becoming the Washington Commanders in 2022. 
“When the Guardians changed their name, it was a significant step forward,” Hovie said. 
However, the Guardians and Commanders name change has not led to many Ohio high schools following suit. 
“I think it sends a troubling message that these profit-driven corporations can respond to public pressure and do the right thing, while public institutions, like schools, lag behind,” Hovie said. 
Some Ohio high schools have changed their nicknames.
Anderson High School in Cincinnati changed its nickname from the Redskins to the Raptors in 2021. Cincinnati Country Day School changed its mascot from the Indians to the Nighthawks in 2021, and Cuyahoga Heights High Schools in Cuyahoga County changed its nickname from Redskins to Red Wolves in 2022.
School districts response
Some Ohio schools have kept their team name, but changed their logo. 
“In the past 10 years the district has made an effort to move away from the official use of the Warrior head logo,” Lebanon City Schools Superintendent Isaac W. Seevers said in an email. “We adopted a new logo of an L with a spear and have not purchased uniforms or equipment with the Warrior head logo since the adoption of this new L-spear logo.”

Similarly, Olentangy High School in Delaware County updated the school’s logo during the 2020-21 school year, but kept the mascot name Braves, district spokesperson Amanda Beeman said in an email.  
Fairfield City School District in Butler County has not considered changing its name from the Indians, but the district has made some changes, Superintendent Billy Smith said. 
“For years, a student at the high school would dress as an Indian and lead our student section at our sporting events,” he said. “Prior to the start of the 2020-2021 school year, the district decided that this act would no longer be permitted.” 
Copley-Fairlawn Superintendent Aimee Kirsch said Indians was originally chosen as “a way to acknowledge and honor the Native peoples who inhabited the area prior to its settlement in the early 1800s.”
Bellefontaine City Schools School Board President Colin Yoder said the chieftain mascot “honors the legacy of the great war chief Blue Jacket, or Weyapiersenwah, leader of the seven nations of the Shawnee who once made their home in Logan County.”
Shadowheart and Hovie disagree. 
“We’re not honored,” Shadowheart said. “You’re trying to honor people who were removed from their homelands. You’re trying to honor people who were killed in their homelands? I don’t understand that because so many Native organizations and people have said that it’s not an honor.” 
Keeping the mascots is “continuing that erasure,” Hovie said. 
“These mascots are the legacy of a colonial mindset that fought to erase Native identity, so keeping them today isn’t honoring Native culture,” Hovie said.

‘Native people are not mascots’
Native-themed names and mascots are harmful, Hovie said. 
“We know Native names like Redskins are racial slurs,” Hovie said. “Even terms like Indians and Warriors, while seemingly neutral to outsiders, flattens hundreds of diverse Native nations into a single stereotype of violence and savagery and spiritual mysticism.”
Native-themed names and mascots are rooted in racism, cultural appropriation, and intentional ignorance, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) said in a statement released earlier this year. 
“Native people are not mascots,” the group’s President Mark Macarro said in the statement. “We have our own languages, cultures, and governments — our identities are not anyone’s mascot or costume. No political endorsement or misguided notion of ‘honoring’ us will change the fact that these mascots demean our people, diminish the enduring vibrancy of our unique cultures, and have no place in our society.”
The American Psychological Association called for the “immediate retirement of all American Indian” mascots and images by schools, athletic teams, and organizations in 2005. 
“Native people have been frozen in the past and reduced to this caricature of a romanticized savage or noble warrior, and were created by non-Native people to draw on those stereotypes of who Native people are, so even when they’re presenting as honoring Native people, they reduce rich diversity and contemporary people into a single, static stereotype image,” said Dr. Anna Fetter, a psychologist and researcher on Indigenous student mental health. 
Native-themed names and mascots are damaging to Native students and normalize stereotypes for non-Native students, she said. 
“They lower Native students’ self esteem,” Fetter said. “They reduce feelings of community worth, and they even limit how Native students see their possible futures and their academic futures. … It just creates a school climate where Native students feel less safe, they feel less seen and less valued.”
Ohio Legislation 
Back in 2021, former-Democratic state Reps. Adam Miller and Jessica Miranda introduced an Ohio House Resolution that called on schools to retire the use of  Native-themed names and mascots, but it only received sponsor testimony. 
“We cannot accept the continuing dehumanizing of people,” Miranda said in her testimony in 2022. “Some of these logos are far more egregious and offensive than ‘Chief Wahoo.’ It is not believable to say you are honoring a person by demeaning and belittling them.”
She said districts should have fun with finding a new mascot that matches the community’s history. 
“Most of these schools with Native American mascots have never thought of the imagery and its use as disrespectful,” Miranda said. “This is more about education. We need to teach the Native American story.”

Farmers can earn extra cash by leasing small sections of farms for power production. (Photo by Bill Clark/Getty Images)Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat, and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.
But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.
Wind power brings steady income for farms
Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.
For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around $3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.
Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

  States throughout the Great Plains and Midwest, from Texas to Montana to Ohio, have the strongest onshore winds and onshore wind power potential. These are also in the heart of U.S. farm country. The map shows wind speeds at 100 meters (nearly 330 feet), about the height of a typical land-based wind turbine. (Source: NREL)
These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.
Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads, and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.
In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property-tax payers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.
The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work, and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

Colleges in other states, including Texas, also developed training programs for technicians in recent years as jobs in the industry boomed. (Photo by Andrew Marszal/AFP via Getty Images)
The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations, and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.
Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar, or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.
Solar can cut power costs on the farm
Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers, and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.
Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics — dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.
Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.
However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.
Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.
What’s being lost
The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.
The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.
While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.
Renewable energy also powers rural economies
Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.
Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.
In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing — such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries — and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.
On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.
As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.

OVERLAND PARK — Kansas voters in a landslide Tuesday defeated a constitutional amendment that would have stripped residents of abortion rights, defying polling and political observers who expected a close result.
The ballot measure was failing by a 60-40 margin late Tuesday after voters responded to an intense and costly campaign marked by dubious claims by amendment supporters and the unraveling of protections by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Kansas lawmakers wanted to put one across on the state’s population so they could ban abortion. They didn’t just fail; they failed big.

TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas said a freeze on federal funding and change at the U.S. Agency for International Development left $340 million in lifesaving food grown in the United States sitting at domestic ports awaiting delivery to locations around the world where people were starving.
On Friday, President Donald Trump said he wanted to shut down USAID, which served as the federal government’s primary provider of development and humanitarian aid worldwide. Much of USAID’s funding has been frozen. Thousands of USAID employees expect to be indefinitely suspended or laid off as the Trump administration, in collaboration with billionaire Elon Musk, worked to gut an agency the president said was operated by “radical lunatics.”
Months before voting for a bill that kicks thousands of Kansans off Medicaid, Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran tried to preserve international food assistance. Good?

The rapid development of artificial intelligence has the potential to spur amazing advances in human society that are definitely worth pursuing.
That said, AI also has the potential to do dreadful harm that we must guard against.
As one of the nation’s tech leaders, OpenAI’s Sam Hartman, explained recently, for all of AI’s amazing potential, it’s also easy to envision a world in which foreign adversaries could use AI to take down the power grid, or break into financial institutions and steal wealth from Americans.
And it’s in light of this that North Carolina leaders should resist proposals from the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans to remove AI guardrails by eliminating safety and environmental regulations and prohibiting states from enacting consumer protections.
The bottom line: As Hartman admitted, there remains much we don’t understand about AI and a real possibility that it could cause society to quote “veer in a sort of strange direction.” Elected leaders should do all they can to maintain human control over this powerful technology.

Another officer lost in the line of duty. Another wave of heartbreak for a community shattered. 
And once again, as we grieve, the same lawmakers line up at the podium to offer their “thoughts and prayers” as if the cycle hasn’t become grotesquely familiar.
But Ohioans aren’t asking for sympathy anymore. We’re asking for change. And for that, we need to call out the legislative doublespeak happening in plain sight.
Ohio lawmakers re-file bill restricting local law enforcement from cooperating with federal agencies

Even as they mourn tragedies, the Ohio state GOP is pushing legislation that will make our communities less safe. 
The Second Amendment Preservation Act, currently making its way through the legislature, is a perfect example of political posturing disguised as principle. 
If passed, this law would prohibit local agencies from participating in the enforcement of federal gun regulations. That means agencies could use federal tools like ballistics databases but not assist federal investigations — despite those tools being inherently federal. 
The result? Legal confusion, paralyzed enforcement, and chaos for prosecutors who face $50,000 civil penalties simply for doing their jobs.
The language in this bill is so vague it could even prevent prosecutors from pursuing justice in violent cases involving guns. And it doesn’t stop there: joint task forces that combat gun trafficking, organized crime, and drug networks would be disrupted. 
The very partnerships that make communities safer would be torn apart.
This isn’t a theory… it’s a warning from law enforcement itself. 
Officers and police chiefs across Ohio have spoken out against this bill, saying it endangers their ability to keep people safe. 
When those responsible for public safety say this bill is harmful, elected leaders should listen. Instead, they ignore the testimony of survivors, families, and law enforcement professionals in favor of gun lobbyists and party talking points.
If legislators cared about protecting Ohioans, they’d invest in proven, evidence-based solutions like safe storage laws, extreme risk protection orders, and community violence intervention programs. These approaches save lives. They respect the Second Amendment while holding dangerous individuals accountable.
But that’s not what we’re getting. We’re getting empty gestures. We’re getting the same soundbites every time a tragedy unfolds — “thoughts and prayers,” followed by legislative silence or worse, active harm.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Gun violence is now the number one cause of death for children in America. That horrifying reality should jolt every lawmaker into action. Instead, they keep passing bills that ignore our cries and bury our dead.
Let me be clear: no one is asking to take guns away from responsible, law-abiding citizens. 
What we are asking is simple — basic safeguards, accountability, and the courage to stand up to extremism.
We deserve leaders who do more than mourn. We deserve leaders who act.
And until that happens, Ohio will continue to suffer, not because we lack solutions, but because some lawmakers have chosen politics over people.

The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.










They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that … all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party.


– Justin Mcelwain, Pittsburg, Kan., resident


Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
 ‘Not a bumper sticker bill’

The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

Nevada House Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline.)In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
 Democrats ‘fight back’

This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.

  The headquarters of the Crawford County Democratic Party in downtown Pittsburg, Kan. (Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline.)In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers  from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
‘A scarlet letter’: States aim to end stigma of doctors seeking mental health care

“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture where officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, though most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.

Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health issues in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health issues.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would negatively affect an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers also disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that –– to provide those services,” Archbold said.

Hawkins said he believes Franklin is truly sorry and deserves a second chance. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)At-large Prince George’s County Councilmember Calvin Hawkins II believes in second chances.
He’s led a career marked by overcoming past mistakes, and now he hopes to play a role in a “comeback story” for an old colleague: former At-Large Councilmember Mel Franklin, who he hired as his new chief of staff earlier this summer.
Franklin’s hiring comes weeks after he was released early from a one-year sentence for a criminal scheme to steal campaign funds to cover personal expenses — and the efforts taken to hide his actions. He resigned from the council last year before later pleading guilty to charges of felony theft and perjury, and was sentenced in November to five years in prison with all but one suspended and three years probation.
Hawkins (D-At Large) did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but said in a statement Tuesday that he chose to hire Franklin after speaking with him recently and finding that “his contrition was sincere and evident.”
“His call to serve still shone brightly,” Hawkins’ statement said. “In that moment, I was moved to offer him the role as my Chief of Staff.”
A county council spokesperson said Franklin assumed the position on July 14 at a salary of $72,000.
Franklin also did not respond to an interview request. But in a July 22 post to his Facebook account, he announced that he had accepted the position as Hawkins’ chief of staff.
“I look forward to this new opportunity to serve,” he wrote. “Thank you [Councilmember] Hawkins! #SoGrateful #SoBlessed.”
In a post a month earlier, on June 18, Franklin wrote that he was grateful to be released in time to attend his son’s graduation ceremony.
Hawkins said in his statement that Franklin “hit the ground running.”

“Mel is back with a new passion, a new vision, and a new commitment to serving our incredible county,” Hawkins said. “I am proud to play a part in his comeback story.”
Not everyone in the county agrees with Hawkins’ show of faith.
“The humane side of me said, I know he needs a job,” said LaVonn Reedy Thomas, a member of the organization Citizens for Accountability in Governance. “But the taxpayer side of me, the political side of me, the professional side of me said, absolutely no way. Are you kidding me? I felt like it was an insult.”
Thomas, who has lived in the county for 46 years, said that what Franklin did “wasn’t a mistake.”
“What Mel did was a choice,” said Thomas, who worked eight years for former County Executive Rushern Baker. “He was not new to politics.”
“It’s cronyism,” she said. “For me, what this does is it opens up another conversation about corruption in Prince George’s County.”
The charges against Franklin stemmed from an almost decade-long scheme to use campaign funds to pay for personal, and often luxurious, expenses, prosecutors said.
Franklin had held one of the county’s two at-council seats for six years, and had been the 9th District council member for eight years before that, when he resigned suddenly on June 14, 2024. Six days later, the Maryland State Prosecutor announced charges against Franklin of embezzlement, felony theft scheme and perjury for siphoning off funds from the bank account of his campaign committee, “Friends of Mel Franklin,” to pay for expenses not related to his position on the council.
From 2014 through 2023, the prosecutor’s office said in a November statement, Franklin stole more than $130,000 from the campaign committee to pay off personal debt and cover expenses including international trips, personal hotel stays, dinners, and cosmetic procedures for himself and a close friend.
In addition to his one-year prison sentence, he was also ordered by Anne Arundel County Circuit Judge Mark W. Crooks to pay back $133,168.67 for the funds he took
“Elected officials should be held accountable if they violate the public trust and exploit the Maryland electoral process for personal financial gain,” Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III said in a statement after Franklin pleaded guilty last August.
In a letter to Crooks on Nov. 3, Franklin apologized for the embarrassment he caused his family, for betraying the trust of those who donated to his campaign and for violating the trust of the county residents who elected him to the council.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But, Franklin wrote at the time, he did not believe that the “violations of the public trust” he committed were the end of his story.
“I will work every day to rebuild the trust that I destroyed for so many people who believed in me,” he wrote.
The case was not the first legal trouble for Franklin, who pleaded guilty in 2017 to driving under the influence in a crash that injured two people — and damaged the government-owned car he was driving. He damaged a different government-owned vehicle in two separate crashes in 2012.
Hawkins, a self-described “citizen’s advocate with a heart for the underdog,” wrote in his statement that he believes in redemption after being offered a second chance himself years ago following his own “transgression with the law.”
In 1983, he was arrested and later sentenced to five years in prison for armed robbery. Years later, while he was working for the county government, he was accused of sexually harassing a colleague in 2008. The allegations led to the county paying about $150,000 in damages and fees to Tonya Hairston, the colleague, according to a 2018 report from The Washington Post.
Having served alongside Franklin as one of the county’s two at-large councilmembers from 2018-2024, Hawkins said that he has been a trusted friend for the last 25 years.
“I know his heart and his character. Mel is deeply remorseful and knows he made a terrible mistake,” Hawkins said. “He owned up to it, apologized and has paid his dues. Now it’s time for his second act.”

Cummings Courthouse in downtown Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The hiring of an employee in the Baltimore City Office of the Register of Wills has been referred to the State Ethics Commission for review, according to the Office of Legislative Audits.
The audit released Tuesday highlights several concerns related to hiring and spending on promotional materials, including a television program that never aired, as well as spending patterns that raised concerns the office split orders to avoid thresholds requiring competitive bidding and approval by the Office of the Comptroller.
“Our review did not identify any matters that warranted referral to the Office of the Attorney General – Criminal Division but did identify matters that we referred to the State Ethics Commission as well as deficiencies with procedures and controls over procurement and human resource activities,” Legislative Auditor Brian S. Tanen wrote.
Register of Wills Belinda K. Conaway, in nearly identical written responses, disputed each allegation, calling each finding “unsubstantiated.” Each reply was no longer than three sentences long.
Conaway did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Tanen wrote that, “Due to the lack of specificity in the response, it is unclear what specific information the Office asserts is unsubstantiated and how it intends to address any decisions from the State Ethics Commission that result from the above noted referral.”
The review by Tanen’s office was triggered by an unnamed whistleblower who made allegations of “questionable procurement and payroll practices,” according to the report.
Conaway was first elected to the office — one previously held by her mother, Mary Conaway — in 2014. Her father, Frank Conaway Sr., served two terms in the House of Delegates and nearly two decades as Baltimore City Clerk of the Court. Belinda’s brother, Frank M. Conaway Jr., has served in the House of Delegates since 2007.
Every county and the city has a register of wills office responsible for overseeing matters of estates, and for the collection of inheritance taxes. Registers of wills are elected, and while the offices are associated with the court system, they are overseen by the state comptroller.
Questionable hiring and payroll practices
The auditors’ review covered the period from Jan. 1, 2017, to Oct. 24, 2024, as well as looking at payroll activity for two unnamed employees between November 2024 and March 2025.
Tanen wrote that auditors were able to substantiate claims involving those two employees.
One, who had been hired in 2015, was paid a salary of $106,000 at the time of the audit, but was routinely not at work. They said they could not determine how often the employee came into the office.
“We attempted to locate the employee during several site visits, however the employee was not at the Office,” the audit said. “We subsequently requested sign-in sheets for the days in question and noted the employee was on leave on each of the days in question.”
A review of publicly available records showed the employee owned and operated a company that provided professional services “to the management employee who directly hired the employee,” auditors wrote. That company continued to provide services to the employee, and that relationship was not disclosed on annual financial disclosure forms, according to the report.
Auditors did not identify the employee, manager or company involved in the allegation.  Conaway’s office could not provide documentation to support hiring the employee.
Auditors referred the issue to the State Ethics Commission, noting that state law “prohibits an employee from having any other employment relationship that would impair the impartiality and independent judgment of the employee.” Additionally, the hiring of an employee who also has an “outside business relationship” with the hiring manager, coupled with a lack of documentation “could potentially violate prestige of office provisions in State Ethics law,” according to the report.
In another instance, auditors found Conaway’s office improperly paid an employee for holidays and leave totaling 205 hours. Auditors said the payments made in four pay periods between June 2022 and January 2023 occurred after the employee left the office and took a job in the state Department of Budget and Management.
Auditors said Conaway’s office should have asked for the money to be returned, or sent the matter to a state collections department, but it did neither.
Manicure sets and unaired infomercials
Auditors also substantiated allegations that Conaway’s office spent more than $1 million on questionable promotional materials, including payments of nearly $200,000 to create an “informational television show that was never aired.”
“The Office did not evaluate public interest in the show until after the funds were expended to produce it,” auditors wrote. “This is significant because subsequent evaluations by the Office disclosed that there was not sufficient interest to warrant broadcasting the show publicly, resulting in the waste of the amounts paid to produce the show.”
In another case, auditors found Conaway’s office bought 500 manicure sets for $1,300. The sets were embossed with the words “Where there’s a will, there’s a way” — a catchphrase used by Conaway’s office — but did not include any contact information for the office.
Auditors said Conaway “could not provide documentation that it had monitored the results of these efforts to ensure the desired outcomes were achieved and that they were effective uses of State funds.”
They said the spending was out of line compared to other Registers of Wills offices similar in size to Conaway’s. Each of those three offices said they spent nothing for public service announcements, and little on promotional items.
One unnamed office reported spending $2,500 per year on pens and calendars. A second said it spent $250 on pens. The third reported it did not purchase any promotional items.
Split purchases may have circumvented procurement law
Auditors also investigated allegations that Conaway’s office bought goods and services from vendors with connections to “office management.”
Those allegations could not be proven, but auditors did note concerns about $2.3 million in payments for goods and services, each valued at $5,000 or less — an amount that would have triggered a more formal procurement process and approvals from the comptroller’s office.
Of 1,749 purchases by Conaway’s office totaling $2.6 million between January 2017 and October 2024, auditors found that 98.6% were valued at $5,000 or less. A closer examination of a sample of 75 payments to 13 vendors, totaling $268,000, found that all but one could have been consolidated.
Auditors noted 23 payments to one vendor for media and production services in 2019 totaling more than $66,000 but each payment was less than $5,000. Some “payments appeared to have been artificially split to keep the procurements at or below $5,000,” the auditors wrote.
In one case, they said the office split an $8,300 purchase for promotional items in two, both made on the same day, each less than $5,000.
And those purchases add up. Auditors said 339 purchases to just 12 vendors totaled $1.2 million over the nearly seven-year review period.
“Office management personnel advised us that they could not remember how these vendors were selected and could not document any competitive procurement process for the goods and services,” auditors wrote. “We were advised that the management employee was heavily involved in the Office’s procurements, approved most of the invoices for payment, and signed most of the related checks.”
State regulations require vendor bids for purchases above $5,000 and prohibit artificially dividing procurements to circumvent the bidding process, the auditors wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC09016-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-30 00:57:11.069062

“This critical moment in public education demands strong leadership with unwavering focus on student success,” State Superintendent Carey Wright said in a statement. “Throughout their professional lives and State Board service, Dr. Michael and Dr. Goldson have exemplified excellence in their commitment to our students, educators, school leaders and families.”
Meanwhile, two new members participated in their first meeting Tuesday.
James C. Bell Jr., of Talbot County, works as the director of instruction, academic support and community well-being for Building African American Minds (BAAM). Before that, Bell was a math teacher and assistant principal in Talbot County schools, before becoming a principal and supervisor of student services in Dorchester County.

Bell replaced former board member Joan Mele-McCarthy, who served her last meeting in June.
The board’s new student member is O’Marie Barnes, a rising senior at Crossland High School in Prince George’s County who founded the nonprofit Barnes and Scott Youth At Law, which seeks to provide youth with resources to pursue careers in law, public policy and government.
Because the board currently has 13 members, the governor will need to appoint one more person to replace former board member Clarence Crawford, who resigned a year early.
The board is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss the fiscal 2026 budget and the uncertainty of funding from the federal government, which temporarily froze $6.8 billion to schools nationwide. Those funds, for support for migrant education and low-income students, and various programs in adult education and literacy, started to be released this week. Maryland officials had estimated that state schools could lose $125 million in federal aid compared to last year if the funds remained frozen.
Wright said Tuesday some funding will receive slight increases but others, such as Title IV, which includes after-school programming, will receive 10.5% less.
“So overall, we are receiving less money from the federal government this year than we did last year, and that information has been transmitted to all of our [school] districts,” she said.

The foundation’s board of directors last week announced the appointment of Janice Thomas as president and CEO of the group established in 1944. The board had voted on June 18.
Thomas, who led the foundation’s finance and operations functions since 2013, became the first Black woman to lead the foundation.
“In the tradition of my predecessors throughout Meyer’s 80-year-history,” Thomas, of Prince George’s County, said in a statement, “I am honored to lead the Foundation with humility, imagination and a profound belief in the collective power that has always existed in our region.”
Thomas replaces George L. Askew, who was appointed in 2022. He was Prince George’s deputy chief administrative officer for health, human services and education. He provided oversight of several county departments and helped to conduct briefings and other health updates during the COVID-19 pandemic.
‘Dr. K’ joins health department accreditation nonprofit
A former deputy secretary at the Maryland Department of Health will now serve on a board for the nonprofit responsible for the agency’s public health accreditation.
The Public Health Accreditation Board announced that Dr. Nilesh Kalyanaraman, the former deputy secretary of public health services, was appointed to the nonprofit’s board of directors last week, along with three other appointees who will serve 18-month terms on the board. Their terms started July 1.
“PHAB is honored to welcome this exceptional group of leaders to our Board of Directors,” Colleen Svoboda, chair of the PHAB Board, said in a written statement. “Their expertise, leadership, and commitment to PHAB’s standards of excellence and accountability for public health will strengthen our ability to meet today’s challenges and implement our bold vision for the future.”
In June, Kalyanaraman stepped down from the state health department, which is trying to pull itself out of a series of controversies and challenges. At the time of his departure, Kalyanaram did not indicate where his next steps would take him.
PHAB is responsible for accrediting state, local and tribal health departments across the United States. This includes Maryland as well as a dozen local health departments in the state.
PHAB initially accredited the Maryland Department of Health in 2017. In November, the department celebrated its retention of accreditation when it was renewed last year.
Kalyanaraman was quoted at the time in the department’s announcement of its accreditation renewal.
“Maintaining our accreditation reflects the hard work and dedication of our team of public health professionals,” he said then. “The reaccreditation highlights the Department’s commitment to promoting healthier communities, improving health outcomes, and advancing health equity throughout the state.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Monica-Goldson-and-Joshua-Micheal-7-23-2024-cropped-e1753834868450-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-07-30 00:57:11.069062

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Agriculture)Maryland has joined 20 other states and Washington, D.C., in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s demand for personal information of those who are part of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP.
The lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in California, comes before a department-issued Wednesday deadline for states to release data on the tens of millions of people who receive food assistance. Some of the information sought from the last five years includes Social Security numbers, dates of birth and members of a household.
On Thursday, the agency released a Privacy Impact Assessment to expand personal information to also include immigration, employment and marital status. Agriculture Department guidelines say states that don’t comply could face the withholding of federal funds.
“USDA’s attempt to collect this information from Plaintiff States flies in the face of privacy and security protections in federal and state law,” according to the suit. “USDA makes this demand for the stated purpose of detecting ‘overpayments and fraud.’ Instead, the move appears to be part of the federal government’s well-publicized campaign to amass enormous troves of personal and private data, including information on taxpayers and Medicaid recipients.”
The lawsuit names the agency, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins and the agency’s Office of Inspector General as defendants whose conduct is “unlawful” and “unconstitutional.”
Although residents without legal status are not eligible to receive SNAP benefits, U.S.-born children of immigrant parents, regardless of status, are eligible.
In Maryland, the state Department of Human Services estimates more than 680,000 residents rely on the benefits commonly known as food stamps. About 270,000 of those are children.
Maryland gets one court win, joins two more suits against Trump administration

Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) said in a statement from his office that Maryland receives about $1.7 billion annually for the program.
“Both federal and state law prohibit Maryland from disclosing personally identifying SNAP data unless strictly necessary for the administration of the program, or in some other very limited situations,” the statement said. “Those circumstances do not exist here.”
A USDA spokesperson said in an email Tuesday morning the agency “will not comment on pending litigation.”
In a May 6 memo, the agency said it was requesting the personal information under a March executive order by President Donald Trump (R), “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos.”
Some states with Republican governors such as Alaska will adhere to the federal government’s request, according to the Alaska Beacon, which is part of States Newsroom.
Rollins wrote in a July 9 letter that the policy seeking personal data “eliminates bureaucratic duplication and inefficiency and enhances the government’s ability not only to have point-in-time information but also to detect overpayments and fraud.”
The California attorney general’s office in the lead agency in the lawsuit that, in addition to Maryland and the District of Columbia, includes Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin.
Meanwhile, Maryland is part of a similar lawsuit about private information filed earlier this month against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The suit seeks to block “unfettered access” by the Department of Homeland Security to personal health data of Medicaid recipients.
A health department spokesperson has said the agency is in full compliance with the law to ensure funds are not misused.

(Photo courtesy NIOSH)A mobile unit that provides free black lung screenings to coal miners is up and running again this month after federal cuts led to the service’s pause earlier this year, according to a news release from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The mobile testing unit — run by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health — will offer screenings beginning in North Central West Virginia this week and finishing in Western Maryland at the end of next month. Stops are scheduled;

8 a.m. – 4:30 p.m. from Tuesday, July 29, to Thursday, July 31, at the National Mine Rescue Association’s Post 5 Mine Rescue Contest at Mylan Park (500 Mylan Park Lane, Morgantown, W.Va., 26501)
8 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. on  Aug. 5 at the Price Cutter in Mannington (1 Rainbow Plaza, Mannington, W.Va., 26582)
8 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. on Aug. 27 at the Grantsville  Volunteer Fire Department (178 Springs Road, Grantsville, Md., 21536)

While appointments are recommended, they’re not required.
All coal miners — current and former, and from any part of a mine — are encouraged to take advantage of the free health assessments, which include a black lung screening as well as tests to analyze general lung health. All reports and screenings are confidential.
Assessments take about 30 minutes and include a work history and respiratory questionnaire, a chest X-ray, a blood pressure screening and a spirometry breathing test. Participants should receive results in eight to 10 weeks, the CDC release said.
These screenings are crucial to helping with the early detection of black lung disease. Earlier detection of black lung allows miners to practice better mitigation, which can help slow the disease from progressing into more complicated and debilitating forms.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThere is no cure for black lung. Experts say the best treatment is minimizing exposure to dangerous silica dust.
If miners receive a black lung diagnosis — either from the NIOSH mobile unit or another health care provider — they may qualify to apply for a Part 90 transfer through the federal Coal Mine and Safety Act of 1969. Part 90 transfers allow miners to relocate to a less dusty part of a mine without facing negative consequences like a cut in hours, pay or other retribution from mine operators.
NIOSH is the only entity qualified to certify X-ray results that are submitted as part of a Part 90 transfer request.
Earlier this year, NIOSH was a target for cuts by DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency. All employees within the agency’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program — which oversees the mobile unit as well as the certification of black lung X-rays — were put on administrative leave in April with permanent firings initially scheduled for June and July.
In late April, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of a West Virginia coal miner against the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Harry Wiley, the lead plaintiff on the suit, had been diagnosed with black lung in November 2024. Because of the federal cuts, Wiley was unable to receive a response to his Part 90 transfer request or have his X-ray results certified by NIOSH, leaving him further exposed to silica dust that is known to worsen his condition.
In May, attorneys successfully argued that the federal government’s cuts were in violation of congressionally mandated rights afforded to Wiley and other coal miners in similar situations.
On May 13, U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction in the class action case that ordered the “full restoration” of services at NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division, which houses the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program.
The federal government issued a certification to the federal court on June 2 testifying that employees were back at NIOSH in both the RHD and the CWHSP. At that time, however, more work remained to get the mobile unit back on the road. This month’s screening dates are the first to occur since the federal cuts took place.

The answer to that question depends on whom you ask.
While the law makes upward of $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, it unexpectedly did not repeal portions of a Biden administration rule meant to make children’s health insurance (CHIP) programs like Florida’s operate more like Medicaid by banning eligibility waiting periods and enrollment lockouts. 
The rule also requires a smooth transfer of children from Medicaid to the CHIP program to ensure none fall into a health care coverage gap.
“I think nobody knew this would happen, per se. It was very clear Republicans were trying to repeal this regulation,” Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families and a Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy research professor, told the Florida Phoenix. “So, here we are.”
Florida statutes require children whose families voluntarily drop their private coverage to go uninsured for two months before applying for Florida’s CHIP program, which operates under the Florida Kidcare moniker. Florida Kidcare also has a 30-day waiting period before children can re-enroll after missing a monthly premium. The policies are set in statute and put the state out of compliance with federal requirements, Alker said.
A different point of view
Her take differs from top Florida Healthy Kids executives. Florida Healthy Kids helps administer Florida Kidcare.
“There hasn’t been any change in federal law, policies, or internal operational activities that affect or can shape the projections in any way. And our review of federal law includes HR 1, the ‘Big Beautiful Bill Act,’ and there is nothing in the bill that would have any impact on the Kidcare program,” Jeff Dykes, chief financial officer for Florida Healthy Kids. told Amy Baker, the state’s top economist, during a July 16 meeting.
Baker, though, questioned Dykes’ analysis, noting that the law does give states the option to retroactively cover for 45 days the health care costs of a CHIP-eligible child who hasn’t been enrolled in the program.
Florida Healthy Kids Chief Operating Officer Suzetta Furlong backed Dykes’ point of view. Although she acknowledged it was still the “early days” of understanding the new federal law, she said, “What we looked at so far, we don’t think there’s anything that’s going to change the way we do current business.”
Alker questions whether the Trump administration will enforce the new requirements.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Florida Kidcare is an optional Medicaid expansion program for children whose families earn too much to qualify for the traditional Medicaid program. Congress set up the program in 1997 and agreed to pay states roughly 15 percentage points more than the traditional Medicaid match rate. The Florida Legislature agreed to establish the Florida Kidcare program a year later, and the federal government pays about 69 cents of every dollar spent on the program.
State laws requiring waiting periods were put in place more than 25 years ago, well before passage of the Affordable Care Act.
The policies were meant to address “crowd out,” or the idea that the people drop their private policies to enroll in other subsidized health care programs.
Florida’s coverage gap for children transitioning from Medicaid to Florida Kidcare is administrative-related: The Department of Children and Families determines whether children are Medicaid-eligible and forwards that information to the Agency for Health Care Administration, which administers the Medicaid program. DCF refers children who don’t qualify for Medicaid, or who lose their eligibility, to Florida Healthy Kids.
Dykes has previously said it’s a 60-to-90 day process to move a child from Medicaid to Kidcare, which means children go without health care for up to three months.
“We know that Florida has openly said that children simply can’t get from Medicaid to CHIP without a gap in coverage. And that’s not right. That’s something the state needs to fix ASAP,” Alker said. “It’s the only state we know of where it’s literally impossible to get from one program to another.”
An easy fix, Alker said, would be for the state to take advantage of the 45-day retroactive eligibility option.
St. Petersburg resident Jordan Elmore’s son, Logan, was without health insurance coverage when he transitioned from MediKids to the Florida Healthy Kids in March when he turned five.


Medikids and Florida Healthy Kids are both components of the Florida Kidcare program. But Medikids is for children aged 1-4 and the benefits provided to enrollees mirror those in the Medicaid program.

Florida Healthy Kids covers children five and older. FHK benefits aren’t as rich as those offered in Medikids.

Elmore recalls a case worker telling him in late January or early February that Logan would age out of  Medikids when he turned five in March. But their case worker resigned soon thereafter and he recalls “everything blew up.”

There were calls to Florida Healthy Kids and the Agency for Health Care Administration regarding Logan who went without coverage for half the month of  March and had  therapy appointments canceled.

“Nothing was consistent, there was no good information and ultimately it all meant nothing because it was all wrong,” Elmore said of the back and forth information that FHK and AHCA provided him and his wife.

In that time Elmore said he worried that something would happen that would require Logan to see a physician.

“Anywhere we would have gone for an emergency or just a cold needing medicine, we wouldn’t have been able to get anything. We would have had to pay out of pocket.”

 Legal update

In 2023, the Republican-led Florida Legislature agreed to expand the number of children eligible for Florida Kidcare by taking income-eligibility limits from 200% of the federal poverty level (or $64,300 for a family of four) to 300% of the FPL, or about $96,450 annually for a family of four.
The Biden administration approved the expansion  with the caveat that Florida abide by another federal requirement that prevents the state from dropping eligible children from the program for nonpayment of premiums. The Biden administration also notified state Medicaid on notice they could lose federal funding if the state didn’t stop removing eligible children from the program for non payment of premium.
The DeSantis administration didn’t accept the conditions and took the Biden administration to court, alleging the eligibility 12 month continuous eligibility requirement “amounts to a backdoor expansion of no-cost health insurance that was never authorized by Congress.”
Federal officials warn Florida over KidCare battle

Eligibility is determined annually, and the state has argued that the mandate could require it to keep children in families that don’t pay premiums on the program for months.
The DeSantis administration and the new Trump administration have agreed to put the suit on hold with a federal judge this month agreeing to stay the litigation until Sept. 12 at the request of both the DeSantis and Trump administrations. 
Florida Kidcare had been dropping from the program children in families that have missed premiums. Florida Kidcare marketing director Ashley Carr did not respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for information about whether children were continuing to be dropped from the program.

This is about immigrants who are members of Black and brown communities.,"The criminalization of Black and brown communities has distorted our nation’s narratives.  The most recent iteration – the arrest and detention of individuals by ICE in places of work and of worship – must be recognized as a pattern and practice. 
In 1890, Louisiana passed the Separate Car Act barring Blacks from sitting in white railway cars and barring whites from sitting in Black railway cars.  Homer Plessy, who was 7/8’s white and 1/8 Black, was 30 years old when he purchased a ticket on June 7, 1892, to ride in a whites-only car and took a seat.  The police arrested and incarcerated Plessy in New Orleans.
In 1998, Michelle Alexander investigated whether racial profiling led to disproportionate traffic stops of Black and brown drivers in California.  Earlier data from studies conducted in New Jersey and Maryland showed police routinely targeted people of color for searches and detentions without evidence of criminal activity.  In Maryland, although African-Americans made up 17% of drivers, they accounted for over 70% of stops and searches.  Drivers of color were seen as “suspicious,” stopped for minor traffic violations, and questioned about imagined criminal activity.
We know better than to think Homer Plessy deserved to be charged with a crime: he never belonged behind bars.  We know better than to believe the Maryland motorists deserved to be detained and searched because the color of their skin made them targets of law enforcement.
Don’t tell me that our present-day reality where ICE officers arrest, detain, and deport Black and brown people is something different.  Don’t tell me that immigrants of color working and worshiping are criminals, while people of color taking a seat on a train or driving a motor vehicle have been proven not to be.
White citizens of European nations who stay in the U.S. are not presently targeted by ICE.  We don’t see their faces in footage captured on mobile devices.  White Afrikaners from South Africa singularly have been granted refugee status in the United States under a program expedited by the current administration.  However, an Afghan refugee, Zia S., a former interpreter for the U.S. military, was arrested by ICE in East Hartford recently.  On the same day, Nancy Martinez was carried into Mexico, absent a hearing; ICE took Martinez into custody when she was driving her minor children to school in New Haven.  A father of five and a mother of two have been separated from their minor children.
ICE is not showing up to remove individuals with criminal histories.  That is a lie you have been told.  This is about immigrants who are members of Black and brown communities.  
It is time to turn the camera around and identify those who are, in fact, involved in illegal activity.  The ICE officers and their bosses are repeatedly acting in violation of the Constitution, as well as state and federal statutes. 
I suggest the handcuffs belong on the wrists of the ones wearing masks and refusing to give their names.

As a family physician and chairman of a department of family medicine at a medical school, I admit to being biased. Nonetheless, I am concerned that we are losing two essential bedrock elements of successful patient care: the biopsychosocial model of effective primary care and the concept of shared decision-making between clinician and patient.

Howard Selinger, MD
The term biopsychosocial speaks for itself. A good clinician must thoroughly understand and examine the patient’s biology to address any  concern, equally essential is respecting the patient’s psychological and emotional circumstances at the time of the clinical encounter and finally it’s essential to fully acknowledge the patient’s social structure and their economic, cultural, educational, occupational and living environment. 
Sounds like a tall order, doesn’t it?
The foundation of successful primary care medicine is the establishment of a long-term and trusting clinician-patient relationship. This will absolutely include the elements of the “tall order” I just presented. 
What then follows over time and in every patient clinician encounter is the process of shared decision-making.  Shared decision-making is a collaborative process in which healthcare providers and patients work together to make decisions about the patient’s care. It is especially vital to pursue this approach. The provider shares medical information, both individuals discuss the care options, often bringing in significant others and ultimately a mutual decision is made that supports the patient’s preferences and the provider’s best clinical judgment.
This fundamental tenet of primary care medicine is also foundational for a functioning democracy. When collaboration and cooperation is not modeled in our society, the ramifications are far-reaching and damaging, including to the functioning of our healthcare system.
Autocracy and shared decision-making represent two opposite ends of the spectrum in governance and leadership. Our healthcare system is highly fragmented and administratively burdened. These elements often drive healthcare providers to provide care autocratically without patient engagement and modeling the top down decision making style now seen in our government.
One example of the harm to the health of our American citizens this behavior will produce is the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” submitted by our current presidential administration and passed by the House and Senate.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects 13–16 million Americans will lose health insurance coverage (Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplace effects) by 2034.
The One Big Beautiful Bill will:

Massively reduce insurance coverage —both via Medicaid and ACA marketplaces.
Increase preventable deaths (by an estimated 51,000 annually) and worsen chronic disease outcomes.
Cut access to gender-affirming and reproductive care, marginalizing vulnerable populations.
Strain public health infrastructure, escalating emergency room use and hospital uncompensated care burdens.

The PBS network recently aired a special on the German American Bund titled “ Nazi Town USA”– a pro-Nazi group widely represented in the United States in the 1930s. Expressing Nazi ideology, the group was virulently, anti-semitic, anti-Catholic and anti-communist. It promoted white racial superiority and opposed immigration from non-European countries.
There are themes of this ideology expressed in today’s Republican political administration through ICE activities which include wider deportation reach, rapid deportation and crackdown on lawful immigrants.
In Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, Ebenezer Scrooge makes a particularly cold remark about the poor, saying, “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.” In the Academy-award winning movie South Pacific  the song: ” You’ve got to be carefully taught” features these lyrics in part:
“You’ve got to be taught to hate and fear, You’ve got to be taught to be afraidOf people whose eyes are oddly made,And people whose skin is a different shadeYou’ve got to be taught before it’s too late,To hate all the people your relatives hate…”
The tone and actions of our current Presidential administration and most Republican members of our House and Senate blatantly demean, denigrate and devalue the humanity of individuals less fortunate through the attitudes and actions I’ve described above.  We must take a step back and preserve the fundamental rights of our American democracy that include:
Dignity of the person: The idea that every human being has inherent worth, Independent of majority opinion or public vote. This underpins anti-discrimination laws and protections for marginalized groups.
Justice and moral order: The responsibility to protect vulnerable populations. We cannot and must not further disenfranchise these population groups if we wish to continue to call ourselves a functioning democracy.

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)The president and CEO of a Utah nonprofit manufacturing consultant misused millions of dollars of public funds meant for a federal and state manufacturing program, according to an audit from the Utah State Auditor’s Office.
The review revealed that the nonprofit, iMpact Utah, spent between $1.8 and $2.8 million in transfers to a for-profit company where the president is a majority shareholder, as well as political donations, personal trips and “excessive” executive compensation in a three-year span. 
The funds were supposed to support the Utah Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a program that provides manufacturing improvement services for companies. The federal government awarded $1.4 million annually in 2023, 2024 and 2025. The Utah legislature has appropriated $2.8 million in matching funds each year since 2022. IMpact Utah has been the recipient of the majority of these funds for the past several years through Utah State University and University of Utah partnerships.

According to the auditor’s office, insufficient oversight from state agencies allowed the misuse to go undetected for years.
“Lack of clear accountability and oversight in the distribution of public funds creates a serious vulnerability,” Utah State Auditor Tina Cannon said in a statement. “In this case, a nonprofit organization tasked with supporting Utah’s manufacturers misused taxpayer dollars, enabled by breakdowns in oversight across several layers of responsibility.”
Cannon’s office has referred the case to the Utah Attorney General’s office. Utah News Dispatch is not identifying him at this time because no charges have been filed.
After the auditor’s office received a whistleblower complaint, the company opened its books, shedding light on its misuse of public funds, including the transfer of up to $2.1 million to Vereo Impact, Inc, a for-profit consulting company also operated by iMpact Utah’s president. That money was used to purchase another business entity, pay down the company’s debt, buy assets and other operating expenses, the report says.
“Reportedly, some Vereo employees performed work for (iMpact Utah), and therefore, it would have been reasonable for Vereo to bill (iMpact Utah) for the cost of these services,” auditors wrote. “However, costs were not tracked and we found no billing records.”
Prior to the audit period there was return on investment for the grant money, Cannon told Utah News Dispatch. But, when appropriations increased in 2022 and 2023, there was an increase in irregular activity.
The CEO received bonuses of $200,000 in both 2022 and 2023. In 2025, the executive also received $125,000, all “exorbitant” compared to other nonprofit executives. The president’s average compensation package, including salary, benefits and bonuses, was $518,823 per year, more than double than what his counterparts in similarly sized organizations made, the audit says.

The executive also spent at least $35,715 on several vacations with his wife, including trips to Hawaii, Las Vegas and Florida with expenses like airfare, lodging, a helicopter tour, snorkel cruise, luaus and shows charged to iMpact Utah’s corporate credit card.
Additionally, iMpact Utah made donations to one federal and three state campaigns, amounting to almost $10,000 during 2023 and 2024, a violation of IRS regulations that ban nonprofits from directly or indirectly participating in political campaigns.
“We’re not saying that this was a company problem, that there were employees with the company that were doing a good job, but there is one particular person who happened to be the president, therefore able to exercise undue influence over how the money is used and how the money was spent, without a functioning board in place,” Cannon said.
After the whistleblower complaint, the iMpact Utah executive director resigned, and the nonprofit “will reportedly cease business operations in early fiscal year 2026,” according to the report. 
The Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity (GOEO), which oversees the program, accepted the auditor’s recommendation, which included a 2024 code change strengthening accountability requirements for grant recipients. 
In its official response to the audit, the economic opportunity office’s executive director Jefferson Moss promised “GOEO has not, and will not, distribute funds to an entity after an audit shows grant funds were inappropriately used.”
For Cannon, there’s a reason why her office is going public with this audit, she said, and it involves all of the government entities across the state that give out grant money, and the constraints of having 51 employees to oversee all of them
“I need government entities to know what happened here, and to make sure that if they are giving out grant money, that they have the proper controls in place so that this type of situation doesn’t happen again in any other company or any other government entity,” she said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)HUDSON — At least no one was hurt.
That’s what Amanda Lounsbery said as she stepped over toppled tree limbs littering her yard and tripped over flattened soybeans while surveying damage in one of her fields. It’s what her neighbors repeated as they cleared trees from streets.
Winds over 90 miles per hour on Monday night raged through Hudson, said Lincoln County Emergency Manager Harold Timmerman. The town of 320 people is in southeastern South Dakota near the Iowa border.
The storm was part of a larger system. Hail up to 1.75 inches in diameter was reported in south-central South Dakota, along with a tornado near Dixon in Gregory County earlier in the day and numerous reports of damaging wind, according to the Sioux Falls office of the National Weather Service. Those reports came one day after a tornado destroyed a farmhouse and several outbuildings near Henry in northeastern South Dakota.
Lounsbery’s sons, who are volunteer firefighters, served as spotters during the storm and said they saw a funnel west of town. According to the NWS, no tornadoes touched down near Hudson. The damage was caused by straight-line winds from a “downburst,” which is when wind in a storm system is forced downward and spreads outward once it hits the ground.
Lounsbery hadn’t seen her husband in nearly 24 hours, since he’s a volunteer firefighter and was focused on ensuring everyone’s safety. The fire department knocked on every house’s door after the storm passed Monday night. Dozens of South Dakotans drove from nearby towns and from as far away as Vermillion and Watertown to help with recovery.

Gov. Larry Rhoden surveyed the damage Tuesday afternoon and offered up to 30 South Dakota prison inmates to Hudson officials to help with cleanup. But that might not be necessary, given the outpouring of support and assistance from neighboring communities, he added. Public Safety Secretary Bob Perry said local officials haven’t requested state assistance yet.
Rhoden added that he doesn’t plan to call in the South Dakota National Guard and isn’t sure if the damage calls for a federal disaster declaration.
Hudson Mayor Steve Wickre said the support among neighbors showcases what’s best about Hudson: its people and their resiliency. 
Officials don’t know the financial impact of the damage yet. They said a nursing home was evacuated due to a power outage.
Lounsbery and many of her neighbors’ power was still out as of 6 p.m. on Tuesday. Her garage was caved in, and pieces of her neighbors’ shed roof landed in her soybean field across from her house just outside of town. Her toppled grain bin carved a path into another field, where it sat split into two pieces.
“I was really upset last night,” Lounsbery said, “but now I realize my people are OK. We’ll be OK.”

Free.,"Bove confirmed by US Senate as federal appeals judge, despite misconduct complaints",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/bove-confirmed-us-senate-federal-appeals-judge-despite-misconduct-complaints,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Tuesday night confirmed President Donald Trump’s former criminal defense attorney, Emil Bove, to a lifetime position on the federal appeals bench, in the face of whistleblower allegations and criticism from former judges and advocates.Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine broke with their party and joined all Democrats in a 50-49 vote to oppose Bove’s confirmation to the U.S. Appeals Court for the 3rd Circuit, which handles cases for Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Bove, 44, currently holds the position of principal associate deputy attorney general at the U.S. Justice Department. Trump initially appointed Bove as acting attorney general at the start of the president’s second term.The former federal prosecutor and private defense attorney faced numerous accusations of misconduct throughout his confirmation process.Democrats walked out of a July 17 committee vote to advance Bove’s nomination, largely protesting the GOP-led panel’s refusal to hear further testimony from a whistleblower who alleged Bove suggested defying a federal court order.Longtime Justice Department senior official Erez Reuveni, who served in the first Trump administration, blew the whistle on Bove for a March 14 meeting during which he allegedly suggested subordinates tell the federal courts “f— you” if a judge ordered a halt to Trump’s deportation flights to El Salvador. A second whistleblower corroborated the alleged comment, according to a CNN report Sunday.Senate Democrats, former judges and advocates also voiced concern over Bove’s alleged unethical behavior, including questions about his role as a top Justice official in the dismissal of federal bribery charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams and in the firing of prosecutors who worked on cases probing the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol.Bove has denied any wrongdoing.Critics also pointed to a trail of allegations from Bove’s former colleagues in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York that he created a hostile work environment, as first reported by Politico in February.‘Unfair accusations and abuse’On Monday, the Washington Post reported that a third whistleblower had come forward, this time alleging the top Justice Department office misled the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in testimony regarding the dropped charges against Adams.Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chairs the committee tasked with vetting judicial nominees, said on the floor ahead of the vote that Democrats “grossly mischaracterized” allegations against Bove.“I have serious concerns with how my Democratic colleagues have conducted themselves — the vicious rhetoric, unfair accusations and abuse directed at Mr. Bove,” the Iowa Republican said.Grassley said he asked Bove to put in writing his response to the latest whistleblower accusations.“In his letter, Mr. Bovey flatly denies the allegations that he misled the committee,” Grassley said.In the seven-page letter made public by Grassley Tuesday evening, Bove dismissed the accusations as a “partisan smear campaign” and a “sham.”“I understand that a lifetime appointment to a federal court of appeals is a serious matter. I welcome serious scrutiny of my record and my service to this country. My record includes 32 appeals, 13 trials, nearly a decade as a federal prosecutor, clerkships in federal trial and appellate courts, successfully defending the President of the United States, and helping lead the Department of Justice,” Bove wrote.“Principled evaluation of that record, separated from the raw political warfare by Democrats that has tainted this process, confirms that I will be a fearless, independent judge committed to justice and the rule of law,” he continued.‘So wrong, so unusual’Senate Democrats railed against the nomination Tuesday.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said ahead of the vote the allegations against Bove “were not minor episodes of prosecutorial misconduct.”“What we're about to do is so wrong, so unusual, that even if these remarks will have no effect whatsoever, I feel obliged to come to the floor,” the Rhode Island lawmaker said.Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, wrote in a social media post that “Three credible whistleblowers have come forward with serious allegations against Emil Bove, a Trump judicial nominee. Republicans are ignoring them and rushing to confirm Bove anyway.”“They’re afraid of the truth… and Donald Trump’s wrath. Shameful,” Durbin, of Illinois, continued.In a statement issued Tuesday afternoon by the Not Above the Law Coalition, the organization’s leaders said Bove is “unfit for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.”“His record of misconduct and disdain for the rule of law is a direct threat to judicial independence and Americans’ rights and freedoms. Any senator who votes to confirm Bove is making clear that their loyalty lies with Donald Trump, not the people they serve or the Constitution they swore to uphold,” the statement continued from the coalition’s co-chairs, including Lisa Gilbert, co-president of Public Citizen; Praveen Fernandes, vice president of the Constitutional Accountability Center; Kelsey Herbert, campaign director at MoveOn; and Brett Edkins, managing director for policy and political affairs at Stand Up America.",,,,2025-07-30 00:57:11.069062

(Courtesy of Norfolk Southern)
Omaha-based Union Pacific Railroad’s announcement Tuesday that it is acquiring the Norfolk Southern Railway — a move that would create the first transcontinental, coast-to-coast rail system — drew praise from Nebraska’s public and business leaders.
Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. lauded U.P.’s decision to remain headquartered in Omaha and to keep its name, saying that both decisions give the city “confidence in a long, proud, shared future.”
“We would welcome any future employees from the combined railroads to settle in Omaha,” Ewing, the mayor of the state’s largest city, said in a statement.
Norfolk Southern operates 2,410 miles of track and employs more than 3,400 people in Pennsylvania. It has intermodal terminals in several commonwealth communities, including Bethlehem, Harrisburg, and Pittsburgh and rail yards in others, such as Reading, Altoona, and Waynesburg.
In February 2023, a Norfolk Southern train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, near the border with Pennsylvania. The crash involved a series of cars carrying hazardous materials and led to evacuations in the community. Norfolk has since agreed to pay more than $900 million in settlements related to the derailment in cases with the federal government and a class action lawsuit involving East Palestine residents.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen noted on social media that President Abraham Lincoln envisioned a railroad extending to the Pacific Ocean and chose the Omaha area as its starting point.
“U.P. has been building America ever since, and Nebraska has become a centrally-located national transportation hub along the way,” he said. “The State of Nebraska looks forward to supporting this tremendous partnership, and we are proud to host America’s First Transcontinental Railroad.”
 Span 50,000 miles

Railroad leaders said the proposed merger, projected to wrap up in early 2027, could transform the U.S. supply chain, unleash American manufacturing, preserve union jobs and drive economic growth.
Jim Vena, the railroad’s chief executive, said in a statement that the new network would span more than 50,000 miles, serve 43 states from the East Coast to West Coast, link about 100 ports and reach nearly every corner of North America.
“It will enable us to stay at the forefront of technological advances that continue to fundamentally change how freight moves,” he said, adding that the move spurs a “new era of American innovation.”

Vena and Norfolk Southern’s Mark George appeared on CNBC to talk about the purchase deal that is said to be worth $85 billion.
The result, the companies’ statement said, is the creation of a “combined enterprise of over $250 billion.”
Vena is to run the combined entity and is viewed as the architect. He said during the interview that the railroads are sure they will grow the business and workforce. Both leaders said they wouldn’t shed unionized jobs as part of the plan.
George said the two CEOs got together several months ago and talked about what they could do to create something bigger. If approved, the new “Union Pacific Transcontinental Railroad” would combine U.P.’s strength in the western two-thirds of the country with Norfolk’s base in 22 eastern states.
“It became very very clear how big these revenue synergies are,” George said. “So we’re really excited about the future.”
Norfolk Southern’s current headquarters in Atlanta is to become a key site focused on technology and innovation.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For now, Vena said, “it is business as usual,” though he acknowledged the many questions that people have.
In coming months, he said, the railroads would submit a formal merger application to the Surface Transportation Board. During that period, the two companies will continue to operate separately.
George said two years of planning the integration should allow the merged railroad to “hit the ground running.”

 Scrutiny ahead

Vena, on his company’s website, said the proposed transcontinental network is expected to deliver faster service by eliminating car touches and interchange delays, opening new routes, expanding intermodal services and ensuring faster movement along key rail corridors.
“We will take even more trucks off highways, decreasing congestion and reducing wear-and-tear on taxpayer-funded roads,” he said.
More than 40,000 U.P. and Norfolk Southern union employees move goods essential to daily lives, he said. Together they have 360 years of history.
The deal likely faces regulatory scrutiny amid concerns, including from labor unions, over potential job eliminations and disruption in service.
The Transport Workers Union of America, which represents workers at Norfolk Southern, said in a statement Tuesday that it strongly opposes the planned merger and urged federal regulators, lawmakers, shippers and unions to block the deal.

“A supersized Union Pacific would be catastrophic for TWU rail workers, shippers, and the safety of millions of Americans who live and work near freight rail lines,” said International President John Samuelsen.
SMART Transportation Division (SMART-TD), described as the largest rail labor organization in the U.S., said in a statement it is “deeply engaged” in evaluating the implications of the proposed merger.
The union said the deal would encourage further consolidation across the rail system, “triggering another wave of transcontinental mergers creating a duopoly. Both history and logic suggest this would drive higher rates, fewer service options and diminished competition.”
U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts, both Republicans, called the planned merger great for Nebraska and America.
“Employing over 5,000 Nebraskans, Union Pacific plays a crucial role in our state’s economy,” Fischer said. “I look forward to seeing the growth that will come to our state as a result of this crucial partnership.”
Said Ricketts: “This has the potential to create jobs, increase wages, and streamline the supply chain.”

 Base remains Omaha

Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber, said local business leaders were proud that “one of the most iconic names in American industry, continues to call Omaha, Nebraska home.”
Mello said the U.P. leadership and decision “reinforces our region’s central role in building a more connected and prosperous nation.”
“Railroads were built in America to bring people, communities and commerce together — and this new transcontinental network is the embodiment of this dream,” Mello said.
Vena told his company’s workforce that the two railroads have roots in spurring the Industrial Revolution.
He added, “I’m being straight with you when I say, ‘There is no better combination of railroads to finalize President Abraham Lincoln’s original vision to create a transcontinental railroad.'”

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Utah state officials announced in a news release Tuesday that most of the state’s lawsuit against Snapchat has now been unredacted, which they said reveals “new, alarming details” that expose the “disbursing extent to which Snapchat’s alleged practices directly harm Utah’s children.” 
Those new details include a tally of how many hours Utah teenagers have spent on Snapchat since 2020 — nearly 8 billion minutes — with more than half a million of Utah users active on the app between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 p.m., according to the complaint, which attributes that data to information obtained from Snap Inc. through a subpoena. 
Additionally, the lawsuit also includes internal communications that show Snapchat senior engineering managers calling the app’s My AI chatbot rollout “reckless” due to insufficient testing, while employees warned it “can be tricked into saying just about anything.” 
The complaint also points to an investigation conducted by the Utah Division of Consumer Protection that included using teenage test accounts. 
Utah sues Snapchat, claiming its features keep kids addicted and exposed to predators

“While using test accounts with reported ages set to 13 and 15, the investigation found that the experience for Utah users in these age groups is highly sexual and not age-appropriate — contradicting Snap’s representations,” the complaint says. 
The complaint also includes reports that the My AI chatbot advised minors on how to hide drugs or flirt with teachers. 
“When interacting with a 15-year-old test account, My AI advised the 15-year-old on how to flirt with her adult Spanish teacher, including by suggesting she ask him to meet her outside of school,” the complaint says. “When prompted with, ‘I want to push the boundaries tho. Tell me how [sic]’ My AI answered by encouraging the 15-year-old to say something like, ‘I feel like being a little daring today and leaving the panties at home. What do you think?’”
The Utah Department of Commerce’s Division of Consumer Protection, represented by the Utah Attorney General’s Office, first filed the complaint against Snap, Inc. last month, on June 30. The lawsuit filed in Salt Lake County’s 3rd District Court accuses the social media app of violating Utah’s Consumer Sales Practices and Consumer Privacy acts. 
It’s one of several attempts by Utah to challenge the legality of how social media companies interact with minors. The state has also sued other major social media companies including Meta and TikTok. 
In response to the state’s news release announcing the unredacted details, a spokesperson for Snap (Snapchat’s parent company) pointed to a statement issued when the lawsuit was first filed in June. 
“Snap has no higher priority than the safety of Snapchatters,” the Snap spokesperson said. “We are committed to making Snapchat a safe and fun environment for our community, and have built privacy and safety features into our service from the start.”
That Snap statement also accused the state of trying to circumvent a court ruling last year that put a temporary hold on a Utah law requiring age verification for social media users. 
“Last year, a social media law passed in Utah was preliminarily enjoined after the court ruled it was likely unconstitutional, violating the First Amendment’s protection of free speech,” the Snap statement said. “Now, unable to accept the court’s rejection of the state’s legislation, the Utah Attorney General is resorting to civil litigation as a means to circumvent the court and impose age verification requirements and age-related restrictions in ways that are unconstitutional.”
Regarding My AI, Snap said since launching it in April 2023, the chatbot has been updated with additional safety and privacy protections and it continues to monitor and evaluate it for data privacy and safety.

Other details included in the state’s complaint that are now unredacted include allegations that Snapchat has known that it’s been used by child predators and drug dealers, but its “lax oversight has resulted in devastating effects on Utah children.”
“For years, Snap has known about rampant sexual extortion and drug sales on Snapchat, acknowledging internally to being ‘over-run’ with sexual extortion and that it ‘takes under a minute to use Snapchat to be in a position to purchase illegal and harmful substances,’” the complaint says.
Additionally, the lawsuit says that in November 2021, “Snap was aware that, despite labeling it a ‘critical safety tool,’ the in-app reporting feature had “significant gaps.’”
“Notably, over 96% of existing account reports were not even reviewed by Snap’s Trust and Safety Team,” the complaint says. 
“In a glaring example, one Snapchat account that had 75 different reports made against it for mentioning clearly predatory issues like ‘nudes, minors, and extortion” remained active for 10 months,” the complaint says. “ Trust and Safety managers acknowledged that many user reports related to grooming and sextortion, like this, were ‘fall[ing] through the cracks’ because Snap failed to provide appropriate ‘guidance’ to its content moderation vendors.”
The complaint also alleges that Snap failed to disclose that My AI collects user geolocation data even when features like “Ghost Mode” are activated to limit location sharing, and that the app shared private information, including My AI conversations, with third parties like OpenAI and Microsoft Advertising. 
Snap has argued that the company has invested significant resources in its moderation efforts and trust and safety teams, and it continues to work with policymakers at both state and federal levels in the U.S. to advocate for legislation to protect teens online. 
The company also continues to argue that Utahns shouldn’t have to choose between free speech rights and other issues including parental rights, cybersecurity, and kids’ safety.

The post Vice president, second lady hobnob in Jackson for $250,000 a greeting appeared first on WyoFile .","Vice President JD Vance and his wife Usha met with supporters Tuesday at a private high-dollar fundraising lunch in Jackson Hole, attracting about seven protesters.
The couple spent about three hours in the valley, Teton County Sheriff Matt Carr said. The two traveled from the Jackson Hole Airport to a private residence south of Jackson in a motorcade of about 20 vehicles.
Two of the limousines flew American and vice presidential flags. One of the protest signs objected to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids targeting immigrants.
Lynn Friess and Karen and Jay Kemmerer hosted the luncheon for the Republican National Committee, according to invitations published on social media. Those invitations offered invited couples a greeting, a meal and a photograph for a $250,000 donation. A $100,000 donation earned a meal and a picture.

“I loved the format,” Friess said Tuesday evening. “They came in, sat down for lunch. He had an opening chat and said ‘ask me questions,’” she said. “It was very relaxed.”
Republican Paul Vogelheim, a former Teton County commissioner, had heard about the fundraiser and wasn’t interested. As a former Teton County GOP Chair, Vogelheim told WyoFile, that he’s long been frustrated by fundraisers that don’t benefit local candidates.
“It was always a little bit of bleeding out the money to national [groups] without really sharing that money,” Vogelheim said of the parade of high-end fundraisers that swing through Jackson Hole.

Event co-sponsor Friess is the wife of the late Foster Friess, a conservative investment manager and avid supporter of President Donald Trump. He ran unsuccessfully for Wyoming governor in 2018.
Jay Kemmerer is a co-investor in the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. He attracted widespread criticism and protest for another fundraiser in 2021. The Kemmerer family owned the ski area at Teton Village outright at that time.
Jay Kemmerer hosted the controversial 2021 fundraiser for the Freedom Caucus Foundation. The event featured U.S. Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.
The protest of the 2021 event evolved beyond a sign-carrying crowd to include the Patagonia clothing company, which said it would no longer sell its products to the Mountain Resort. The environmentally oriented outdoor wear brand advocates strongly for progressive action to defend the planet and combat climate change.
Patagonia’s 2021 decision centered on “our really strong commitment to using both our business and our brand to advocate for our strong priorities,” the company said at the time. “When there’s a misalignment on that, then we take action,” Corley Kenna, Patagonia’s head of communications, said.
The Teton County Republican Party defended the Kemmerers during that dust-up. “There is a firm distinction between peaceful protest, and deliberate aim to hurt those with whom we disagree, physically, emotionally, and financially,” the group posted on its webpage.
Tuesday, Vogelheim had another take. 
As Teton County GOP chair, Vogelheim worked to rally the local party around being fiscal conservatives, being good stewards of habitat and respecting individual choices. He doesn’t see those values reflected in the party, he said, describing himself as an Al Simpson-style Republican.

“The current administration does not represent my interests and my priorities,” he said.
For host Friess, however, the event was worthwhile. “I’m glad I went,” she said. “He was very forthright. He answered well.”
The Vances left Jackson Hole in the early Tuesday afternoon, apparently headed for Big Sky, Montana, for a dinner fundraiser. Invitations offered similar $250,000 and $100,000 tickets.
The FAA issued notices restricting the airspace around the Jackson Hole Airport and a neighborhood south of Jackson from late morning to early afternoon Tuesday.
Axios reported that the two events in the West were expected to bring in more than $4 million.

(Getty Images)A western Pennsylvania prosecutor facing scrutiny over his prolific pursuit of the death penalty in cases is accused of compelling a county coroner to help bolster his political image by filing a fraudulent death certificate.
Washington County Coroner Timothy Warco said in an affidavit filed Tuesday in state Supreme Court that District Attorney Jason Walsh was dissatisfied after the Allegheny County Medical Examiner labeled the manner of death of a two-month-old child in May 2022 undetermined.
Walsh, who was running for election, allegedly told Warco he wanted the Washington County Coroner’s Office to have jurisdiction over the death because, “you know that I need this to be a homicide, I need it to win an election,” according to the affidavit.
It alleges Walsh fraudulently obtained a court order for Warco’s office to take jurisdiction over the baby’s death from Washington County President Judge John DiSalle. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Walsh and DiSalle are co-defendants in a federal civil rights lawsuit by a witness in another capital murder case, who claims they violated her right to representation and falsely imprisoned her. DiSalle is also being sued by a former court employee who claims she was subject to retaliation after she raised an alarm about DiSalle allegedly denying legal counsel for indigent defendants who appeared before him in the county’s veterans’ court.
A group of death penalty defense lawyers filed a petition in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court last week asking the court to intervene in a pair of death penalty prosecutions against two fathers charged with killing their infant children.
The Atlantic Center for Capital Representation, based in Philadelphia, alleges Walsh has filed notices that he would seek the death penalty in 11 of 18 homicide cases his office has prosecuted since he took office in 2021. 
In at least five cases, detailed in the petition, Walsh’s office failed to produce evidence that the killings were intentional and that there was an aggravating factor, which are required to pursue capital charges. Aggravating factors include an underlying felony, murder for hire, torture, murder of a police officer or first responder and more than a dozen other circumstances.
Walsh, who became county district attorney after his predecessor’s death and was later elected as a Republican in 2023, called the Atlantic Center’s filing a “liberal smear campaign” by an anti-death penalty group. 
He did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday on the updated filing.
When two-month-old Sawyer Clarke died in 2022, Walsh was actively campaigning for his first election as district attorney. His primary platform was harsh punishment for people who kill infants and children, Warco’s affidavit said. 
Sawyer’s father Joshua Clarke told detectives that he had tripped and fallen on his son. Clarke’s grandfather and aunt were in the house at the time and called 911. 
Although Sawyer died at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County, an assistant district attorney told Warco that Walsh wanted the Washington County Coroner’s Office to perform the autopsy. Walsh and the assistant district attorney did not believe the Allegheny County Medical Examiner would rule the death a homicide. 
According to Warco’s affidavit, Walsh obtained a court order from President Judge John DiSalle listing the child’s place of death as Peters Township, Washington County, in order to give the Warco’s office jurisdiction over the death. 
“It is believed, and therefore averred, that Walsh misrepresented the place of death to DiSalle to fraudulently induce him to enter an order that somehow conferred jurisdiction for the death to Washington County,” Warco said in the affidavit.

A forensic pathologist under contract to the coroner’s office performed the autopsy and forwarded the results to the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office. There, Sawyer’s death was ruled to be the result of blunt force trauma to the head with the manner undetermined. 
“I was then approached by Walsh immediately thereafter, who expressed his dissatisfaction with the determination by the Allegheny County medical examiner,” Warco’s affidavit says. “He compelled me to prepare and file a fraudulent death certificate, despite the fact that I did not have jurisdiction to either rule on the cause and manner or to file a death certificate.”
Warco’s death certificate was rejected by the state because the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office had already filed one for Sawyer Clarke.
Joshua Clarke is being held on criminal homicide charges and faces the death penalty, which the Atlantic Center contends is not supported by the evidence produced at a preliminary hearing.
Walsh and DiSalle are accused in the federal civil rights lawsuit of depriving Anitra Banks of her constitutional rights to be free from false arrest and imprisonment. According to the suit in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh, Banks was called as a witness in a preliminary hearing for two men charged with a fatal shooting at a convenience store.
After Banks’ testimony, it says Walsh became enraged and had Banks arrested by a county detective. She was then taken in handcuffs to DiSalle’s courtroom, where the judge convened an impromptu contempt hearing where Banks was denied a lawyer and threatened with incarceration unless she cooperated with Walsh.
“It was clear to the plaintiff that … appearing as a witness … and testifying were not enough: she had to say in her testimony what [Walsh] wanted her to say,” the lawsuit claims.
The second lawsuit against DiSalle alleges he had former court employee Elizabeth Sullivan fired after she contacted the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts about her concerns about his operation of the county’s Veterans’ Court. 
The suit alleges DiSalle denied dozens of veterans the right to have an attorney at hearings in the problem-solving court and had some jailed for not complying with conditions of the program.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1483938846-gavel-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 20:56:18.799284

Central Idaho Dispatch Zone increases fire danger to ‘very high’

The Washington Legislature approved House Bill 1168 in 2021, which committed $500 million over eight years to the state Department of Natural Resources for wildfire preparedness and response.
State spending had largely kept up with that target until this year, with the department receiving $115 million in the last two-year budget and $130 million in the one before that.
Then this year, as lawmakers confronted a budget shortfall, they slashed the wildfire preparedness funding to just $60 million for the next two years.
The Department of Natural Resources says it’s prepared for this fire season and has money left over from past years. But the funding rollback has sparked concerns.
 Lands commissioner raises alarm with media near Washington’s Burdoin Fire

Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove raised the alarm this week during a press conference near the Burdoin Fire in the Columbia River Gorge.
As of Friday, that fire had burned 11,269 acres on both sides of Highway 14 east of White Salmon and was just 13% contained. The blaze had also led to the closure of Highway 14 and other roads, and evacuation orders for hundreds of residents.
“If next year’s supplemental budget does not restore some of that funding, we’re going to see more fires like this, they’re going to be larger, and they’re going to cost the taxpayers a lot more money in the back end,” Upthegrove said during a press conference with Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson.
Ferguson stopped short of calling for the funding to be boosted, but thanked the Legislature for the funds it did provide.
“This is a reminder of the need for those resources … they’re truly making a big difference right now as we understand it from the experts here on the ground,” Ferguson said.
The Department of Natural Resources has worked since receiving the dedicated wildfire preparedness funding in 2021 to thin out flammable vegetation in forests around the state.
But there’s plenty more to be done, both for fire mitigation and fire recovery, and the reduced funding is “not going to allow us to do as much work as we normally do,” said Collin Haffey, post-fire recovery program manager for the department.
Haffey spoke during a tour of the Rimrock Retreat Fire area in the Yakima Valley this week. The fire burned roughly 46,600 acres over a month last year, between Rimrock Lake and Tieton in the Yakima Valley, after starting at a cabin.
 How state funding has helped thin trees, conduct prescribed burns

The visit highlighted the department’s post-fire recovery efforts, as well as the pre-fire actions that officials say helped to significantly reduce the harm the fire caused the local ecosystem and surrounding community.
While the fire burned severely in some areas, the damage wasn’t as bad in the Oak Creek drainage due to forest management actions the Department of Natural Resources took before the fire, officials said.
Using House Bill 1168 funding, the Department of Natural Resources thinned trees and conducted prescribed burns in that area.
The goal with this kind of work is to restore a historically natural mix of clearings and densely forested areas, creating what forest scientists call a mosaic pattern. This can reduce the risk of high-intensity fires while also better supporting biodiversity than forests that get too dense.
And when wildfires do burn on land that’s been treated in this way, it can be beneficial rather than catastrophic.
“This fire in the Oak Creek drainage, in terms of the impacts on forests and on wildlife overall, was good,” said Derek Churchill, a scientist with the Department of Natural Resources.
“Now this watershed is in pretty good condition, at least for another 10 or 15 years, where we have really low fuel loads and lower fire risk,” he said.
In contrast, areas in the footprint of the Rimrock Retreat Fire that weren’t pretreated suffered from high-severity burns that damaged the soil and decimated the vegetation.

Burns like this in that part of the state can end up converting forest habitat to a shrub steppe — at least for years to come, Churchill said. The scorched land can also invite invasive species and is at higher risk of landslides.
“If you lose your big trees in a fire like this, we’ve lost them for, I won’t say forever, but for a long time,” Churchill said. “These soils will come back eventually, but it definitely takes a lot longer when you cook the soil like this.”

Uriel Sinai/Getty ImagesMedical cannabis and recreational hemp are likely to be high on lawmakers’ list of priorities as they reconvene in January for the 2026 legislative session.
Members of a House study committee dedicated to studying the impact of cannabis consumption held their first meeting at the state Capitol Tuesday. The committee will hold three additional hearings between now and October to examine medical studies, solicit expert testimony and compare Georgia’s marijuana laws to those of other states before compiling a report on official policy recommendations. 
The committee, which is composed of lawmakers, agency leaders, medical professionals and everyday citizens, will study two distinct policy subsets: Medical cannabis, which is administered through Georgia’s Access to Medical Cannabis Commission, and commercial hemp products, which are regulated through the federal 2018 Farm Bill and the Georgia Hemp Farming Act.

“There is some blurring in this committee, which happens because of the fact that we’re looking at, really, two different policies,” said state Rep. Mark Newton, an Augusta Republican and physician who chairs the committee. “Medical marijuana is one area of this Blue Ribbon commission that we’re assigned with, and the second area is hemp policies.”
Bills related to medical cannabis and hemp beverages became a focal point during the 2025 session, which also marked the 10-year anniversary of Haleigh’s Hope Act. The law created the licensing commission, legalized possession of low-THC oil for the first time in Georgia and created a new research program dedicated to studying the drug’s impact. Subsequent legislation enabled companies to produce and sell the oil in-state, but advocates argue that Georgia’s current laws do not go far enough to help patients access medical cannabis in the forms that they need. 
Georgia has seen incremental but steady growth in its low-THC oil program, which currently has over 33,700 patients, 2,300 caregivers and 700 physicians enrolled, according to the latest data from the state Department of Public Health. Patients with intractable pain and post-traumatic stress diagnoses make up more than 75% of those on the list, though patients with conditions like cancer, seizure disorders and Parkinson’s disease are also eligible to enroll. Georgia’s numbers are also dwarfed by other Southern states like Mississippi and Louisiana, where enrollment numbers are closer to 50,000 despite having much smaller state populations.
At least four bills on the topic of medical cannabis and hemp products were introduced during the most recent session, though none managed to successfully clear both chambers before the Legislature adjourned in April.
Over on the Senate side, lawmakers on the Study Committee on Intoxicating Cannabinoids in Consumable Hemp Products will also tackle the issue of regulating recreational products like THC-infused drinks, which are chemically similar to medical cannabis but more broadly available to consumers because they fall under the federal 2018 Farm Bill and the Georgia Hemp Farming Act. The first meeting of that committee has yet to be publicly announced.
The House committee will hold its next meeting on Aug. 21 in Augusta.

(Photo by Will Newton/Arkansas Governor's Office)Arkansas’ net general revenue in the first month of the 2026 fiscal year exceeded projections by about $10 million, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Little Rock Rotary Club members on Tuesday.
The boost in net revenue “was not expected” by “outside voices” that have said tax cuts made since she took office would hurt the state’s economy and not induce economic growth, Sanders said.
“Over the last two years, we’ve been able to cut Arkansas taxes three times, taking 20% off our state income taxes and putting more than $1 billion back into the pockets of Arkansans,” the governor said. “By doing that, we’ve reinvested in our state, and we’re seeing a return.”
Arkansas remains “number one” in the country in cost-of-living and among the top states for new residents migrating from other places, she said, attributing the rankings to her administration’s ability to get rid of regulations and make the state even more friendly to business and investment.
The state has the strongest economy it’s ever had, she said.
The state finance department won’t release the official revenue numbers until Monday, and Department of Finance and Administration spokesperson Scott Hardin said the net revenue could change slightly in the two days remaining in July.
DFA Secretary Jim Hudson told legislators in May that an extension of the deadline for filing state income taxes to July 31 because of storms in April likely would mean revenue that should have shown up by the end of fiscal 2025 in June would be reflected in July’s numbers.

Sanders’ comments came during the Rotary’s monthly meeting as she responded to questions from Soirée magazine Publisher Mandy Richardson at the William J. Clinton Presidential Library.
During the roughly 45-minute “fireside chat,” Sanders touted her signature education legislation — the LEARNS and the Arkansas ACCESS acts — as key components of her overall workforce development strategy to help attract industry and support in-state businesses.
LEARNS overhauled the state’s K-12 education system, setting a minimum $50,000 salary for teachers, establishing tougher standards of third-grade literacy and providing coaches to help meet them, and establishing Educational Freedom Accounts to subsidize parents who want to send their children to private schools.
The voucher program enters its third year with the upcoming school year when it becomes universally available to any public school student. So far, the state Education Department has approved more than 43,100 applicants, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported. If the department approves the full amount for every applicant, the cost would be about $18.5 million more than the $277 million the Legislature approved this year, and Sanders is committed to funding every approved applicant, the newspaper reported.
Sanders noted Tuesday that the EFA program enabled EasterSeals Arkansas to expand the number of developmentally disabled students it serves from 20 to 220 as of this fall. She attended a ribbon-cutting at the nonprofit’s new K-12 academy on Monday.
Arkansas ACCESS made changes to the state’s higher education system, including allowing faculty tenure to be affected by job performance reviews, streamlining course structure across institutions, allowing easier student transfers between two-year and four-year schools, and creating an accelerated learning program for high school students who want to take college-level courses.
“We’ve made significant strides” in building a workforce to meet employers’ requirements, she said.
The governor also touted measures the administration and Legislature have taken to improve the state’s energy infrastructure by allowing the Public Service Commission to fast-track energy companies’ projects.
Other successes Sanders mentioned Tuesday:

Arkansas is one of only nine states to offer paid maternity leave to teachers.
$4 billion invested in water and wastewater infrastructure over the past two years, although she noted the cities and counties still need at least another $4 billion to address critical needs.

Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images (file)Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene says she will not run for governor, just weeks after taking a pass on entering Georgia’s U.S. Senate race.
Greene, a close ally of President Donald Trump, announced Tuesday she will not run for governor in 2026, citing a desire to focus on her district and distaste for what she called Georgia’s “good ole boy” political system.
“I am humbled and grateful by the massive statewide support that I have to run for Governor, and if I wanted to run we all know I would win. It’s not even debatable,” the Rome Republican wrote in a long post on X.
Greene previously pulled her name out of the race for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, reportedly under pressure from members of her party – including Trump – who were concerned that she might win big with conservative primary voters but fall flat in a general election.
Greene’s confrontational demeanor has made her a darling for conservatives in her district and nationwide – she’s in the top 10% for fundraising among all House incumbents, according to OpenSecrets data, and the top House fundraiser from Georgia – but she is also polarizing to liberals and moderates whose support she would likely need to win a statewide race in a battleground state.
For now, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and Attorney General Chris Carr are considered the frontrunners for the GOP nomination once Gov. Brian Kemp’s term expires, but there is still time for more candidates to enter the race.
Georgia’s governor has been a Republican since 2003, but Democrats are hoping changing demographics, frustration with the party in power and a series of statewide wins in recent years can propel a candidate to victory.
Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey taunted Republicans in a statement after Greene’s announcement.
“Marjorie Taylor Greene has officially chickened out of the race for Governor because she knows she’s too extreme for Georgia – something Burt Jones and Chris Carr apparently haven’t figured out yet. That leaves Jones and Carr to spend the next year in a messy, nasty primary doing what they do best: ignoring the real needs of hardworking Georgians to audition for Donald Trump’s approval.”
The Democratic frontrunners at the moment are former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Atlanta state Sen. Jason Esteves.
But Georgians who hope to see Greene tested in a statewide election need not lose all hope – in her post, she left the door open for a potential future run for governor.
“And one day, I might just run without the blessing from the good ‘ole boys club or the out of state consulting leaches or even without the blessing of my favorite President,” she wrote. “One day, I might just run purely out of the blessing of the wonderful people of Georgia, my family and friends, but it won’t be in 2026.”
“In the meantime, you’ll find me in the beautiful hills of Northwest Georgia and fighting with all my might in the House of Representatives for the people who elected me,” she added.

(Pool photo by Cody Scanlan/The Des Moines Register)The Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board reprimanded Brian Jorde, an attorney who has represented hundreds of landowners in lawsuits against pipelines, including Iowa and South Dakota landowners opposed to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.
The disciplinary board wrote in the reprimand that Jorde presented information that was “misleading or deceptive” during Iowa and South Dakota utilities commission proceedings regarding permit applications for the carbon sequestration project.
Jorde, part of Domina Law Group out of Omaha, represented 155 landowners in the Iowa Utilities Commission’s evaluation of Summit Carbon Solutions’ permit application to construct more than 600 miles of a pipeline carrying liquid carbon dioxide sequestered from biorefineries across the state. The pipeline would travel through Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and eventually be stored in underground rock formations in North Dakota.
In the Iowa permit proceedings, Jorde filed pretrial testimony on behalf of landowners, including Nancy Dugan.
Dugan had filed her own information in the IUC proceedings as well and, according to the reprimand, had been in contact via email with Jorde.
Jorde also represented landowners in the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission’s hearings on Summit’s permit application. According to the records provided in the reprimand, he asked for and received Dugan’s permission to submit some of her research that had already been submitted in the IUC dockets, to the South Dakota hearings.
Jorde’s filings on behalf of Dugan, however, included introductory written testimony, which Dugan later said, in an email to Jorde obtained by the advisory board, were “not statements I would choose to submit.”
The reprimand said Dugan did not approve these written statements. The statement submitted in South Dakota had an electronic signature at the bottom, but the IUC document had not been signed by Dugan.
Dugan clarified in her email to Jorde that she was not a landowner and was worried about being called to testify. Jorde, in response, said the filing with the IUC must have happened inadvertently by staff who filed a number of pretrial testimony. He assured Dugan he did not intend to call her to testify, according to the included emails.
In subsequent emails, Dugan asked Jorde to retract the statement, or allow her to submit a revised version that included her actual responses. According to the reprimand, Dugan later learned the same statements had been submitted in South Dakota and again emailed Jorde asking him to refrain from filing any affidavits on her behalf unless it was something she had written or reviewed or approved.
In April 2024, months after the IUC hearing occurred  Dugan brought up the issue again to Jorde asking him to rescind the statements from the IUC record, according to the reprimand. Jorde said the pretrial testimony was not used in the hearing and therefore not part of the record, so he was unsure what action the IUC would take. He later said to the board the filing was not “material” information to the proceedings, the reprimand states.
“If I file a request to have it deleted for instance that will bring more attention to something Summit and others are not even thinking about now,” Jorde said in an email excerpt included in the letter from the advisory board.
According to the advisory board, Jorde contacted the IUC about removing the testimony, but did not contact the South Dakota commission about the issue.
The written testimony attributed to Dugan was not used in the commission hearings in either state.
Dugan brought the issue to the attention of the IUC council and Nebraska attorney disciplinary authorities, where the matter was brought to the Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board.
The board concluded the actions in South Dakota were “deceptive” and wrote it was “deeply concerning” that Jorde and his staff did not mention to Dugan the extra pages filed in addition to the research she had consented to filing.
The board was less clear on its ruling on the Iowa document because Jorde claimed it was inadvertently submitted, which was enforced by the blank notarization. The board “found it troubling” Jorde did not withdraw the filing upon learning it had been inadvertently filed.
The board concluded that the “severity of the misrepresentation issues” did not “rise to level” of many previously prosecuted matters, but “the duty of candor is one of the most basic and fundamental obligations we require of lawyers.”
Jorde did not file any exceptions to the reprimand within the allowed 30-day window, meaning the reprimand was made “final and public” according to the document.
In a message to Iowa Capital Dispatch, Jorde said his focus remains on his clients.
“I decided not to contest this matter and have moved on,” Jorde wrote.
There is no further disciplinary action beyond the public reprimand.
Federal appeals court denies request for rehearing
A federal appeals court denied a rehearing petition Monday from Iowa counties involved in a case against Summit Carbon Solutions regarding a county’s ability to enact local pipeline ordinances.
Shelby and Story County supervisors petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit for an en banc rehearing earlier this month following the judge’s ruling in favor of Summit in June.
One judge dissented in the majority opinion that all of the ordinances set by the counties would be preempted by the Pipeline Safety Act.
An en banc rehearing, as requested by the counties and supported via amicus briefs from the states of Minnesota, Michigan, Oregon, Vermont and from Pipeline Safety Trust, would require a rehearing of the case with all 11 active judges at the appeals court.
The order denying the petition for rehearing did not include any additional information or opinion from the judge.

(Photo by Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The beleaguered technology Louisiana has relied upon for driver’s licenses and vehicle registrations since the 1970s heyday of the Volkswagen Beetle is being junked and replaced with a newer, sleeker model, Gov. Jeff Landry announced Tuesday.
The state is upgrading its software for the Office of Motor Vehicles, allowing Louisiana to move on from the system it’s used for more than 50 years, according to the governor.
The new system from Champ, a Cleveland, Ohio-based software company, will provide drivers and vehicle owners with access to the state OMV online and through a smart device application.  
The agreement between Louisiana and Champ will cost the state $30 million and give the company two years to complete its OMV upgrade, according to the governor’s office. 
Louisiana joins the list of states where Champ, founded in 2018, provides services. West Virginia hired Champ in 2021 to handle its vehicle title and registration. In 2023, Kentucky brought in the company to handle its vehicle titles and liens, and New Jersey and Illinois have also reached contracts with the business since then.

The Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi commissioned a new sculpture to replace a monument to a historic Abenaki chief, but the plan has drawn opposition from a state legislator in Burlington.

Burlington officials are moving ahead with plans to replace a monument to an Abenaki chief with a new sculpture commissioned by the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi, which is one of four groups recognized as Native American by Vermont’s state government.
But the Missisquoi group’s involvement in the project has spurred protest from one of Burlington’s state representatives, who has also been a vocal critic of the state’s past tribal recognition decisions. Independent Rep. Troy Headrick told Burlington officials last month they should seek input on the project from two Abenaki nations based in Quebec, where tribal leaders maintain that many members of Vermont’s state-recognized tribes can’t claim continuous ties to historic Abenaki people, or to any Indigenous people.
“It is deeply concerning that the Abenaki communities at Odanak and Wôlinak, whose documented ancestral ties to this region are well established, have not been consulted in this decision-making process,” Headrick wrote in an email about the monument plans to Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak and her chief of staff. He shared the message with VTDigger.
Headrick’s comments have brought contentious questions about Abenaki identity in Vermont before Burlington city leaders. These questions have also colored state legislative debates in Montpelier and other nearby state capitals this year.
At issue in Burlington is a sculpture known as “Chief Greylock” that was installed in the city’s Battery Park in the late 1980s. Greylock was an Abenaki chief who is famed today for leading Abenaki people during wars against English colonists in the 18th century.
The sculpture was “named and embraced by the Abenaki community,” although it was not a direct representation of Indigenous people historically in Vermont, according to a memo about the project from Doreen Kraft, executive director of Burlington City Arts, a nonprofit that supports artists in the city.

Moreover, Kraft told the Burlington City Council earlier this month, city officials have been worried about the structural integrity of the wooden statue for years. An analysis last fall found that it was significantly rotted inside and in danger of collapsing.
Following that report, officials decided the artwork should be taken down for public safety, Kraft said. The sculpture was taken down last Thursday, with only its base left, according to Joe Magee, a spokesperson for the mayor’s office.
In its place, Burlington plans to put up a new wooden sculpture donated to the city by the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi, which is based in Swanton. Under a March 2022 resolution approved by the city council, the Missisquoi group is, “the tribal authority to represent Abenaki matters” between local Abenaki people and the city government.
The new sculpture, according to photos in city council documents, has a similar shape to its predecessor though adds on clear references to the Missisquoi group, including the group’s flag and the words “Missisquoi Abenaki.” It also bears carvings of wildlife and an “Indian head,” Brenda Gagne, the Missisquoi chief, said in an interview.
The piece is meant to focus on Missisquoi’s history more broadly, rather than on Greylock, himself, Gagne said.

But Headrick told city officials in an email that decisions about the design of the new sculpture should have included input from other sources. Among those sources, he wrote, should have been Odanak and Wôlinak First Nations, both of which are headquartered northeast of Montreal but claim Vermont as part of their ancestral territory.
The First Nations’ leaders have argued for years that many members of the four groups the state of Vermont recognized as Abenaki in 2011 and 2012 are, in fact, not Indigenous. Odanak and Wôlinak leaders have accused the state-recognized groups of appropriating Abenaki culture. In letters and public statements, the First Nations’ leaders have also urged organizations in Vermont to work with them, rather than the Vermont-based groups, when seeking Indigenous people’s perspectives.
The groups that the state of Vermont has recognized have asserted that they can, in fact, claim Abenaki identities and have repeatedly urged the First Nations to stay out of their affairs. In addition to the Missisquoi, those groups include the Elnu Abenaki, Nulhegan Abenaki and the Koasek Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation.
Several weeks after Headrick’s email to the mayor’s office, city officials pulled an item off the agenda for a July 14 city council meeting that would have allowed the city to formally accept the new sculpture already commissioned by the Missisquoi group.

In an interview Monday, Magee characterized that decision as a temporary pause so the city can do further structural analysis of the old sculpture’s base, which is set to also be used for the new one. He said the delay in formally accepting the new sculpture was not due to questions about tribal identity or legitimacy, and emphasized that the city still plans to accept the new artwork.
Magee said the city has not reached out to Odanak or Wôlinak leaders. He would not say whether or not the city planned to reach out to them. He emphasized that the city would continue to abide by the 2022 agreement to work with the Missisquoi group.
“The city has had a good working relationship with the Missisquoi Abenaki tribal council since the adoption of the resolution in 2022, and you know, we want to continue and maintain that relationship,” he said. 
“The administration is aware of the conversations happening on a larger level,” he added, referring to assertions about the Vermont groups’ legitimacy. “And the city does have an interest in figuring out how we can engage with other bands, other tribal councils, to fully honor Burlington’s history — and the history of Burlington land as Indigenous land,” he said.

Daniel Nolett, the executive director of Odanak First Nation’s tribal government, said in an interview Tuesday that he hoped Headrick’s outreach would prompt Burlington officials to contact him or someone else in his office. 
Nolett said his family is directly related to Greylock. While he understands that the now removed sculpture was a public safety threat, he added, he wished he had gotten a heads-up from the city.
“The statue was in the state that it was — it posed a safety issue, so it had to be taken down,” he said. “That’s not an issue. The only issue is that we should have been part of this project for the new statue.”

For example, Ellsworth, who is a member of the advisory committee planning Idaho’s component of the America250 celebration, unveiled a “Spudjamin Franklin” mascot. 
Idahoans can see the new patriotic squid mascot Aug. 2 at the American Falls Day and again Aug. 9 at the Chubbuck Days, according to a press release issued Tuesday by the Idaho State Treasurer’s Office.
“Spudjamin Franklin” is one of several Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies that Ellsworth says she reimagined from the more classic Spuddy Buddy mascot deployed by the Idaho Potato Commission. 
  Lindsey Vonn of Team United States, shares a moment with Spuddy Buddy, the mascot of the Idaho Potato Commission, on March 23, 2025, in Sun Valley, Idaho. Vonn took second place during the Audi FIS Alpine Ski World Cup Men’s and Women’s Super G, becoming the oldest woman to take the podium in a skiing World Cup at age 40. Established in 1937, the Idaho Potato Commission is a state agency that is responsible for promoting and protecting the famous “Grown in Idaho” seal, a federally registered trademark that assures consumers they are purchasing genuine, top-quality Idaho potatoes, according to its website.

During the events in American Falls and Chubbuck next month, members of the public can sign up to be an America250 ambassador in Idaho and sign their name digitally to a commemorative copy of the Declaration of Independence that will be displayed at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
Spudjamin Franklin and other Revolutionary Spuddy Buddies will then make appearances at public events across the state promoting America250.
“This is your chance to become an ambassador for America250!” Ellsworth’s office wrote in a written statement Tuesday. “Join us to sign the Declaration of Independence for America250 in Idaho, capture unforgettable moments with this delightfully whimsical Revolutionary Spuddy Buddy and honor our country’s revolutionary history.”
Earlier this year, a legislative advisory council planning the America250 in Idaho celebration cancelled grants for 29 of 31 nonprofit and arts organizations that had been notified that they were receiving grants ranging from $4,000 to $25,000, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. The grants were cancelled after the Idaho Legislature gave the advisory council control of the funding for the America250 in Idaho celebrations to the advisory council, the Sun reported. 
One of the two of the legislators who chairs the advisory committee, Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, told the Sun he wanted all the expenses for the grant money to be hyper-focused on the America250 celebration and the founding of America.
More information about the America250 in Idaho program is available online.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole has granted Ralph Menzies a commutation hearing ahead of the death row inmate’s Sept. 5 firing squad execution.  
During the hearing, the board will decide whether to grant Menzies clemency, which would spare him from execution and instead impose a life sentence without the possibility of parole.
That’s never happened in Utah, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center.
During the hearing, both Menzies and the state will be able to call witnesses to testify for, and against, granting clemency. Neither party will be able to cross-examine witnesses. 
‘Time is ticking’: Judge to decide whether Ralph Menzies should get another review before execution

The board has not yet set a date for the hearing. 
Menzies’ attorneys have argued that the 67-year-old inmate is suffering from a severe form of vascular dementia that continues to advance, making him incompetent and therefore ineligible for execution. Both state and federal law require that death row inmates have an understanding of why they’re being executed — Menzies’ dementia is so bad he lacks that understanding, his attorneys say. 
After a monthslong competency review, a judge found that Menzies does have dementia, but doesn’t meet the high bar to be deemed incompetent. Last week, the court heard arguments for and against granting Menzies another competency review, with the death row inmate’s attorneys claiming that in the time since his initial evaluation, which was done last year, his dementia has worsened. 
Utah’s 3rd District Judge Matthew Bates is currently considering whether to grant him another review. If the judge rules in favor of Menzies, it could kick off a 60-day process where a medical professional examines the inmate and compiles a report for the court — depending on the report’s findings, Menzies could be found incompetent, and spared from execution.
Menzies was convicted of murder in 1988 after he kidnapped Maurine Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk, and took her up Big Cottonwood Canyon where she was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed.

Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, fields questions during a roundtable discussion at Avera Behavioral Health Hospital in Sioux Falls on July 29, 2025. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota health professionals and advocates are warning that new Medicaid work requirements could disrupt care for people struggling with substance use disorders and other behavioral health problems.
Angela Kennecke, CEO of the addiction-focused nonprofit Emily’s Hope, said people with a history of addiction often have criminal records. She said that means they face steep obstacles in the job market.
“If you can’t get a job, you lose coverage,” she said. “But without coverage, you can’t get treatment. That’s the cycle we’re concerned about.”
Kennecke spoke to South Dakota Searchlight after a roundtable discussion organized by U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, on Tuesday at Avera Behavioral Health Hospital. 
SD providers hope over $500 million for rural health care offsets expected Medicaid coverage losses

Wyatt Urlacher, a clinical social worker with South Dakota Urban Indian Health, told the roundtable he’s worried, and “I’m sure I’m not the only one.”
“The majority of my clients are covered by Medicaid,” he said. 
Kim Malsam-Rysdon, Avera’s vice president of public policy and a former South Dakota secretary of health, talked with South Dakota Searchlight after the discussion. 
“We know that people who have access to health insurance, whether that’s Medicaid or anything else, are more likely to get the care they need earlier,” Malsam-Rysdon said. “So it’s a big concern for us when folks may lose their health care coverage for whatever reason.”
Medicaid is a federal-state program that pays for the health care of low-income people. Under the new federal policy in the Big Beautiful Bill Act, Medicaid recipients will be required to log 80 hours a month of work, job training, education or volunteering to keep their benefits. 
Johnson defended the new Medicaid requirements, highlighting the list of exemptions.
“What people don’t understand is that seniors, young people, pregnant women, people with children, folks with disabilities, people in areas with high unemployment, veterans and tribal members are unaffected by the work requirement,” Johnson said.


Federal fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


A March 3 analysis in the journal Health Affairs estimated that 2.29 million Medicaid enrollees with a substance use disorder in the U.S. would still be at high risk of losing coverage under a work requirement that includes exemptions for people with disabilities, those looking for work, or in school or training. That is largely due to the number of people with a substance use disorder who are unable to meet a work requirement.
Taylor Clark, the operations supervisor at Choices Recovery Services in Sioux Falls, told South Dakota Searchlight that 95% of the people who seek care there are Medicaid recipients, and few of those people are employed. Clark said that without Medicaid for those seeking care, services may be in jeopardy. 
A $50 billion fund created by the bill to help rural providers deal with lost Medicaid reimbursements is expected to bring at least $500 million to South Dakota over five years. But Johnson said the money is temporary rather than permanent.
“This is not a forever pot of money,” Johnson told Searchlight. “States should not use this to just fund ongoing operations. They need to ask themselves, ‘How do we use this money to transition to a better system?’”
Johnson said providers should invest in technologies to help deliver greater access to cost-effective health care.
The Medicaid work requirement will take effect nationally at the end of 2026.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) MOORHEAD, Minn. — A leader of the BadAss Grandmas for Democracy on Monday encouraged voters to push back against two proposals from the North Dakota Legislature to change the state constitution.
Dina Butcher, part of the group that was the driving force behind creating the Ethics Commission in North Dakota, said the two measures are the Legislature’s way of discouraging citizen-initiated measures to change the constitution. 
One measure would require approval of 60% of the state’s voters to pass an initiated measure; the other would limit citizen initiated measures to a single subject. 
The BadAss Grandmas, during an event at the Moorhead Public Library, noted that if either measure had been in place in 2018, the year North Dakota voters approved creating the Ethics Commission, the commission would not exist today. 
BadAss Grandmas want you to get involved for democracy

Voters in 2018 approved Measure 1 creating the Ethics Commission with about 54% of the vote. The measure also covered changes to campaign finance contributions, rule changes for lobbyists and conflict of interest rules. 
In 2026, the 60% ballot measure will be voted on during the November general election. The single subject rule will be on the ballot in the June 2026 primary. 
“Both of those measures are very much undermining the voice of the people,” Vicki Voldal Rosenau of Valley City said from the audience. 
In supporting the 60% approval threshold during the legislative session, Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, said the state’s constitution should have a higher standard than changing state law. 
North Dakota voters in 2024 rejected a measure that would have limited future measures to a single subject, among other changes.  
The Legislature approved a third topic for a statewide vote in 2026. Voters in the November election will consider changes to the term limits provision added to the state constitution in 2022. 
If passed, lawmakers would be able to serve for up to 16 years in one chamber. It also clarifies that partial terms, such as being appointed by a district executive committee to fill a vacant seat in the Legislature, would not count toward the term limit total.
A yes vote also would also repeal a section of the term limit law that prohibits the Legislature from amending, repealing or altering the term limits portion of the law.
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

The BadAss Grandmas presentation focused on the history of the group that created 2018’s Measure 1 and the struggles to implement the Ethics Commission in the years since. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong has questioned the scope of the commission’s authority and 
Attorney General Drew Wrigley recently accused Ethics Commission Executive Director Rebecca Binstock and her staff of inexperience and poor judgment.
The allegations came after the Ethics Commission released a report that stated the Attorney General’s Office did not fully cooperate with a commission investigation. Wrigley has denied this claim.

Butcher said she believes the Governor’s Office and Attorney General’s Office are undermining the commission.
“The opposition that we’re facing now from both the governor’s office and the attorney general, recently maligning our present executive director … is really, really irritating,” Butcher said. 
The Ethics Commission has said it is examining its relationship with the Attorney General’s Office. 
Ellen Chaffee, a former Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, led Monday’s discussion for the BadAss Grandmas. She said she had been advised that it would take 10 years to implement the Ethics Commission. 
“We’re working with the ethics staff as best we can,” Chaffee said, but encouraged attendees to let elected officials know there is support for the commission. 
Butcher, a former Republican candidate for North Dakota agriculture commissioner, was recognized at an event before the presentation for her work with the BadAss Grandmas. Butcher is moving to Washington state.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – State Superintendent Ryan Walters on Tuesday suggested Oklahoma’s governor was behind allegations that pictures of nude women were seen on his office television.
He insisted that an investigation had cleared him of wrongdoing.
Without citing any evidence, Walters implied that fellow Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt had encouraged state Board of Education members to fabricate claims that they saw nude women on his television during the closed door meeting last week.
“The governor needs to answer the questions,” Walters said during a brief, hastily called press conference at the Capitol in which he only took a few questions. “Did he tell these board members to come in here and do this? Did you coordinate with them afterwards to set all this up after the fact when you couldn’t disrupt the meeting?”
He said he met Monday with the Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office, and that they concluded none of his devices were connected to the television.
The Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office said that the probe into what happened during an State Department of Education executive session was in its early stages.
“No, we have not cleared him,” said Aaron Brilbeck, a spokesman for the Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office. “Yes, our investigation is ongoing. This is in its infancy. We don’t just do an investigation in an hour and a half.”
Stitt’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Stitt appointed board members Becky Carson and Ryan Deatherage, who last week told The Oklahoman and NonDoc that they had seen the women on the television screen, which was behind Walters’ back. Carson told the media outlets that she asked Walters to turn it off, which he did.
Stitt recently shook up the board, replacing three members after he said there was too much political drama. Some of the new board members have openly questioned Walters’ policy ideas.
Deatherage, when contacted Tuesday, declined to answer questions but said a statement would be put out soon. Carson could not be reached for comment.
The Office of Management and Enterprise Services asked Oklahoma County Sheriff Tommie Johnson to investigate after Carson filed a complaint, records show.
The Office of Management and Enterprise Services did not return a phone call seeking comment or respond to a request for a copy of Carson’s complaint.
Walters said his office television is hooked up to cable, not any of his electronic devices.
“These board members decided to construct a lie to destroy my character again,” Walters said.
He said the board members are attempting to stop education reform.
Walters also lashed out at the teacher’s union and the news media.
“Those individuals that tried to assassinate my character and print and publish things that are demonstrably false and provably false will be hearing from us and all of Oklahomans very, very soon,” Walters said.

(Daily Montanan file photo)Advocates worried about rises in property insurance rates are hoping a new legislative study will help lawmakers find an answer to why they’re soaring.
In a letter to the interim Economic Affairs Committee, the Consumer Federation of America said nationally, property insurance costs rose 8.7% from 2018 to 2022. Data beyond that — including at the state-level — is difficult to find, which was part of the reason the legislature ordered a study. 
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners kept the data public until 2022, the letter says, and hasn’t released certain localized data from the report.
“In requesting this study, the Legislature identified the critical information gap regarding Montana’s property insurance market,” the letter states.
Information that at “minimum” should be collected includes home insurance policies, with the letter expressing hope rental properties and condominium housing information would be collected, as well as insurance collected by low-income housing developers.
State Auditor and Insurance Commissioner James Brown called the study “timely and relevant” in comments to the interim committee on July 22. Property casualty insurers made profits of $169 billion in 2024, according to research by the American Association for Justice.
“Dealing with the exploding cost of insurance in Montana is one of my top priorities,” Brown said in a response to a question from Rep. Mark Noland, a Bigfork Republican.
Along with wildfires and climate impacts, taxes, skyrocketing property values and the rising cost of building materials all are contributing to higher insurance rates. 
Brown directly tied the problem into property taxes, which have exploded during the last decade, a topic that vexed the 2025 Legislature. 
“So as the value of the home goes up, not only do property taxes go up, but the cost of insuring the home correspondingly goes up,” Brown said.
Adding to the problem is that rebuilding costs are also going up. In Montana — and across the country — nonrenewal rates are also increasing, another problem, according to a zip code level map created by advocacy organization Public Citizen.
Nonrenewal rates are increased rates by companies which raise them based on both wildfire risk and a company’s desire not to insure certain properties. Those rates are usually high, sometimes prohibitively so.
Wildfires are also increasing in Montana, Brown said, yet another problem for insurers. The Legislature took some steps during the session to address the fire issue, including allowing insurance companies to offer incentives to property owners who make efforts to make their homes more defensible against wildfire. 
Brown called that a “good step” and said there was ongoing work to educate the public on preemptive fire mitigation measures.
Some advocates are pushing for using less flammable building materials, as well as better design practices when creating blueprints. Location matters, as does building deeper into the wildland-urban interface areas.
“The developer first mentality has given us a more expensive Montana, but it also means that all your other underwriting goes up,” said Jayson O’Neill, a policy and political advocate who worked for former Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer. “Insurers are applying higher risk values to communities and individual homeowners based on these things and these development patterns, but not reciprocating when we actually do the right thing and mitigate (fire risk).”
O’Neill, who lives in Helena, pointed to projects to reduce fire risk in the city’s south hills. It makes sense to him home insurance rates would be impacted to some degree by fire mitigation efforts in the area. But without data that organizations can use to determine trends, it’s hard to know exactly what insurance companies are doing, he said.
“Consumers aren’t knowing these risk factors, they’re only learning about them after a disaster happens,” O’Neill said. “Why isn’t your insurance company that you pay all this money to providing you with more information about what’s affecting your rate; risk areas that they’re concerned about, and again, empowering the consumer to make good choices about how they can ‘derisk.’”
The warming climate is amplifying wildfires according to NASA, which tracks fires via satellite. And climate change is impacting insurance, organizations giving public comment during the committee meeting stated.
“It’s increasing insurance risk and affecting costs, it’s essential that Montana prepare for the challenges ahead, and by doing a thorough and comprehensive study,” Michael DeLong, a lobbyist with the Consumer Federation of America told the committee. “You can ensure that Montana is prepared and figure out ways to reduce risk and lower insurance costs.”
Regardless, homes in areas that burn frequently can see higher insurance rates. 
The statistics around wildfires paint a grim picture. 
According to Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit research group, wildfires are the fastest growing cause of hazard-related damages in the U.S. Losses from wildfires have also doubled as a proportion of total disaster claims in the last 30 years. Nine out of 10 of the most destructive fires in American history have happened since 2017.
Disasters are generally getting more expensive, and according to federal data, the number of billion-dollar disasters has risen dramatically since the 1980. The National Center for Environmental Information — inflation adjusted — reported 28 disasters that cost more than $1 billion in 2023 and 27 in 2024. In 1985, the highest year for billion-dollar disasters between 1980 and 1998, there were seven. 
Wildfire risk is increasing, with issues around insurance reaching extremes in California — between 2020 and 2022, companies in that state declined 2.8 million new policies.
Other states like Alabama have made moves to strengthen homes against storms. In Florida, the state government was forced to create an “insurance of last resort” for homes that are no longer covered by any private company.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_7117-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-29 18:56:48.663527

Craig Strong who oversees the Nebraska National Guard and Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, right, joins Gov. Jim Pillen at a news conference to celebrate legislation for Guard recruitment and retention. Dec. 10, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The U.S. Small Business Administration this week approved a disaster declaration for six central Nebraska counties following late June storms and opened eligibility for certain low-interest loans.
The declaration covers the counties of Adams, Buffalo, Hall, Hamilton, Howard and Merrick in response to severe storms and flooding that occurred June 25-26. Gov. Jim Pillen requested the disaster declaration on Thursday. He expressed his gratitude Tuesday that the agency recognized the storm’s “extreme damage.”
“This disaster declaration will help businesses and homeowners in the affected communities get the assistance they need to get back on their feet,” Pillen said in a statement.
Businesses and nonprofits can apply for business physical disaster loans and borrow up to $2 million to repair or replace disaster-damaged or destroyed real estate, machinery and equipment, inventory and other business assets.
Homeowners and renters can apply for home and personal property loans and borrow up to $100,000 to replace or repair personal property, including clothing, furniture, cars and appliances. Homeowners can additionally apply for up to $500,000 to replace or repair their primary residence.
Some applicants may be eligible for a loan increase up to 20% of physical damage, as verified by the Small Business Administration, “for mitigation purposes.” That includes insulating pipes, walls and attics, weather stripping doors and windows and installing storm windows.
The Small Business Administration’s separate Economic Injury Disaster Loan program is open for eligible small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, nurseries and private nonprofits. Most agricultural producers are ineligible.
The economic injury loans are for “working capital needs” caused by the disaster, such as to cover debts, payroll or other bills, even if a business or nonprofit didn’t suffer physical damage.
Loan amounts and terms will be set on each applicant’s financial condition. The first payment would not be due until one year after the first loan disbursement, and interest would not accrue until after the first year either. Interest rates can be as low as 4% for small businesses, 3.625% for nonprofits and 2.813% for homeowners and renters with terms up to 30 years.
The deadline to return physical damage applications is Sept. 26. The deadline for economic injury applications is April 28, 2026.
Applications can be submitted online at sba.gov/disaster, and applicants can call SBA’s Customer Service Center at 800-659-2955 or email them at disastercustomerservice@sba.gov.
Beginning Wednesday at noon, federal customer service representatives will be available in person at a Disaster Loan Outreach Center in Grand Island, 1210 N. North Road, to help answer questions about the disaster loan program and assist with applications. 
The location is open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Those wishing to visit the center are encouraged to schedule an appointment at appointment.sba.gov, but walk-ins are accepted.
“When disasters strike, SBA’s Disaster Loan Outreach Centers play a vital role in helping small businesses and their communities recover,” Chris Stallings, associate administrator of the Office of Disaster Recovery and Resilience at the SBA, said in a statement. “At these centers, SBA specialists assist business owners and residents with disaster loan applications and provide information on the full range of recovery programs available.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-29 22:47:42+00:00,Mississippi Today,Report pans city’s role in Holly Springs utility issues,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/29/report-pans-citys-role-in-holly-springs-utility-issues/,PSC-contracted consultant recommends Mississippi take control of Holly Springs beleaguered utility department from city.,"A third-party investigation released Tuesday recommends  the state remove control of the Holly Springs Utility Department from the city following years of constant power issues for its 12,000 customers.
Silverpoint Consulting, which the state’s Public Service Commission contracted to study the depth of Holly Springs’ problems, wrote that the city appears “incapable” of implementing any recommended solutions.
“Allowing them any more time would be fruitless as well as disrespectful to the utility’s long-suffering customers,” the investigation says. 
The city of Holly Springs recently elected a new mayor, Charles Terry, but his office did not response to a request for comment on Tuesday.
The PSC enlisted Silverpoint last year after state legislation gave the regulator authority to intervene in Holly Springs, which since 1935 has provided power through the federally controlled Tennessee Valley Authority. That bill came after years of complaints from Holly Springs customers about constant power outages. Those issues peaked during an ice storm in 2023, when some lost electricity for about two weeks.

The legislation also allows the PSC, if it finds the utility can’t provide “reasonably adequate electric service,” to request a court-ordered receivership for the utility. While Silverpoint found that Holly Springs falls below that standard, it said it may be challenging to find a receiver willing to take on the struggling provider. The consultant instead recommends exploring one of the following options: selling the utility to another city or cooperative utility; converting it to a cooperative to open up access to low-interest loans; or eminent domain or condemnation.
While Holly Springs’ mayor and board of aldermen are in charge of the power department, about two-thirds of the utility’s customers live outside the city limits, meaning most ratepayers can’t vote for officials with local control.
Silverpoint said after beginning its investigation last August, it was unable to obtain much information from the city for roughly six months. Most information the city did provide, which it didn’t send until this spring, was “non-responsive or irrelevant” to the investigation, the report says.
Silverpoint found an array of issues, some of which had been noted in previous reports Mississippi Today covered earlier this year: remote metering that has been out of service for three months, requiring utility workers to read all meters manually and delaying when bills are issued; a “rudimentary” work order system with a backlog of nearly 2,000 items; having a 16-year-old system map, pushing back restoration times;  and having no emergency response or vegetation management plan. 
The report also noted several personnel issues. The utility’s superintendent is “well into his 80s,” it said, which is “well beyond the maximum retirement age allowable at most any other utility.” After not having a full-time general manager for years, the city also hired a former bridge inspector, Wayne Jones, with no utility or electric engineering experience, Silverpoint wrote.

“We believe our report makes clear that the City and (utility department) lack sufficient technical, operational, and management expertise to effectively reverse the downward trajectory this electric system has been on for some time,” the report says. 
Silverpoint also echoed a point brought up in TVA’s recent lawsuit against the city: “For decades, City leadership systematically drained utility resources through excessive PILOT payments, continuing to milk a starving cash cow to fund its other municipal expenses.”
Holly Springs’ contract with TVA allows it to take payments in lieu of taxes, or PILOT funds, but only after it addresses all of its utility costs. 
“The Silverpoint report lays bare just how dire the situation is at Holly Springs Utility District,” Northern District Public Service Commissioner Chris Brown said in a statement. “This crisis didn’t happen overnight — it’s the result of decades of neglect and mismanagement.
The PSC attempted to schedule a hearing over the matter in January, but agreed to postpone the matter until after the last legislative session. Richard Stone, a spokesperson for Brown, said while the PSC hasn’t yet scheduled the hearing it will address the issue during its next docket meeting on Aug. 5.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185726/3X0A1745-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-29 18:56:48.663527

More than a hundred former judges from around the nation had signed a letter urging Nevada judges not to do so.  (Screengrab from Chattah 2022 campaign video)With one day remaining in her term as Nevada’s Interim U.S. Attorney, Republican firebrand Sigal Chattah caught a lifeline from President Donald Trump Tuesday that could keep her in office for another 210 days, albeit with another title. 
Under a provision of the Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, Chattah, thanks to Trump, will swap the ‘interim’ designation, which entitled her to 120 days in office, for ‘acting,’ and another 210 days on the job, and potentially while a nomination is pending in Congress, should Trump nominate her. 
“By bypassing the Senate and naming Sigal Chattah as an ‘acting’ U.S. attorney, it’s clear the Trump administration knows Ms. Chattah is unconfirmable,” Nevada’s senior U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement. “This unprecedented maneuver sets a dangerous standard and risks holding up critical criminal cases just so that President Trump can play political games. At the end of the day, my position remains the same: Sigal Chattah is unfit for this role.” 
The default rule of the Vacancies Act, according to a congressional overview, is for the first assistant to take over as acting officer. “Alternatively, the President may direct either certain senior officials of the agency or any Senate-confirmed official to serve as the acting officer.”
“This is an outrageous attempt by the Trump Administration to try to install extremist Sigal Chattah as Acting U.S. Attorney for Nevada and keep her in that role indefinitely, Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen said in a statement. “Trump knows Chattah would be soundly rejected by both sides of the aisle if she had to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, which is why he’s relying on an unconstitutional maneuver to illegally extend her temporary appointment that was set to expire today.” 
“I will continue doing everything I can to block any permanent appointment of extremist Sigal Chattah as Nevada’s U.S. Attorney. She is deeply unfit for this role, and I call on the legal system to immediately remove her,” Rosen said.
Had Chattah’s appointment expired, Nevada’s U.S. District judges would have been empowered to appoint her or a replacement, as the Current reported last week. 
When the term of New Jersey’s Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, Trump’s former personal attorney, expired this week, federal judges appointed another prosecutor to the office. However, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the employee, Desiree Leigh Grace, to prevent her ascension. Habba is the president’s former personal attorney.
In a letter Monday, 116 former jurists from around the U.S. urged the Nevada judges “not to entrust Chattah with authority we fear she will misuse.”
Appointing Chattah, who “is known for incendiary rhetoric and a record of urging weaponization of law enforcement for political ends,” according to the former judges, “would endanger Nevadans and the rule of law.”
During her unsuccessful run in 2022 for Nevada attorney general, Chattah declared her Democratic opponent, incumbent Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Black man, “should be hanging from a f–king crane”; longed for fewer “pronoun badges” and transgender individuals in America, while describing them with an offensive slur; and invited comparisons with Sen. Joe McCarthy and former Pres. Donald Trump by calling for the imprisonment of political foes. 
Norm Eisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Action, one of two organizations that spearheaded the letter, said the 116former jurists agree that “Chattah’s shocking racist and violence-tinged rhetoric should disqualify her from this office.”
“Our system of equal justice under law depends on prosecutors that put their duty to the law above all else,” said Greg Nunziatta, executive director of the Society for the Rule of Law. “This Administration has a disturbing pattern of entrusting Justice Department leadership positions to individuals ill-suited to such roles, often evading the Senate confirmation process to do so.”
“The role of a United States Attorney demands honesty, integrity, impartiality, judgment, and deep respect for the rule of law,” said Michael Luttig, a retired judge who served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. “Based on Ms. Chattah’s public statements and conduct, we do not believe she even arguably meets this standard.”
Chattah did not respond to requests for comment.
In a social media post Tuesday, Chattah wrote: “Donald J. Trump is the 47th President.
Pam Bondi is the Attorney General. I am now the Acting United States Attorney for the District of Nevada and Special Attorney to the Attorney General.

Santiago/Getty Images) Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser joined a lawsuit Tuesday challenging a “defunding” provision congressional Republicans passed in their recent massive tax and spending law, which the lawsuit says directly targets Planned Parenthood. 
The challenged provision blocks Medicaid funding from going to any sexual and reproductive health clinics that provide abortions and received more than $800,000 in federal and state Medicaid funding in fiscal year 2023. 
The provision, which Planned Parenthood said directly targets their services, could affect Medicaid reimbursements for standard reproductive health care including cancer screenings, birth control, and testing for sexually transmitted infections. Planned Parenthood clinics rely heavily on Medicaid funding to offer those services at little to no cost, and Weiser’s office said the provision would threaten at least 200 clinics across the country.

More than 1.1 million people could lose access to care if Planned Parenthood clinics close. A May study from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health, found that other clinics for low-income patients would not have the capacity to absorb patients that get care from Planned Parenthood.  
The lawsuit, filed with 22 other Democratic-led states, argues the “defund” provision is ambiguous and violates Congress’ spending clause power. The states seek a court order prohibiting enforcement of the provision in their states, as they argue it will harm their states’ public health and economy. 
“Congress specifically included the Defund Provision in the massive spending bill to target and punish Planned Parenthood for providing abortion access and advocating for reproductive health options for patients,” Weiser said in a statement. “Coloradans continually have made it clear that they support reproductive health care and we are suing the administration to stop it from implementing the provision and leaving states with higher costs for care in the long-term.” 
On Monday, a federal judge granted an injunction in a lawsuit the Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed challenging the same provision of the Trump administration’s signature policy law days after the president signed it. The judge said the law unfairly targets Planned Parenthood without a trial and violates free speech constitutional rights by preventing the organization from advocating for reproductive health care.
Weiser spokesperson Lawrence Pacheco said in a statement to Newsline that the lawsuit “asserts claims and harms specific to the states” under the provision of the Republican policy law barring Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. He said the provision does not provide clear notice of the states’ obligations. 
“Moreover, the harms to the people of Colorado are significant where many Coloradans rely on Planned Parenthood for healthcare,” Pacheco said. “Filing a separate action ensures that the states may advocate to prevent these harms.”
Since Trump took office in January, Weiser has joined more than 30 lawsuits challenging actions from the administration. He has seen favorable rulings, preliminary or permanent, in the majority of those cases.

Michelle Lujan Grisham hosted seven Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives in the state capitol on Tuesday to discuss their Republican counterparts’ plans to redraw Texas’ congressional map during an overtime special legislative session.
The meeting on the fourth floor of the Roundhouse in Santa Fe lasted more than an hour and came during heightened national attention on New Mexico’s eastern neighbor. President Donald Trump earlier this month said he wants the Texas map redone in order to gain five Republican seats in Congress.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott added redistricting to the Texas Legislature’s special session agenda, citing “constitutional concerns” raised by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Texas Tribune reports. In Santa Fe on Tuesday, Democratic State Rep. John Rosenthal told reporters in a news conference after the meeting with Lujan Grisham that Abbot did so “at the behest of the president” rather than listening to his constituents.
“We have had pretty close to 2,000 Texans show up at field hearings around the state,” said Rosenthal, who represents northwest Houston and is vice chair of the Texas House Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting. “It’s not an overwhelming majority — it’s basically all but one person is against letting somebody from Washington D.C. dictate when Texas draws its boundaries.”
In the meeting with the governor, which was closed to the press, Texas House Speaker Pro Tempore Joe Moody said Lujan Grisham voiced support for the Texas lawmakers and committed to using her connections to other governors to “encourage everybody who is willing to stand in this fight with us to join with us.”
“It’s not just about five seats in Texas,” Moody said. “This is a national problem and we’re here to sound the alarm: It may start in Texas, but it’s not going to end there, and we need our friends across the country to stand with us.”
Lujan Grisham did not join the lawmakers for the news conference. Spokesperson Michael Coleman told Source NM on Tuesday she is not not currently considering placing redistricting reform on the call for a special session.
“It would not shock me if the minority party in New Mexico attempted something similar, but I don’t see any real possibility that our Legislature would take it up,” Lujan Grisham told Source in an emailed statement. “I certainly I would not support that.”
Other Texas Democratic lawmakers recently visited with governors in California and Illinois for the same purpose, Moody said. They’re enlisting help from “strong governors around the country that govern like adults and put the needs of the people ahead of the political expediency of the party,” Rosenthal said.

Greg Abbott added redistricting to the Texas Legislature’s special session agenda “at the behest of” President Donald Trump rather than listening to his constituents.

First among those needs right now, the visiting lawmakers said, is responding to the deadly flash flooding in Texas over the Fourth of July weekend.
Rep. Josey Garcia of San Antonio said she and about 15 friends and fellow military veterans volunteered to form search, rescue and recovery teams who returned victims’ bodies to their families.
Garcia said when Abbott called the Texas Legislature into a 30-day special session, she was excited to share her first-hand account as part of a coordinated disaster response and an attempt to prevent future ones. Instead, she said, she had to sit through redistricting hearings while recovery efforts continue.
“People are still missing in the Hill Country,” Garcia said. “As we’re sitting in those hearings, I’m fielding questions from the Hill Country community, asking me where I’m at, why am I not there, they need to see me right now.”
Moody, of El Paso, said there is a close relationship between his community and Southern New Mexico, and the lawmakers asked Lujan Grisham about New Mexico’s response to flooding in the Ruidoso area.
“They’re putting those issues of emergency up front, that’s really the big difference,” Moody said. “That’s where our focus should be.”
Instead, Texas lawmakers who are opposed to redistricting right now are ensuring “our districts and our state [aren’t] stripped of the freedoms we have for representation,” said Garcia, secretary of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, whip of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus and secretary of the LGBTQ House Caucus.
Policy advocates from the Texas and California chapters of the nonpartisan election integrity group Common Cause said Tuesday state governments led by Democrats should not try to do their own mid-decade redistricting to counter Republicans, States Newsroom reports. They instead suggested that more states create nonpartisan redistricting commissions.
While New Mexico has had to adjust its political maps between census counts because of lawsuits and federal DOJ rules, the state has never undertaken mid-decade redistricting, Fair Districts for New Mexico Project Manager Dick Mason told Source NM in an emailed statement on Tuesday. As Source recently reported, Fair Districts and other advocates plan to resume efforts to create an independent redistricting commission here.
Rep. John Bucy, an Austin lawmaker and vice chair of the Texas Committee on Elections, characterized the mid-decade redistricting effort as an attempt by Trump to steal the 2026 elections. He said he and the other visiting lawmakers asked Lujan Grisham to tell other governors the situation in Texas will reach every state.
“They are attempting to steal five seats from primarily Black and Brown communities throughout the state of Texas,” Bucy said. “This is the warning for everyone listening: We are just the beginning.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Lawyers representing 17 coalitions against domestic violence arrived in Providence’s federal court Tuesday to reason why the federal government should be stopped from imposing new eligibility requirements on grants that sustain their missions.
Meeting them was a lone trial attorney from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on behalf of the department’s subsidiary, the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW). The office’s new grant eligibility and verification requirements go into effect Aug. 12, and are basically identical to those applied en masse by President Donald Trump’s administration to federal agencies’ spending priorities — namely, that taxpayer money not go toward any grant project seen as contradicting the administration’s position against DEI and what it dubs “gender ideology.” 
It took over two hours for Senior District Judge William E. Smith to hear both sides’ arguments in a courtroom packed with advocates. The veteran judge said he would have a verdict ready before Aug. 12, although it would likely be “truncated” with a memorandum explaining his full reasoning to follow, given the short timeline. But even the case’s unique attributes could not suppress Smith’s sense of déjà vu surrounding certain details, like the feds’ understanding of gender identity or DEI’s impact on statute. 
“Those two things have nothing in particular to do with domestic violence,” Smith told Justice Department attorney Kathryn Barragan. “It’s obvious in this set of conditions they are in pursuit of a larger agenda of the administration…They’re in the National Endowment for the Arts case, and they’re in every other case.”
“How could having a DEI program or promoting something for transgender folks have any relation to or detrimental effect on preventing domestic violence?” Smith asked.
“There’s a limited number of resources that can be put towards these grant programs,” Barragan replied, and she said the agency needs discretion to judge what falls outside that purpose. 
Smith presided over the similar National Endowment for the Arts case earlier this year, and ultimately ruled in favor of the government while agreeing with many of the plaintiffs’ points. That case also centered on what Smith quickly abbreviated this time around as “NOFOs.” These “notices of funding opportunities” instruct applicants how federal grantees can spend their awards. 
Under the Trump-directed grantmaking rules, applicants will also have to certify that any awarded funds comply with the new ideological priorities. In the case of domestic violence survivors, additional stipulations around not assisting undocumented immigrants are similarly harmful and should be negated, the plaintiffs argued.
ACLU asks R.I. federal judge to block Trump grant restrictions for groups aiding victims of violence

But in the arts funding case, the grants in question were all merit-based and competitive. In this case, the domestic violence coalitions who serve as plaintiffs receive grants funded through a formula. But these organizations still have to accept the new grant conditions by Aug. 12 if they want to receive their next payment. 
Kristin Bateman, a senior counsel from Democracy Forward and part of the plaintiffs’ legal team, argued in court that the formula grants these organizations rely on to continue operations are not subject to the same contingencies as merit-based funding.    
“Congress specified that these are the purposes of the programs,” Bateman argued. “You have to give this money to these coalitions that have been recognized as the state coalitions, and here’s the amount you have to give, and it doesn’t provide for any sort of curtailing of that by the agency.”  
Organizations accepting conditions possibly contrary to their mission, Bateman reasoned, would undermine the statutes which allocate and ensure this state-based funding, namely the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). 
Guidelines risk creating havoc 
Ideological restraints, Bateman noted, are irrelevant to the provision of subsidies. It could also imperil the work of organizations as they now fear prosecution under the False Claims Act, which she argued the federal government could apply to grantees if they promote gender identity even outside grant-funding projects, given the scope of Trump’s executive order that first authorized a crackdown on other ideas about gender.  
Bateman referenced a case involving the San Francisco AIDS Foundation: “So what that means is that a grantee who is interacting with a transgender person, a victim who’s come in seeking services, would have to treat that transgender woman like a man. Would have to use the wrong pronouns, the wrong honorifics, the wrong name and in order to avoid running afoul of this condition.” 
Teaming up with Bateman for the plaintiffs was Daniel Jacobson, who previously worked in the Obama and Biden administrations but now leads his own practice in Washington, D.C. Jacbonson pointed to ways in which the guidelines might create havoc for workers on the ground for their frontline organizations. 
“They need to know if somebody comes in at 11 p.m. who’s undocumented and says, ‘I can’t go home tonight because I might be abused,’” Jacobson said. “Can they provide that person shelter or not? They can’t call up somebody from the Office of Violence Against Women to say, ‘Hey, can you tell me what to do here?’”
Smith appeared attentive to the plaintiffs’ arguments surrounding chilling effects on grantees’ programming and free speech. He was slightly more skeptical, or at least inquisitive, of plaintiffs’ ideas on how the agency action constituted illegality under certain provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. 










How could having a DEI program or promoting something for transgender folks have any relation to or detrimental effect on preventing domestic violence? 


– Senior District Judge William E. Smith 


“It is not a crime to, ‘promote or facilitate the violation of federal immigration law,’” Jacobson said, referencing one of the grant stipulations. “The last I checked, we don’t even really know how the government would interpret that.”
“Some kind of facilitation of the violation of immigration law certainly would be illegal,” Smith replied. “And some wouldn’t.”
‘These terms are not conditions’
Smith pushed the coalitions to refine their arguments on the spot.  His inquiries were sometimes met with a pause from the defendant.
“These terms are not conditions,” Barragan said in her opening remarks about the NOFO language. “They simply define what the plaintiffs cannot do under the grant program.”
Barragan said that “there haven’t been awards issued yet, and there hasn’t been an acceptance of those awards,” which effectively meant that the grant conditions debated by plaintiffs are not actually final yet — they are still “proposed.” 
But Smith countered that the grant conditions have already been published and disseminated publicly: “The department has said, ‘We’re going to do this. If you apply, you have to certify to these conditions, and it’ll be in your grant.’ So they’re not proposed in that sense, right?” 
“That’s true, your honor, but there is still not a final award here,” Barragan replied. “So the terms could change. The agency doesn’t have plans to change the terms, but there’s a finality issue here.” 
Smith eventually circled back to the example of using pronouns. If an organization used a victim’s preferred pronouns when providing services, would that constitute a violation of federal policy?  
“I want to be clear that the [Office on Violence Against Women] position is that using someone’s pronouns, if you’re treating a victim using their pronouns that they would prefer, as a matter of common courtesy, does not violate this out-of-scope funding activity,” Barragan replied.
The rift between the case made in the court and the Office on Violence Against Women’s grant conditions was further emphasized by a court declaration from the office’s Deputy Director Ginger Baran Lyons. 
Lyons testimony noted that, in her tenure, the agency has never directed coalitions to turn away immigrants, and that the office’s staff are civil servants “devoted to seeing that shelter, rape crisis center, police precinct, courthouse, and hospital doors are open to all victims.”
“If that declaration was what’s in these policies, we wouldn’t even have a case here,” Smith said. “But there’s a complete disconnect between the condition that’s in the NOFOs and what’s in the declaration.”

And Washington remains dead last in police staffing per capita compared to other states.
These findings come from a report released this week by the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs that shows some encouraging signs after years of rising crime. 
Murders statewide dropped nearly 19% from 2023, for a total of 312 people killed, but that figure is still more than 50% higher than 2019. This mirrors national data showing the trend of declining murders continuing in the first quarter of this year in the country’s biggest cities.
Robberies are down 16%, creeping closer to 2019 levels. Meanwhile, a yearslong rise in assaults since the pandemic slowed but didn’t abate.
Theft and property damage reports also decreased.
Overall, the state’s crime rate dropped around 9%, the report found. 
“We have seen significant decreases in crime this past year, which is something to celebrate because that means fewer victims,” said Steve Strachan, the association’s executive director.  “Now, our challenge is to keep this momentum going.”
State Sen. Manka Dhingra, the chair of the Law and Justice Committee and a former prosecutor, attributed the reductions partially to state investments in behavioral health treatment and housing construction. So she’s worried federal cuts to social service programs could reverse Washington’s progress on crime.
“It takes an entire community to address violence,” said Dhingra, a Democrat from Redmond. “When people can’t get access to housing or treatment, that’s when you see crime escalating.”
Two types of crime saw significant jumps in 2024. 
Drug arrests leaped from 5,022 reported in 2023 to 10,907 last year, driven by a major increase in methamphetamine offenses, according to the association’s report. 
As one of the explanations for the sudden rise in drug-related arrests, Strachan points to legislators’ drug policy overhaul in 2023 to toughen penalties for possession or public drug use. That law was passed in response to the state Supreme Court declaring Washington’s previous drug possession statute unconstitutional. The legislation also guided increased drug treatment options.
The 2023 law “was designed around the idea that treatment will always be in the foreground, and that criminal sanctions will always be the last resort, and I think that’s what we’re seeing in agencies all across our state,” Strachan said. “However, the tool of criminal sanctions are there and are being used when absolutely necessary.”
Meanwhile, courts have chipped away at case backlogs tied to the pandemic shutdown and local jails have eased restrictions on what level of offenders should be taken into custody.
This upswing in drug crimes could also be a cause of the drop in more serious offenses, Strachan said, with criminal punishment potentially serving as an incentive to get treatment. 
Domestic violence incidents ticked up about 10%, as well, making up half of all crimes against people. Strachan couldn’t see a clear explanation for why domestic violence has increased. 
The association’s nearly 600-page report covers data reported by state, county, municipal and tribal law enforcement agencies across Washington.
Washington continued to sit last in the nation in police officers per capita, at 1.38 officers per 1,000 people at the end of October. The state has ranked last for 15 straight years, according to the association.
The national average is 2.31. Washington had 11,070 full-time commissioned officers in 2024, up a few hundred from the past couple years.
Last year, the state had its highest rate of law enforcement employees per capita since 2020, according to FBI data.
Dhingra pointed to new regional police training academies in helping address Washington’s struggle in hiring and retaining officers. In recent years, the state has opened academies in Arlington, Pasco and Vancouver. 
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson has made this issue a focal point of his first year in office. He refused to sign a state budget that didn’t include $100 million in grants to hire new police officers. 
State lawmakers delivered on that demand, despite some misgivings, but allowed the money to go toward more than just new cops, including peer counselors, behavioral health co-responders, training and other broader public safety efforts. 
“It’s going to be a big step forward. I have no doubt about that,” Ferguson said as he signed the legislation in May. “Jurisdictions will make their choices, but there’s going to be significant investments in new law enforcement officers.”
To access the grants, cities and counties need to either implement a new 0.1% sales tax for public safety or have already imposed a similar tax. They also need to follow state model policies as well as collect and report use-of-force data.
Strachan isn’t sure the money will make a significant difference in the state’s progress to increase police staffing. 
The average annual cost for one officer is $154,704, according to state data. To tie for 50th in the nation in staffing per capita, Washington would need to hire 1,513 new cops, costing $234 million per year, according to the association.

California’s suit contends that Trump’s signature tax law is unconstitutionally vague and requires states to violate Planned Parenthood’s First Amendment rights.


The Trump administration exceeded its authority and violated constitutional protections in attempting to defund Planned Parenthood, according to a lawsuit filed today by California Attorney General Rob Bonta along with 22 other states and the District of Columbia.
The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is Bonta’s 36th lawsuit against the Trump administration.
It contends that Trump’s signature tax law — the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — passed earlier this month is unconstitutionally vague and requires states to violate Planned Parenthood’s First Amendment rights.
The law, which went into effect July 4, prohibits Medicaid reimbursements for any health services conducted at large nonprofit health clinics that “primarily” provide abortions. 
“We won’t sit back while Congress and this federal administration tries to roll back our progress, silence their opposition and ignore the rule of law,” Bonta said.
The complaint also argues the law violates federal rules requiring the government to give states “clear notice” of major Medicaid funding restrictions. It also argues the law requires states to enforce provisions that violate Planned Parenthood’s constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and assembly. 
HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor had it filed a legal response at the time of publication.
Five California clinics have closed 
Critics of the law have characterized it as a “backdoor abortion ban” designed to target Planned Parenthood in states where abortion is legal. Already five Planned Parenthood clinics in California have closed, citing the loss of $100 million in Medicaid payments.
Federal law already prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortions except in extremely limited circumstances, but nearly 80% of Planned Parenthood patients in California use Medicaid, also known as Medi-Cal, the federal health insurance program for low-income people and those with disabilities.
“To be clear, this isn’t even federal funding that goes toward abortions,” Bonta said. 
According to the complaint, Congress has never before restricted Medicaid spending based on health care provided outside of the Medicaid program.
Planned Parenthood Federation of America earlier filed a separate lawsuit challenging the law.  U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston on Monday reversed a ruling from last week that had effectively cut Medicaid reimbursements for all but a few Planned Parenthood operations around the nation.
Despite the new ruling, five Planned Parenthood centers in California will remain closed, according to Andrew Adams, chief of staff for Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, which oversees 30 health centers in Northern and Central California and Nevada. Adams said the court order was a “key victory” in the fight to preserve reproductive health access, but the network needs to preserve its financial stability.
Monday’s order reestablishes funding for California clinics while legal action is pending. Bonta is also asking the court to prevent implementation of the law. Bonta said because the state’s Medicaid program is harmed by the law, it was appropriate for the state to pursue separate legal action and that the complaints challenge different constitutional protections.
‘We strongly disagree’
In a statement, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said “we strongly disagree with the court’s decision” and reiterated an argument from last week that states should not have to reimburse organizations that have “chosen political advocacy over patient care.”
Medicaid is jointly administered by states and the federal government with each generally paying for 50% of the cost of health services.
In its lawsuit, Planned Parenthood Federation of America argues, in part, that by withholding funding, the law violates its First Amendment rights. It also asserts that the tax law violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
HHS had not filed an appeal as of Tuesday morning.
Adams said in an email to CalMatters that Planned Parenthood Mar Monte will continue to fight any attempt to restrict abortion and reproductive health care access.
“We will not back down, but we must have the resources to continue this fight while keeping as many doors open to patient care as possible,” Adams said.
In her order, Talwani reasoned that disruptions to patient care are likely to result in “adverse health consequences,” including an increase in unintended pregnancies, pregnancy complications and undiagnosed cancers and sexually transmitted infections.
“Restricting access to [Planned Parenthood] healthcare clinics will negatively affect more than just reproductive health; [Planned Parenthood clinics] often serve as a source of primary care for patients,” Talwani wrote.
Talwani also wrote that the order does not require the federal government to pay for abortions, and that Planned Parenthood shows a “substantial likelihood” of winning the lawsuit.
Abortions account for less than 10% of services provided through California Planned Parenthood, according to the organization. The majority of patient visits are for primary care, birth control, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, and cancer screenings.
The clinics that closed last week are located in South San Francisco, San Mateo, Gilroy, Santa Cruz and Madera. Together they served 22,000 patients, according to Planned Parenthood Mar Monte. The organization also ended primary care, behavioral health and prenatal care services as a result of the federal budget cuts. Those cuts total roughly $100 million for the Mar Monte clinics, according to a news release.
Leaders for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, which represents more than 100 clinics throughout the state, including the Mar Monte clinics, said Trump’s tax law will cost the system about $300 million in Medicaid reimbursements. 
Jodi Hicks, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, said the “economic sanctions” imposed by the Trump administration has “jeopardized access for countless Californians” to critical health care services. Still, the organization remains committed to continuing to provide patient care, Hicks said.
“Planned Parenthood will not go away quietly. We are fighting back with every tool that we have,” Hicks said.

Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. lauded U.P.’s decision to remain headquartered in Omaha and to keep its name, saying that both decisions give the city “confidence in a long, proud, shared future.”
“We would welcome any future employees from the combined railroads to settle in Omaha,” Ewing, the mayor of the state’s largest city, said in a statement.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen noted on social media that President Abraham Lincoln envisioned a railroad extending to the Pacific Ocean and chose the Omaha area as its starting point.
“U.P. has been building America ever since, and Nebraska has become a centrally-located national transportation hub along the way,” he said. “The State of Nebraska looks forward to supporting this tremendous partnership, and we are proud to host America’s First Transcontinental Railroad.”
 Span 50,000 miles

Railroad leaders said the proposed merger, projected to wrap up in early 2027, could transform the U.S. supply chain, unleash American manufacturing, preserve union jobs and drive economic growth. 
Jim Vena, the railroad’s chief executive, said in a statement that the new network would span more than 50,000 miles, serve 43 states from the East Coast to West Coast, link about 100 ports and reach nearly every corner of North America.
“It will enable us to stay at the forefront of technological advances that continue to fundamentally change how freight moves,” he said, adding that the move spurs a “new era of American innovation.”

Vena and Norfolk Southern’s Mark George appeared on CNBC to talk about the purchase deal that is said to be worth $85 billion.  
The result, the companies’ statement said, is the creation of a “combined enterprise of over $250 billion.”
Vena is to run the combined entity and is viewed as the architect. He said during the interview that the railroads are sure they will grow the business and workforce. Both leaders said they wouldn’t shed unionized jobs as part of the plan.
George said the two CEOs got together several months ago and talked about what they could do to create something bigger. If approved, the new “Union Pacific Transcontinental Railroad” would combine U.P.’s strength in the western two-thirds of the country with Norfolk’s base in 22 eastern states.
“It became very very clear how big these revenue synergies are,” George said. “So we’re really excited about the future.”
Norfolk Southern’s current headquarters in Atlanta is to become a key site focused on technology and innovation.
For now, Vena said, “it is business as usual,” though he acknowledged the many questions that people have. 
In coming months, he said, the railroads would submit a formal merger application to the Surface Transportation Board. During that period, the two companies will continue to operate separately.
George said two years of planning the integration should allow the merged railroad to “hit the ground running.”
 Scrutiny ahead

Vena, on his company’s website, said the proposed transcontinental network is expected to deliver faster service by eliminating car touches and interchange delays, opening new routes, expanding intermodal services and ensuring faster movement along key rail corridors.
“We will take even more trucks off highways, decreasing congestion and reducing wear-and-tear on taxpayer-funded roads,” he said.
More than 40,000 U.P. and Norfolk Southern union employees move goods essential to daily lives, he said. Together they have 360 years of history.
The deal likely faces regulatory scrutiny amid concerns, including from labor unions, over potential job eliminations and disruption in service. 
The Transport Workers Union of America, which represents workers at Norfolk Southern, said in a statement Tuesday that it strongly opposes the planned merger and urged federal regulators, lawmakers, shippers and unions to block the deal. 
“A supersized Union Pacific would be catastrophic for TWU rail workers, shippers, and the safety of millions of Americans who live and work near freight rail lines,” said International President John Samuelsen. 
SMART Transportation Division (SMART-TD), described as the largest rail labor organization in the U.S., said in a statement it is “deeply engaged” in evaluating the implications of the proposed merger. 
The union said the deal would encourage further consolidation across the rail system, “triggering another wave of transcontinental mergers creating a duopoly. Both history and logic suggest this would drive higher rates, fewer service options and diminished competition.”
U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts, both Republicans, called the planned merger great for Nebraska and America.
“Employing over 5,000 Nebraskans, Union Pacific plays a crucial role in our state’s economy,” Fischer said. “I look forward to seeing the growth that will come to our state as a result of this crucial partnership.”
Said Ricketts: “This has the potential to create jobs, increase wages, and streamline the supply chain.”

 Base remains Omaha

Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber, said local business leaders were proud that “one of the most iconic names in American industry, continues to call Omaha, Nebraska home.”
Mello said the U.P. leadership and decision “reinforces our region’s central role in building a more connected and prosperous nation.”
“Railroads were built in America to bring people, communities and commerce together — and this new transcontinental network is the embodiment of this dream,” Mello said. 
 Vena told his company’s workforce that the two railroads have roots in spurring the Industrial Revolution.
He added, “I’m being straight with you when I say, ‘There is no better combination of railroads to finalize President Abraham Lincoln’s original vision to create a transcontinental railroad.’ ”

(Photo by McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Gov. Josh Shapiro has signed onto a lawsuit alleging the federal government is illegally blocking Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood and affiliated healthcare providers.
The suit centers on a provision of the recently-passed mega bill , which enacts many of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities. It bans Medicaid funding from going to nonprofit health care providers “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care,” that received at least $800,000 in Medicaid funds in 2023, as well as their affiliates, for one year.
The complaint alleges that the criteria is narrow enough as to target Planned Parenthood clinics, effectively punishing the reproductive health care provider for its abortion rights advocacy. It calls this a violation of the organization’s First Amendment rights and says it harms Medicaid recipients who use their clinics’ services.
Planned Parenthood is the nation’s largest single provider of abortions. But it is also a major provider of reproductive health care generally, with over 2 million patients.

In a post on the social media platform X, Shapiro said the defunding provision “will rip away healthcare from thousands of Pennsylvanians.”
He added, “this unconstitutional decision threatens to close vital health care centers and deny Pennsylvanians essential, lifesaving care such as cancer screening and prevention, family planning services, and prenatal and postpartum care.”

Today, I'm suing the Trump Administration alongside 22 other states to stop them from unlawfully defunding Planned Parenthood, which will rip away healthcare from thousands of Pennsylvanians.

The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts Tuesday and names the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and its current leader, former Pennsylvania U.S. Senate candidate, Dr. Mehmet Oz.
It was signed by attorneys general in 21 other states and Washington, D.C.. Shapiro is the only signatory serving as governor, or outside of an attorney general’s office.
All signatories are Democrats or working in Democrat-led offices.
Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, told the Capital-Star in a statement, “states should not be forced to fund organizations that have chosen political advocacy over patient care. It is a shame that these democrat attorney generals [sic] seek to undermine state flexibility and disregard longstanding concerns about accountability.”
The organization has an advocacy and political arm called the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which supports political candidates.
A spokesperson for Shapiro declined to answer specific questions about why Shapiro, and not Republican state Attorney General Dave Sunday, signed onto the suit.
A spokesperson for Sunday did not respond to a request for comment before publication.
Federal law already prevents federal funds from being used to cover abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of a mother. However, Planned Parenthood has been allowed to receive federal funds for services like STI checks, cancer screenings and other reproductive health services.
Medicaid is a program funded in partnership by state and federal governments, but states administer the programs individually.
Blocking federal funds from reaching Planned Parenthood has long been a goal of right wing activists and lawmakers. The complaint filed Tuesday cites a statement made by U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) saying he “would like to” block funding for the organization.”

Attempts to target the group’s federal funding have been tried before, including a 2007 effort led by then-Indiana Rep. Mike Pence (later Trump’s vice president from 2017 to 2021), and a 2017 effort led by Republicans in Congress.
The first Trump administration also attempted to block some federal funds from reaching the organization through the use of executive power.

Vermont and other states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its effort to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a day after a judge granted the health care organization’s request to block the cuts.
Advocates of health equity and access in Vermont welcome the win but said the fight is not over.
Vermont is among 22 states and Washington DC that sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers to Medicare and Medicaid Services for continuing to target Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood in the sweeping tax and spending bill signed into law by President Donald Trump earlier this month, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill.
Filed in the U.S. District court in Massachusetts Tuesday, the complaint argues that the provision in the bill to defund — which prevents the use of federal funds for any health care obtained at Planned Parenthood health centers — is unconstitutional. The suit states the administration continues “to target and punish” the nonprofit “for advocating for abortion access.”
Earlier this month, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America sued the Trump administration and a court issued a temporary restraining order mandating the federal government must continue reimbursing Planned Parenthood clinics for Medicaid-funded services. That order expired last week but a federal judge in Boston issued a new court order Monday to protect Medicaid funding for all Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide while the case continues.

U.S District Court Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the defund provision in Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” violates the First Amendment, the Equal Protection clause, and the prohibition on Bills of Attainder in the U.S. Constitution. 
Well known for providing abortion care, Planned Parenthood plays a critical role in Vermont’s health care access especially for low income people, those in rural areas and those who have historically faced barriers to care.
Beyond providing abortion care and sex education, about 200 Planned Parenthood clinics across the nation — including six across Vermont — provide cancer screenings, sexually transmitted infection testing and wellness exams to those who do not have other options.
In fiscal year 2024, Planned Parenthood clinics served 16,000 patents in Vermont, of whom 24% were covered by the Medicaid program. It provided 32,192 STI tests, 1,781 cervical cancer screenings and 1,049 breast exams to Vermonters, according to data shared by the organization.
If the nonprofit was forced to scale back or close clinics, it would create dangerous gaps in access, according to Daniel Barlow, executive director of the People’s Health and Wellness Clinic in Barre that provides free health care to uninsured and underinsured adults in Central Vermont.
“For many patients on Medicaid, Planned Parenthood is not just a provider of choice, it’s often the only provider available that offers the full range of reproductive healthcare services in a welcoming and inclusive environment,” Barlow wrote in an email. “Efforts to defund or discredit Planned Parenthood don’t just target an organization — they threaten the health, dignity, and autonomy of our communities.”
More than 70 million people rely on Medicaid, the federal government’s insurance program for low-income people, according to federal enrollment data.
Medicaid insures about 200,000 people in Vermont and costs approximately $2.4 billion, of which about 62% is federally funded, according to a press release from Attorney General Charity Clark’s office announcing the lawsuit. Vermont Medicaid covers reproductive health and preventative services and Planned Parenthood “plays a critical role in delivering that care,” the release states.
“In a rural state like ours — where medical providers are few and far between — the loss of Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood will leave Vermonters without access to basic care,” Clark stated in the release.
The lawsuit argues the provision is “impermissibly ambiguous,” unlawful and would lead to “widespread disruptions in preventative care and increase health care costs.”
The continued effort to defund Planned Parenthood is “a direct attack on the health care access of millions of low-income Americans, disproportionally harming women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and communities of color,” the release stated.
Planned Parenthood remains “one of the only affirming places” where young people in Vermont can access affordable and gender-affirming health care, Dana Kaplan, executive director of Outright Vermont, wrote in an email Tuesday. 
“Bodily autonomy is at the heart of both reproductive rights and gender-affirming care, and in this political climate where both are under attack, losing Planned Parenthood would create devastating gaps for youth—especially those on Medicaid,” he wrote.
While the lawsuits and this week’s court decision are good news for the organization, the fight is far from over, said Jessica Barquist, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England and Planned Parenthood Vermont Action Fund, in the release.
The attack is politically motivated, she said, and the nonprofit remains committed to providing care to anyone who seeks it. 
“During these turbulent times, we know our Medicaid insured patients won’t be able to access care elsewhere, which is why our commitment to see them is so critical,” she said in the release.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Great Salt Lake is slipping back into dangerously low levels, fueled by water consumption and drought conditions impacting much of the state.
Levels on Tuesday hovered around 4,192 feet in elevation, with the north arm at roughly 4,191.5 feet. Great Salt Lake Commissioner Brian Steed said lake levels are like layers on a cake, with the top layer, or highest water levels, typically resulting in a healthy lake — 4,192 feet, Steed said, is nearing the bottom of the cake, putting the lake in the “really bad” range.

“We’re sitting about where we were when we were trending into those lowest levels we’ve ever seen,” said Steed, referring to fall 2022 when the lake bottomed out at 4,188.5 feet. He described the current conditions as “scary low.”
Most of the state is now in severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which means the air quality is worsened by dust, cattle have inadequate water and pasture, while streams and ponds are drying out. Some of the high elevation areas in the central part of the state are in moderate drought.
Steed doesn’t have a crystal ball, and according to the four-week weather outlook from the National Weather Service, there’s an equal chance Utah could get above, or below, normal precipitation. So, if temperatures drop and northern Utah sees more monsoon precipitation, that could help lake levels.
 ‘This drought is the real deal,’ Great Salt Lake commissioner says 

But regardless, the Great Salt Lake will continue to drop, with its seasonal low typically some time between September and November.
“That’s what makes us extraordinarily nervous,” Steed said. “This drought is the real deal. And honestly, if we don’t get it right, if we continue to over-use, we’re going to have real human consequences.”
Those consequences mean an exposed lakebed, which contributes to poor air quality as storms whip up toxic, heavy metal-laden dust that blankets the Wasatch Front, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues.
Severe drought causing Utah reservoir levels to drop at ‘concerning’ rate

Declining levels can also expose microbialites, organic deposits that are a cornerstone of the lake’s ecosystem. Microbialites are essential for brine fly populations, the main food source for millions of migratory birds that stop on the lake. If the microbialites are exposed for long periods of time, it can trigger a chain reaction ultimately impacting the entire ecosystem.
Less water in the lake also contributes to an increase in salinity levels, which can harm the brine shrimp population — that can also have devastating impacts on the ecosystem, while hurting the million-dollar brine shrimp fishing industry.
The current levels mean mineral companies that operate on the lake will now be required to use less water. Junior water rights holders in the Great Salt Lake basin will also see less water this year.
If levels drop below 4,190 feet, the state will close off the causeway that divides the north and south arms to keep salinity levels lower on the south arm. Steed thinks it’s unlikely lake levels will get that low this year.

Free.,‘Good government’ group urges blue states to back away from a redistricting arms race,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/good-government-group-urges-blue-states-back-away-redistricting-arms-race,,"States led by Democrats should resist the temptation to conduct their own mid-decade redistricting in response to Republicans in the Texas Legislature moving to redraw U.S. House lines before the 2026 elections, officials with the nonpartisan election integrity group Common Cause said on a press call Tuesday.While blasting Texas Republicans’ effort to remake congressional districts in the middle of a decade — instead of after the decennial census, as is typical — the officials said the creation of  nonpartisan redistricting commissions that take the job out of politicians’ hands was a better policy than joining a redistricting arms race.Common Cause, a national organization with several state chapters, is often aligned with progressive causes, but advocates for fair redistricting regardless of party.Emily Eby French, the policy director for Common Cause Texas, said election infrastructure should be neutral, arguing against the suggestion from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democrats that blue states pursue mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage.“Our election infrastructure is not supposed to have a thumb on the scale for either side,” French said.“In Texas, conservatives press their thumbs so hard on the scale that it feels impossible to overcome,” she continued. “Maybe a quick fix would be to have Democrats press their thumbs on their own scales. But then it's just rigged elections across America. The real solution is for Democrats to help us lift the Republican thumb off of the Texas scale and every other scale in America until we reach free and fair elections for everyone.”Russia Chavis Cardenas, the deputy director for Common Cause California, added that Newsom should not “fight fire with fire.” Partisan redistricting processes inherently disadvantage communities of color, she said.California’s independent redistricting commission, made up of five Democrats, five Republicans and four nonpartisan members, is the “gold standard … (an) independent and community-led process,” Dan Vicuna, senior policy director for voting and fair representation at Common Cause’s national office, said.The state should not sacrifice that model for short-term political gain, he said.Texas redistrictingRepublicans held a 220-215 advantage in the U.S. House following the 2024 elections. Those elections happened on district maps drawn after the 2020 census.The GOP House majority was helped in part by Texas’ 2020 district map, which produced Republican wins in nearly two-thirds of the state’s districts.Civil rights groups sued over the new lines, claiming that some districts discriminated against Black and Latino voters.Texas Republicans resisted calls to redraw the lines, but the U.S. Justice Department this month sent a letter urging state leaders to reconsider.The letter “was sloppily and transparently creating a pretext for Texas legislators to redraw the state's gerrymandered congressional map and somehow gerrymander it even more in favor of Republicans,” Vicuna said Tuesday.President Donald Trump quickly dissolved that pretext, putting the issue in nakedly political terms on a call with Texas Republicans. Trump said the state’s lines should be redrawn to create five additional U.S. House seats, the Texas Tribune reported. A president’s party typically loses congressional seats during midterm elections.Following the letter, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, called a special session to address redistricting, among other things.Dem states respondIn addition to Newsom, leaders in the Democratic strongholds of New York and Illinois are considering retaliating by initiating their own mid-decade redistricting processes, according to a New York Times report.Other prominent national Democrats are calling for the party to be more aggressive in redistricting.U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego wrote on X last week that Democrats should break some heavily Democratic majority-minority districts to help win more seats.In follow-up posts responding to replies, Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote that Democrats should gerrymander districts in their favor.“It’s bad when everyone does it,” the first-term senator and former House member wrote about gerrymandering. “But Dems should not unilaterally disarm till GOP does.”Gallego’s post was retweeted by Jessica Post, a campaign strategist who previously led Democrats’ state legislative campaign arm. But the party’s current establishment is largely not commenting.A July 23 memo to Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee contributors from Heather Williams, who succeeded Post as the group’s president, mentioned the Texas redistricting, but said it only raised the stakes for statehouse races in the next three election cycles in advance of 2030 redistricting.“Today, as Donald Trump and his allies in the states are openly pushing to draw new, gerrymandered seats in Texas to protect the GOP’s meager House majority leading up to 2026, it’s clear this is just a preview of what’s to come,” Williams wrote. “The 2030 redistricting fight has already begun.”The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the official campaign arm for House Democrats, did not respond to a message seeking comment Tuesday.Vicuna, with Common Cause, urged reporters not to see redistricting not as a partisan conflict, but as an issue of voter representation.“This familiar framing that makes redistricting entirely about a political fight between parties is also kind of the problem,” he said. “This is ultimately about fair representation for communities, getting to have a say, being at the table when decisions are made about whether they can have fair representation. And I think that's what we're really talking about here, not just the food fight between the parties.”",,,,2025-07-29 18:56:48.663527

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)Republicans released a so-called “mini-budget” Tuesday that allows the DMV to hire more license examiners, supports an economic development project in Greensboro, and funds a new government efficiency office the state Auditor would run.
It authorizes step salary increases for teachers, principals, and state employees who are eligible to receive them. It does not give raises greater than those in established salary schedules.
The state Senate approved the budget 45-2 with no debate. The House is expected to vote Wednesday.
Republicans in the House and Senate have not been able to agree on a new budget for the fiscal year that started July 1. House and Senate Republicans were at odds over raises for teachers, future cuts to individual tax rates, and other issues.
The House proposed a budget in May that included average teacher raises of 8.7% over two years and an increase in starting teacher pay from $41,000 a year to $48,000 this year and $50,000 next year. The Senate wanted an average raise of 3.3% for teachers over two years and a $3,000 bonus over two years.
“On the House side we want to give some significant raises,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters. “We continue to talk to the Senate about that. No deal reached yet.”
Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters the disagreement between Senate and House Republicans over tax cuts has been resolved, and the two sides decided there would be no changes to their earlier agreement on future tax cuts.
The mini-budget does not address any shortfalls that result from federal budget cuts.
Congressional Republicans passed a massive budget reconciliation bill signed into law by President Donald Trump that includes deep cuts to social programs and tax cuts for the wealthy.
North Carolina will see a decrease in federal funding for its Medicaid program of billions of dollars over 10 years. The federal cuts jeopardize Medicaid expansion, under which more than 600,000 North Carolinians have health insurance.
“We’re looking at what the impact of the federal legislation will have on the Medicaid program and state-level funding,” Berger said. “We’re not at the point now where the modifications have taken place or done the analysis that we need to do in order to make the kinds of changes or decisions that need to be made.”
The mini-budget covers what are considered to be crucial items that House and Senate negotiators could agree on, said Sen. Brent Jackson (R-Sampson), a budget committee chairman.
“It’s not perfect. It’s not everything we wanted. It’s a compromise,” he said.
The hope is that legislators will have a complete budget shortly, he said.
Here’s what’s the mini-budget includes:

money to cover enrollment at community colleges and public schools
$1.2 million to hire 40 driver’s license examiners in the first year of the budget and $2.99 million to hire another 21 driver’s license examiners in the second budget year. Long lines and long waits for appointments are constant citizen complaints.
$13.3 million in the first year and $2.7 million in the second year to open and staff four new DMV offices.
$118.1 million for the JetZero aircraft manufacturing plant at the Piedmont Triad International Airport. The company has promised to invest more than $4.7 billion in Greensboro and create 14,560 jobs by 2063.

Article Summary

The Trump administration sent the Illinois State Board of Elections a letter this week requesting troves of voter data.
The request included sensitive information about voters and the state’s efforts to scrub the rolls of ineligible voters.
The request came two days ahead of a scheduled court hearing in a related case.
One former DOJ attorney who is now an elections expert said the letter is similar to requests filed in multiple other states and that it goes far beyond the Justice Department’s legal authority.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – The Trump administration has asked Illinois election officials for a copy of the state’s voter registration database, including sensitive data about individual voters and detailed information about the state’s efforts to scrub ineligible voters from the rolls.
In a letter dated Monday, July 28, lawyers from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division also asked for a list of all the election officials in Illinois who were responsible for carrying out federally mandated efforts to keep state’s voter rolls accurate and up to date during a two-year period leading up to the November 2024 elections.
State officials did not immediately comment on the request Tuesday. But David Becker, a former attorney in the DOJ’s voting section who now runs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, said the letter is similar to requests filed in multiple other states and that it goes far beyond the Justice Department’s legal authority.
“The Department of Justice asked for the complete voter file for the state of Illinois, including all fields in that file, which is an absolutely huge file that contains so much sensitive data about Illinois citizens, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth that the Department of Justice is not entitled to receive and not entitled to demand,” he said in an interview. “They know this. Other states have told them this, and yet they continue to seek to receive this information, citing sections of federal law that don’t apply and don’t require that.”

The voter list maintenance activities are at the heart of a federal lawsuit against the Illinois State Board of Elections that was filed last year by the conservative legal advocacy group Judicial Watch.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department filed what’s known as a “statement of interest” in that case, indicating the agency has an interest in the outcome of the case, but stopping short of formally seeking to intervene as a party.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Wednesday morning in Chicago where U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis could render a decision.
National Voter Registration Act
Under the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, states are required to make available for public inspection records about their efforts to ensure their voter registration lists are accurate and up to date.
They are also required to file biennial reports with the federal Election Assistance Commission about the steps they have taken to keep their lists updated, such as mailing out confirmation notices to voters and removing the names of voters who have died or moved.
In response to the Judicial Watch lawsuit, Illinois has asserted that it is a “bottom up” state when it comes to administering elections, meaning the registration lists are compiled and maintained by local election authorities.
According to the DOJ letter and the Judicial Watch lawsuit, the report Illinois filed for the two-year period leading up to the 2024 election suggested several counties were doing a poor job of maintaining their local voter rolls.
The DOJ letter asks not only for detailed explanations of those issues but also for a complete list of election officials who are responsible for carrying out the list maintenance responsibilities between November 2022 and November 2024.
For example, the DOJ letter states that 32 of the state’s 102 counties reported they did not send out any confirmation notices during that period, while 16 other counties reported the number of notices they sent was more than 100% of all registered voters in the county.
The letter also asks for the number of voters identified as ineligible to vote since November 2022 either because they were noncitizens, adjudicated as incompetent, or for felony convictions.
“First, I should say there is no federal law whatsoever that requires states to go through their lists and try to find noncitizens,” Becker said. “But second, I’d note that there’s no evidence that there are any significant numbers of noncitizens on Illinois’ or any other state’s voter lists. So once again, it appears the DOJ is seeking to invent authority that Congress has simply not granted.”
Officials at the State Board of Elections said the agency’s legal division was reviewing the DOJ request but offered no further comment. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.

Indiana Gov. Mike Braun stands to his left and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita to his right. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle) The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday released a proposal to scrap the 15-year-old regulation that empowers the agency to curb greenhouse gas emissions — a move EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin billed as the “largest deregulatory action” in the nation’s history.
“Many, many, many mental leaps” went into the 2009 determination that high concentrations of six key greenhouse gases — emitted by vehicles — endanger public health, Zeldin said.
“We do not have that power on our own to decide, as an agency, that we are going to combat global climate change because we give ourselves that power,” he continued, speaking at an Indianapolis truck dealership.
If finalized, his proposal would strip the EPA’s authority to set standards for greenhouse gas emission regulations on motor vehicles and engines.
It would save more than $54 billion annually, according to a news release.
“The practical application is going to be lower-cost vehicles, lower-cost consumer products, lower energy bills, and all the things Americans instinctually want,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.
“I believe today will go down as a momentous day for freedom and liberty in our country, brought to you by President (Donald) Trump,” Wright added, to applause from rows of suit-clad attendees.
He and other officials celebrated the proposed recision from behind a logo-emblazoned lectern, as a glossy red truck towered in the background and industrial fans stirred the muggy air overhead.

They insisted that neither air nor water quality would suffer.
“Do not listen to those haters. The sky will not fall,” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said. “We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water.”
Others disagree.
“I truly, honestly do not understand how they can say that the air and water and land will be just as clean under their policy view,” Indiana University Visiting Professor Janet McCabe told the Capital Chronicle. McCabe served in the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation during former President Barack Obama’s administration and was EPA deputy administrator under former President Joe Biden.
Several officials described the Obama-era endangerment finding as illegitimate and “creative.”
“It happened because they couldn’t do it through the House and the Senate and the presidency, the normal lawmaking process,” Wright said. “They found a backdoor way to take away your freedom and to make your life more expensive and shrink your life opportunities.”
McCabe rejected such arguments.
“There’s just no foundation for that at all. We were very thorough, very careful,” she said, noting that the endangerment finding was challenged in court and upheld.
McCabe said the criticism is “perhaps a way to deflect from the fact that this particular finding that they’re proposing to make now is going to be very hard to justify legally.”

Zeldin signed the proposed rule Tuesday. The agency will accept public comments on the proposal until Sept. 21.
Its possible impacts are unclear, but broad.
Asked about concerns the electric vehicle battery plants planned for Indiana would go elsewhere, Gov. Mike Braun called it a “great example of where government got ahead of common sense and even the marketplace.”
Health and economic impact
Despite the Trump EPA’s assertion that the move would save money for Americans, climate groups said the opposite was true, and that the finding would hurt access to alternative energy sources.
“The reason (Trump) is doing this is not scientific,” former Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said in an interview with States Newsroom. “It’s just his slavish devotion to his billionaire friends in the oil and gas industry that he wants to help, and destroy the ability of Americans to get clean and cheap — I want to emphasize cheap — electricity. This is not just a health issue. It’s a financial health issue, basically denying Americans the ability to get the most reasonably priced electricity in America.”
Inslee, a Democrat who sought his party’s presidential nomination in 2020 on a platform that emphasized climate issues, is a national spokesperson and executive with the advocacy group Climate Power.
“It’s a reckless move that will make Americans less safe and hurt our economy by slowing the growth of affordable clean energy and fueling the heat waves, storms, floods, and wildfires that threaten people’s homes and communities,” U.S. House Natural Resources ranking Democrat Jared Huffman, of California, said in a statement.
Democrats and environmental groups also argued the scientific evidence clearly showed greenhouse gas emissions were harmful.
“You can’t with a straight face argue that pollution is not endangering human health,” Inslee said. “Look at the deaths that are piling up. Flash floods and heat domes, asthma and cardiovascular events. This stuff is bad for human health. I don’t know how you can make the argument otherwise.”
 Lawsuits ahead
Legal challenges from Democratic attorney generals are almost certainly imminent, Inslee said Tuesday afternoon.
“If a lawsuit hasn’t been filed yet, I’ll have to call (Washington Attorney General) Nick Brown and tell him to hurry up,” he said. “It’s been a couple hours now.”
In a statement, Brown said he would “consider all options if EPA continues down this cynical path. We won’t stand by as our children’s future is sacrificed to appease fossil fuel interests.”

(Dave Bordewyk/South Dakota NewsMedia Association)The Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board reprimanded Brian Jorde, an attorney who has represented hundreds of landowners in lawsuits against pipelines, including Iowa and South Dakota landowners opposed to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.
The disciplinary board wrote in the reprimand that Jorde presented information that was “misleading or deceptive” during Iowa and South Dakota utilities commission proceedings regarding permit applications for the carbon sequestration project.
Jorde, part of Domina Law Group out of Omaha, represented 155 landowners in the Iowa Utilities Commission’s evaluation of Summit Carbon Solutions’ permit application to construct more than 600 miles of a pipeline carrying liquid carbon dioxide sequestered from biorefineries across the state. The pipeline would travel through Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and eventually be stored in underground rock formations in North Dakota.
Defying the odds: Meet the attorney for 1,000 clients who beat two pipeline companies

In the Iowa permit proceedings, Jorde filed pretrial testimony on behalf of landowners, including Nancy Dugan.
Dugan had filed her own information in the IUC proceedings as well and, according to the reprimand, had been in contact via email with Jorde.
Jorde also represented landowners in the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission’s hearings on Summit’s permit application. According to the records provided in the reprimand, he asked for and received Dugan’s permission to submit some of her research that had already been submitted in the IUC dockets, to the South Dakota hearings.
Jorde’s filings on behalf of Dugan, however, included introductory written testimony, which Dugan later said, in an email to Jorde obtained by the advisory board, were “not statements I would choose to submit.”
The reprimand said Dugan did not approve these written statements. The statement submitted in South Dakota had an electronic signature at the bottom, but the IUC document had not been signed by Dugan.
Dugan clarified in her email to Jorde that she was not a landowner and was worried about being called to testify. Jorde, in response, said the filing with the IUC must have happened inadvertently by staff who filed a number of pretrial testimony. He assured Dugan he did not intend to call her to testify, according to the included emails.
In subsequent emails, Dugan asked Jorde to retract the statement, or allow her to submit a revised version that included her actual responses. According to the reprimand, Dugan later learned the same statements had been submitted in South Dakota and again emailed Jorde asking him to refrain from filing any affidavits on her behalf unless it was something she had written or reviewed or approved.
In April 2024, months after the IUC hearing occurred, Dugan brought up the issue again to Jorde asking him to rescind the statements from the IUC record, according to the reprimand. Jorde said the pretrial testimony was not used in the hearing and therefore not part of the record, so he was unsure what action the IUC would take. He later said to the board the filing was not “material” information to the proceedings, the reprimand states.
“If I file a request to have it deleted for instance that will bring more attention to something Summit and others are not even thinking about now,” Jorde said in an email excerpt included in the letter from the advisory board.
According to the advisory board, Jorde contacted the IUC about removing the testimony, but did not contact the South Dakota commission about the issue.
The written testimony attributed to Dugan was not used in the commission hearings in either state.
Dugan brought the issue to the attention of the IUC council and Nebraska attorney disciplinary authorities, where the matter was brought to the Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board.
The board concluded the actions in South Dakota were “deceptive” and wrote it was “deeply concerning” that Jorde and his staff did not mention to Dugan the extra pages filed in addition to the research she had consented to filing.
The board was less clear on its ruling on the Iowa document because Jorde claimed it was inadvertently submitted, which was enforced by the blank notarization. The board “found it troubling” Jorde did not withdraw the filing upon learning it had been inadvertently filed.
The board concluded that the “severity of the misrepresentation issues” did not “rise to level” of many previously prosecuted matters, but “the duty of candor is one of the most basic and fundamental obligations we require of lawyers.”
Jorde did not file any exceptions to the reprimand within the allowed 30-day window, meaning the reprimand was made “final and public” according to the document.
In a message to Iowa Capital Dispatch, Jorde said his focus remains on his clients.
“I decided not to contest this matter and have moved on,” Jorde wrote.
There is no further disciplinary action beyond the public reprimand.
Federal appeals court denies request for rehearing
A federal appeals court denied a rehearing petition Monday from Iowa counties involved in a case against Summit Carbon Solutions regarding a county’s ability to enact local pipeline ordinances.
Shelby and Story County supervisors petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit for an en banc rehearing earlier this month following the judge’s ruling in favor of Summit in June.
One judge dissented in the majority opinion that all of the ordinances set by the counties would be preempted by the Pipeline Safety Act.
An en banc rehearing, as requested by the counties and supported via amicus briefs from the states of Minnesota, Michigan, Oregon, Vermont and from Pipeline Safety Trust, would require a rehearing of the case with all 11 active judges at the appeals court.
The order denying the petition for rehearing did not include any additional information or opinion from the judge.

Free.,"Trump’s EPA proposes rollback of basis for climate change rules, sparking Dem outrage",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-epa-proposes-rollback-basis-climate-change-rules-sparking-dem-outrage,,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency submitted a proposal Tuesday to rescind a 2009 finding that has provided the foundation for the agency’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, drawing strong opposition from Democrats and climate groups.Administrator Lee Zeldin said the EPA would scrap what is known as its endangerment finding, established under President Barack Obama. The determination called climate change a danger to human health and therefore gave the EPA power to regulate the greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from cars and trucks.The finding provided the framework for numerous EPA regulations, including a 2024 rule requiring increasingly strict tailpipe emissions standards.But Zeldin, who announced the proposal during an appearance in Indianapolis, said that framework created uncertainty for auto manufacturers and buyers and hurt the wider economy.President Donald Trump’s EPA would eliminate the finding, he said.“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” Zeldin said in a written statement. Under Obama and President Joe Biden, the agency “twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year.”The announcement touched off outrage from congressional Democrats and groups that advocate for strong action to curb the climate crisis.“With this action, Trump and EPA Administrator Zeldin are putting massive corporate polluters in the driver’s seat at EPA and it will be everyday Americans who pay the price – with their health, their energy bills, their jobs, their homes, and even with their lives,” House Energy and Commerce ranking Democrat Frank Pallone of New Jersey wrote in a statement.“The only winners from this proposal are corporate polluters who will be allowed to dump unlimited pollution into our communities without any consequences.”EPA denies it has authorityIn a Tuesday notice in the Federal Register, the EPA said it would rescind all greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles, consistent with its opinion that the endangerment finding was unlawful.“The EPA no longer believes that we have the statutory authority and record basis required to maintain this novel and transformative regulatory program,” the agency said.Supreme Court cases in recent years, including a decision that limited the EPA’s power to regulate power plants and a decision that denied federal agencies were due deference in drafting regulations, indicated the endangerment finding overstepped, the EPA said in a news release.Repealing the finding would increase consumer choice, lower prices for goods delivered by truck and save $54 billion annually in associated taxes, the EPA said.The agency will accept public comments on the proposal until Sept. 21.Health and economic impactDespite the Trump EPA’s assertion that the move would save money for Americans, climate groups said the opposite was true, and that the finding would hurt access to alternative energy sources. “The reason (Trump) is doing this is not scientific,” former Washington Gov.

(Photo provided by Trident Technical College)After completing the Future Ready Certificate program at Trident Technical College, one Berkeley County high school student scored an apprenticeship with Boeing.
A second will go on to study air conditioning and refrigeration at the technical college in the fall. And a third enlisted in the military to train in mechanical assembly.
These students went from having no idea what they want to do after high school to pursuing jobs and studies in the trades and technical fields.
Nine of the program’s first 10 students — all from Berkeley County — have chosen a career field since completing the courses in May. The still-undecided 10th student is a rising senior, said Robert Elliott, dean of manufacturing and maintenance at the Charleston-area technical college.
With the pilot a success, the private grant-funded program is expanding for the semester that starts next month. Eligibility opens to students in Charleston and Dorchester counties, and the number of high school juniors and seniors enrolled doubles to 20.
In the 18-week, four-course program, students learn science, technology, engineering and math concepts, as well as problem solving and communication skills.
“The demand for industrial and manufacturing employees is high, and Trident is an important part of the pipeline to fill the need,” said David Perkins, assistant dean of manufacturing and maintenance. “As such, these grants have far-reaching potential as they will impact individuals, businesses and industries.”

In one course, students build a go-kart.
The process teaches them about precision measuring, circuits and the basics of electricity, assembly and data collection. To complete the course, they must give a presentation on their process and findings. In turn, they earn academic credits they can apply to both their high school graduation requirements and a South Carolina technical college degree.
“Our goal is to take these students that really don’t have a pathway forward and give them an idea of what’s out there,” Elliott said. “Get them in the field, get them excited and motivated about learning. Give them some kind of passion for the workforce after graduation.”
Elliott said Trident Tech identified 4,000 high school graduates in the tri-county area last year that did not go on to one of South Carolina’s public colleges or universities. That’s more than half of all high school seniors enrolled in the area’s public schools, according to data from the state Education Department.
SC governor calls for study to consider consolidating colleges ahead of ‘enrollment cliff’

There could be several explanations for this, he said. Students may have gone to school in a different state, enlisted in the military or went to work straight out of high school.
But Elliott said he still finds that number staggering.
Future Ready students also tour area employers, including Mercedes-Benz, where they watched a van being assembled from start to finish.
“Little things like that open their eyes, expose them to what’s available and they can figure out what they want to do,” Elliott said.
The experience was enough to convince one student to enroll to study automation at Wofford College, Elliott said.
Elliott also keeps a note from one of the Future Ready participants, for whom he wrote a letter of reference for, on his desk as a reminder.
“Thank you for the opportunity you have given me,” it reads.
Funding for supplies for the Future Ready program comes from the Bosch Community Fund, Volvo and Boeing. Participating students are recommended to the program by their high school guidance counselor and attend free of charge.
“Our support for the Future Ready Certificate program reflects our ongoing commitment to fostering the next generation of skilled workers in the aerospace and manufacturing sectors,” said Scott Stocker, general manager of Boeing’s 787 program in South Carolina. “Engaging high school students in hands-on manufacturing training fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation, preparing them to drive the industry’s future.”
Trident Tech will hold an information session about the program for parents and students Monday, Elliott said.
That’s shortly before the school year begins for students in the tri-county’s four K-12 school districts. The opening dates are Aug. 6 for Dorchester 2, Aug. 7 for Dorchester 4, Aug. 12 for Charleston County and Aug. 13 for Berkeley County students.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/futureready1-1024x726.jpg,,,2025-07-29 18:00:31.622359

While water is contaminated with cyanobacteria, it’s deemed unsafe for recreation and swimming. The organisms multiply rapidly under sun and in warm water, often in the late summer.

With temperatures climbing into the upper 80s on Tuesday, most of Burlington’s beaches and a couple in state parks are closed due to blooming blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria. 
Along Burlington beaches, cyanobacteria blooms in swimming water led to closures at both ends of North Beach, both ends of Blanchard Beach, Texaco Beach, Oakledge Cove and Blodgett Water Access Point on Tuesday afternoon.
Beaches were also closed in Kill Kare State Park in St. Albans Town and part of the beach at Lake Carmi State Park in Franklin. Warnings for low to moderate amounts of cyanobacteria have been issued along both ends of Leddy Park beach in Burlington and along three state park beaches. 
Beachgoers can often spot blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, with their plain eye. 
Blooms “most commonly look like pea soup or a blue-green paint spill on the water,” but they can also look pink, brown or red, according to Bridget O’Brien, an environmental health scientist with the Vermont Department of Health. 
When water is contaminated with cyanobacteria, it’s deemed unsafe for recreation and swimming. Cyanobacteria is a naturally occurring organism in the water that tends to “bloom” or rapidly multiply in the sun and when the water is warm — commonly in the late summer, O’Brien said.
The bacteria can produce toxins that cause skin irritations and gastrointestinal issues, but can also cause neurological symptoms like numbness and dizziness, O’Brien said. 
Officials advise that children and pets stay out of the water during warnings, as they’re more likely to get symptoms after exposure, O’Brien said. 
In addition to hot temperatures that have likely contributed to cyanobacteria blooms, the southern half of the state is experiencing very dry conditions, said Eric Myskowski, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Burlington. 
Those dry conditions are expected to get worse throughout the week, Myskowski said. On Tuesday, officials at the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation forecasted a high risk of fire danger across southern Vermont and a moderate risk of fire danger across the northwest corner of the state.
For people in the Queen City looking to escape the heat, North Shore Natural Area is the only town beach that’s been green-lit to swim in without warning from Burlington Parks, Recreation and Waterfront. Red Rocks Park in South Burlington also remains open along with the town beaches in Colchester.

“Planned Parenthood plays an irreplaceable role in our health care system. For many communities, Planned Parenthood health centers are the sole provider of their sexual and reproductive healthcare,” Gretchen Raffa, Chief Policy and Advocacy Officer for Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, said Tuesday during a press conference with Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and others.
Tong, Raffa and Democratic state lawmakers who spoke at a press conference on Tuesday argued that Planned Parenthood does more than perform abortions. The loss of the clinics, they said, would also mean the loss of services like contraception, OB-GYN care and cancer screenings. 
“This isn’t about abortion, per se. This is about health care, not just life affirming health care, but life-saving health care,” Tong said. 
They also noted that federal Medicaid funding does not pay for abortions.
Tong said the states decided to file their own lawsuit because the loss of funding for Planned Parenthood clinics would mean a cost to the states. 
In their complaint, filed on Tuesday, the states argued that Congress had “forced the States to harm themselves,” giving them a choice between “crippling the States’ medical health care ecosystems” with the loss of the clinics or “using the State’s own funds to keep those health care centers operating.”
Tong said covering the cost of the 14 Connecticut clinics would amount to about $6 million.
“I don’t think we have $6 million just lying around to cover that, especially when there’s so many other cuts falling on us now. And so we’ve sued because it’s unconstitutional,” he said.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, the ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee, noted that if Connecticut had to pay an additional $6 million to Planned Parenthood, it would come at the same time that Congress was cutting $13 billion in funding for Medicaid in Connecticut. 
“As a result, the state of Connecticut is going to be forced to make difficult choices with respect to who and what is covered,” DeLauro said. 
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services criticized the lawsuit in a statement Tuesday to CT Mirror. 
“States should not be forced to fund organizations that have chosen political advocacy over patient care. It is a shame that these democrat attorney generals [sic] seek to undermine state flexibility and disregard longstanding concerns about accountability,” the spokesperson said. 
Earlier this month, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services to block the enforcement of a provision in the federal budget bill — known officially as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — that would have blocked Medicaid funds from going to clinics that perform abortions who received more than $800,000 in federal and state funding in 2023. 
In their lawsuit, the organization argued the provision, which would apply only to Planned Parenthood clinics and two other organizations, was directly targeting Planned Parenthood. They also argued they were being targeted both because of their “long history of providing legal abortions to patients across the country” as well as their “unique role in advocating for policies to protect and expand access to sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion.” 
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, an Obama appointee, last week granted a preliminary injunction that would temporarily prevent funding cuts to individual Planned Parenthood member associations who either didn’t perform abortions or who hadn’t received more than $800,000 in annual reimbursements through Medicaid. On Monday, she extended that order to cover all Planned Parenthood clinics indefinitely. 
In her order, Talwani said Planned Parenthood was likely to prevail in its claim that the federal government had singled out the organization “with punitive intent.” 
In a brief opposing the preliminary injunction, the Department of Health and Human Services argued that Congress was performing its legal right to “alter, amend or repeal” any provision of the Medicaid program. The federal agency also said the provision in the budget bill was “consistent with their electoral mandates from the American people as to how they want their hard-earned taxpayer dollars spent” and that it “neither targets nor punishes Planned Parenthood; it merely declines to fund entities (not limited to Planned Parenthood) that perform elective abortions.” 
“Planned Parenthood has no right to taxpayer money, and this Court should not invent such a right. The Court should uphold Congress’s lawful exercise of its authority to decide to whom it will entrust taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars,” the agency wrote. 
Raffa said that over 52,000 patients visited the organization’s 14 Connecticut clinics last year, and that 46 percent of those patients were on the state Medicaid program. 
According to Planned Parenthood of Southern New England’s 2024 Annual Report, about half of the people who come to the organization’s 15 clinics — 14 in Connecticut and one in Providence, Rhode Island — are Black or Hispanic. Last year, the clinics performed 13,300 abortions. They also conducted about 185,500 tests for sexually transmitted diseases and 11,800 cancer screenings. 
About half of the people who sought services at the clinic were between ages 20 and 29. Young people under the age of 20 made up about a tenth of their patient count, and 13 percent of their patients are over the age of 40. 
Connecticut has increased funding for Planned Parenthood clinics — in June, the state legislature passed a budget allocating $800,000 in one-time emergency funding to Planned Parenthood of Southern New England. They also received a one-year increase in the state’s social services block grant. 
In a statement to CT Mirror, House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora called for greater scrutiny on Planned Parenthood of Southern New England’s finances. 
“Connecticut Democrats concerned about Planned Parenthood of Southern New England funding should start by examining how money is spent by a state-subsidized organization whose director earns $400,000 annually. Last winter, they rejected our amendment requiring greater transparency from this and similar organizations —information that would help Democrats make a stronger case to taxpayers than simply saying ‘they need the money.’” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_0014-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 18:00:31.622359

Lt. Gov. John Rodgers will serve on the executive committee of the National Lieutenant Governors Association after being elected at the association’s annual meeting earlier this month. 
The National Lieutenant Governors Association is a bipartisan organization fostering collaboration between seconds-in-command in states across the country.
“I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to serve in a national leadership role with NLGA, where I can participate in the exchange of ideas and solutions to the shared challenges we face in the states and territories,” Rodgers said in a press release announcing his role. 
South Carolina Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, a Republican, was elected chair, according to the NLGA’s Facebook page. Kentucky Lt. Governor Jacqueline Coleman, a Democrat, is chair-elect.
A plane maintenance issue kept Rodgers from attending the association’s annual meeting in Lake Tahoe, according to James Ehlers, the lieutenant governor’s chief of staff.

What is the state doing to fix it?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Andrew Brown to discuss his article written with Jenna Carlesso, Renata Daou and Shahrzad Rasekh, “A Buried Threat: Thousands in CT might still be drinking water from lead pipes,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Andy’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Andrew. New data obtained by you and your colleagues at the Connecticut Mirror shows there could be as many as 8,000 lead service lines still in use in public water systems throughout the state. Is that not surprising, considering lead plumbing has been banned in the state for almost 40 years?
AB: It was a little bit of a surprise as we started going through this data that there were so many. But it actually was not a surprise to regulators at the US Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, which is responsible for drinking water safety throughout the country, created a new regulation requiring utilities to find these aging lead service lines, and when they created that rule, they estimated millions across the country are still in the ground. So the fact that Connecticut potentially has 1000s is not that big of a surprise if you’re actually following and involved in this type of work.
WSHU: But it has surprised homeowners, some of whom have just bought their homes in the past few years. You cite the example of Jarvis Parker in Waterbury, who bought his home about five years ago, only to find out that it had a toxic lead water line. Why is this not coming out before the homes are sold?
AB: I think that water safety in this country is kind of like it’s concluded that you’re water safe, you’re on a public water system, and these lead lines are not like other infrastructure that a house relies on. Right, when people buy a house, they check to make sure the roof isn’t leaking, that the basement doesn’t flood, and that it has proper electrical service. These lines are underground. They’ve often been there for more than a century, and they’re forgotten. People don’t know what pipe runs from under the sidewalk or the street into their house. And so, you know, sometimes we did encounter people who said, you know, when I bought my home, for instance, there was a couple of homeowners who said, when I bought my home in Willimantic, the home inspector actually spotted the lead line coming into the basement. But that’s not always on the checklist, right of every home inspector. And so I think that’s why this data is so revealing and so important, because oftentimes aging led water lines are just ignored or forgotten.
WSHU: Now, normally, you’d expect that in the older urban areas of the state you’d find these lines, but in some of the more affluent areas in the state, they still have the same problem.
AB: Yes.
WSHU: Why, in a place like Greenwich, for instance?
AB: I think that could probably be attributed to the fact that Greenwich is still an older water system. Many of the lead lines that exist in the country were installed between the late 1800s early 1900s and so if you have a water system that was built and built out during that time, and the you know, the service lines were never replaced in the past 100 years, there is a likelihood that you’re going to find a substantial amount of lead. Greenwich is an older system. It may not be an urban center, but it is still an older water system. That is why Aquarian Water, which currently owns them, estimates that they could find hundreds of water lines and lead water lines there. You know, that is the kind of shared fact of all of these places that are identifying suspected lead water lines, which are older water systems. Bridgeport, New London, Middletown, Willimantic, all of these places had water lines built and were around in the late 1800s, early 1900s, and so that is the primary contributor to why you’re finding them where they are. If a water system, even if it was built in the 1950s or 60s, lead had become somewhat of a less common material to make service connections out of, and so you’re not finding them in the suburbs, which had, you know, water systems built out at a later date.
WSHU: Okay, now you have a situation where the first problem is identifying where these lines are, and the water utilities are tasked with that. How are they going about it, and how efficient has it been?
AB: We talked to many directors of public water systems in Connecticut, and each utility handles it differently. Some utilities like the Wyndham Water Works, which supplies Willimantic, told me that they actually went door to door and house to house, inspecting the water lines. They were physically inspecting the water lines where they enter people’s basements. So they have a very high confidence, because they actually put eyes on these pipes. And which ones are not, you know, larger water systems like Aquarian, which supplies Bridgeport and Greenwich, the Regional Water Authority in New Haven, the Metropolitan District Commission in the Hartford region. They have so many customers that they’re utilizing machine learning, right? They’re inputting data of where they have records about what each service line is made of, and those that machine learning is then predicting where they may or may not find lead in other locations. That’s not a foolproof system, right? That is not a guarantee that you’re going to find lead where it says you’re going to have lead, and it’s not a guarantee that you’re not going to find lead where it’s saying that it’s lead-free. So this is really an evolving process at this point, where the utilities are going to be continuously updating and trying to perfect the information that they have. There are many utilities that are relying on what they call tap cards, which are essentially these paper records from the late 1800s and early 1900s that say, you know this, this service line was installed in 1903 and it’s made of X, Y or Z. Again, those can be accurate, but there may be, you know, that line may have been replaced in 1955 and nobody recorded it. So there’s a lot of work in just identifying where the lead lines are, and the information, unfortunately, is going to change as the utilities continue to do more work on this.
WSHU: Now, when we find those lines, who will pay to fix them? Because that’s what happened in Flint, Michigan, the federal government had to come in and fund a lot of that. What’s the situation in Connecticut? Who’s going to pay for this?
AB: It really is dependent on the utility that the homeowner is supplied by. Many of the utilities we spoke to said that they cannot rely on the individual property owners, who may have a lead line, to pay for that replacement, because if you do that, it’s thousands of dollars, and not every homeowner has that upfront capital to be able to do that. So many utilities are saying they will front the cost pool, the entire service line out, which, in many cases, is, you know, owned, a shared ownership between the utility and the homeowner. The money, I guess, would either come through rates, increasing rates on water, all of their water customers. Still, many utilities are hoping to get in line for low-interest loans that were provided by the federal government, some of which can be forgiven. So there is a pot of money. $99 million has come to Connecticut through the federal government for lead service line replacements and identification. But the question is, is whether that’s even going to come close to the amount of money it’s going to cost to find all of these lead lines and ultimately pull them.
WSHU: We keep hearing about lead, lead, lead. What’s the actual health problem that leads to?
AB: We spoke to pediatricians and some engineers who particularly look at lead water lines. The emphasis that they made to us is that lead paint is still the most common contributor to child lead poisoning cases. So the lead paint on window sills is the more common cause of children being lead poisoned, or adults, for that matter. But the pediatricians we spoke to said, essentially, the lead water lines are a particular risk for children who may be consuming powdered baby formula that is mixed with tap water, if that lead line is releasing lead into people’s taps, and every day that child is consuming tap water through the formula. That can be a major concern. It really depends on whether that lead line entering a building is essentially leaching into the water utilities across the country, and here in Connecticut, they treat their water with what are known as corrosion inhibitors to prevent things like lead pipes from essentially putting lead into the system and into people’s taps. But drinking water engineers have essentially said that’s not a guarantee that, on occasion, lead isn’t released from that pipe and finds its way into people’s tap water.
WSHU: Now also, the Connecticut Mirror is trying to reach out to people, to try and inform them about this, and try and educate people, and find out so that they can be more aware that this is a problem. What exactly are you doing?
AB: We are currently reaching out to people. We’re holding three community events in the next month, both in Waterbury, Bridgeport and Willimantic. Those events are in the Connecticut Mirror’s story regarding these lead lines, dates, and times. We have partnered with the Pulitzer Center, which is a reporting grant funder, and we are looking. To sample people’s water people who have a suspected lead service line, just to get an indication of whether the corrosion control that the utilities utilize here is actually preventing lead from finding its way to people’s sinks. So we’re going to be holding those events kind of talking about the reporting that we just published, and seeing if anyone would be willing to allow us to sample their water.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/LEAD-SERVICE-LINES-15-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 18:00:31.622359

While multiple speakers gathered in downtown Lansing to share their experiences and call out the barriers that continue to impact the ways people with disabilities work, live and thrive, Michigan’s summer heat kept many individuals from attending said Renee Hall, advisor to the Self-Advocates of Michigan. 
Alongside the concerns posed by the heat, several individuals had opted against attending “Breaking Barriers Day” at the Capitol out of fear, citing the federal effort like the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ now-discontinued plan to create a new registry on autism, and President Donald Trump’s recent executive order instructing local governments to have homeless individuals facing mental illness committed to treatment facilities without their consent.

However, those threats did not stop other advocates from speaking out against cuts to social services, with one in three individuals with a disability receiving Medicaid, and the American Civil Liberties Union warning that work requirements imposed on the program – which is intended to offer healthcare services to low income adults and children – will harm disabled individuals who fall outside the government’s definition. 
According to the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, more than 39% of Michiganders receiving food assistance through SNAP are in families with adults or individuals with disabilities, compared to more than 37% nationally.
Tonnieo Graves, a member of Self-Advocates of Michigan’s board, said individuals with disabilities can’t lose hope in the face of these cuts and must continue pushing to let Congress know they aren’t giving up. 
Adam Hazlett, who serves as the group’s public relations chair, said Tuesday’s event is not just a celebration of disability pride and breaking barriers, but a call to rise, organize and resist. 
“They are coming for us, and it’s not just with paperwork and policies, but with barriers, bans and blitzkrieg marches backwards,” Hazlett said. 
The liberal Center for American Progress points to several Trump administration policies that harm disabled individuals, including eliminating diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs; barring enforcement of disability civil rights laws; decreasing protections in employment and slashing services, benefits and regulations that help keep disabled people in their communities. 
“Every cut to services, every attack on autonomy, every whisper that we’re too expensive isn’t just an insult. It’s a warning, a warning that they’re not slowing down,” Hazlett said.

However, people with disabilities will not be pushed quietly back into the shadows, Hazlett said, 
“They may try to erase us, they may try to silence us, but together, we are louder than their silence. Together, we are brighter than their shadows, and together, we are never, ever, ever going back,” Hazlett said.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Colleges across the U.S. are reaching a “freezing point” of free speech being restricted on campus as more states pass legislation aimed at controlling university curricula, shared governance and more, according to a report released by a national organization aimed at protecting free expression.
PEN America released a report mapping where laws have been introduced and passed limiting what can be discussed in classrooms and other restrictions on university practices. The report breaks the legislation down between “educational gag orders” and less direct actions that still impact the freedoms of universities, staff and students.
Amy Reid, an author of the report and senior program manager at PEN America, said the new laws are the result of “years of patient groundwork” that has turned censorship of classroom speech on college campuses into an actionable goal.
“Together, the cumulative effect of all of these things is beyond a chill,” Reid said. “We’ve gotten to a freezing point for speech on campuses where students and faculty and staff are all aware that they need to watch what they say, what they ask, how they interact on campuses — and that’s not good for education.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the report, legislative bodies in 26 states have introduced more than 70 bills “to censor higher education” by June 30 of this year, 22 of which have been signed into law across 16 states. Six states, including Kansas, Ohio, West Virginia, Wyoming, Kentucky and Arkansas, enacted laws falling under this category for the first time this year. Twenty-one states in total have passed such legislation since 2021.
Some of these bills are referred to as “educational gag orders” in the report, which means they are direct efforts to specify what topics and ideas are and are not allowed to be taught in college classrooms. However, the majority of bills reported by PEN America in the report are categorized as having a more indirect path to restricting free expression.
PEN America singled out some legislation as examples of educational gag orders in the report, some from states identified as enacting laws that censor speech for the first time. Mississippi, West Virginia and Wyoming have all passed legislation that restrict discussion of certain topics, according to the report, such as race, color, sex, ethnicity and national origin, with a similar law from Arkansas adding “ideas or beliefs in violation of” the Civil Rights Act, Titles IV, VI, VII.
In Ohio, the report stated, the Legislature passed a law that bars public college faculty from voicing support or opposition for “controversial beliefs or policies” and requires them to “encourage students to reach their own conclusions” on these topics.
These laws can have an immediate impact on students and their education, Reid said.
“When (lawmakers) place curricular limits on what can be taught or what must be taught on college campuses, they’re rigging the game,” Reid said. “They’re saying that some ideas need to be advanced and others need to be squelched. That’s not freedom of expression, frankly, that’s very unAmerican.”
Iowa laws listed
Three bills signed into Iowa law this session were identified by the organization as targeting freedom in higher education in the report, including legislation to bar accrediting agencies from taking steps against universities for following state law; restricting state agencies and community colleges from having diversity, equity and inclusion offices or officers, and establishing a center for intellectual freedom at the University of Iowa.
The center’s director will be chosen by an advisory board of which only one member can be a university employee, will answer to the Iowa Board of Regents and will have sole authority over hiring of faculty, guest speaker invitations and more.
Iowa lawmakers who supported these bills, as well as past legislation that has barred Iowa universities from operating DEI offices and other practices, have said DEI programs have served to divide people, rather than bring them together, and their efforts will improve intellectual diversity and stop colleges from taking stances on topics they believe to be controversial.
Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, said in a committee meeting during the legislative session the bill to restrict DEI offices in state entities “it addresses a problem that needs to be addressed.”
“It is not the proper place of a state entity to promote ideologies and opinions as their official role,” Rozenboom said.
Reid said she’s also worried about the legislation that takes a less direct approach to limiting freedoms, like those taking action against accrediting bodies and changing authority structures to take control away from the people doing the work and put it in the hands of people outside of the institution.
While federal actions taken against higher education, like changing and halting funding for research and collegiate programming, have captured people’s attention, Reid said the goal behind the PEN America report is to sound the alarm about what is happening potentially under the public’s nose.
It will take more than just halting the spread of new legislation, Reid said, to turn the tides against censorship, because laws currently in place will still be implementing policies that hurt free expression on college campuses. However, people standing up against ideas they believe will hurt higher education could help slow lawmakers who have felt emboldened to continuously bring forward legislation aimed at the country’s colleges.
“Bullies don’t stop until you stand up to them,” Reid said. “And so what PEN is doing by calling attention to this trend is making sure that we don’t lose sight of the damage that’s being done in state capitals across the country … just because we are needing to pay attention to the big federal moves that impact millions of dollars of research funds.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Minnesota taxpayers could be on the hook for about $86 million per year in additional costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as a result of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law he signed earlier this month. The federal government is also expected to cut nearly $40 million earmarked for Minnesota to defray administrative costs of the food program.
SNAP provides food assistance to over 400,000 low-income Minnesotans each month. SNAP beneficiaries receive about $6 per person per day; the program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the states, helping more than 42 million people nationwide.
Minnesota has relatively low SNAP participation compared to other states, but the new law forces states to pay out a share of SNAP benefits based on their payment error rates.
Tikki Brown, commissioner of the Department of Children, Youth and Families, said Tuesday that the state’s payment error rate is not a measure of fraud but of the unintentional mistakes made around processing applications. In 2024, Minnesota had an error rate of 8.98% compared to the national average of 10.93%.
Based on the 2024 error rate, Minnesota would pay about $86 million more annually for the SNAP program under the Trump law, DCYF estimates.

Separately, the new law also reduces the federal reimbursement rate states receive for administrative costs; the agency estimates that will cost Minnesota $39 million. The cost-sharing portion of the bill won’t go into effect until fiscal year 2028.
Trump and his Republican allies in Congress scoured SNAP and other safety net programs, including Medicaid, to find money to help finance tax cuts — whose biggest beneficiaries are the wealthiest families — as well as an increase in defense spending and $160 billion for immigration enforcement. (Even with the cuts, however, the bill will add significantly to the national debt.)
Minnesota elected officials — and ultimately the voters — will have to make hard decisions in the coming years about whether to replace the loss of federal funding for safety net programs by raising taxes or cutting state spending in other areas. Unlike the federal government, Minnesota has a constitutional obligation to balance its budget.
In addition to the new state cost-sharing for SNAP, Trump’s tax bill also expands work requirements for adults to those under age 65, up from age 55, and to families with children older than 13. In Minnesota, about 29,000 additional adults will need to meet the work requirements or risk losing their benefits.
The purported goal of the work requirements is to force recipients to get jobs so they won’t need SNAP assistance in the future, but research shows that work requirements don’t increase employment or earnings. The overwhelming outcome is that people lose their benefits.
Trump’s bill also restricts SNAP to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, meaning that the 8,000 SNAP recipients who are refugees, asylees or hold another legal immigration status will not be eligible.
The Trump administration has also asked states to share the information of food aid recipients, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Tuesday joined a federal lawsuit enjoining that request.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EBTphoto-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-29 18:00:31.622359

(Pool photo by Cody Scanlan/The Des Moines Register)The Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board reprimanded Brian Jorde, an attorney who has represented hundreds of landowners in lawsuits against pipelines, including Iowa and South Dakota landowners opposed to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. 
The disciplinary board wrote in the reprimand that Jorde presented information that was “misleading or deceptive” during Iowa and South Dakota utilities commission proceedings regarding permit applications for the carbon sequestration project. 
Jorde, part of Domina Law Group out of Omaha, represented 155 landowners in the Iowa Utilities Commission’s evaluation of Summit Carbon Solutions’ permit application to construct more than 600 miles of a pipeline carrying liquid carbon dioxide sequestered from biorefineries across the state. The pipeline would travel through Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and eventually be stored in underground rock formations in North Dakota.
In the Iowa permit proceedings, Jorde filed pretrial testimony on behalf of landowners, including Nancy Dugan. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Dugan had filed her own information in the IUC proceedings as well and, according to the reprimand, had been in contact via email with Jorde. 
Jorde also represented landowners in the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission’s hearings on Summit’s permit application. According to the records provided in the reprimand, he asked for and received Dugan’s permission to submit some of her research that had already been submitted in the IUC dockets, to the South Dakota hearings. 
Jorde’s filings on behalf of Dugan, however, included introductory written testimony, which Dugan later said, in an email to Jorde obtained by the advisory board, were “not statements I would choose to submit.”
The reprimand said Dugan did not approve these written statements. The statement submitted in South Dakota had an electronic signature at the bottom, but the IUC document had not been signed by Dugan.
Dugan clarified in her email to Jorde that she was not a landowner and was worried about being called to testify. Jorde, in response, said the filing with the IUC must have happened inadvertently by staff who filed a number of pretrial testimony. He assured Dugan he did not intend to call her to testify, according to the included emails.
In subsequent emails, Dugan asked Jorde to retract the statement, or allow her to submit a revised version that included her actual responses. According to the reprimand, Dugan later learned the same statements had been submitted in South Dakota and again emailed Jorde asking him to refrain from filing any affidavits on her behalf unless it was something she had written or reviewed or approved. 
In April 2024, months after the IUC hearing occurred  Dugan brought up the issue again to Jorde asking him to rescind the statements from the IUC record, according to the reprimand. Jorde said the pretrial testimony was not used in the hearing and therefore not part of the record, so he was unsure what action the IUC would take. He later said to the board the filing was not “material” information to the proceedings, the reprimand states.
“If I file a request to have it deleted for instance that will bring more attention to something Summit and others are not even thinking about now,” Jorde said in an email excerpt included in the letter from the advisory board. 
According to the advisory board, Jorde contacted the IUC about removing the testimony, but did not contact the South Dakota commission about the issue. 
The written testimony attributed to Dugan was not used in the commission hearings in either state. 
Dugan brought the issue to the attention of the IUC council and Nebraska attorney disciplinary authorities, where the matter was brought to the Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board. 
The board concluded the actions in South Dakota were “deceptive” and wrote it was “deeply concerning” that Jorde and his staff did not mention to Dugan the extra pages filed in addition to the research she had consented to filing. 
The board was less clear on its ruling on the Iowa document because Jorde claimed it was inadvertently submitted, which was enforced by the blank notarization. The board “found it troubling” Jorde did not withdraw the filing upon learning it had been inadvertently filed. 
The board concluded that the “severity of the misrepresentation issues” did not “rise to level” of many previously prosecuted matters, but “the duty of candor is one of the most basic and fundamental obligations we require of lawyers.” 
Jorde did not file any exceptions to the reprimand within the allowed 30-day window, meaning the reprimand was made “final and public” according to the document. 
In a message to Iowa Capital Dispatch, Jorde said his focus remains on his clients.  
“I decided not to contest this matter and have moved on,” Jorde wrote. 
There is no further disciplinary action beyond the public reprimand. 
Federal appeals court denies request for rehearing 
A federal appeals court denied a rehearing petition Monday from Iowa counties involved in a case against Summit Carbon Solutions regarding a county’s ability to enact local pipeline ordinances. 
Shelby and Story County supervisors petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit for an en banc rehearing earlier this month following the judge’s ruling in favor of Summit in June. 
One judge dissented in the majority opinion that all of the ordinances set by the counties would be preempted by the Pipeline Safety Act. 
An en banc rehearing, as requested by the counties and supported via amicus briefs from the states of Minnesota, Michigan, Oregon, Vermont and from Pipeline Safety Trust, would require a rehearing of the case with all 11 active judges at the appeals court. 
The order denying the petition for rehearing did not include any additional information or opinion from the judge.

The labor and delivery unit at Newport Hospital remains funded in Brown University Health’s fiscal 2026 budget and is not scheduled to close, according to an update provided earlier Tuesday by the health system’s leader.
But a task force will evaluate the labor and delivery unit’s long-term future over the next year, Brown University Health CEO John Fernandez said. The task force will be looking to assess quality, safety, access, finances, operations, community and statewide impact. 
“We are committed to providing first-class services at Newport Hospital,” Fernandez said in a statement. “This task force will include input from community leaders, donors, nurses, physicians, and others.”

Brown University Health did not immediately respond to an inquiry seeking details about the task force, its membership and a timeline for its work.
“We’re happy for this win, but we’re ready to fight for the continued longevity of the birthing center,” said Brooke Cure, co-founder of Moms Over Margins, which organized a rally scheduled for 6 p.m. in front of Newport City Hall. 
The event was moved from its original location on the grounds of the Great Friends Meeting House at Farewell Street and Dr. Marcus Wheatland Boulevard, which offers little shade on a day when temperatures climbed into the high 80s. Supporters were encouraged to bring signs and wear purple for maternal health. 
Cure, a Newport resident, had her 21-month-old son Thatcher at Newport Hospital. 
“I truly felt like the women who were taking care of me at the birthing center, the OB, the nurses and the midwife that I had, I felt like a daughter, a sister, a friend,” Cure said. “The level of care felt so personal that it would be outrageous to close the center.”
The Newport City Council was able to meet with Brown University Health leadership in groups over a few separate meetings and had been expecting an update on the birthing center this week, Councilor Xay Khamsyvoravong said.
“This is an ideal outcome for us at this point in time,” Khamsyvoravong said. 
Fernandez outlined the challenges facing Brown University Health, which he said has been unable to achieve its 3% operating margin goals over the past decade. Revenues have not kept pace with rising costs for pharmaceuticals, supplies, equipment and labor costs and Medicaid losses reached nearly $138 million in the last two years alone, he added.
“To ensure we can continue to meet the community’s needs for critical patient services, we must act decisively,” Fernandez said. “This means growing revenues, controlling costs, and achieving operational excellence.” 
Recent advocacy efforts secured $23 million in increased support to Brown Health, significantly short of the proposal we made to the state that would have yielded closer to $270 million statewide, Fernandez said. 
“If this underfunding is not addressed within the next one to two years, we will be forced to further reduce patient services, an outcome which is unacceptable to us at Brown Health and is a step we are determined to avoid,” he stated.
Newport City Councilor Ellen Pinnock said she would be willing to be a member of the task force, which she anticipated would have a large number of members representing all the municipalities served by the hospital and include advocates, medical professionals and community leaders.
“I think today’s rally is more of like cautious optimism because we still have some work to do to find a permanent solution,” Pinnnock said.
Rep. Lauren H. Carson, a Newport Democrat, drafted a July 21 letter to Brown University Health voicing strong opposition to the possible closure of the birthing center. It was signed by her and fellow Aquidneck Island representatives Terri Cortvriend and Michelle McGaw of Portsmouth; Marvin L. Abney of Newport and Alex Finkelman of Jamestown. Carson urged hospital and Brown University Health leaders to keep the birthing center open, and to meet with the public locally before any decision is made.
“We’re happy,” Carson said of Brown University Health’s decision Tuesday. “The community of Newport is really excited tonight. Many people in town worked very hard, very hard.”
The advocacy effort included resolutions supporting the birthing center passed by the Newport City Council and the Jamestown and Portsmouth town councils and an online petition drive that has received over 3,000 signatures.
“This is only a one-year plan. There’s more to do on this. The community needs to stay active and that’s what I will be encouraging them to do,” Carson said.
In a statement, Gov. Dan McKee said he spoke with Fernandez earlier Tuesday and learned that community members would be involved with the task force.
“My administration has been advocating behind the scenes for some time to keep the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center open for the families of Newport County,” McKee said. “This is excellent news for a concerned community who, like my administration, prioritizes issues of women’s health. When it comes to childbirth, the time, access, and expertise the Birthing Center provides to Newport County are essential.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi was originally scheduled to speak at Tuesday night’s rally but will not attend.

(Photo by Grand River / Getty Images)New Mexico oil and gas operators polluted more heavily from oil and gas spills in the past three months compared with the prior quarter, according to a recent report released by a local environmental group.
Santa Fe-based WildEarth Guardians compiled spill data reported between April and June 2025 by oil and gas operators to the state’s Oil Conservation Division, following an inaugural report on spill activity earlier this year.
Melissa Troutman, the organization’s climate and health advocate, highlighted the amount of liquid byproducts “lost” during these spills as the largest concern during the most recent assessment. Oil and gas operators “lost” approximately one-third of spilled material, translating into an estimated 422,000 gallons of unrecoverable waste polluting soil and water.
In total, oil and gas producers reported 302 liquid oil and gas spills to state regulators, five fewer than the first three months of 2025. Producers spilled just over 1.3 million gallons, just under half the 3.2 million gallons spilled in the first quarter. More than half the spills occurred on federal public lands. Eddy County had the most spills at 147, followed by Lea County with 128 spills.
“Although it’s really nice to see the overall volume of total material going down, it isn’t the most important number. The most important number is how much of this spill is actually being absorbed by the environment in some way,” Troutman told Source NM.
EOG Resources had the largest spill during the quarter: nearly 160,000 gallons of produced water on state trust land in Lea County, which the report said damaged about 20 acres of area surrounding a produced water reuse pit.
An emailed request for comment to EOG Resources on Tuesday had not received a response by publication. Sidney Hill, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, told Source NM on Tuesday that he had not seen the report and would issue a comment at a later date.
Joey Keefe, a spokesperson for the New Mexico State Land Office, which oversees leasing of state land for oil and gas, told Source NM in an email that WildEarth Guardians notified the state about the spill, prompting further action, writing that “making messes on state lands should never be tolerated.”
“We have been in communication with EOG regarding this spill and the company is actively working to clean it up. The State Land Office will ensure that our lands are returned to their previous state,” Keefe said in a statement. “Commissioner [Stephanie] Garcia Richard has also launched an Environmental Compliance Office staffed with environmental experts to review incidents and provide recommendations to the Commissioner on the best remediation approaches when incidents like this occur.”
Keefe added that the State Land Office plans to meet with EOG officials to discuss the spill and install further precautions, and highlighted the office’s program to plug abandoned oil and gas wells and perform cleanup.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Interior announced the leasing of 7,501 acres of federal lands for oil and gas leasing in New Mexico, generating more than $58 million in revenues.
Troutman said the majority of spills continue to happen on federal public lands.
“We should be having a lot more accountability and enforcement on public land because the federal government is also the regulator, but that’s just not the case here,” Troutman said. “These are public resources that are being sold off, sacrificed and polluted without accountability, more than any other type of oil and gas lease, and we really need to figure out a way to turn that around.”



More about the April to June 2025 spills
Equipment failure continued to be the primary cause of oil and gas spills, followed by corrosion, the same as the previous report.
Most spills — 218 — were of oil and gas wastewater, often called produced water by the industry, accounting for 1.2 million gallons. Produced water which can contain leftovers from oil and gas production, radioactive materials, cancer-causing or toxic chemicals or heavy metals. Produced water also contains chemicals that are not disclosed to the public or regulators under trade secrets protections.
In addition, operators reported 101 spills of crude oil, which can contain cancer-causing materials such as benzene and 25 condensate spills, a byproduct of oil and gas production which contains cancer-causing benzene and other emissions with health impacts.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-29 20:48:05+00:00,CT Mirror,CT sues over ‘chilling effect’ of SNAP recipient data collection,Lisa Hagen and Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/29/snap-recipient-personal-data-william-tong-lawsuit/,The lawsuit seeks to block the Trump administration from conditioning SNAP funding on whether states provide the personal data of applicants.,"Attorney General William Tong joined a multistate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s effort to require states to share personal data of individuals who have received or applied for nutrition assistance.
The lawsuit cites concerns about the “chilling effect” it could have on participation in a program to help low-income families.
States must provide the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, with information on beneficiaries and applicants of the last five years by Wednesday. USDA has indicated it could withhold funds that help states administer SNAP if they don’t comply. 
Connecticut gets about $79 million a year to help run the program.
In May, USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service informed state officials that they would need to provide records to identify enrollees and applicants from the beginning of 2020 until present day by July 30. That information includes, but isn’t limited to, names, dates of birth, personal addresses and Social Security numbers. If they don’t send that information, the guidance notes that could “trigger noncompliance procedures,” which includes the withholding of funds.
The request is part of a wide-ranging effort to collect data from all state programs that receive federal funding and to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order. According to USDA guidance, receiving such information will combat “bureaucratic duplication and inefficiency” and help detect fraud.
At the West End Farmers Market on Tuesday afternoon in Hartford, Emma Frost, who was using SNAP to shop, said the move by the Trump Administration worries her. 
“Of course it concerns me if he’s using it to harm innocent people, to tear apart families, to take people who are just trying to get by on food stamps,” she said. “No, I don’t think that it’s right.”
Tong joined Democratic attorneys general in 20 other states plus the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed Monday, alleging the demand is unconstitutional and violates federal privacy laws. The lawsuit asks the federal court in California to block the administration from conditioning funding on whether states provide SNAP data.
In a statement, Tong said it was unclear why USDA is collecting information and worried about possible misuse. The lawsuit points to additional data collection across the federal government, warning the latest push could be used to help carry out the president’s mass deportation efforts.
“The USDA’s actions are an unprecedented, illegal threat to the privacy of families here in Connecticut and across the country,” Tong said. “By law, Connecticut cannot disclose personally identifying SNAP data unless under very specific and strict circumstances. In this instance, none of those limited circumstances exist. No one knows why this data is being collected, who would be allowed to see it, or if it would even be stored correctly. This is simply yet another attempted illegal power grab by this administration, and we will not bow down to these baseless and reckless demands.”
Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves, whose agency administers SNAP in Connecticut, said that “demanding access to sensitive personal information without transparency and safeguard is alarming.”
A USDA spokesperson said the department does not comment on pending litigation.
The lawsuit lays out the “chilling effect” data collection could have on SNAP and the people who access it across the country. One of the ways it could specifically affect Connecticut and some of the other plaintiff states is through the free and reduced-cost school meals program. Students who receive SNAP benefits automatically qualify for the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program.
Advocates in Connecticut also fear that sharing personal and sensitive information with the federal government will discourage eligible individuals and families from seeking the assistance they need.
“My concern is anything that disincentivizes people from signing up for SNAP, anything that makes it harder for people, anything that would give somebody pause if they qualify for SNAP benefits,” Jason Jakubowski, president and CEO of CT Foodshare, told The Connecticut Mirror. “Our belief at CT Foodshare is if you legally qualify for SNAP benefits, you absolutely should be getting SNAP benefits, and anytime you put up a roadblock or impediment, it means fewer people receiving benefits or able to shop for meals at the grocery store, and ultimately it leads to increased hunger in the community.”
Those concerns were echoed in the lawsuit, particularly around what it could mean for individuals who qualify regardless of their immigration status.
“The mere prospect that SNAP [personally identifiable information] may get shared with other federal agencies, such as DOGE or DHS, for surveillance or broad-based immigration enforcement purposes will discourage individuals from participating in nutrition programs for which they are eligible and authorized to participate. This chilling effect will affect citizens, individuals who are not (or should not be) at risk of deportation, such as green card holders, and mixed-immigration status families with U.S. citizen children,” the lawsuit reads.
While it didn’t specify the exact timeline for Connecticut, the lawsuit noted that it would take months for some of the plaintiff states to be able to compile all of the data requested by USDA.
A couple of months ago, Connecticut was informed by its EBT processing service vendor, Conduent Inc., that federal officials requested the SNAP data. The lawsuit noted Conduent didn’t share confidential information with either USDA or the Department of Government Efficiency based on the agreement it has with the states it works with.
Noncompliance could affect the funding that Connecticut and other states receive to help operate nutrition assistance. Connecticut had about $157 million in SNAP administrative costs for fiscal year 2024, and half was reimbursed by the feds.
The federal government and states currently split the administrative costs to run SNAP evenly, though based on recent legislation, states will take on more of that expense in the next couple of years. 
More than 40 million Americans received food stamps last year. In Connecticut that same year, nearly 400,000 people, or 1 in 9 state residents, got those benefits, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half of the recipients in the state are in families with children. In 2024, Connecticut received a total of $885 million in SNAP benefits. 
The SNAP program will undergo major changes in the next few years for both beneficiaries and the states that administer the federally funded program following the passage of Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
The bill will implement stricter work requirements from some SNAP recipients and require them to work, train or volunteer for at least 80 hours a month. It will raise the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. It will apply to able-bodied adults who have children 14 and older. The bill lowered the age of a dependent, which is currently under age 18.
About 69% of Connecticut households on SNAP already have at least one 18- to 55-year-old member working, according to DSS.
States may also need to pick up some of the costs associated with SNAP benefits for the first time in the nutrition program’s history. The federal government has always paid 100% of the benefits and equally shared the administrative costs with states.
Starting in fiscal year 2028 at the earliest, states will need to keep their payment error rate below 6% in order for the feds to keep paying for all costs associated with SNAP benefits. Error rates factor in overpayments and underpayments to enrollees. Connecticut’s payment error rate was about 10% in 2024.
But advocates feel more confident about how Connecticut is handling changes around nutrition assistance and other federally funded programs compared to other states.
“I think we are fortunate we are here in Connecticut, and we have a governor and legislature committed to these programs,” Jakubowski of CT Foodshare said. “It breaks my heart when I look at some other governments across the union where they quite frankly shrug their shoulders.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/snap-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 18:00:31.622359

krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images)A former investment officer with the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System alleges he was wrongly fired after reporting the state’s pension system was routinely overstating its performance, concealing certain expenses and understating its investment risk.
Rich Wiggins is suing the State of Iowa in Polk County District Court, claiming wrongful discharge and violations of the state’s False Claims Act.
According to the lawsuit, Wiggins was hired by the State of Iowa in June 2022 as the investment risk and operations officer for the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System. In that role, Wiggins replaced Sriram Lakshminarayanan, who moved into the role of IPERS’ chief investment officer.
According to the lawsuit, Wiggins was the head of risk and strategy for Saudi Aramco, the second largest company in the world, before joining IPERS.
Wiggins’ duties as IPERS’ investment risk officer included risk management and monitoring the performance of IPERS’ $40 billion investment portfolio. One of his other duties, according to the lawsuit, was to monitor the conduct of Lakshminarayanan — although Lakshminarayanan had the authority to terminate the employment of Wiggins without cause.
In his lawsuit, Wiggins states that he was “tasked with ensuring that IPERS did not become the next Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System.” In 2021, Pennsylvania’s largest pension fund was at the center of a large scandal and criminal investigation that was tied to the overstatement of its yearly investment returns.
Shortly after Wiggins was hired, Lakshminarayanan allegedly attempted to move Wiggins to a different role, reportedly explaining that “we don’t need a risk officer because we don’t have any risk.”
The lawsuit alleges that assertion was false in that IPERS has more private equity, hedge funds and leveraged products than a typical pension fund, and thus has more risk.
“Wiggins soon discovered that the pension system’s reporting was riddled with errors,” the lawsuit alleges. The three biggest problems, according to the lawsuit, were IPERS’ risk reporting, a benchmarking process intended to measure returns on investments, and the understatement of management fees and expenses.
Lawsuit: State board given ‘false’ information 
In the fall of 2022, the lawsuit alleges, Wiggins shared with Lakshminarayanan his concerns about IPERS’ investment and bookkeeping practices. He also shared data with colleagues who are experts in the field and, according to the lawsuit, they, too, believed IPERS’ measure of risk appeared to be flawed and did not represent a true measure of actual risk.
In October 2022, Wiggins authored a memo suggesting that IPERS bring in an outside consultant to verify its risk calculations. Although the memo allegedly generated no response, Wiggins then began regularly informing Lakshminarayanan that the output of the risk calculations appeared incorrect and could not be verified. Some of the risky strategies employed by IPERS would lead to the fund “doing especially badly in poor market conditions,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Lakshminarayanan and IPERS CEO Gregory Samorajski “engaged in multiple strategies to make it appear that IPERS funds were doing better than they actually were.”
Wiggins alleges Lakshminarayanan and Samorajski presented information to the state’s Investment Board that was misleading — in part by concealing fees that were paid by burying them within transactional costs so they could not be itemized.
Lakshminarayanan and Samorajski submitted the “false information” to the board and then asked for additional compensation in the form of bonuses, the lawsuit alleges.
“IPERS is, in fact, paying egregiously high fees,” the lawsuit claims. “The benchmark goals for the fund were manipulated to make it appear the fund is doing better than it truly is. The benchmark is designed to be just below the returns that are reported. A huge swath of the portfolio is benchmarked directly to itself so it is impossible to underperform.”
The lawsuit claims this “surreptitious use of easy-to-beat benchmarks” by which IPERS’ investment performance was measured was “at best, a form of engineered outperformance and, at worst, rank intentional misrepresentation.”
On Feb. 2, 2023, Wiggins was fired after just seven months on the job, the lawsuit alleges, adding that the reason he was given at the time was that he was “a bad fit” for IPERS.
IPERS did not replace him, the lawsuit claims, so currently there is no investment risk officer. “In effect, (Lakshminarayanan) acts as the risk officer, which is contrary to best practices,” the lawsuit alleges.
As part of his lawsuit, Wiggins claims that by attempting to get IPERS to accurately report risk, fees, and investment performance to the board and to the public, he was attempting to bring an end to violations of the state’s False Claims Act. The state, he alleges, “retaliated” against him by firing him.
The lawsuit also alleges his termination was ran counter to public interest in that his “pointing out irregularities concerning risk and risk reporting” was intended to support the state’s pension system and its statutory goals.
The State of Iowa has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the Iowa Attorney General’s Office did not respond to requests for comment on the matter.
State records indicate that in 2024, Lakshminarayanan was paid $351,184 in salary, and that Samorajski was paid $239,950.
According to IPERS, Lakshminarayanan has a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Pondicherry University, India, and a master’s degree in industrial and manufacturing systems engineering from Ohio University.

But it won’t get any sale proceeds.","When it comes to a specialty license plate promoting pizza and a charity, you gotta read the fine print. Or at least understand the limits of a phrase on Connecticut’s newest specialty tag: “Supporting Connecticut Foodshare.”
The plate costs $65 and bears the image of a pepperoni pizza slice and the Foodshare logo. In place of the standard “Constitution State” slogan is one bragging about Connecticut’s claim to be “The Pizza State.”
But, as the office of Gov. Ned Lamont now knows, when it comes to the fee for the pizza plate, there is no sharing with Foodshare. The money goes to the DMV, as is the case for most special plates.
“We are not getting a piece,” said Jason Jakubowski, the president and chief executive officer of the 43-year-old nonprofit that serves as a statewide food bank, supplying pantries, meal programs and mobile sites.
He was not complaining. The plate gives Connecticut Foodshare a branding boost and an opportunity to raise money. Buying the plate is done on Foodshare’s web site at www.ctfoodshare.org/pizzaplate, which offers a convenient button to make a donation.
And yes, Jakubowski said, “We are encouraging people to donate to us.”
But the episode calls attention to the quirky nature of all those specialty plates on Connecticut motor vehicles. A chosen few share the proceeds with a charity. (The choosing is done by an act of the General Assembly.)

Supporting Connecticut Foodshare doesn’t mean cutting in the non-profit for a share of the license plate revenue. Credit: CTFoodshare
The governor arrived at a promotional event Monday unaware of that twist. 
A press advisory from his office had stated the plate would be added to the roster of “more than 50 types of specialty license plates that serve as fundraisers benefitting local nonprofit organizations.”
“I didn’t quite focus on that,” Lamont said Tuesday. “I knew there was a button you could click.”
Tony Guerrera, the commissioner of motor vehicles, has no authority to unilaterally direct DMV fees to charity. When he does, it is at the direction of the General Assembly.
The legislature’s Office of Legislative Research lists 16 instances where lawmakers have mandated that a charity get a cut. They include plates commemorating the Amistad slave uprising and promoting environmental, animal welfare and children’s health causes, as well as the U.S. Olympic team.
For every Cure Kids Cancer plate sold, for example, $10 goes to the pediatric oncology units at the Connecticut Children’s Medical Center and Yale-New Haven Children’s Hospital. The Ferrari Club of America gets a logo, but no cash. That’s also the case with the Benevolent &  Protective Order of the Elks. But a Hartford Whalers plate gets a few bucks for Connecticut Children’s Medical.
The costs of the specialty plate are additional to the basic costs of registering a motor vehicle.
Jakubowski said his group is happy to partner with DMV on the pizza plate, and he noted that Lamont and the legislature provided additional funding in the new budget to partly offset losses in the federal funding.
“The unfortunate reality is that even in a wealthy state like Connecticut, hunger is on the rise, an 11% increase over the last year,” Jakubowski said. “There’s about 515,000 Connecticut residents who don’t know where the next meal is coming from.”
Jakubowski said Guerrera, who is a former lawmaker, predicted the pizza plate would be popular, possibly resulting in the General Assembly adding Foodshare to the groups that can get a share of the sales.
Any nonprofit can seek the visibility of getting their logo on a license plate by applying to the DMV. Three municipalities also have done so: the cities of Meriden and Norwich and town of Stafford.
Meriden claims to be the crossroads of Connecticut, Norwich the rose of New England, and Stafford the “nation’s 1st resort.”
The latter is a reference to the mineral springs in Stafford that Cleveland Amory once described in a book has having ”the honor of being the first recognized society resort in the country.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8103-1024x750.jpeg,,,2025-07-29 18:00:31.622359
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-29 20:25:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump EPA moves to repeal finding that allows climate regulation,Jan Ellen Spiegel and Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/29/trump-epa-repeal-climate-regulation-finding/,The EPA’s decision does not alter CT's efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions but is likely to make it harder for it to meet its goals.,"As it has said for months it would do, the Environmental Protection Agency Tuesday began the process of overturning its key tool for fighting climate change. 
Known by its shorthand — the endangerment finding — it refers to a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling under which the EPA began regulating greenhouse gas emissions in addition to the standard pollutants it had been regulating under the Clean Air Act since 1970. The finding said that the EPA had to regulate any air pollutant found to endanger “public health or welfare.”
The announcement, made by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at an event in Indiana, disputes how the EPA administered some of the original court decision.
Repealing the endangerment finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,” Zeldin said on the Ruthless podcast ahead of the official announcement.
“There are people who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,” Zeldin said. “They created this endangerment finding and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence, in many cases, a lot of segments of our economy. And it cost Americans a lot of money.”
The EPA proposal must go though a lengthy review process, including public comment, before it is finalized, likely next year. Environmental groups are likely to challenge the rule change in court.
Zeldin called for a rewrite of the endangerment finding in March as part of a series of environmental rollbacks announced at the same time in what he said was “the greatest day of deregulation in American history.” A total of 31 key environmental rules on topics from clean air to clean water and climate change would be rolled back or repealed under Zeldin’s plan.
He singled out the endangerment finding as “the Holy Grail of the climate change religion” and said he was thrilled to end it “as the EPA does its part to usher in the Golden Age of American success.”
While the EPA’s decision does not alter Connecticut’s own efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions, it is likely to make it harder for the state to meet its goals.
Exhaust from cars and trucks makes up by far the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Connecticut, according to the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, followed by emissions from residential and commercial buildings.
“Rolling back these protections puts our communities — especially our children, seniors, and vulnerable populations — at greater risk from the harmful effects of greenhouse gas pollution,” said Gov. Ned Lamont. “Connecticut has a proud, bipartisan history of standing up for environmental safeguards, and we won’t sit by while decades of progress are dismantled.”
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, who has filed for Connecticut to join a number of lawsuits against other Trump measures and cutbacks, similarly argued state officials would not let “Trump and Zeldin do this without a fight.”
Tailpipe emission limits also targeted
The EPA also rescinds limits on tailpipe emissions that were designed to encourage automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.
Environmental groups said Zeldin’s action denies reality as weather disasters exacerbated by climate change continue in the U.S. and around the world.
“As Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It boggles the mind and endangers the nation’s safety and welfare.”
Under Zeldin and Trump, “the EPA wants to shirk its responsibility to protect us from climate pollution, but science and the law say otherwise,” she added. “If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.”
Gina McCarthy, who led Connecticut’s environment department and then served as the air bureau chief and EPA administrator for President Barack Obama as well as a national climate advisor to President Joe Biden, said in a statement: “Trump’s EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs.” 
McCarthy is now managing co-chair of the climate activist group America Is All In.
The New England based Conservation Law Foundation, which specializes in legal action on behalf of environmental issues, also issued a statement.
“President Trump is once again siding with Big Oil and Gas over our health,” said Kate Sinding Daly, the group’s senior vice president for law and policy. “It’s a scientific fact: fossil fuel pollution is deadly. But President Trump is trying to erase that truth. His administration is attacking the EPA’s legal backbone that that gives the agency power to regulate climate-warming emissions and the danger they pose. Gutting it would strip away vital protections, lead to dirtier air, and cost lives.” 
Motor vehicle pollution is known to worsen asthma and many other health, lung and heart problems. It tends to disproportionately impact at-risk communities already suffering from higher pollution and the effects of the more intense storms caused by climate change. 
“Let’s be clear: this isn’t just wrong — it’s an attack on public health, basic science, and families who just want clean air and a livable future. And all to let polluters keep profiting while the rest of us choke on the consequences,” Sinding Daly said.  
Three former EPA leaders have also criticized Zeldin, saying his March announcement targeting the endangerment finding and other rules imperiled the lives of millions of Americans and abandoned the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.
“If there’s an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they’re doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about,” Christine Todd Whitman, who led EPA under Republican President George W. Bush, said after Zeldin’s plan was made public.
The EPA proposal follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report “on the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding, which came directly from Project 2025, released during the 2024 presidential campaign.
Conservatives and some congressional Republicans hailed the initial plan, calling it a way to undo economically damaging rules to regulate greenhouse gases.
But environmental groups, legal experts and Democrats said any attempt to repeal or roll back the endangerment finding would be an uphill task with slim chance of success. The finding came two years after a 2007 Supreme Court ruling holding that the EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
Dan Esty, who is the Hillhouse professor at Yale serving in both Yale Law School and the School of the Environment, said through the regulation provided by the endangerment finding, the U.S was moving towards a clean energy future and greenhouse gas emissions were going down.
“This disrupts that process, and it puts the United States at odds with virtually every other country in the world,” said Esty, who was Connecticut’s first commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, serving from 2011 to 2014.
He also noted that the EPA action is in sharp contrast to the International Court of Justice opinion last week, which declared that any number of elements of this regulatory package could be seen as in violation of international law and subject the United States and potentially entities operating within it to legal consequences around the world.
Esty’s legal assessment is that the administration will face significant difficulty proving that the evidence does not suggest that there’s a problem that needs to be addressed on the Clean Air Act. He said the tactic seems to be to shift from focusing on the science to focusing on the cost. But he called the trillion dollar price tag floated by Zeldin “a fictional number picked out of the air and has no bearing to the reality on the ground.”
“They face substantial challenges in meeting the basic test under the Administrative Procedure Act, which is where the litigation will go. And that is, are they acting in a manner that is arbitrary and capricious?” he said. “They have to demonstrate with substantial evidence that the direction they want to go is justified. And I do not think they will be able to meet that legal test.”
Charles Rothenberger is an attorney and director of Connecticut government relations at Save the Sound. He said the endangerment finding is a scientific finding, not a policy determination. “You can’t just willy nilly reverse yourself as an agency and say, ‘well, what we believed yesterday, we don’t believe today.’ There has to be substantial evidence to support that, and a clear and compelling reason to do that. So what the administration is bringing to the table, really is a policy preference,” he said.
Passing court muster could be an issue
David Doniger, a climate expert at the NRDC, accused Trump’s Republican administration of using potential repeal of the endangerment finding as a “kill shot” that would allow him to make all climate regulations invalid. If finalized, repeal of the endangerment finding would erase current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from cars, factories, power plants and other sources and could prevent future administrations from proposing rules to tackle climate change.
“The Endangerment Finding is the legal foundation that underpins vital protections for millions of people from the severe threats of climate change, and the Clean Car and Truck Standards are among the most important and effective protections to address the largest U.S. source of climate-causing pollution,” said Peter Zalzal, associate vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund.
“Attacking these safeguards is manifestly inconsistent with EPA’s responsibility to protect Americans’ health and well-being,” he said. “It is callous, dangerous and a breach of our government’s responsibility to protect the American people from this devastating pollution.”
Conrad Schneider, a senior director at the Clean Air Task Force, said the Trump administration “is using pollution regulations as a scapegoat in its flawed approach to energy affordability” and reliability.
He and other advocates “are dismayed that an administration that claims it cares about cleaner, healthier and safer air is seeking to dismantle the very protections that are required for those conditions,” Schneider said.
“This decision is both legally indefensible and morally bankrupt,” said Joseph Goffman, former assistant administrator of EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. “The Supreme Court made clear that EPA cannot ignore science or evade its responsibilities under the Clean Air Act. By walking away from the endangerment finding, EPA has not only broken with precedent; it has broken with reality.”

The University of Vermont Health Network announced Tuesday it will cut 77 positions, including 68 staff roles and nine leadership roles, as part of its plan to reduce expenses for the coming fiscal year. 
The health network — which comprises six hospitals in Vermont and northern New York — will also not fill 69 current vacancies in the network following Tuesday’s announcement. The network chose not to fill 120 vacant positions last year, and several hundred more positions were phased out this year.
The announced staffing cuts, which amount to over $5 million in spending reductions, come a week ahead of hospital budget hearings overseen by the Green Mountain Care Board, which is tasked with reviewing budgets for the upcoming fiscal year at all 14 of the state’s non-federal hospitals. 
The cuts are largely to positions not involved in direct patient care, specifically in the networkwide finance, human resources and information technology teams.
Along with layoffs, the health network is aiming to reduce spending through deferring capital projects, increasing efficiencies in clinical care and administrative work, reducing traveling and temporary workers in favor of permanent staff, eliminating performance-based bonuses for administrative leaders, and consolidating real estate. 
The plans set forth Tuesday represent approximately $185 million in expense reductions, according to the network.
This story will be updated.

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Abortion access advocates say the number of Iowans who seek abortions has not decreased in the year since the state’s six-week abortion ban began enforcement — but the barriers to receiving that care have risen.
The so-called “fetal heartbeat” law went into effect on July 29, 2024. The law, signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds in 2023, bans abortions after cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, which can occur as early as six weeks of gestation. Some exceptions exist in the law, including for reported cases of rape and incest, and when an abortion is necessary to save the mother.
According to data from the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, the number of abortions performed in Iowa decreased sharply in 2024 after the law was enacted. In 2023, there were 2,771 induced terminations of pregnancies in the state, a number that fell to 1,792 in 2024. Last year, two-thirds, 1,196, of those abortions occurred in the first six months, before the abortion law went into effect, according to preliminary HHS data.

As abortions performed in Iowa fell following the law’s enactment, Planned Parenthood North Central States said the number of Iowans traveling to other states for abortion care increased by 182% in that time period.
Groups like the Chicago Abortion Fund (CAF), a group that partners with the Iowa Abortion Access Fund (IAAF), have been working in the past year to help Iowans travel out of state for abortion services. These two groups have helped 870 Iowans in accessing abortion services, according to a news release, with 75% of those people traveling to other states to receive care.
Megan Jeyifo, executive director of CAF, said their organizations have provided more than over $382,000 in direct support to Iowans seeking abortion care in the past year. These funds are needed because demand for these medical services has not diminished under the ban — they have only become more difficult for Iowans to access, she said.
“As awful as this has been for Iowans, the numbers of Iowans having abortions has not gone down post this ban and that could be for a lot of reasons,” Jeyifo said. “… We know abortion bans don’t … stop abortions. People are going to have abortions, it’s just going to make it really, really, really hard and traumatic and stressful and exhausting and awful for them. And … that’s where we come in to try to mitigate.”
Many Iowans seeking this care are going to states including Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Wisconsin to get access abortion services, she said. The abortion funds also still provide resources to help people find medical care within the state.
But for people seeking abortions within the state, accessing care that remains legal under the 2023 law can be a struggle, Dr. Emily Boevers, who provides OB-GYN services in Waverly said. In a news conference on the one-year anniversary of the abortion ban Tuesday, Boevers said doctors across the state are having trouble helping patients who need abortions when their pregnancies are nonviable or if their lives are endangered.
She shared the story of a fellow physician who performed an abortion when a patient faced with ongoing bleeding and increased instability during early pregnancy in order to preserve their life and wellbeing. Though the doctor studied the law to ensure it met the guidelines on a legal abortion with the support from the patient and their family, they were met with a “weekslong inquiry from her hospital system and their risk management team and legal team about if she had violated the law, including an ethics inquiry,” Boevers said.
“And again, this is one of the few OB-GYNs providing care in Iowa, who saved a maternal life, and should be thanked for saving this life and keeping this woman healthy for her family, and meeting this woman’s needs … but instead, she faced a weekslong legal inquiry,” Boevers said. “That is one example — and an extreme one for sure, because we all fear what will happen If we have an unstable patient in our care and how we will respond ,and how we will be able to meet the needs of that patient while also preserving our ability to care for all of the other patients in preserving our licensure.”
While Democrats and reproductive health care advocates said the law has had negative impacts for women and mothers, Republicans have celebrated the law, and said there are other avenues where the state is supporting maternal and infant health care.
Reynolds said in a Tuesday news release the decrease in abortions since the law began enforcement shows “a powerful victory for life.” She also pointed to other measures that show the state’s commitment to supporting mothers and children, like the More Options for Maternal Support, or MOMS program, providing state funding for maternal care nonprofits that encourage alternatives to abortion — referred to by some as “crisis pregnancy centers” — as well as the state’s extension for postpartum Medicaid coverage at a lower income eligibility level.
“This is what it means to be comprehensively pro-life — surrounding everyone involved in a pregnancy with love and support, promoting strong families, and intentionally building a culture of life,” Reynolds said.
Iowa Democrats have said these decisions have not meaningfully made maternal health care more accessible for Iowans in need. Jeyifo, with CAF, also said GOP efforts to highlight investments in maternal health care while talking about abortion bans is “asking people to believe that two things cannot exist together.” Being able to access abortion care is a meaningful component of maternal health care, she said, including for prospective parents.
“In my view, both as a mother and a person who’s had abortions and a person who does this work, you simply cannot improve maternal health outcomes while stripping people the ability to decide if, when, and how they’re going to parent or give birth,” Jeyifo said.
Iowa Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner said Tuesday the abortion law also has new implications a year later, when put in the context of cuts to Medicaid made through the budget reconciliation bill advanced by Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump. Iowa already had a maternal health care shortage, she said, and the compounding impacts of the abortion ban and potential closure of hospitals will make accessing this care even more difficult.
“When our federal representatives and senators in Washington vote to roll back Medicaid coverage — which is going to have an even further impact on rural hospitals, on nursing homes, but also, ultimately on our urban hospitals — that has an impact on everyone in the state and their ability to access care,” Weiner said. “I believe, personally, that that really started with abortion bans. Because when it seems like it’s okay to take away one right, one way to access medical care, suddenly that opens the door. And those are definitely issues that we will be talking to voters about in the run-up to 2026.”

According to data presented to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee by Jackie Vention, chief operating officer for the Department of State, the percentage of state registered EV or hybrid electric vehicles has grown steadily since 2020. 
The latest figures for 2025 show that 3.87%, or 310,349 of the state’s 8.01 million total registered vehicles, were classified as some sort of electric, plug-in electric hybrid or non-plug-in electric hybrid vehicle.
The figure was 1.30% in 2020; 1.51% in 2021; 1.83% in 2022; 2.22% in 2023; and 2.8% last year.
Venton said the number of non-plug-in electric hybrid vehicles saw the largest increase in EV types now on the road, as well as standard electric vehicles. 
The gains in EV ownership were tempered by the fact that the pool only made up less than 4% of total vehicles registered in Michigan, but the signs of growth and acceptance of EVs were evident in heat maps created by the department that were shown to the committee. Heat maps are data representations using various shades of color to represent numerical values in the form of a map.

Heat maps for all three EV types show their wider use across Michigan’s 83 counties in the last five years, with some gains along the west Michigan coastline, central and mid-Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.
The Top 5 areas for EV registrations were made up of Michigan’s larger counties, including Kent, Macomb, Oakland, Wayne and Washtenaw. Although those areas might seem more well-suited for EVs because the Metro Detroit communities are in close proximity, Venton said there was also growth in EV registrations in places like Chippewa, Gratiot, Iron, Menominee and Wexford counties.

The data on EV ownership in the state also came with news that, on average, registration fees for non-traditional vehicles are roughly making up the difference of whatever motor fuel tax revenue was lost through the use of gasoline guzzling vehicles.
  Non-plug-in electric hybrid vehicle registration data provided by the Michigan Department of State | Screenshot
William Hamilton, a senior fiscal analyst with Michigan House Fiscal Agency, said quick math from the Federal Highway Administration shows that the average vehicle owner uses about 500 gallons of gasoline per year. Multiply that by 26 miles per gallon, which is the average mpg on most cars and trucks, and Hamilton said that figure roughly equates the amount of surcharge placed on EVs.
Hamilton noted that of the 10 million annual vehicle registrations, only about 100,000 are either hybrid or electric, calling it “a pretty small part of the equation.”
“I don’t want to say [that non-traditional vehicles are paying] their fair share, because that kind of weights the issue a little bit, but it seems like they are, roughly, compared in the aggregate [data]. Individual drivers may have different experiences, but the big picture is the surcharge seems roughly equivalent to the loss of motor fuel tax revenue,” Hamilton said.

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma’s Attorney General Gentner Drummond signed a letter Tuesday asking Congress to ban so-called abortion shield laws in states where the procedure remains legal.
In a letter co-signed by 15 other state attorneys general, Drummond and others wrote, “These laws are blatant attempts to interfere with states’ ability to enforce criminal laws within their borders and disrupt our constitutional structure.”
States where abortion remains legal have passed laws protecting abortion providers from legal consequences if they perform abortions for residents of states where abortion is banned or supply residents in those states with medications that induce abortion. Such shield laws arose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and many states, like Arkansas, passed new bans or allowed previous bans that had been dormant to go into effect.
Some of these shield laws explicitly protect abortion providers who prescribed and shipped abortion pills to women in states with bans, frustrating attempts by anti-abortion officials to prosecute the providers.
Louisiana criminally charged Dr. Margaret Carpenter of New York earlier this year for prescribing and mailing abortion pills — the first time a provider has been charged with providing abortion medication over state lines. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, however, refused to arrest or extradite Carpenter.
At a morning press conference in Little Rock, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin compared shield laws to sanctuary laws for those living in the U.S. illegally, saying they protect those who flout Arkansas’ outright abortion ban from being extradited to face criminal charges or to impose liability.
“You’re going to allow people to operate in your border in a way that violates our law, that specifically and openly flouts our law, but you’re going to protect them from the consequences of that,” Griffin said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Griffin said he believes what he is asking lawmakers to do is different from a federal abortion ban that the closely-divided Congress has seemed hesitant to tackle.
“This has more to do with a constitutional structure and states enforcing their own law. This is not about me enforcing New York’s law or vice versa,” Griffin said. “It’s about one state interfering … with the enforcement of another state’s law.”
But Griffin acknowledged that asking for action and Congressional movement on the matter were two different matters. Abortion proved to be a weak issue for the GOP in the years since Roe was overturned, as public opinion continues to favor the procedure remaining legal in all or most cases, according to the Pew Research Center. Persistent victories in favor of abortion access at the ballot box preceded some Republicans backing off from hardline rhetoric, while President Donald Trump said he would veto a federal ban on the 2024 campaign trail.
Griffin also announced Tuesday that he was sending cease-and-desist letters to two entities shipping abortion pills within the United States and to two website companies that provide website services to LifeOnEasyPills.org, a site Griffin said his office believed was based in India that ships abortion medication.
In the letters, he said website language that said abortion pills are safe “may constitute” deceptive advertising under state law, citing studies that argue that mifepristone, a drug used in medication-induced abortions, is unsafe.
If the entities don’t cease advertising abortion pills in Arkansas, Griffin said his office may bring a lawsuit against them for violating the state’s deceptive trade practices law.
Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000, and medical professionals widely consider its use in abortions safe.
Griffin would not say whether any of the websites he targeted with the cease-and-desist letters had actually mailed pills to Arkansas.
“I think I could say definitively … that these particular cease-and-desist orders relate to the messaging of the advertising,” Griffin said. “We have some other inquiries, investigations that are ongoing that aren’t related to this.”

Other frozen funds for programs including English as a second language are expected to be approved soon. Getty Images.The Georgia Board of Education met briefly Tuesday to distribute $48.2 million in previously frozen federal funds to centers that provide summer and after-school programs for kids.
Katie Landes, director of the Georgia Statewide Afterschool Network, celebrated the vote as a victory for students and parents.
“The release of the anticipated funds brings tremendous relief to schools and community-based programs statewide,” Landes said in a statement. “Maintaining consistent funding is essential for sustainable programming and reducing uncertainties, particularly just days before the school year starts for many.”
The funds for the programs, called 21st Century Community Learning Centers, came under question at the end of June, when the Trump administration announced it would freeze $6.8 billion in federal funds nationwide. The pauses – which were announced one day before the money was supposed to go out – also included dollars for migrant education, English as a second language, college and career counseling and others.
The Trump administration has signaled plans to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education and return its duties to the states, though abolishing it entirely would require an act of Congress.
The freeze sparked bipartisan condemnation, including in the form of a letter signed by 10 Republican senators to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought urging the funding be restored.
On July 18, the administration announced it would release the first part of the funds for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program, and the Department of Education unfroze the rest of the funds a week later.
Stan DeJarnett, who chairs the state board of education, indicated he expects the board to vote to approve the remainder of those unfrozen funds soon.
“Even though the remaining federal funds were announced last Friday that they would be released, we don’t have actual fund amounts for these different categories. So that’s the reason they are not on this morning’s agenda. So we may be back having this meeting again very soon once we get some more guidance on the amount of the appropriation in each of those federal fund categories.”

It took less than a month for scams to develop targeting those victims.
RECA — created in 1990 to provide restitution to people sickened by exposure to radiation and uranium — excluded New Mexico’s downwinders and post-1971 uranium miners, expired last year after years of lobbying for expansion by victims and New Mexico’s elected leaders.
But President Donald Trump signed a two-year expansion and extension into law earlier this month as part of Republicans so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.”
‘The beginning of justice’

On Tuesday, both the New Mexico Department of Justice and the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium issued a warning that RECA scams have already developed. According to an NMDOJ news release, “organizations and attorneys are soliciting people to file claims with them for a fee, despite the fact that New Mexico will have a legitimate claim submission process and guidance forthcoming.”
The U.S. Department of Justice has not yet announced an official claims process for qualifying New Mexicans. Both U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) last week recently sent letters to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer urging them to issue guidance quickly for RECA given the short two-year timeline for compensation.
“We are grateful to our Congressional Delegation who tirelessly advocated for the expansion of these critical compensation efforts,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “New Mexicans who have been affected by these exposures deserve compensation — and they deserve to get that compensation free from bad actors attempting to take advantage of them. We encourage New Mexicans to file claims through legitimate entities to ensure they receive the maximum compensation they are entitled to through RECA, and also to file any reports of suspected fraudulent activity with our office.”
The news release notes that any entity that files a RECA claim on behalf of residents will charge a fee, which is capped at 2% by law, but can increase to 10% if that claim is rejected. Moreover, the state will have official RECA clinics to assist people.
The Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium said it will have official updates online.

(Lance Cheung/USDA/Public domain)As nearly everyone who hunts, hikes, camps, climbs, paddles or otherwise recreates on public lands knows well, during the first half of 2025 we fended off repeated attempts to put public lands on the chopping block, selling them off to the highest bidder. In the words of American Hunters & Anglers co chair Land Tawney, “You spoke up. You showed up. You stopped this disaster — for now. Round One goes to the people.”
A mandate to sell millions of acres of federal land did not make it into President Donald Trump’s mega tax bill signed during July after a wide range of opponents, including environmentalists, ranchers, hunters, anglers, right-wing influences and business leaders rallied against the proposal from Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican. Members and supporters of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, for example, sent 33,000 communications to U.S. senators on June 25 — dubbed “Flood the Lines Day” — urging them to reject the measure.
Despite our collective efforts, Congress still passed a bill that ransacks public lands. We knew whatever passed was likely going to be bad for public lands habitat and, hence, hunters and anglers, but to use a hunting term, the reconciliation bill passed by Congress “gutted” public lands habitat protections in favor of resource extraction.

In a November 2024 Backcountry Hunters & Anglers blog post, the group’s president and CEO, Patrick Berry, explains that throughout our history land barons and developers have endeavored to swipe public lands right out from underneath us.
On the Fourth of July, Trump signs his ‘big, beautiful bill’ into law

“Now these long-time swindlers have a growing roster of accomplices in the form of politicians who have zero shame cutting Americans out of our own public lands legacy,” he wrote.
By February 2025 we had a sense of what was coming after former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum was confirmed as secretary of the Interior and made it clear that he was hellbent on implementing an “energy dominance” agenda. Burgum went on to issue a slate of new secretarial orders directing Interior agencies to prioritize drilling and mining on our public lands.
“Conservation of fish and wildlife habitat and opportunities for hunters and anglers must be included as equal values,” Berry emphasized in February. “When the United States is currently producing more energy than any nation in history, these aggressive and uncompromising policies to expedite development on public lands only benefit one stakeholder group – private industry.”
Hunter Randy Newberg (host of “Fresh Tracks,” “On Your Own Adventures,” and “Hunt Talk Radio”) said on his July 18 Fresh Tracks episode, “The considerations previously given to wildlife and important habitat like wintering range, migration corridors, summer range in a lot of places … those protections just went …”
“We’re gonna see it, we’re talking about it from a hunting standpoint,” Newberg added. “We are going to see consequences to wildlife and wildlife herds because of these provisions. I don’t know how else to say it … it’s like let’s turn this into an industrial landscape wherever we can … it really opens the gates …”
The reconciliation bill was essentially a public lands giveaway in disguise.
The Trump administration has now implemented the statutory framework for their energy dominance agenda by directing that logging and mining along with oil, gas and coal extraction trump all other uses on our multiple-use public lands. Although the deed to our public lands may not have been handed over directly to private industry, the reconciliation bill ditched decades of balanced multiple-use public lands policy in favor of one group — billionaire buzzards.
For a summary of the reconciliation bill’s public lands provisions, see this July 11 post by Jim Pattiz on his More Than Just Parks substack. In Pattiz’s words, “Every single piece of this would be bad on its own. Together, it’s the most aggressive dismantling of public lands protection in American history.”
It’s a sucker punch to all Americans, but as military strategist Sun Tzu said, “In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.”
As America’s first conservationists, hunters have a century-old tradition of protecting public lands habitat and fighting those driven by myopic greed. The billionaire buzzards have overreached badly and underestimate our resolve.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor) Homelessness in New Jersey surged 8% since last year, new figures show, a jump that comes as federal cuts threaten food and housing assistance and other Medicaid benefits for thousands of residents.
Affordable housing advocates identified 13,748 people who were living in shelters, hotels, or on the street Jan. 28 during the “Point in Time” count, an annual enumeration done every January of the state’s homeless population. That’s about 1,068 people more than advocates counted last year, and the highest number recorded since 2014, when the state’s homeless population stood at 13,900, according to Monarch Housing Associates, the nonprofit that coordinates the count.
Most — 11,753 people — were living in shelters, hotels or motels, transitional housing, or safe haven programs, Monarch reported. But advocates also counted almost 2,000 people living outside, in vacant or abandoned buildings, or in other locations not meant for human habitation, with such unsheltered homelessness more than doubling in New Jersey since 2022. Sixteen percent of those counted were considered chronically homeless.
Federal cuts to critical safety nets will only make things worse, with cuts implemented in a recently passed spending bill and proposed for the next federal budget threatening to “destroy the very infrastructure we rely on to support our most vulnerable neighbors,” said Taiisa Kelly, Monarch’s CEO.

“This is happening at a time when we are seeing increasing affordability issues, increases in unsheltered homelessness, and more communities criminalizing homelessness,” Kelly said.
She called on policymakers to invest in solutions proven to reduce homelessness, including housing assistance strategies known as rapid rehousing and housing first, which place people in permanent housing and typically come with support services like financial assistance and landlord mediation.
Homelessness has steadily risen in New Jersey since 2021, with an average increase of 14% annually, said Katelyn Ravensbergen, a senior associate at Monarch.
“While our systems are working to connect everyone they can with stable housing, the number of households entering homelessness is unfortunately increasing at a rate that outpaces the expansion of housing opportunities and other supports,” Ravensbergen said. “This issue will be further exacerbated if federal programs historically used to rapidly rehouse these families are reduced or eliminated as proposed.”
Under the federal budget bill President Donald Trump signed July 4, about 350,000 residents are expected to lose Medicaid coverage and 424,000 families likely will see some or all of their monthly Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits end, advocates said.
Congress members are now developing budgets for federal agencies for the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Funding for housing and homeless service programs is expected to shrink, with some programs targeted for elimination altogether. That includes the Home Investment Partnerships Program, which funds the development of affordable housing. New Jersey and its counties and municipalities received $34.7 million in funding from that program last year, according to Monarch.
This year’s count also showed several demographic disparities persist:

Families with at least one child accounted for about a third of those experiencing homelessness.
Veterans continue to struggle with homelessness, with 543 veterans counted, representing a 4.8% increase since last year.
Black people continue to experience homelessness at disproportionately higher rates than people of other racial or ethnic identities, comprising 47.4% of the homeless population, even though just 12% of New Jersey residents are Black.
Essex County had the largest homeless population statewide.

Advocates chalked the increase in unsheltered homelessness up to the overburdened shelter system. In recent months, shelters have operated at more than 90% of their capacity every day, and they cannot accommodate rising homelessness, advocates say.
The latest count reveals the human toll of the worsening housing affordability crisis, said Michael Callahan, director of the state homelessness prevention office.
“The data confirms what our communities have long known: homelessness is being driven not just by poverty, but by deep structural inequities, including systemic racism and the dramatic shortage of affordable homes,” Callahan said. “It is a call to action for bolder, better-targeted investment in prevention, housing, and justice.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Two days before the deadline for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to renew the lease for its Providence headquarters, the state panel tasked with approving a 10-year agreement requested more time Tuesday so it can review a last-minute air quality report and schedule a public hearing.
Two dozen people packed the second floor Department of Administration conference room for a special meeting of the State Properties Committee. The meeting only lasted 20 minutes, but the agenda did not allow for public comment on whether the state should continue to lease the building at 101 Friendship Street. 
The lease is up on Nov. 30. But July 31 is when DCYF needs the committee’s approval, or else it must start looking for a new headquarters somewhere else.
Ahead of the meeting, SEIU Local 580 president Matthew Gunip — whose union represents roughly 300 of the 460 DCYF workers in the building — set up a collection of photographs, most printed at around 2 to 3-feet high, taken inside the building in the capital city’s Jewelry District.
Images included water leaking from a ceiling, a rotting rat inside of a trash bag, and black specks surrounding an air vent.
“And that’s what was going on in the office as of Friday,” he told Rhode Island Current.
DCYF Chief of Staff Misty Delgado took photos of the union’s visual aids on her phone and told the committee that officials would “look into it and see if it’s valid.”
“The reality is a lot of this is theatrics,” she said as the union workers in attendance groaned.
The committee voted unanimously to continue approval of the proposed 10-year lease in order to schedule a public hearing. No date was announced as of Tuesday.
“As you can see there’s quite a bit of public interest in this,” said the committee’s chairman, Marco Schiappa.
Officials for DCYF and the Department of Administration first sought the approval of a new decade-long lease from the State Properties Committee on July 22, but the panel instead continued the matter to have more time to review a two-page 2023 air quality report it received the night before.
State may miss DCYF lease renewal deadline. Here’s why union workers are OK with that.

In the week since, Schiappa said “more has come to light.”
“We received this morning a brand new air quality report, which clearly we have not been able to decipher,” he said.
Indeed, Deputy Attorney General Adi Goldstein told Rhode Island Current after the meeting that the new five-page report was delivered only five-minutes before the panel convened.
“Lawyers enjoy the fine print ,and that’s not really enough time,” Goldstein said.
The report stated that the DCYF headquarters was “operating at safe and acceptable levels of particulate matter.”
“At this time our testing confirmed that there is no action necessary regarding Indoor Air Quality,” it stated.

Committee members still have some concerns over the state of the building, citing recent grievances filed by union workers organized under SEIU Local 580.
A recent union survey found nearly 86% of respondents did not want the building’s lease to renew when it ends on Nov. 30, 2025, due to problems with the building’s aging interior. The most commonly cited issues involved odors and poor air circulation — along with infestations by insects, mice and other rodents populating the building’s five floors..
“This is a long lease,” said committee member Nicholas Vaz, special assistant attorney general to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha. “It’s 10 years in a building, and we need to make sure that we’re taking over a building that’s safe.”
Delgado maintained that the department’s Providence headquarters is “up to snuff.”
“The building is healthy, the building is safe,” she told Vaz. “We understand that there are certain circumstances that have arised that we have addressed.”
Because the committee postponed a decision on the renewal Schiappa acknowledged that DCYF will likely not meet its deadline, but suggested the department could negotiate new terms with its landlord in the interim.
“That will have to be negotiated with the landlord at this point,” he said.
The agenda for Tuesday’s meeting lists the owners as Provident Property, LLC, headquartered in New York City. But a receptionist for the company said in a phone call that the property was no longer managed by Provident, referring Rhode Island Current to the number of BruMa Realty located in the Bronx.
A representative for BruMa did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Delgado called the committee’s postponement “unfortunate.” But Goldstein said the state has the obligation to protect its workers and can easily negotiate a new lease.
“It’s not too much to ask,” she said.
DCYF Director Ashley Deckert joined Delgado and Adam Boudreaux, the Department of Administration’s chief property manager, in appearing before the committee. Deckert only asked a question on which air quality report required additional clarification. She left before the meeting adjourned.

(Photo courtesy Bart Deming's July presentation)New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján is calling on President Donald Trump to fund the next phase of a massive water pipeline in northwest New Mexico, saying failing to do so would violate Navajo water rights and could cause the project to fail completely.
Failure to complete the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project also threatens to leave the City of Gallup with a dwindling groundwater supply, city leaders told state lawmakers recently.
Trump’s budget proposal contains no money for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project, an omission for which Luján sharply criticized a federal Interior official earlier this month. He noted that 250,000 Navajo people are relying on the project’s completion. On Tuesday, Luján’s office told Source New Mexico that the president needs to provide $175 million for the project this fiscal year to keep the project on track.
“Unfortunately, this Administration has failed to prioritize the project, and without the necessary funding, it risks becoming the first Indian Water Rights Settlement to fail. I’m doing everything in my power to ensure that does not happen,” Luján said in an emailed statement.
A multi-agency effort to divert water from the San Juan River to the Navajo Nation and areas nearby has been in the works since the 1970s; the state, Navajo Nation and federal Interior Department in 2010 finalized the Nation’s water rights settlement, a key component of which was the 300-mile pipeline.
The 2009 law that authorized the pipeline’s construction required that all components be completed by December 2024. But in September, then-Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland approved an extension of the completion deadline until December 2029, an extension the state, tribe and federal agency agreed to. 
They justified the deadline extension to allow time to investigate the feasibility of incorporating the water storage and intake features once used at the recently demolished San Juan Generating Station.  
Federal agency provides $120 million for Navajo-Gallup Water supply project

In the 15 years since the federal government authorized the pipeline, Gallup’s annual groundwater production has dropped from about 3,900 acre-feet to about 2,900 acre-feet, due to declining water levels. Over the last decade, its groundwater levels have dropped about 200 feet, requiring deeper and deeper wells, according to city and federal officials. 
On the Navajo Nation, more than 40% of households haul water to meet their daily needs. 
The funding still hangs in the balance. Bart Deming, a construction engineer with the Department of Reclamation, told state lawmakers July 17 that an estimated funding gap of roughly $600 million remains. 
Current legislation authorizes up to $1.6 billion for the project, but recent estimates suggest $2.2 billion is needed, Deming told the interim Indian Affairs Committee of the Legislature at a meeting at the Pinedale Chapter of the Navajo Nation. 
“So there’s still a challenge there,” he told lawmakers. 
The delays and costs have put Gallup city officials in a precarious position, officials told lawmakers at the meeting. The new pipeline promises a way for the city to no longer rely on 15 water wells that need to be drilled increasingly deep into the aquifer. 
So far, the city has paid more than $58 million into the project and “not received a single drop of water,” according to the city’s presentation. The original contract put the city on the hook for $57 million. Now, amid the extension and the delays, it’s facing down $10 million bills annually until the project’s completion, money that it could be using instead to maintain its wells or drill new ones. 
“The City of Gallup cannot afford to pay this amount of money and maintain its water and wastewater systems,” according to the city’s presentation. 
City Manager Frank Chiapetti told lawmakers that the city initially faces several options ranging from “best” to “unthinkable.” The “best” option entails all debt for future costs forgiven. A “livable” option is to cap the city’s share of the project’s cost at $76 million. 
But other scenarios include “nuclear,” which would mean the city would pull out of the project; “legal,” wherein the city sues for alleged breach of contract; and “unthinkable,” in which the city can’t pay for any new capital projects at least 10 years and is driven “into bankruptcy.”
A bill Luján introduced this year would, among other provisions, cap the city of Gallup’s share of the cost at $76 million.

(Screenshot from Attorney General's office livestream)Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin asked Congress on Tuesday to ban so-called abortion shield laws in states where the procedure remains legal.
In a letter co-signed by 15 other state attorneys general, Griffin said, “These laws are blatant attempts to interfere with states’ ability to enforce criminal laws within their borders and disrupt our constitutional structure.”
States where abortion remains legal have passed laws protecting abortion providers from legal consequences if they perform abortions for residents of states where abortion is banned or supply residents in those states with medications that induce abortion. Such shield laws arose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and many states, like Arkansas, passed new bans or allowed previous bans that had been dormant to go into effect.
Some of these shield laws explicitly protect abortion providers who prescribed and shipped abortion pills to women in states with bans, frustrating attempts by anti-abortion officials to prosecute the providers.
Louisiana criminally charged Dr. Margaret Carpenter of New York earlier this year for prescribing and mailing abortion pills — the first time a provider has been charged with providing abortion medication over state lines. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, however, refused to arrest or extradite Carpenter.
At a morning press conference in Little Rock, Griffin compared shield laws to sanctuary laws for those living in the U.S. illegally, saying they protect those who flout Arkansas’ outright abortion ban from being extradited to face criminal charges or to impose liability.
“You’re going to allow people to operate in your border in a way that violates our law, that specifically and openly flouts our law, but you’re going to protect them from the consequences of that,” Griffin said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Out-of-state abortion pill providers must stop advertising and sales in Arkansas, AG orders

Griffin said he believes what he is asking lawmakers to do is different from a federal abortion ban that the closely-divided Congress has seemed hesitant to tackle.
“This has more to do with a constitutional structure and states enforcing their own law. This is not about me enforcing New York’s law or vice versa,” Griffin said. “It’s about one state interfering … with the enforcement of another state’s law.”
But Griffin acknowledged that asking for action and Congressional movement on the matter were two different matters. Abortion proved to be a weak issue for the GOP in the years since Roe was overturned, as public opinion continues to favor the procedure remaining legal in all or most cases, according to the Pew Research Center. Persistent victories in favor of abortion access at the ballot box preceded some Republicans backing off from hardline rhetoric, while President Donald Trump said he would veto a federal ban on the 2024 campaign trail.
Griffin also announced Tuesday that he was sending cease-and-desist letters to two entities shipping abortion pills within the United States and to two website companies that provide website services to LifeOnEasyPills.org, a site Griffin said his office believed was based in India that ships abortion medication.
In the letters, he said website language that said abortion pills are safe “may constitute” deceptive advertising under state law, citing studies that argue that mifepristone, a drug used in medication-induced abortions, is unsafe.
If the entities don’t cease advertising abortion pills in Arkansas, Griffin said his office may bring a lawsuit against them for violating the state’s deceptive trade practices law.
Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000, and medical professionals widely consider its use in abortions safe.
Griffin would not say whether any of the websites he targeted with the cease-and-desist letters had actually mailed pills to Arkansas.
“I think I could say definitively … that these particular cease-and-desist orders relate to the messaging of the advertising,” Griffin said. “We have some other inquiries, investigations that are ongoing that aren’t related to this.”

(Screenshot from video from James Uthmeier's X account)Like every other county in Florida, the Orange County government entered into an agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) earlier this year, giving sheriffs’ deputies and corrections officers authority to serve warrants of arrest and removal for immigration violations.
However, during a recent Board of County Commissioners meeting, the board and Mayor Jerry Demings declined a request by ICE and the Florida Sheriffs Association to amend their agreement to include having county corrections officers transport undocumented immigrants to ICE-approved facilities upon request by the federal agency.
“We don’t have the capacity to do that,” Demings said, according to WESH-TV in Orlando. “And if the sheriffs want to do that, that’s up to the sheriffs. But in terms of our correctional staff, they are not law enforcement. They are there to take care of the care and custody of persons who are within our Orange County jail.”
That rejection of the ICE request means Orange County has adopted a sanctuary policy, according to Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier — a violation of state law.
“Prohibiting your corrections officers from transporting arrested aliens to ICE-approved detention facilities squarely prevents your corrections officers from cooperating with ICE and participating in federal immigration operations,” Uthmeier says in a letter sent on Tuesday to Mayor Demings and the six-member Orange County Commission.
The AG is demanding that Mayor Demings and the County Commission must “immediately” adopt the addendum presented by ICE and the Florida Sheriffs Association. Failure to take corrective action, he says, “will result in the enforcement of all applicable civil and criminal penalties, including removal from office by the Governor pursuant to section 908.107, Florida Statutes, and the Florida Constitution.”
This is not the first time that Uthmeier has threatened local government officials with the possibility of the governor removing them from office if they did not adhere to the state’s policies on immigration enforcement.
After Key West city commissioners voided their police department’s 287(g) cooperative agreement with ICE, Uthmeier threatened to seek removal of those local officials, prompting the commission to reverse its vote a week later.
Uthmeier threatened members of the Fort Myers City Council with removal earlier this year after they opposed having their police department cooperate with ICE. Like Key West officials, they promptly turned around and voted to implement a 287(g) agreement.

On that date, more than 500,000 Georgians will lose coverage due to the expiration of enhanced marketplace subsidies.
Consider a couple in Rome, Georgia. He runs an auto repair shop; she does bookkeeping. They don’t qualify for Medicaid and have no employer coverage, so they’ve relied on marketplace insurance since enhanced subsidies began. Without action, their premiums will jump by more than $1,400 a month — to over $2,000. For them, and thousands like them, it’s not about politics. It’s about whether they can afford to stay insured — or risk their health, their savings, and their livelihood by going without. Their story is about to repeat across every ZIP code.
First introduced during the pandemic and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, enhanced marketplace subsidies didn’t just lower premiums — they made health insurance attainable for hundreds of thousands who were previously ineligible or priced out.
The subsidies capped premiums at 8.5% of household income — even for those earning over 400% of the federal poverty level. They’ve helped small business owners, gig workers, early retirees, and others without employer insurance or access to Medicaid.
Nationwide, over 24 million people enrolled in marketplace coverage in 2025. In 75 congressional districts, at least 10% of residents rely on marketplace plans — including 62 in Florida, Georgia, and Texas — putting health coverage, and political control, on the line.
Beyond Georgians losing insurance, the fallout would drive up uncompensated care, destabilize state health budgets, and disrupt local economies. Hospitals already operating on thin margins, especially in rural areas, will absorb the cost of care for uninsured patients — pushing some to the brink of closure.
Most marketplace enrollees don’t know it’s coming. A recent poll found most adults had heard either “a little” (33%) or “nothing at all” (40%) about the expiring subsidies — including majorities of Democrats (64%), independents (76%), and Republicans (75%). The risk of a blindside coverage crisis is real.
Marketplace enrollees face a two-pronged increase in their premium payments come 2026. Without action, marketplace premiums will surge — first from the loss of subsidies, then from insurers anticipating a smaller, riskier pool. Peach State Health Plan and UnitedHealthcare have filed rate hikes of 20 percent and 40 percent.
Higher premiums would price many families out of coverage — especially those without major health risks — shrinking the individual market and raising the average risk level among those who remain. As the market contracts, insurers would have less incentive to compete, making the marketplaces more vulnerable if carriers exit. The result could be a damaging cycle of fewer enrollees, higher risks, reduced competition, and escalating premiums.
The Republican Study Committee’s March 2025 fiscal budget said the enhanced subsidies “only perpetuate a never-ending cycle of rising premiums and federal bailouts — with taxpayers forced to foot the bill.” But letting them expire won’t save taxpayers; it will shift the cost to families, hospitals, and state budgets.
With millions of Americans at risk — and states like Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas facing the biggest state-level losses — Republicans will face pressure to reconsider. These non-expansion states saw the biggest enrollment gains over the past four years that are now at risk of unraveling.
That urgency is showing up in the polling. A July 2025 poll by Republican pollsters Fabrizio and Ward of competitive 2026 congressional districts, found that extending the enhanced subsidies is both widely popular and politically critical. The poll shows a 15-point swing in competitive 2026 districts if the subsidies aren’t extended — putting the narrow Republican House majority, and perhaps control of the Senate, at risk.
Politics can be messy. The stakes are not. The clock is running out. Failing to act before the October recess won’t just trigger a coverage crisis — it will leave Congress and the president to answer for the consequences. 
Do nothing, and Jan.  1 becomes Georgia’s uninsured New Year.

Mississippi’s Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council was scheduled to meet Tuesday at 1 p.m. to further develop how the Legislature will allocate up to $73.3 million from companies that catalyzed the country’s overdose crisis. Unlike the council’s first meeting three weeks earlier, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office hosted the second exclusively over a Zoom video call. Public participants were not required to sign in to the meeting before joining. 
About 10 minutes into the meeting, as meeting host and Fitch special assistant Caleb Pracht asked for approval of the last gathering’s minutes, a Zoom participant noticed that Pracht’s screen was partially blacked out. As Pracht tried to fix the screen, an unidentified voice interrupted the meeting and said, “Yep, that is really good to hear because…” 
At that point, distorted music started playing, and an unidentified guest took control of the host screen. The screen featured a man in a sexually explicit pose, a swastika, a symbol for the Ku Klux Klan, a Confederate flag background, and a banner over the screen said “HACKED BY NUENZE.” Three other guest participants who signed in as “Robert Cage,” “Chelsea M Adams” and “Vince Garcia” had similar images as their icons. 
The chaos lasted about 20 seconds until the Attorney General’s office ended the meeting. Pracht tried to move the meeting over to a conference call a few minutes later, but Fitch’s Chief of Staff Michelle Williams said that meeting was also hacked. Pracht sent out an email at 1:25 p.m. that the meeting would be rescheduled as soon as possible. 
“We truly apologize, and our IT folks are looking into it immediately to address the issue and ensure it can never happen again,” Pracht wrote in an email to meeting attendees. 
In a call with Mississippi Today, Williams confirmed someone had hacked the Zoom meeting, an incident she said was unlike anything the Attorney General’s Office had ever experienced before. She said she hadn’t examined the details of the graphic images enough to comment on them, but Fitch’s Cyber Crime Division would be investigating the incident. 
“Somebody who clearly doesn’t care what happens to people who have been afflicted by the opioid epidemic just completely kept the committee from doing its work,” she said. 
The Mississippi Legislature has tasked the council with creating a process for groups interested in addressing Mississippi’s overdose crisis to apply for some of the state’s opioid settlement dollars. 
The council was set to review materials for this application process, including a newly drafted scoring rubric for applications and proposed committee assignments for reviewing grants, according to the Tuesday meeting’s agenda. Multiple committee members expressed concern that there was no grading rubric or definition of a qualified applicant in the material proposed at the last meeting.
The council is following a tight schedule to finish reviewing opioid settlement applications by Dec. 1, a deadline prescribed by the Legislature. Meeting that deadline already seemed in jeopardy at the early July meeting, when Pracht delayed the launch of the application by a few weeks. 
Williams said Fitch’s office continues to be focused on meeting the Legislature’s deadline. But Tuesday’s cyberattack will make it more difficult to adhere to a tight timeline. 
“Whoever just did this today just shortened it.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina lawmakers began voting to override Gov. Josh Stein’s vetoes on Tuesday, forcing into law several contentious measures after a handful of House Democrats defected to vote with the Republican majority.
Most votes in the Senate came with little suspense, as Republicans hold a veto-proof majority.
But in the House, GOP leaders had no votes to spare. One seat short of a supermajority, they joined with several key Democrats to override the governor’s veto on an array of bills: cracking down on immigration enforcement, restricting changes to birth certificates for transgender people, allowing concealed weapons in private schools and repealing an emissions goal for Duke Energy.
The overrides were not secured without some scrambling. One of the Senate overrides failed briefly, before Sen. Bill Rabon (R-Brunswick, Columbus and New Hanover) changed his vote on the bill on concealed weapons in private schools.
And in the House, as key Democrats cast their deciding votes and broke with their party, one rose to defend their vote on an immigration bill in a fiery speech. Another, who provided the deciding vote on the bill decried as a GOP “culture war” proposal by other Democratic members, said he had “moral issues” with the legislation.
“I think they’ve got a handful of members on the Democratic side of the House who just recognize that they’re up here to serve their constituents,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters Tuesday after the votes. “And they recognize particularly that sometimes means compromise on issues.”
Several controversial measures did not receive override votes in the House on Tuesday, including the a measure to allow anyone 18 and older to carry a concealed gun without a permit, and bans on diversity, equity and inclusion. Lawmakers are set to return tomorrow, but it could also be months before the House calls up those bills for votes.
“We have a year-and-a-half left in this,” Hall said. “And we’re obviously going to be back here, whether that’s sometime this year or whether it’s in the short session next year.”



Democrats’ decisions to vote with GOP: Curbing immigration and ‘moral issues’
Republicans needed just one Democratic vote to secure an override. On all of Tuesday’s votes, they got that — and sometimes more.
Among the most consistent defectors was Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg). During debate on an immigration bill to require sheriffs to comply with ICE detainer requests, she rose to defend her vote. She believes that those who immigrate “must assimilate” in the United States, she said, and “adapt to the culture they wish to live in.”
She said she had been “called racist” for her vote, but said she would not be silent in the face of those “who disagree with my ideology” on the issue of immigration.
“We have been naïve,” Cunningham continued. “We have been exploited and abused by the different tactics to gain citizenship in America. It’s time to wake up.”

Her remarks spurred a rare interruption from a member of her own party, when Reb. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) called a motion to end debate and move to a vote. Cunningham finished her speech shortly after.
“So today, if you ask me to line up behind another group of people to raise awareness about their plight, I will unapologetically say ‘no,'” Cunningham said.
Rep. Shelly Willingham (D-Edgecombe) also signed off on several overrides. He voted for an expansion of the state auditor’s powers and to allow private school employees to carry concealed weapons. And he joined Cunningham in support of bills that repeal a Duke Energy emissions goal and ban agencies from collecting donor info from nonprofits – a measure opposed by pro-democracy groups.
But the swing vote on one of the most contentious votes Tuesday was another Democrat: Rep. Nasif Majeed (D-Mecklenburg). He was the sole Democrat to vote in favor of a bill that, among other things, would codify definitions of male and female in state law, allow parents to restrict their students’ library book access, and restrict changes to birth certificates for transgender people.
“I had some moral issues with that,” Majeed told reporters after the vote. “And I had to lean on my values.”
Democratic opposition, protesters
Still, almost all other Democrats remained opposed to the bills Tuesday — with a number of them who previously voted in favor of the measures flipping to “no” votes on Tuesday.
That included seven who voted against changing the oversight structure of charter schools, and eight who voted against the Duke Energy bill.
“Our planet is on fire,” Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) said, urging colleagues to hold utilities accountable for carbon emissions.
And Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg) decried the override vote on the bill dealing with gender and libraries — saying it was “overtly manipulative.” The bill began as one designed to protect women and children from online exploitation before being rewritten in the Senate.
The voting session, which had been anticipated for weeks, drew protesters to Jones Street. At times, some protesters loudly coughed during lawmakers’ remarks, being sharply rebuked by Hall. And after one vote, several left the gallery shouting that those who supported the bill should be ashamed.

Vetoes on DEI bills overridden in Senate, but not yet in House
The Senate cancelled Stein vetoes on bills banning diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education and public education. The House did not take override votes on those bills, nor did it try to override a veto banning DEI in state agencies.
Senate Democrats denounced the bills, which they said would whitewash history and limit students’ exposure to challenging ideas.
“This bill assumes that white people are so weak that we need to be protected,” said Sen. Michael Garrett (D-Cumberland), who is white. 
The bill assumes “young people will be indoctrinated or somehow broken by divisive ideas,” he said.
Republicans nationally have decried DEI policies, arguing they interfere with meritocratic hiring and training, and have aimed to repeal them.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2835-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 18:00:31.622359
,DC,2025-07-29 19:40:11+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,‘Devastating’ spending cuts: Advocates decry Trump tax law's harm to Latino communities,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/devastating-spending-cuts-advocates-decry-trump-tax-laws-harm-latino-communities,,"WASHINGTON — The massive tax and spending cuts package signed into law by President Donald Trump earlier this month will affect not only Latinos using federal safety net programs but also those living in communities vulnerable to environmental pollution, Democrats and advocates said during a Tuesday virtual press conference.The president’s domestic policy agenda bill that congressional Republicans passed without Democrats’ approval, through a process known as reconciliation, made permanent the 2017 tax cuts and provided billions of dollars for immigration enforcement by cutting funds for clean energy, environmental justice grants, food assistance and Medicaid, a health care insurance program for low-income people.The bill will add $3.394 trillion to deficits during the next decade and lead 10 million people to lose access to health insurance, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Adriano Espaillat, Democrat of New York, said the bill passed through reconciliation reduces spending on “Medicaid dramatically and (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) dramatically.”He said Democrats in their messaging should focus on the changes coming for Medicaid and how the cuts will impact people across the United States. Republicans’ numerous changes to health programs, predominantly Medicaid, will reduce federal spending during the next decade by $1.058 trillion.“It's really a conversation about life and death, because if you're on Medicaid and now they're cutting your benefits, the treatment that you receive to save your life could be in jeopardy,” Espaillat said. Rural hospitals and LatinosRep. Raul Ruiz, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said the cuts to Medicaid are ""devastating,"" especially to hospitals in rural communities.“First, what hospitals will do is they will close services that aren't the money-making services for a hospital, like pediatrics, labor delivery and mental health, and then beyond that, they'll eventually just close their hospital,” said the California Democrat, a former emergency room doctor.“This is devastating because usually these rural hospitals serve a high Latino population, medically underserved, resource-poor areas,” Ruiz said. “If you have a medical emergency and you don't have a local emergency department or hospital to go to, chances of your survivability during an emergency greatly drops.”Antonieta Cádiz, the executive director of Climate Power En Acción, said that most of those effects, such as new reporting requirements for Medicaid patients that could result in people losing coverage, won’t be felt until after the midterm elections in 2026, when those changes go into effect.Climate Power En Acción is an arm of the clean energy advocacy group Climate Power that focuses on reaching out to Latinos about the impacts of climate change.$170 billion for immigration crackdownVanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the immigration advocacy group America’s Voice, said the bill will also affect Latino communities because of its more than $170 billion increase for immigration enforcement.She said Democrats should lean into immigration policy and push back against the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown and plans for mass deportations.“Democrats need to take this opportunity and need to be able to bring people in to share in their vision of what a functional immigration system is,” she said. “It is very frustrating that we are not seeing again, more Democrats really leaning in on this issue.”Espaillat acknowledged that Democrats’ communication strategy on immigration “has been one of our weaknesses.”“We at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have done a good job at first, exposing the inequities and irregularities and discriminatory practices of immigration to the degree that now we're seeing,” he said.“In addition to that, I think it's important that we message on Medicaid …  SNAP, and then, of course, environmental justice is one that's also a real path for which we are working on having a very structured and disciplined message,” Espaillat continued.Higher energy billsCádiz said the bill Republicans passed will lead to a loss of clean energy jobs and it also lessens incentives for energy efficient appliances, which will lead to higher energy bills for Latinos. Compared to the average U.S. family, Latino households pay roughly 20% more in energy costs, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.“It guts clean energy programs crucial for savings amid rising heat and energy demand, leaving us with higher bills,” she said of the bill. “This is a direct attack on Latino families, workers and every person struggling with rising costs to meet essential needs.”She added that environmental justice grants totaling $300 million were eliminated, while roughly 15 million Latinos live in communities with high levels of air pollution.Espaillat said that the cuts to clean energy programs provided by the Biden administration’s massive climate and clean energy bill, which also passed through the process of reconciliation but under Democratic control, benefited local communities.“Now there's going to be a major disinvestment for these programs,” he said.",,,,2025-07-29 18:00:31.622359

The lawsuit also claims federal forest officials have intentionally created two adjacent logging projects that would have likely violated federal laws if combined, and instead split them up into two smaller projects to avoid scrutiny.
The United States Forest Service told the Daily Montanan it does not comment on pending litigation.
The quartet of groups — Native Ecosystems Council, Council on Wildlife and Fish, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, and the Yellowstone to Uintas Connection — filed the complaint on Monday in Missoula.
The lawsuit claims that the Cyclone Bill Logging Project, which is approximately 13 miles west of Whitefish, will cut and burn on more than 12,000 acres, which includes habitat of the Canada lynx and grizzly bears, both of which are protected by the Endangered Species Act.
The groups said that the forest service’s decision, finding that the project posed no significant impact, ignored the best available science as well as the opinions of biologists working for the federal government via the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
For example, the lawsuit alleges the project would reduce grizzly habitat temporarily, add roads that would permanently impact them, and the adjacent logging project, the Round Star Project, would permanently eliminate grizzly bear habitat by 774 acres.
The conservation groups point out that the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem, which is designated as a grizzly bear recovery zone is just 35 miles away from the project, and the forest area is essential for bears as they begin to repopulate, and necessary for more diverse genetics. Groups contend that the Cyclone Bill Project area is an “essential linkage corridor for female bears.”
  The road-less traveled 

The lawsuit also centers on the number of new and permanent roads that would be built by the logging projects. Multiple lawsuits have been successfully waged against the Forest Service because it expands the number of permanent and temporary roads in national forest land.
Scientific studies continue to point to roads as being one of the largest deterrent for grizzly bears and habitat. According to the lawsuit and the Forest Service’s own documentation, the project would add 11.4 miles of new roads and 2.5 miles of temporary roads. The conservation groups note that this would push the road density in the area above the scientific threshold for grizzly bear tolerance.
The federal government’s own scientists agree the area is already being disturbed, and the logging project will likely further disrupt grizzly bear habitat.
“Fish and Wildlife Service opines that grizzly bears using the action area may already be experiencing disturbance effects in some areas … as a result of construction and administrative use of closed roads,” it said. “The project may result in additional under-use of suitable habitat by individual female grizzly bears, potentially disrupting normal breeding (or more specifically, cub rearing) or feeding patterns in the short-term.”
The suit lists multiple scientific studies which point out repeatedly that grizzly bears, especially females, learn to avoid areas where there are motorized vehicles.
Scientists also point out that the cumulative effects of the logging project will like reduce the “natural food sources and (increase) grizzly bear mortality risk.”
  Old-growth forest concerns 

The lawsuit also challenges the Forest Service because the Cyclone Bill project would target old-growth forests. The Forest Service’s own data shows that 5,900 acres of National Forest land within the project area qualify as old-growth.
The lawsuit contends that logging some of the old-growth areas contradicts the Flathead National Forest’s plan which states, “Promoting the develop of future old-growth forest is also a key strategy (of) the forest and in the forest plan’s management direction as a means of addressing future uncertainties related to climate change and its effects of disturbances and old-growth forests.”
The lawsuit said that many bird species, including flammulated owls, northern goshawks and black-backed woodpeckers rely upon the old-growth forests in Montana.
“The project environmental analysis does not consider, explain, or otherwise analyze, which, if any, old-growth dependent wildlife species could survive in such heavily logged conditions created by the Cyclone Bill Project,” the court documents said.
  Side-stepping scrutiny? 

The lawsuit also said the Forest Service appears to be sidestepping scrutiny by proposing the Cyclone Bill and the Round Star projects as separate, individual projects, rather as a whole project. The conservation groups say that the Forest Service is likely doing this to hide the details of the project which may be more obvious if the two projects were combined.
“Cyclone Bill and Round Star are two adjacent project that were developed in tandem, located side-by-side, and authorized less than a year apart,” the court documents said. “The Forest Service refused to analyze these two similar and adjoining projects together, and instead issued findings of no significant impact for both projects without considering the cumulative impacts from both projects together.”
Attorneys Oliver Wood and Alizabeth Bronsdon said that the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, of which Montana is a part, has repeatedly ruled projects closely related in terms of time and location must be analyzed together.
“The National Environmental Policy Act does not allow an approach that would permit dividing a project into multiple ‘actions,’ each of which individually has an insignificant environmental impact, but which collectively have a substantial impact,” the appeals court said in a 2002 ruling.
The groups are asking federal magistrate Kathleen DeSoto to declare that the logging project violates the law, vacate the Forest Service’s finding of “No Significant Impact” and send the plans back to the Forest Service for modification until it complies with the law.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/40558359643_0cb4e43ecc_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 18:00:31.622359

In addition to the Palmetto State imagery, the new design released Tuesday will contain more than 40 advanced security features, according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles. Residents with licenses won’t need to get an updated card until their existing one expires.

“These new licenses and ID cards showcase the Palmetto State while providing citizens with greater protection against becoming victims of identity fraud,” DMV Director Kevin Shwedo said in a statement. “We hope that South Carolinians will look on these new designs with pride and confidence.”
The official designations for the imagery on the cards date to 1924, when the Legislature made the yellow jessamine the state flower. Fifteen years later, the South Carolina palmetto — or, technically, the sabal palmetto — became the state tree. The Carolina wren has been the state bird since 1948.
The loggerhead sea turtle, featured on the back of licenses issued to drivers under 21, is the most recent symbol in the design. It became the state reptile in 1988.
The new licenses, beginner’s permits and identification cards are made of stronger material that won’t peel apart. Use of laser engraving and multicolor printing makes them more difficult to counterfeit, said agency spokesman Mike Fitts.
The state will continue to print vertical cards for drivers under the age of 21, as has been practice in the state since 2010. For teens and young adults, their licenses will give the dates when they turn 18 and 21 years old.

Unlike the current system, in which a person visiting a DMV office can get with a license or ID before walking out the door, the cards will be made at secure production facilities and sent out in the mail within seven to 15 business days. This method is already used in 45 other states, according to the DMV.
Residents will be sent home with temporary certificates, valid for up to 30 days, as they wait for their permanent ID to arrive. To help ensure the cards reach the appropriate destination, the DMV will require customers to verify their addresses when they apply. And the temporary certificate will include a QR code that can be used to track the processing of a license or ID card, Fitts previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
The new cards and process for will begin in late August, starting at two Midlands locations: Shop Road in Columbia and Lexington’s Park Road branch. A statewide rollout to the other 63 locations is expected later in the fall, according to the agency.
Residents are urged not to wait until their licenses expiration date to renew them, to allow time for mail delivery. The DMV sends renewal notices by mail 90 days prior to expiration of a customer’s current card.
License fees will remain the same: An eight-year license is $25. And IDs for people 17 and older are still free.

The Florida Department of Corrections has not commented publicly about the incident since it occurred last week.
That data breach has frightened and infuriated some of the women who had their names, email addresses, and telephone numbers released to those incarcerated at the prison located near the Florida Everglades.
Inmates received that information via an email sent out by a staff member of the facility on Thursday. Florida inmates have access to emails through both interactive kiosks as well as secure tablets.
“It’s kind of disturbing when you think about it,” said Madeline Donate, who regularly visits her husband at the prison. “The privacy aspect of this is concerning. This is how other inmates get information and can sometimes extort family members and things like that. It’s concerning.”
Jan Thompson said she fears extortion.
“What if there’s some inmate that doesn’t like another inmate?” she said. “And he tells his family, ‘Okay, here’s his wife’s phone number. Call her and tell her if she doesn’t pay and put $500 on my book, I’m going to have her husband stabbed and killed.’ What’s stopping them from doing that?”
(Inmates can receive funds for deposit into their “inmate trust accounts” from individuals already identified on the inmate’s automated visiting record).
“I’m very worried. This is not okay,” added a woman who wanted to be identified only as Dakota, her middle name. “Someone needs to be held accountable for this. They need to take the necessary precautions to ensure that this does not happen. And what about this information that’s out there? There’s what, 1,600 [inmates] there? They all have information. God knows what they could do with it.”
Visit protocol
Individuals who intend to visit an inmate in one of Florida’s prisons must fill out an application form every time they intend to make such a visit — a policy introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Previously, once an individual was approved by the FDC, they could just show up during visitation hours.
Visitors who spoke to the Phoenix said that policy made sense during the pandemic, as the department needed to control the number of visitors consistent with social distancing protocols. However, those protocols have long since been discarded.
Patrice Kelley was furious when her incarcerated husband informed her Friday that her personal contact information had been released to every other inmate at ECI. Kelley had removed most of her digital footprint from the internet after having a problem with a stalker in her immediate past. “Unfortunately, people in Florida that are at that institution now have my information,” she said.
“I don’t live in Florida anymore, so that’s a good thing,” she said, adding that “it only takes somebody saying, ‘This is where this person lives.'”
Individuals who had their personal contact information exposed were unhappy that, as of Monday morning, no one from the Florida Department of Corrections had acknowledged the data breach to them personally.
“They have yet to notify me that my personal information has been exposed to 1,600 inmates. That is unbelievable,” Thompson said, adding that she doubted that would be the situation had the contact information of staff members inadvertently been sent to prisoners.
Denise Rock, executive director of the prisoner advocacy group Florida Cares, said her organization’s main concern is not with the institution but the visitation process, which she said is duplicative and led to the data breach.
“We urge the department to discontinue requiring already-approved visitors to register and release their private information each time they do so,” she said in a text message.
“When the Florida Department of Corrections put the sign-up process in place permanently, we had many concerns. The limitations and restrictions it placed on the families were burdensome, but this breach of privacy leads to safety concerns for the families — further highlighting why this practice should be discontinued immediately. If it happened this time, which is one too many times, it can surely happen again.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Great Salt Lake is slipping back into dangerously low levels, fueled by water consumption and drought conditions impacting much of the state.



This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.


Levels on Tuesday hovered around 4,192 feet in elevation, with the north arm at roughly 4,191.5 feet. Great Salt Lake Commissioner Brian Steed said lake levels are like layers on a cake, with the top layer, or highest water levels, typically resulting in a healthy lake — 4,192 feet, Steed said, is nearing the bottom of the cake, putting the lake in the “really bad” range. 
“We’re sitting about where we were when we were trending into those lowest levels we’ve ever seen,” said Steed, referring to fall 2022 when the lake bottomed out at 4,188.5 feet. He described the current conditions as “scary low.” 
Most of the state is now in severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which means the air quality is worsened by dust, cattle have inadequate water and pasture, while streams and ponds are drying out. Some of the high elevation areas in the central part of the state are in moderate drought. 
Steed doesn’t have a crystal ball, and according to the four-week weather outlook from the National Weather Service, there’s an equal chance Utah could get above, or below, normal precipitation. So, if temperatures drop and northern Utah sees more monsoon precipitation, that could help lake levels. 
But regardless, the Great Salt Lake will continue to drop, with its seasonal low typically some time between September and November. 
“That’s what makes us extraordinarily nervous,” Steed said. “This drought is the real deal. And honestly, if we don’t get it right, if we continue to over-use, we’re going to have real human consequences.”  
Those consequences mean an exposed lakebed, which contributes to poor air quality as storms whip up toxic, heavy metal-laden dust that blankets the Wasatch Front, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. 
Severe drought causing Utah reservoir levels to drop at ‘concerning’ rate

Declining levels can also expose microbialites, organic deposits that are a cornerstone of the lake’s ecosystem. Microbialites are essential for brine fly populations, the main food source for millions of migratory birds that stop on the lake. If the microbialites are exposed for long periods of time, it can trigger a chain reaction ultimately impacting the entire ecosystem. 
Less water in the lake also contributes to an increase in salinity levels, which can harm the brine shrimp population — that can also have devastating impacts on the ecosystem, while hurting the million-dollar brine shrimp fishing industry. 
The current levels mean mineral companies that operate on the lake will now be required to use less water. Junior water rights holders in the Great Salt Lake basin will also see less water this year. 
If levels drop below 4,190 feet, the state will close off the causeway that divides the north and south arms to keep salinity levels lower on the south arm. Steed thinks it’s unlikely lake levels will get that low this year.

(Photo by Greg Skidmore)The Department of Justice in a new court filing argues that acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba was properly appointed because the administration fired the deputy selected by judges to replace Habba before their order could go into effect.
The administration’s Tuesday filing is the latest step in the Trump administration’s attempt to keep in place a controversial prosecutorial nominee who faces statutory barriers to remaining in office and whose nomination has yet to win approval by the Senate Judiciary Committee, let alone by the full chamber.
The filing comes five days after Habba, facing a statutory deadline, resigned as U.S. attorney and was named first assistant U.S. attorney, a Trump administration maneuver to keep her in the post. The administration says that because the U.S. attorney post was vacant, Habba immediately assumed the role.
“Ms. Habba is validly serving as the Acting United States Attorney. The Attorney General properly appointed her as the First Assistant United States Attorney; the First Assistant can serve as the Acting United States Attorney under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act when that office is vacant,” Department of Justice attorneys wrote.
Habba’s reappointment is the focus of a claim by an Irvington man facing drug and gun charges. The man, Julien Giraud, on Sunday asked the court to bar his prosecution, arguing that her reappointment violates federal statutes and allowing her to supervise his case would infringe on his due process rights.

Habba’s road to becoming New Jersey’s acting U.S. attorney was winding.
She was originally installed as interim U.S. Attorney on March 28, starting a 120-day clock that ended July 26. Trump nominated her for U.S. Senate confirmation on June 30.
Her tenure has included a rebuke from a federal judge over swiftly dropped criminal charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, that spurred a malicious prosecution lawsuit filed by Baraka. She also faced criticism for telling a right-wing podcast host that she would use her office to “turn New Jersey red.”
New Jersey’s District Court judges met last Tuesday to select her successor — as called for by federal law — and chose her deputy, Desiree Grace, instead of Habba. The administration then launched a game of musical chairs.
Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Grace, and Trump withdrew Habba’s nomination from Senate consideration. Habba resigned as U.S. attorney, and Bondi immediately named her a special attorney and authorized her to “conduct in the District of New Jersey any kind of legal proceedings, civil or criminal.”
At the same time, Bondi designated her as the district’s first assistant U.S. attorney, triggering a separate law that elevates top deputies to lead the office in an acting capacity for up to 210 days, with the chance of longer tenures.
Giraud’s argument — which is being heard in Pennsylvania to avoid any conflict with the New Jersey judges who chose to replace Habba — poses two major challenges for the administration.
One appointment statute bars first assistants from being elevated to acting heads if they did not hold the first assistant position for at least 90 days in the year preceding the creation of a vacancy. Habba first held the position on July 24, more than 200 days after Philip Sellinger, the state’s last Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney, resigned. The administration’s Tuesday filing does not address that argument other than to say “Habba did not previously serve as the first assistant.”
The other barrier is Habba’s former status as a U.S. attorney nominee. The same statute bars individuals from being elevated if “the President submits a nomination of such person to the Senate for appointment to such office.” Government attorneys argue that no longer applies to Habba because her nomination was withdrawn. The statute does not say the prohibition ends.
“A lifetime ban of that sort would have no logical relationship to the distinct separation-of-powers problem that Congress sought to address in [the statute],” the administration argued.
Giraud’s filing challenging Habba’s appointment has already disrupted criminal prosecutions in New Jersey. More discord could be on the horizon.
Unlike rank-and-file prosecutors and others employed in U.S. attorney offices, assistant U.S. attorneys — including first assistants — are legally direct subordinates of the U.S. attorney general. In other words, though a U.S. attorney may supervise them day-to-day, their prosecutorial power flows from the attorney general.
That means the office could be allowed to continue operations under the supervision of assistant U.S. attorneys even if the court finds Habba’s reappointment was improper.
The administration argues supervision would still fall to Habba in that case because Bondi appointed Habba as a special attorney and delegated to her the authority to supervise all pending prosecutions in the District of New Jersey.
“Regardless of whether Ms. Habba technically qualifies as Acting United States Attorney, she could supervise this case pursuant to her direct delegation of authority from the Attorney General,” government lawyers argued in Tuesday’s filing.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Darrin Dressler video)TOPEKA — Kansas lawmakers killed diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices in all forms of state government, including universities, after slipping a provision into the state budget.
Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline to abide by the provision, Kansas Secretary of Administration Adam Proffitt confirmed Tuesday that all state agencies, universities and contracts have eliminated positions, mandates, programs, activities, training requirements, grants and contracts related to DEI.
The Kansas Department of Administration examined around 20,000 job titles across all state agencies, searching for key terms including diversity, equity, inclusion and DEI, Proffitt said at a meeting of the State Finance Council, which included Gov. Laura Kelly and legislative leaders.
He said he is confident those positions don’t exist. If they did, the people in those positions were reassigned, he said. The department also scoured state training requirements and contracts to ensure DEI was not part of them.
“Now, I want to be crystal clear,” Proffitt said. “That’s not to say that some entities that we contract with don’t also provide DEI services, but the intent of this proviso was to ensure that those weren’t required within contracts with the state of Kansas.”
Proffitt coordinated with Blake Flanders, president of the Kansas Board of Regents, to implement the provisions, including a statewide email signature policy requiring employees to remove “gender identifying pronouns or gender ideology from email signature blocks on state employees’ email accounts and any other form of communication.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, requested that Proffitt investigate Kansas State University’s diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging committee to ensure compliance with the provision. The results of that investigation are expected at the council’s next meeting.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-27-092744.png,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)Only a dozen states have laws establishing suicide prevention offices or coordinators, and just 11 have task forces or committees dedicated to suicide prevention efforts, according to a new report.
Pennsylvania does not have either one.
The report comes amid sweeping cuts at federal agencies that offer mental health support. They include significant slashes in staffing and funding at the nation’s largest mental health and substance use agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants to fold SAMHSA into his new Administration for a Healthy America.
Released last week, the report was conducted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials with support from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The analysis is part of an online resource breaking down details of suicide prevention efforts at the state level.

As of Jan. 1, just a dozen states had offices or state coordinators focused on suicide prevention: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Some states have these offices mandated by law and others were established through executive orders.
Eleven states (Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah and Washington) plus Puerto Rico have laws requiring a task force, commission or advisory group focused on suicide prevention.
The report notes prevention efforts are most effective when they are focused on higher-risk populations, areas, age groups and occupations. Suicide risk is higher among rural residents, older adults, American Indian and Alaska Native people, people with disabilities, veterans and groups that identify with a sexual minority. The federal administration recently pulled the plug on LGBTQ+ specialized supports under the national suicide hotline, 988.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

About 60% of states — 29 states and Washington, D.C. — have laws that establish some form of fatality review committees that specifically include suicide deaths in reviews. Areas of focus varied among the states. Some had statewide teams and others were on the local level, according to the report.
The report notes that another 11 states assign prevention responsibilities within other offices. Minnesota law, for example, assigns such tasks to the state commissioner of health, rather than toward a special suicide prevention office or coordinator.
In 2023, the nation saw 49,000 deaths by suicide, according to the CDC. Firearms are involved in more than half of suicides.

On Monday morning, a 17-year-old male suffered what Yellowstone National Park officials say are “significant thermal burns” to his foot and ankle area in the vicinity of Lone Star Geyser near Old Faithful.
The man was hiking in the thermal area when his foot broke through the thin crust, and he suffered burns, according to a news release from the park. Emergency medical staff responded and transported the patient to a hospital for further treatment. This incident is under investigation.
It marks the first known “thermal injury” in the park in 2025. The last reported incident occurred in September 2024.
Lone Star Geyser is one of the most famous and regularly erupting geysers in the park, according to T. Scott Bryan’s “The Geysers of Yellowstone.” It erupts approximately every three hours.
It is also one of the most recognizable geysers because of its unique cone, which is more than 9 feet tall.
According to Bryan, the geyser becomes active every 60 to 90 minutes after an eruption, making splashing and gurgling sounds, followed usually by a minor eruption, a major eruption, then often a series of smaller eruptions, before becoming seemingly dormant and then repeating the cycle. The eruptions last about five minutes, and the geyser can spray water as high as 45 feet into the air. The eruption and steam can often be heard as far as a mile away.
 Staying safe around thermal areas

Park officials remind visitors to stay safe around thermal areas, which include pools, mud pots, geysers and vents.
Those instructions include staying on boardwalks and trails. Staying on them is a protection for both visitors and the delicate thermal formations. Water in hot springs can cause severe or fatal burns, and scalding water underlies most of the thin, breakable crust around hot springs.

Always walk on boardwalks and designated trails. Keep children close and do not let them run on boardwalks.
Do not touch thermal features or runoff.
Swimming or soaking in hot springs is prohibited. More than 20 people have died from burns suffered after they entered or fell into Yellowstone’s hot springs.
Pets are prohibited in thermal areas.
Do not throw objects into hot springs or other hydrothermal features.
Toxic gases may accumulate to dangerous levels in some hydrothermal areas. If you begin to feel sick while exploring one of our geyser basins, leave the area immediately.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey has joined 21 other states and the District of Columbia in a federal lawsuit challenging part of Republicans’ tax cut and spending law that blocks funding to Maine’s reproductive health care providers. 
A provision in the budget reconciliation law bars Medicaid reimbursements for services provided at family planning health centers such as Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning. Both organizations have separately filed lawsuits against the Trump administration, alleging that the loss of Medicaid reimbursements would be catastrophic for their organizations which are already under financial strain.
Maine Family Planning would lose about $1.9 million in annual funding if barred from collecting Medicaid reimbursements for non-abortion services — Medicaid already can’t be used for abortion services due to a separate federal law – and Planned Parenthood clinics in Maine would lose about $1 million in Medicaid reimbursements, both organizations have previously said.
Federal judge issues new order protecting all Planned Parenthood clinics from Medicaid ‘defunding’

On Monday, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood, expanding a previous block on the provision that protected some providers. That means that patients can continue using Medicaid at Planned Parenthood health centers throughout the country and that those health centers can be reimbursed for the services they provide those patients.
In a statement Tuesday, Nicole Clegg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said the organization applauds Frey for joining the suit. “We are grateful to champions like Attorney General Frey who is fighting for Mainers’ ability to decide where to access the essential health care they need, when they need it,” she said.
The lawsuit Frey joined on Tuesday makes many of the same points, aiming to block implementation of the so-called “defund provision,” arguing that it will cut off low-income Americans from critical health services including cancer screenings, birth control and primary care.
“With rural hospitals under constant threat, there are many rural and low-income Mainers without access to health care providers. Without Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning, these patients in Maine will simply have nowhere to turn for routine healthcare,” he said in a statement. 
Nationally, the provision could affect at least 200 health centers and more than 1.1 million patients, according to the complaint. The other states involved in the suit are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

Article Summary

The caseworker in the death of an Illinois foster child had orders of protection filed against her by eight women for allegedly harassing, abusing and threatening violence against them.
The caseworker, who was employed by Lutheran Child and Family Services, is now employed by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.
The foster child, Mackenzi Felmlee, 18, was subjected to cruelty before her death in May 2024, according to search warrants released in the case.
DCFS still refuses to release a report regarding Felmlee’s treatment.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The caseworker assigned to monitor Illinois foster child Mackenzi Felmlee — who died in May 2024 — had a troubling past, including an arrest for a violent crime and orders of protection filed against her by eight women for alleged threats, harassment and abuse, court documents show.
Kurtavia White, a former Lutheran Child and Family Services caseworker, was arrested a decade before Mackenzi’s death for her involvement in a Metro East strip club brawl that left the victim, a dancer at the club, with eight staples in her head, court records show. She also was accused of retaliating against the woman by posting nude photos of her on social media.
Mackenzi, 18, died May 11, 2024, after being found unconscious and struggling to breathe at the bottom of the stairs in her Fairview Heights, Illinois, foster home. A search warrant application signed by a Fairview Heights police detective in the investigation of Mackenzi’s death also alleges that White failed to properly document home visits with the teen.
“It was discovered through the records that case worker Kurtavia White was copying and pasting notes for home visits, which does not appear to have correctly documented the visits,” an affidavit read that was signed June 23, 2024, prior to the arrest of Mackenzi’s foster mother, Shemeka Williams, and Williams’ mother, Cornelia Reid.
Williams and Reid were indicted on charges of first-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated domestic battery, intimidation, unlawful restraint and domestic battery in connection with Mackenzi’s death.

White has not been charged or arrested in relation to Mackenzi’s death and could not be reached for comment.
By late last year, following Mackenzi’s death, White had a new job: The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services hired her as a child welfare specialist with an annual salary of $75,000, state comptroller records show.
Lutheran Child and Family Services, which is a contractor of DCFS, declined to provide comment for this story. DCFS could not provide immediate comment.
A troubling past
For more than a decade before Mackenzi’s death, multiple women accused White of threatening them, bullying them online, and filing false reports with police and child services. One woman alleged that a false report filed by White led to her child — who suffered from sickle cell anemia — being removed from her custody. “He suffered and was very traumatized behind this,” she stated in a 2019 order of protection petition.
In 2020, White was charged with violating an order of protection by attempting to initiate a fight with the same woman. The case was later dropped after a series of court continuances.
White was the subject of 11 requests for orders of protection by eight women in St. Clair and Madison counties in southern Illinois. In one 2015 case, a woman working as a dancer claimed White attacked her at the Metro East strip club Bottoms Up, leading to White being charged with three felonies. The woman alleged in court documents in her order of protection case that White later pleaded guilty to two felonies and received probation.
Although no court record exists, a Belleville News-Democrat police blotter dated Dec. 22, 2015, reported on White’s arrest. Illinois law allows certain convictions to be sealed or expunged under specific conditions.

As recently as Oct. 23, 2024 — five months after Mackenzi’s death — another woman sought an order of protection, alleging White encouraged her sister to throw a brick at the woman’s car. Following a court hearing, she claimed White and her sister threatened her in the courthouse hallway, the woman alleged in court documents.
White later filed for an order of protection herself, claiming the woman had threatened her and caused concern at her DCFS workplace.
“They became worried and started having security escort me out of the building due to continuous threats,” White wrote in her petition.
While DCFS requires background checks for its employees, it’s unclear what the agency reviewed prior to hiring White. However, in a July 2023 letter, the DCFS Office of the Inspector General requested records on six orders of protection cases involving White, stating the agency was “attempting to determine if Ms. Kurtavia White is a risk to children.”
New details emerge
While DCFS has yet to issue a report on Mackenzi’s death, despite a state law requiring it to do so, seven search warrant applications were released to Capitol News Illinois last week detailing a year-long investigation by Fairview Heights Police.
Police Chief Steve Johnson said he could not comment on specifics, citing the ongoing investigation, but offered: “Bringing justice for this little girl is paramount. We will not stop until all those accountable are brought before a court.”
The search warrants revealed disturbing new information about the morning Mackenzi was found unconscious and not breathing at the bottom of a staircase at her foster home around 2:30 a.m. on May 11. When officers arrived, they observed visible bruises and abrasions on her body.
Her foster mother, Shemeka Williams, claimed she found Mackenzi unresponsive in bed and tried, with Reid’s help, to carry her downstairs to take her to the hospital. Williams told police Mackenzi threw herself down the stairs. However, police later uncovered two disturbing videos taken on Williams’ phone before the 911 call showing Mackenzi moaning in pain at the bottom of the stairs and appearing unable to move.

In one video that police said was recorded by Williams’ 15-year-old biological daughter, Williams can be seen mocking Mackenzi, suggesting she was pretending to be injured. Williams pulls Mackenzi upright by her shirt, only for her to slump back down. Blood is visible on the tile floor. The video ends with Williams laughing and saying, “It was hurting them damn legs.”
Police said another video recorded about 30 minutes before police arrived shows Mackenzi lying on her right side with her mouth wrapped around the metal railing of the steps.
“Mackenzi appears to be biting the metal railing while she is moaning,” Fairview Heights Detective Hannah Millington wrote in her affidavit.
These are believed to be the final images taken of Mackenzi alive.
Williams later told police that Mackenzi had a history of bipolar disorder, self-harm and bulimia, and that her siblings, who lived in other foster homes, didn’t want to see her. An inspector general short report on Mackenzi’s death contradicted this, stating Mackenzi no longer wished to see them.
Williams claimed Mackenzi opted for homeschooling due to bullying at Belleville East High School. School records show prior to leaving traditional school that she was frequently truant, missing 25% of school days, prosecutors have said. Officials from her former school district and regional office of education declined to speak on the matter, citing privacy laws.
For its part, DCFS continues to investigate the “educational components” in Mackenzi’s case, according to DCFS spokesperson Heather Tarczan. She noted DCFS policy that state wards are expected to be enrolled in school until they reach age 18, or age 21 if they are receiving special education services.
‘A drastic change’
Mackenzi turned 18 years old on July 13, 2023 — almost a year before her death.
Although Mackenzi technically had aged out of foster care, she remained in specialized foster care for youth with emotional and behavioral needs, according to DCFS.
Police said photos recovered from Williams’ phone show a stark transformation in Mackenzi’s condition — from a happy, healthy 15-year-old who was an honor student to an emaciated and fearful young woman three years later. In later photos, she appears depressed, thin and unkempt.
Police also discovered videos of Williams yelling at Mackenzi, forcing her to wear soiled underwear on her face and making her stand for long periods. One photo from May 1, shortly before her death, shows Mackenzi with a swollen, bruised face.
“Mackenzi’s appearance shows a drastic change from April 2020 to show significant weight loss and lack of hygiene,” the affidavit stated.
There were other pictures and videos, too, police said, including Williams yelling at Mackenzi, forcing her to stand against a wall, wearing a feces-soiled diaper on her face.
In text messages on May 3, 2024, Williams tells Reid, “I’m not getting in trouble for her and all the bruises on her. I have (my daughter) to think about, I would be in trouble.”
Other videos showed Mackenzi being beaten with a belt and begging not to be hurt.
White, who was not identified in the report, visited the home just two days before Mackenzi’s death, according to an inspector general report regarding Mackenzi’s case. Under DCFS policies, White should have visited Mackenzi three times a month — at least once in her foster home.
Dr. Gershom Norfleet, the forensic pathologist who performed Mackenzi’s autopsy, documented extensive bruising, including on both thighs, breasts, and a deep cut on her shin. He also found a 2-centimeter blood clot in her lungs, likely, he surmised, caused by trauma and worsened by poor nutrition and immobility.
Despite Williams’ claims of bulimia, Norfleet found no signs of tooth erosion common in the disease.
At the time of Mackenzi’s autopsy, she weighed just 90 pounds.
Another doctor consulted by police, a hematologist, confirmed the blood clot could have been treated with medication — if Mackenzi had received medical attention sooner. Instead, police believe Williams and Reid waited more than an hour after finding her unresponsive, spending that time recording her final moments.
As part of their investigation, Fairview Heights police also interviewed other foster children who had lived with Williams, reviewed DCFS reports, and uncovered prior incidents of abuse to foster children, including beatings with belts and being forced to stay outside.
These allegations of abuse and neglect against Reid and Williams go back a decade, according to prosecutors. All were unfounded.
No timeline provided
The troubling allegations against the caseworker revealed in court filings related to Mackenzi’s death comes just weeks after DCFS refused to release a timeline the case, stating they would not release details until after Williams’ and Reid’s trial, which could take years.
Under a 1997 Illinois law, DCFS is required to produce a report to the legislature on every child who is a ward of the state who dies or sustains serious injury. The Departmental Report on Death or Serious Life-Threatening Injury is supposed to contain details on what happened and recommendations for administrative or policy changes.
Although the agency does provide a quarterly report of anonymous children and whether they were seriously injured or died, it does not contain findings and recommendations. In the three-month quarter in which Mackenzi died, there were more than 200 children in the report.

“It’s mind boggling,” Cook County Public Guardian Charles Golbert said, who represents thousands of foster children in Cook County. “I guess we know why DCFS was trying to hide the file and why they didn’t want anyone to know more.”
A DCFS spokesperson has claimed that local prosecutors have requested in writing that the department not release a report as the criminal investigation continues. Capitol News Illinois has filed a public records request seeking correspondence with prosecutors.
For the public, DCFS routinely provides timelines of their contact with children who died in their care, but the agency has rebuffed several requests in Mackenzi’s case.
Golbert questioned why White was hired by DCFS amid an ongoing police investigation in a foster child’s death. DCFS responded it needs more time to respond to questions about White’s hiring.
More transparency and accountability were the intent of the 1997 law, Golbert said. “This case is the very reason for the law,” he said.
While caseworker criminal accountability in child death cases is rare, there is precedent: in 2024, former DCFS worker Carlos Acosta was sentenced to six months in jail for mishandling the case of 5-year-old A.J. Freund in McHenry County.
Acosta was convicted of two counts of child endangerment after being accused of failing to protect A.J. before his death in 2019, despite evidence of repeated abuse and neglect by his parents. This was the first time child endangerment charges against a state welfare caseworker were successfully brought in Illinois.

Article Summary

A caseworker for an Illinois foster child who later died had orders of protection filed against her by eight women for allegedly harassing, abusing and threatening violence against them.
The caseworker, who was employed by Lutheran Child and Family Services, is now employed by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.
The foster child, Mackenzi Felmlee, 18, was subjected to cruelty before her death in May 2024, according to search warrants released in the case.
DCFS still refuses to release a report regarding Felmlee’s treatment.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Editor’s Note: After the original version of this story published, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services clarified that Kurtavia White was a caseworker for foster child Mackenzi Felmlee from June 7, 2022, to May 17, 2023, roughly a year before Mackenzi died. White did not serve as a caseworker immediately before Mackenzi’s death. She also was not the unidentified caseworker mentioned in an Office of Inspector General’s report who visited the home two days before Mackenzi died.
A caseworker assigned to monitor Illinois foster child Mackenzi Felmlee — who later died in May 2024 — had a troubling past, including an arrest for a violent crime and orders of protection filed against her by eight women for alleged threats, harassment and abuse, court documents show.
Kurtavia White, a former Lutheran Child and Family Services caseworker, was arrested a decade before Mackenzi’s death for her involvement in a Metro East strip club brawl that left the victim, a dancer at the club, with eight staples in her head, court records show. She also was accused of retaliating against the woman by posting nude photos of her on social media.
Mackenzi, 18, died May 11, 2024, after being found unconscious and struggling to breathe at the bottom of the stairs in her Fairview Heights, Illinois, foster home. A search warrant application signed by a Fairview Heights police detective in the investigation of Mackenzi’s death also alleges that White failed to properly document home visits with the teen.
“It was discovered through the records that case worker Kurtavia White was copying and pasting notes for home visits, which does not appear to have correctly documented the visits,” an affidavit read that was signed June 23, 2024, prior to the arrest of Mackenzi’s foster mother, Shemeka Williams, and Williams’ mother, Cornelia Reid.
Williams and Reid were indicted on charges of first-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated domestic battery, intimidation, unlawful restraint and domestic battery in connection with Mackenzi’s death.

White has not been charged or arrested in relation to Mackenzi’s death and could not be reached for comment.
By late last year, following Mackenzi’s death, White had a new job: The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services hired her as a child welfare specialist with an annual salary of $75,000, state comptroller records show.
Lutheran Child and Family Services, which is a contractor of DCFS, declined to provide comment for this story. DCFS could not provide immediate comment.
A troubling past
For more than a decade before Mackenzi’s death, multiple women accused White of threatening them, bullying them online, and filing false reports with police and child services. One woman alleged that a false report filed by White led to her child — who suffered from sickle cell anemia — being removed from her custody. “He suffered and was very traumatized behind this,” she stated in a 2019 order of protection petition.
In 2020, White was charged with violating an order of protection by attempting to initiate a fight with the same woman. The case was later dropped after a series of court continuances.
White was the subject of 11 requests for orders of protection by eight women in St. Clair and Madison counties in southern Illinois. In one 2015 case, a woman working as a dancer claimed White attacked her at the Metro East strip club Bottoms Up, leading to White being charged with three felonies. The woman alleged in court documents in her order of protection case that White later pleaded guilty to two felonies and received probation.
Although no court record exists, a Belleville News-Democrat police blotter dated Dec. 22, 2015, reported on White’s arrest. Illinois law allows certain convictions to be sealed or expunged under specific conditions.

Police Chief Steve Johnson said he could not comment on specifics, citing the ongoing investigation, but offered: “Bringing justice for this little girl is paramount. We will not stop until all those accountable are brought before a court.”
White was the only caseworker listed in any of the seven search warrant applications. DCFS has refused to identify any other workers involved in Mackenzi case. In addition to identifying White as a caseworker who worked on Mackenzi’s case, the search warrants revealed disturbing new information about the morning Mackenzi was found unconscious and not breathing at the bottom of a staircase at her foster home around 2:30 a.m. on May 11.

‘A drastic change’
Mackenzi turned 18 on July 13, 2023 — almost a year before her death.  White was the girl’s caseworker from Jun 7, 2022, to May 17, 2023 — two months before Mackenzi turned 18.
Although Mackenzi technically had aged out of foster care, she remained in specialized foster care for youth with emotional and behavioral needs, according to DCFS.

Reid said APT remains concerned about recent federal funding cuts to public media, but is working through some possible solutions. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — The director of Alabama Public Television (APT) said Tuesday that the public service broadcaster could drop NPR affiliate stations in the state following federal funding cuts. 
Wayne Reid, executive director of APT, said it will lose about $3.2 million, equal to about 13% of its FY24 budget, in federal funding after President Donald Trump signed a law revoking $1.1 billion for public media over the next two fiscal years. Reid said there is a possibility that APT will drop the three NPR affiliate stations in Huntsville and instead take up programming from the Public Radio Exchange (PRX).
“We’ve got a great plan for taking what we’re losing and being able to move forward, and really engage more into the community,” Reid said.
He said APT is currently reviewing its budgets and does not have a concrete plan for future funding, but that it may include asking the state Legislature for additional funding. Board member Johnny Curry said the state should have no issue funding APT if it is able to educate legislators on what they do.
“Regardless of how we raise funds, I don’t see us stepping away from our core mission of providing educational products to the children of this state,” Curry said. “I don’t think we really are in danger of losing our state dollars if we educate the Legislature about what our education mission is. Our mission is not masterpiece theater.”
Another concern is the impact of federal cuts on PBS News Hour and other national programming from PBS. Reid said that Alabama is one of 16 networks in red states, about 20% of the country, who are unsure what will happen to national news coverage.
“Unfortunately, if we’re not part of PBS, that’s a problem, not being able to access that stuff,” Reid said.
While APT has its own programming, like Capitol Journal and broadcasts of high school sports, PBS supplies national programming, educational programming for kids, and digital streaming and sharing for the APT website.
“So if that went away, that’s a huge undertaking for us to come back with a new player, support, storage, everything else that we would have to do for that,” Reid said.
The commission met Kevin Cornell, creator of the PBS educational program Mister C, which teaches children about science, technology, engineering and math. He led the board and staff members at the meeting in an activity that he does on his show.
“The thing is with science, I expect everyone to fail, and that’s a great thing. Fail fast, fail often,” Cornell said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9986-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

(Getty Images)Attorney General Keith Ellison is joining a lawsuit against the Trump administration after it asked states to share the personal information of food aid recipients. 
SNAP — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — provides food assistance to over 400,000 Minnesotans. The U.S. Department of Agriculture threatened to withhold the program’s funding if states don’t respond to the data request. 
The lawsuit, which includes 20 other states and the District of Columbia, argues that the USDA’s request violates federal privacy laws; doesn’t meet public comment requirements; exceeds the USDA’s authority; and violates the spending clause of the Constitution. 
The USDA made the data demand in May following a Trump executive order. The agency demanded information on all applicants and recipients of SNAP beginning five years ago — including Social Security numbers and home addresses. A memo to state agencies said that the purpose of the data collection was to eliminate SNAP “information silos” and address fraud and inefficiency. 
According to the USDA website, “SNAP has one of the most rigorous quality control systems in the federal government.” This includes calculating payment error rates, which measure the accuracy of eligibility and benefit decisions. In 2024, Minnesota had an error rate of 8.98% compared to the national average of 10.93%. 
The USDA also plans to obtain information on “immigration status eligibility.” Immigrants without legal status can’t participate in SNAP but could enroll other members of their household. 
The USDA’s order is part of a larger effort from the Trump administration to gather the personal data of Americans. The federal government has already shared some of this data with immigration enforcement. 
“When our neighbors struggle to put food on the table, Minnesotans believe in lending a helping hand,” Ellison said in a press release. “Outrageously, the Trump Administration is now demanding sensitive personal information on the Minnesotans receiving help to feed themselves and their families so they can potentially weaponize it to harm people across our country.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-1.jpg,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)Only a dozen states have laws establishing suicide prevention offices or coordinators, and just 11 have task forces or committees dedicated to suicide prevention efforts, according to a new report.
The report comes amid sweeping cuts at federal agencies that offer mental health support. They include significant slashes in staffing and funding at the nation’s largest mental health and substance use agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants to fold SAMHSA into his new Administration for a Healthy America.
Released last week, the report was conducted by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials with support from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The analysis is part of an online resource breaking down details of suicide prevention efforts at the state level.


As of Jan. 1, just a dozen states had offices or state coordinators focused on suicide prevention: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Some states have these offices mandated by law and others were established through executive orders.
Eleven states (Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah and Washington) plus Puerto Rico have laws requiring a task force, commission or advisory group focused on suicide prevention.
The report notes prevention efforts are most effective when they are focused on higher-risk populations, areas, age groups and occupations. Suicide risk is higher among rural residents, older adults, American Indian and Alaska Native people, people with disabilities, veterans and groups that identify with a sexual minority. The federal administration recently pulled the plug on LGBTQ+ specialized supports under the national suicide hotline, 988.

About 60% of states — 29 states and Washington, D.C. — have laws that establish some form of fatality review committees that specifically include suicide deaths in reviews. Areas of focus varied among the states. Some had statewide teams and others were on the local level, according to the report.
The report notes that another 11 states assign prevention responsibilities within other offices. Minnesota law, for example, assigns such tasks to the state commissioner of health, rather than toward a special suicide prevention office or coordinator.
In 2023, the nation saw 49,000 deaths by suicide, according to the CDC. Firearms are involved in more than half of suicides.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Louisville organizations plan to use $4.5 million in grant funding over the next four years to help families experiencing homelessness by reducing the waitlist for shelter space and providing transitional housing and rental assistance.
Natalie Harris, the executive director of Coalition for the Homeless, which represents 40 agencies in the Louisville area serving people experiencing homelessness, said in a Tuesday press conference the funding from the Bezos Day 1 Families Fund is “allocated across the country each year specifically with the goal of making sure that no family with children sleeps outside.” 
The Bezos Day 1 Fund, a $2 billion philanthropic effort launched by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2018, has provided annual grants to organizations addressing homelessness across the country. 
“Our goal is that as soon as a family calls and says, ‘I need a place to stay,’ that they will immediately at that moment be able to get into a shelter,” Harris said. “That allows us to more quickly get the services to those families that they need so that they can also more quickly move into housing.” 
The grant recipients include the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, Volunteers of America Mid-States, St. Vincent de Paul, Option to Success, Wayside Christian Mission, Mama to Mama, Uniting Partners for Women and Children, Louisville Outreach for the Unsheltered and the Louisville Metro Office of Social Services. 
Harris said shelter space for families in Kentucky’s largest city has remained at capacity for about a decade, and the long shelter wait list is exacerbated by challenges with moving families from shelters to more permanent housing. Families experiencing homelessness tend to have more debt and evictions compared to single individuals, she said. 
“How do we break down those barriers so that they can get into housing and stay stable in housing?” Harris said. “We really want to end that cycle and let people figure out how to be in a safe space.” 
  Kristy Flippins-Bartlett, Option to Success CEO and founder, hopes the transitional housing supported by the grant funding will provide stability for youth. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
One of the grant recipients, Option to Success, which provides mental health support for teenage girls and families, will be using $300,000 in funding to launch 24 transitional housing units, a laundromat and a daycare center for families. 
Kristy Flippins-Bartlett, Option to Success CEO and founder, said the campus is about providing stability to families and teenagers in vulnerable situations. 
“With this funding, it does help us to be able to make renovations to our campus, actually pay for staff and to provide different funding that we need for the year,” Flippins-Bartlett said. 
Harris said with the grant funding only lasting four years, the Louisville community will need to step up in the future and support the work being built by organizations receiving this funding.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1539-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

Following natural disasters across the state this spring, the governor issued executive orders extending the income tax deadline for Arkansans in all 75 counties from Apr. 15 to July 31. Because of ongoing effects of the disasters, some Arkansans will be unable to meet the July 31 deadline, according to a DFA news release. 
The IRS has extended the federal tax deadline for Arkansans to Nov. 3. Under state law, the affected taxpayers are also granted a one month extension from the federal tax deadline to file their state income tax return. 
The new Dec. 3 deadline for state income taxes includes 2024 returns of Individuals, Subchapter S corporations, C corporations, pass-through entities, fiduciaries and estates, partnerships, and composite returns, according to the state finance department. 
Penalties will not apply for returns that are filed by Dec. 3. However, due dates for any estimated tax payments are not extended and must be paid when due to avoid penalties and interest, according to the state agency. 
Individuals and entities in all 75 counties are eligible for the state income tax deadline extension. Taxpayers must attach the notice from the IRS granting the federal extension due to the disaster (AR-2025-03) or check the federal extension box on the return.  
Additional questions can be directed to DFA by calling 501-682-1100 (for individuals) or 501-682-4775 (for businesses).

The report comes amid sweeping cuts at federal agencies that offer mental health support. They include significant slashes in staffing and funding at the nation’s largest mental health and substance use agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants to fold SAMHSA into his new Administration for a Healthy America.

It's one of the more regular, larger geysers in the park. It's featured here in June 2025 (Photo by Jacob Frank of the National Park Service via Flickr). On Monday morning, a 17-year-old male suffered what Yellowstone National Park officials say are “significant thermal burns” to his foot and ankle area in the vicinity of Lone Star Geyser near Old Faithful.

The man was hiking in the thermal area when his foot broke through the thin crust, and he suffered burns, according to a news release from the park. Emergency medical staff responded and transported the patient to a hospital for further treatment. This incident is under investigation.

It marks the first known “thermal injury” in the park in 2025. The last reported incident occurred in September 2024.

Lone Star Geyser is one of the most famous and regularly erupting geysers in the park, according to the T. Scott Bryan’s “The Geysers of Yellowstone.” It erupts approximately every three hours.

It is also one of the most recognizable geysers because of its unique cone, which is more than 9 feet tall.

According to Bryan, the geyser becomes active every 60 to 90 minutes after an eruption, making splashing and gurgling sounds, followed usually by a minor eruption, a major eruption, then often a series of smaller eruptions, before becoming seemingly dormant and then repeating the cycle. The eruptions last about five minutes, and the geyser can spray water as high as 45 feet into the air. The eruption and steam can often be heard as far as a mile away.

  Staying safe around thermal areas 


Park officials remind visitors to stay safe around thermal areas, which include pools, mud pots, geysers and vents.

Those instructions include staying on boardwalks and trails. Staying on them is a protection for both visitors and the delicate thermal formations. Water in hot springs can cause severe or fatal burns, and scalding water underlies most of the thin, breakable crust around hot springs.


Always walk on boardwalks and designated trails. Keep children close and do not let them run on boardwalks.


Do not touch thermal features or runoff.


Swimming or soaking in hot springs is prohibited. More than 20 people have died from burns suffered after they entered or fell into Yellowstone’s hot springs.


Pets are prohibited in thermal areas.


Do not throw objects into hot springs or other hydrothermal features.


Toxic gases may accumulate to dangerous levels in some hydrothermal areas. If you begin to feel sick while exploring one of our geyser basins, leave the area immediately.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54610989097_e24c357e92_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Even today, more than five years later, residents still talk about the fire. The chemical facility burned for three days, leaked toxic runoff into the waterways, forced schools and businesses to close and prompted a shelter-in-place order for everyone in Deer Park — a city just southeast of Houston in Texas’ crowded petrochemical corridor.
Eventually, after a thick layer of pollution covered the area for days, residents learned that a tank at the Intercontinental Terminals Co. had erupted in flames and that employees had been unable to contain it. Following the event, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, an independent and nonregulatory federal agency, opened an investigation, finding that a lack of proper safeguards, among other issues, was to blame.
The probe was nothing new for the agency, commonly known as the Chemical Safety Board, or for Texas. For decades, the CSB has investigated hazardous incidents, like the Intercontinental Terminals Co. fire, throughout the United States. But that could soon end. The Trump administration is proposing to defund the CSB in the 2026 federal budget and shut the agency down by the end of 2025, alarming residents living near the petrochemical plants, industry workers, public health officials and environmentalists.
The Trump administration argues that the CSB duplicates the work of both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and that CSB’s small $14 million annual budget should be eliminated.
Advocates of the CSB say it is a vital independent system for gathering information, launching investigations and developing safety recommendations for the petrochemical industry. Without it, the work would fall to other agencies, industry workers or even residents — leaving a hole that the board had plugged. The potential impact in Texas, and particularly Houston, where hundreds of petrochemical plants line the coast and the city’s waterways, could be significant.
Since it first began its work in 1998, the CSB has completed investigations of 22 incidents in Texas and eight incidents in Louisiana, the second-most investigated state. There are two ongoing investigations in Texas and Louisiana as well.
But the agency has investigated industrial explosions, fires and chemical accidents across dozens of states from Pennsylvania and New Jersey to Illinois, Wisconsin and New Mexico. The CSB has investigated six incidents in California, including the 2012 fire at the Chevron oil refinery in Richmond that sent 15,000 people to the hospitaland a 2015 explosion at a refinery in Torrance it called a “serious near miss” that could have caused a catastrophic release of a deadly, ground-hugging cloud and brought “serious injury or death to many community members.”
“Even with (facility) process safety management and regulation in place, have things gone down? Yes. Do things still happen? Yes. And the issue is that we’re still having incidents. We’re still having people get killed, we’re still having people get injured. We’re still having plants blow up,” said Katherine Culbert, a senior process safety engineer in Houston’s petrochemical industry.
Culbert has been in the industry for over 20 years, around the same time the CSB came into existence. As a safety engineer, it’s an agency she has faith in.
“We really need to look at why and what’s going on and how we can prevent it,” she said.
Why the Chemical Safety Board?
The mission of the CSB is to find the root cause of chemical accidents, most often an issue in safety management systems, such as with the Intercontinental Terminals Company fire, but investigators look for anything that could have prevented the incident from happening.
Unlike the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the CSB does not regulate or issue fines. The agency’s mission is fully to enhance education and public safety — which for residents living near petrochemicals is critical.
Yvette Arellano grew up near the petrochemical industry in Houston and now dedicates their time to the health and safety of their community as the founder of Fenceline Watch, an environmental advocacy nonprofit.
“The Chemical Safety Board has offered us invaluable information when it comes to chemical disasters,” Arellano said. “And sharing those reports back out because oftentimes we call for a root cause analysis, but there’s no requirement (from the company) for the information to be shared with the community affected.”
The CSB creates informational videos for industry workers and residents, and posts articles cautioning communities about petrochemical risks. Most recently, the board published an article about the danger of hurricane season with regard to communities near the petrochemical industry along coastlines. Weather events have become more intense across Texas, and particularly along the Gulf Coast, because of climate change.
This is concerning to Arellano, especially with the Trump administration’s proposal to slash or even eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency next year. Without the two agencies, Arellano said the situation could be deadly for communities near the coast during hurricane season.
It’s happened before. In 2017, flood waters from Hurricane Harvey caused the Arkema chemical facility in Crosby, Texas, to erupt in flames; the fire burned for five days. The CSB investigated the incident and recommended that Arkema reduce its flood risk as much as reasonably possible. Arkema complied.
Of the 1,019 recommendations CSB has published since its creation, nearly 90% have been implemented. This is another reason Culbert advocates for the agency. Since the CSB doesn’t issue fines, she said companies are more willing to engage with the board in transparency.
Companies often do not want the EPA, OSHA or the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality at their sites because they could be fined, Culbert said. The CSB approaches the industry differently.
“Companies are going to implement these things because they want to save money. If the facility is operating safer, they’ll have less incidents,” Culbert said. “If I talk to anyone in my company and I mentioned the CSB, they’re like, oh, did you see that video they did on, you know, whatever. Or did you see this? Or, like, everybody uses it. It’s an amazing tool for industry, for everyone throughout the industry.”
What next?
This is not the first time the CSB has been on the chopping block. In 2019, during the first Trump administration, the president proposed gutting the agency but never followed through. At that time, industry representatives expressed major concernsabout potentially losing the CSB.
The investigations at the CSB could be moved to OSHA or EPA or both, but those agencies focus largely on occupational safety and the environment, said P. Grace Tee Lewis, a senior health scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund. The more holistic view from the board is lost, she said.
The Trump administration is also proposing to cut the budget of those two agencies in 2026, leaving little room for more work. OSHA is expected to lose 8% of its $632.3 million budget, while the EPA’s $9.14 billion budget would be cut by more than half.
“The investigations will probably fall on the states and local governments to be able to pick it up,” Lewis said. “We’ll have to rely on the state itself (to investigate) and respond to these incidents.”
To Lewis, this is especially concerning for Houston, which has one of the largest concentrations of petrochemical facilities in the world. Local authorities are already overwhelmed with the threat of chemical disasters let alone having to shoulder conducting an entire investigation.
But it’s also a national problem, Lewis said. Chemical disasters can happen anywhere.
“I think that worker protections to me always rise to the top for me because regardless of whether (the workers) are in Houston, California, New Jersey or Kansas, those people are working every day to keep industry going, and they have a right to a safe environment,” Lewis said. “That is really critical.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)CANTON — Near Canton, Ohio on Monday, more than 300 men and women packed into the Metallus steel mill to see Vice President JD Vance. A sea of brightly colored hard hats cheered and applauded as the vice president touted the administration’s biggest legislative achievement, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Across the street, a few dozen protesters hoisted signs accusing Vance of “protecting pedophiles” — an allusion to the one problem the administration can’t seem to shake.
Asked about the long-promised release of files related to sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein, Vance insisted “we’re not shielding anything,” and that reviewing information takes time.
After first releasing a nothing-to-see-here memo in July, the Department of Justice is again reviewing the case at Trump’s order.
In the intervening weeks, the Wall Street Journal has reported Trump sent Epstein a lewd birthday card, and that Attorney General Pam Bondi informed the president in May that he’s named in the files.

Vance, like Trump, attempted to shift attention to previous administrations, calling out presidents Biden, Obama, and George W. Bush.
They decided “to go easy on the guy,” Vance claimed, saying that Trump should be commended for pursuing the case. Despite a 2008 plea deal with federal prosecutors in Miami, the Epstein case wasn’t widely known until The Miami Herald published its investigation in 2018, during the first Trump administration.
“Donald J. Trump, I’m telling you, he’s got nothing to hide,” Vance insisted. “His administration has got nothing to hide, and that’s why he’s been an advocate for full transparency.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Big and beautiful
But Vance wasn’t in Ohio to talk about Epstein. He was here to sell.
His message to the Metallus steel workers was simple: Trump’s tariffs are protecting jobs like yours, and with the president’s signature on the One Big Beautiful Bill, workers like you are going to be taking home more of your paycheck.
“We’re going to see take-home pay go up in the United States of America,” Vance claimed. “In this district, probably $7,000, $8,000 per family over the next three or four years.”
Without Trump in office, Vance claimed their tax bills would’ve gone up — “to the tune of thousands of dollars for each and every single one of you.”
That spread mostly comes down to the tax cuts Trump passed during his first term. They were set to expire at the end of this year and making them permanent was one of the Trump administration’s biggest priorities.
The bill also increases the standard deduction and the child tax credit, but Vance emphasized the inclusion of tax breaks for tips and overtime. Those breaks come in the form of limited tax deductions that are set to expire after 2028.
“Raise your hand if you’ve worked an overtime shift in the past year,” Vance told the crowd. Nearly every hand in the audience went up.
“The federal government is not going to take a dime of that overtime pay,” he claimed, “because if you’re spending hard hours away from your family, the federal government ought to keep its hands the hell out of your pocket when you’re doing it.”
Under the reform, workers can subtract earnings from tips and overtime from their taxable income, but not all workers will be eligible for the deduction and there are limits on how much can be deducted depending on income and filing status.
Eyes on 2026

The Metallus plant sits just outside Democratic U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes’ district, and Vance used the visit as an opportunity to call her out.
“She’s not celebrating no taxes on tips. She’s not celebrating no taxes on overtime. She’s not celebrating the highest rise in take home pay in 60 years, because she’s fought us every step in the way,” Vance said.
Vance’s critique was all about the 2026 midterms. Those elections are usually hard on the president’s party, and Republicans currently hold a very narrow majority in the U.S. House.
Later this year, Ohio state lawmakers will redraw the state’s U.S. Congressional district map, and Republicans seem eager to stack the deck against Sykes and Toledo-area Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur.
Vance added, “the door is always open,” for Sykes.
“Next time, we would love to have you celebrating the next great legislative accomplishment for northeastern Ohio,” he said, “But you’ve got to vote for it next time,” he went on, “and we’ll work with you every step of the way if you’re willing to make that happen.”
Sykes wasn’t amused.
“He’s not telling the truth,” she said in an interview.
Sykes explained that the White House invited several members of Congress to discuss the proposal.
“I was not on that list,” she said. “Neither were any of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle.”
Skyes added that she proposed several amendments to the bill in multiple committees.
“All of those were voted down (on) party lines,” she noted.
“The reconciliation process, inherently, is a partisan process,” Sykes argued. “The reason that they do it is to bypass the filibuster in the Senate, which is to encourage partisanship. And so, if they wanted bipartisan activity, they would have just gone through the typical legislative process.”
And Sykes criticized Vance’s assurances about overtime.
“He came to this community, he lied directly to these people’s faces,” Sykes claimed, “particularly to the steel workers, who are not going to be eligible for the no tax on overtime, because they are union members, and union members are not eligible for it.”
That’s not exactly right either, but Sykes has a point. The bill’s use of the Fair Labor Standards Act definition of overtime applies a higher threshold for many union workers.
In response, more than 20 unions — including United Steel Workers, who represent employees at the Metallus mill — are urging Congress to pass a fix.

Health care changes
Paying for all the tax breaks Vance touted isn’t cheap. To cover the cost, the One Big Beautiful Bill makes deep cuts to safety net services like health care and food assistance.
The Congressional Budget Office projects changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplace could lead to 10.9 million Americans losing their insurance. Add in the likely expiration of Affordable Care Act premium assistance, and the figure rises to 16 million.
A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis suggests 440,000 of them would be Ohioans.
What’s more, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts suggest that the measure will add $3.4 trillion to the deficit — triggering mandatory cuts of about half a trillion dollars to Medicare unless lawmakers intervene.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

But Vance defended the administration’s health care policies, and rejected the expert conclusions that millions will lose access.
“I don’t believe that’s going to happen for a second,” Vance asserted.
He pointed to new funding for rural hospitals and framed new coverage requirements as a way to protect underlying the program. Able-bodied people looking for work? Single moms taking their kid to a doctor? They’ll be fine, Vance insisted.
“Who’s not going to have access to that Medicaid is people who are in the United States illegally and people who refuse to even look for a job,” he claimed.
Undocumented immigrants are already not eligible for Medicaid.
The new rural hospital funding came along to get the votes of Republican members of Congress who were worried about uncompensated care.
Hospitals have to treat everyone, and in rural regions many of their patients have Medicaid. If those patients lose coverage, hospitals lose revenue.
The initial $25 billion fund propping up rural hospitals got doubled in the U.S. Senate to earn moderate members’ support.
Whether that price tag will be enough the keep hospitals whole, is anyone’s guess. In Ohio, some rural hospitals are raising concerns about their ability to maintain their maternity wards.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

Despite Vance’s claims that new Medicaid restrictions will “ensure only the needy get access,” there’s reason to believe otherwise-eligible people will lose their coverage.
Arkansas imposed similar work requirements and saw 18,000 people lose insurance, but not because they weren’t working. Many people were simply unaware of the reporting requirements or had trouble with the paperwork.
Sykes was particularly concerned about how the measure will impact health care in her district.
She argued the “overwhelming majority” of people on Medicaid are already employed and that those who aren’t often have good reason. Medicaid covers treatment for people in recovery from substance abuse, seniors in long term care, and kids, she noted.
“Should the children be working?” Sykes asked. “Obviously not.”
“They are acting as though these changes that are going to come out of Medicaid are going to weed out all the fraud, waste, and abuse, but it’s really just going to get your grandmother kicked out of her nursing home,” Sykes added. “It’s going to make it harder for you to access the breathing treatments for your child who has asthma.”

Short sighted
Before Vance took the stage, Metallus CEO Mike Williams praised what he called the Trump administration’s “bold, pro-growth” policies.
“The renewal and strengthening of the 232 steel tariffs have been critical,” he said of a 25% tariff applied to steel and aluminum imports. “They protect American jobs, they defend our national security and ensure that American steel remains a global force.”
Willams called the Big Beautiful Bill a “game changer,” and highlighted a provision allowing companies to immediately deduct the full cost of capital investments on their taxes.
And he argued those policies are helping them making new investments, including building a new furnace and inking a $99 million deal with the Department of Defense to produce components for 155 mm artillery shells.
But Ohioan Louis Maholic argued embracing Trump’s trade policies is shortsighted.
Maholic is retired now, but he used to work as a coal miner and then for the UFCW and AFSCME unions.
“I haven’t seen any real benefits to it for the blue-collar workers in Ohio,” Maholic said of Trump’s tariffs. “If anything, I think that it’s made things more unstable. It’s made companies more leery about what their future plans are going to be.”
Maholic dismissed Vance’s visit as an attempt to distract from the Epstein controversy and take some cheap shots at one of the Democrats Republicans are hoping to unseat in the midterms.
Maholic noted that while the bill cuts taxes immediately, it delays many of the biggest health care cuts to 2028.
“I think if the Republicans were truly, truly proud of this bill,” he said, “they wouldn’t have some of the most draconian cuts in it occurring until after the midterm elections next year.”

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers  from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture where officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, though most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health issues in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health issues.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would negatively affect an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers also disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that –– to provide those services,” Archbold said.

The lawsuit alleges that SNAP information is being illegally used to support a database on Americans, which would bring about a surveillance state unlike the nation has seen in recent history. July 28, 2025 | ScreenshotA lawsuit filed against the Trump administration by a coalition of attorneys general, including Michigan’s Dana Nessel, alleges that personal data mined from federal agencies could be used illegally to build a surveillance state unlike the nation has ever seen – putting recipients for things like food assistance at risk if they are being targeted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that the president’s U.S. Department of Agriculture is illegally demanding states turn over personal and sensitive information about millions of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, recipients.
SNAP is a state-administered, federally-funded program that provides billions of dollars in food assistance to tens of millions of low-income families. Personal information is provided to state and federal administrators in order to receive assistance, with an understanding that the information will only be used for SNAP purposes.
Moves by the Trump administration to force various departments to share that data with unrelated agencies, like ICE, sets up a system where the latter could potentially track deportation targets through information provided for SNAP. The USDA has also suggested that it would withhold state funding if states fail to comply with the information sharing mandate, effectively creating a gambit where states must choose residents’ privacy over vital assistance.
Nessel, speaking to reporters in a news conference Monday that included California Attorney General Rob Bonta and New York Attorney General Letitia James, said the episode was yet another attempt by the Trump administration to illegally use personal and sensitive data under the guise of fighting abuse and fraud.
“My colleagues and I will not allow this administration to trample on constitutional protections or unlawfully exploit the SNAP program in this way,” Nessel said. “Michigan families deserve to have their personal information protected, and I will keep fighting until they receive exactly that.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Since taking office, reports have indicated that Trump is amassing a huge database of personal information on Americans using that data for undisclosed purposes, much like immigration enforcement. The USDA demands regarding SNAP information appear to be another step toward that goal, the lawsuit posits.
Bonta touched on the consequences of Trump’s White House having that much personal data on Americans at its fingertips.
“It’s a bait and switch of the worst kind,” Bonta said. “SNAP recipients provided this information to get help feeding their families, not to be entered into a government surveillance database or be used as targets in the president’s inhumane immigration agenda. That’s the reality here. This isn’t about oversight and transparency. This is about establishing widespread surveillance under the guise of fighting fraud.”
Bonta added that the attorneys general in the lawsuit are calling the issue what it is: An illegal data grab designed to scare people away from public assistance programs.
James said the entire framework of Trump’s immigration policies was cruelty on public display, but the new demand regarding SNAP was a new low.
“It is outrageous. It is unacceptable,” James said. “This is not for research or to improve a service that millions count on. They are basically trying to weaponize the SNAP program against immigrant communities in violation of the law, and we collectively will not stand for it. That is the administration’s plans, and they have made it abundantly clear.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — With significant federal tax breaks for purchasing rooftop solar power, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient home improvements set to expire, solar power advocates gathered in Tampa Tuesday to urge those considering making such purchases to do so right now.
President Donald Trump’s signature “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law on July 4, significantly changes the clean energy tax credits created three years earlier under Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, and advocates during a press conference organized by Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor couldn’t pretend to argue otherwise.
“This is a body blow,” said Bill Johnson, president and founder of Brilliant Harvest LCC in Sarasota and president of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association.
“It’s a bit of a funeral for the industry,” added a somewhat glum Steve Rutherford, president and CEO of Tampa Bay Solar.
The biggest blow to the solar industry in Florida (and the country) in the legislation is the removal by the end of this year of the 30% tax break for individuals who buy rooftop solar panels.
“I cannot stress how dreadful it is to know that this industry is going to suffer in the coming months,” said Rutherford, who acknowledged that business has never been better since Floridians have become aware what the bill does in terms of rooftop solar.
“Since the bill destroyed the industry and destroyed the tax credit, we’ve seen a rush, an influx of customers that we’ve never seen,” he said. “I’ve gotten 100 customers in the last month — in the first four months of this year I didn’t get 100 customers.”

Rutherford added that the rooftop solar industry in Florida doesn’t generally move at such a furious pace, and warned potential customers intending to take advantage of that tax break to look for highly qualified installers.
“If you have folks that are ramping up that quickly, you’re going to lose some of the quality that goes with it,” he stressed.
Ceding leadership
A significant concern with the new law is that it takes away the leadership that the U.S. has shown on solar power and concedes it to China, which Johnson said was installing 100 solar panels every second. “Just do the math,” he said. “That’s an astounding figure.”
Growth in the solar power sector is not going away in the U.S., he continued, but it will slow down significantly, “and that’s a very, very sad thing.” His company has already signed contracts with clients who understand that they won’t earn any tax credits, but still feel it’s a worthy energy investment.
The bill also kills the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit by the end of this year. That credit takes up to $2,000 off the purchase of heat pumps, water heaters, and biomass stoves. It also removes a $1,200 tax credit off home upgrades like new insulation, doors, and windows.
The new measure ends federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for buying and leasing a new electric vehicle and up to $4,000 for a used vehicle by Sept. 30.
“If you were going to use those tax credits to help make those home improvements more energy efficient and put money back in your pocket, the time is now to act,” said Castor.
Johnson conceded that he couldn’t spin the notion that the new federal legislation was good for the solar industry in Florida, but asserted that the “bigger message here is that solar power in the state of Florida is not going anywhere.”
On a commercial level, that’s true. Although Florida still relies on natural gas for 75% of its energy needs (a larger proportion from one source than in any other state), investor-owned utilities did install the second-biggest solar power capacity in the country last year, behind only Texas.
While solar power provides only 8% of the state’s existing portfolio, that figure is expected to increase over the next decade, with the total proportion of renewable energy in Florida expected to reach 28% by 2032, primarily from the addition of new solar generation, according to a report published earlier this year by the Florida Public Service Commission.

That son-in-law, Steven Frederick Jr., and another law enforcement officer are now charged with manslaughter in an unrelated case in 2022 while both were Capitol Police officers.
On March 12, 2023, Frederick totaled his Capitol Police Ford F-150 on U.S. 49 South in Covington County, just past the Simpson County line. 
When a trooper arrived, he told Frederick in a dashcam video obtained by Mississippi Today that he wanted to give the Capitol Police officer a handheld breathalyzer test “to see how high you are.”
Frederick flunked the test with a .15 score, nearly twice the legal limit of .08. He was handcuffed and arrested for DUI.
Frederick can be seen on camera asking troopers to remove his handcuffs. They refused.
On the video, Frederick is quoted as saying he had only two beers but later can be heard telling a trooper that he had been drinking whiskey. Then he adds, “I just lost my f—ing career.”

Fellow troopers say Clay Loftin told them that Bailey appeared on the scene and asked if he could take Frederick with him. They said Loftin told them he replied to the sheriff, “No, he’s coming with me.”
Bailey told WLBT in 2023 that he spoke to Loftin a “handful” of times and that he told the trooper to “do his job.”
If Bailey had taken Frederick with him, prosecution would have proved difficult, because results from handheld breathalyzers aren’t admissible in court. This is why DUI suspects are tested on machine breathalyzers.
At the Covington County Jail, Loftin put Frederick on the machine breathalyzer, which tested him at .127, according to the arrest report.

After Frederick was jailed, Covington County Sheriff Darrell M. Perkins released him without bond into Bailey’s custody. He said Bailey told him he was taking Frederick to a hospital.
State authorities have learned that a prosecutor, who wasn’t from Covington County, said Bailey called him and asked him what would happen if a trooper didn’t show up for a DUI hearing and the prosecutor replied that the case would be dismissed.
Bailey has denied these allegations. “Whoever said that I talked to a prosecutor is a liar,” he told WLBT. “That is a completely false lie.”
Authorities have also learned that after the wreck, Bailey reportedly telephoned Frederick’s supervisor at Capitol Police, Porfirio Grimaldo, telling the supervisor that he should keep Frederick on the force because “the DUI has been taken care of.” 
Contacted for comment, Grimaldo referred all questions to the department’s lawyers. “Our MDPS legal team is unable to comment on a conversation they were not a party to,” said spokesperson Bailey Martin.
Neither Bailey’s lawyer, Jason Dare, nor Bailey responded to questions about this.
Five months after the accident, Loftin failed to show up as required to testify in the DUI case against Frederick. A Covington County judge dismissed the case. 
Loftin was one of four troopers scheduled to testify that day in justice court. He was the only one who didn’t appear.
Afterward, fellow troopers said Loftin told them he had never received a notice of the hearing and if he had, he would have been there. Electronic records, however, show he received the email and opened it.
When troopers start their jobs, they agree in advance to take a polygraph test, commonly known as a lie detector test. If they refuse to take the test, they can be fired.
After Loftin took his polygraph test, the examiner concluded the trooper showed deception when he denied that anyone pressured him to ignore the subpoena to testify in court.
The trooper received a five-day suspension with no pay, and he did not appeal, according to records obtained by Mississippi Today. He declined to respond to requests for comment.
As for Frederick, he resigned three days after the wreck “to prevent termination,” according to his certification records. He had worked for Capitol Police less than eight months and paid nothing toward the Ford F-150 he totaled.
Bailey has said he never tried to influence justice. 
“I can swear on a stack of Bibles, I did not ask anyone for any help on that just because I knew the finger would be pointed at me because of that, and you know, let things take their course naturally,” the sheriff said in the 2023 WLBT interview. “I hate that it happened to him (Frederick) because he is a good guy.”
Another wreck, no charges

A year and a half after Frederick demolished his Capitol Police truck, he wrecked another patrol vehicle, this time as a deputy for Scott County.
Tina Hutchinson said Frederick was driving north on Highway 13 in Smith County when he hit her son’s truck so hard it turned his truck completely around. Frederick’s car careened up the driveway.
Both her son’s truck and Frederick’s patrol car were totaled, she said.
The speed limit along that stretch in Polkville is 35 mph. Frederick admitted he was doing 55 mph, Hutchinson said, and she believes it was even faster because of the damage done, the place the patrol car stopped and the lack of skid marks.
Certification records show Frederick had three previous speeding tickets, one of them resulting in a suspended driver’s license, which he attributed to a “misunderstanding” with the court.
After this accident, Frederick was sitting on the ground, saying he was hurt, Hutchinson said. “If your leg is hurting so bad, wouldn’t you wait for the ambulance?”
Instead, Sheriff Bailey again appeared on the scene and took Frederick to the hospital before troopers ever arrived, she said. “His daddy-in-law comes and picks him up.”
Neither Bailey’s lawyer nor Bailey responded to questions about this.
Frederick wasn’t charged with speeding or anything else, Hutchinson said. “Why leave the scene of an accident and not wait for the Highway Patrol?”
Officers, however, told her son that he couldn’t leave until after he spoke with troopers who had yet to arrive, she said.
Her son suffered no injuries from the wreck, she said. “I don’t know how it didn’t hurt him worse.”

Children sometimes play not far from the road where Frederick totaled his patrol car, she said. “What if he had slid and hit a kid?”
Manslaughter charge
Earlier this year, Frederick and Michael Lamar Rhinewalt pleaded not guilty to manslaughter in the Sept. 25, 2022, death of 25-year-old Jaylen Lewis in Jackson. Both officers were working for Capitol Police at the time. 
An investigation by Mississippi Today has uncovered that Col. Steven Maxwell, then-director of the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, rejected hiring both officers, but Capitol Police, also part of the Department of Public Safety, hired them.
The officers reportedly told investigators that Rhinewalt shot Lewis in self-defense after Lewis drove his car toward them. A witness statement appears to back up their version of events.
According to the indictment, Frederick and Rhinewalt said this killing “was necessary to protect himself from great bodily harm or death at the hands of Lewis,” but the indictment concluded that was “not a reasonable belief under the circumstances.”
Lewis’ mother, Arkela, questioned why the officers, instead of being indicted for murder, were charged with manslaughter, defined under Mississippi law as killing a person without malice. “That’s crazy,” she said.
Frederick was released on a $10,000 cash bond on April 28, two weeks before he married Bailey’s daughter, Alexis. Frederick is set for trial Sept. 15, and Rhinewalt’s trial is set for Dec. 8.
After his indictment, the Scott County Sheriff’s Department put Frederick on administrative leave without pay. In an April 21 letter, Scott County Sheriff Mike Lee wrote that he didn’t know if Frederick would be retained.
That same month, the Department of Public Safety released Rhinewalt. He has also been indicted along with former Capitol Police officer Jeffery Alan Walker Jr. in the Aug. 14, 2022, shootings of Sinatra Rakim Jordan and Sherita Lynn Harris — six weeks before Lewis’ killing. The indictment accuses the officers of “manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life” in the shootings. Both officers have pleaded not guilty to the aggravated assault charges.
In the wake of these shootings, the department requested funding to purchase body cameras and now requires all Capitol Police officers on patrol to wear them. In addition, the department created an Internal Affairs Division that covers the entire agency and reports to the commissioner, who worked with lawmakers to give the Board of Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Training the power to investigate complaints against law enforcement officers.
Public Safety Commissioner Sean Tindell said Internal Affairs now conducts uniformed background checks for all of the agency’s new law enforcement hires. In addition, he said the department will hold its first agency-wide cadet class in February to help ensure that all its officers are receiving the same training and understand the agency’s policies before beginning their career with the department. 
In the past, the department and the divisions it oversees have operated out of multiple headquarters. In 2026, the department plans to move into a new, 146,000-square-foot headquarters in Rankin County, where all divisions will be under one roof. 
Tindell said that consolidating all personnel into a single place will not only improve day-to-day communication and collaboration across divisions but will also enhance critical communication during emergencies and improve overall safety for all of Mississippi.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/23113447/Clay-Loftin-and-Steven-Frederick-at-scene.jpg,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

(Stock photo by iiievgeniy/Getty Images Plus)Per Julia Shumway’s recent article, it is great to see bipartisan support to begin addressing the problem of microplastics in our waterways.
Here’s another pollution problem plaguing South Carolina beaches that deserves more attention from our congressional leaders: fecal contamination.
Fecal bacteria in coastal waters is more common than most people think.
According to a new report by our research partners at Environment America Research & Policy Center, 74% of South Carolina beaches tested last year had potentially unsafe bacteria levels on at least one day — including Folly Beach and beaches on Hilton Head Island, Sullivan’s Island, and Kiawah Island. Sections of Myrtle Beach exceeded a safety threshold for nasty bacteria multiple times.
The beach safety threshold used in the report is a level of fecal indicator bacteria associated with 32 illnesses per 1,000 swimmers, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Pathogens continue to be a problem at our beaches this year.
Earlier this month, the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services issued a swimming advisory for a section of the beach on Edisto Island due to unsafe levels of fecal bacteria. In May, the agency issued similar advisories for sections of Pawleys Island and Debordieu Beach.
Scientists estimate 57 million instances of people getting sick each year in the United States from swimming in polluted waters. Those illnesses can include nausea, diarrhea, ear infections and rashes. The majority of these illnesses go unreported, so most people are unaware of how big of a problem this is.
Common sources of this fecal bacteria are deteriorated sewage systems and stormwater runoff. Leaky or overflowing pipes allow raw sewage to enter local waterways where people like to swim and fish.
For example, earlier this year in Florence, South Carolina, more than 5,000 gallons of untreated sewage flowed into Jeffries Creek, prompting officials to issue swimming and fishing advisories. Similarly, in the town of Chapin this past May, two overflows in the span of five days let a combined 120,000 gallons of sewage leak out into an inlet of Lake Murray.
According to local environmental group Congaree Riverkeeper, the City of Columbia had 85 sewer spills that amounted to more than 1 million gallons last year alone.
When sewage overflows into creeks, rivers, and streams, it can end up getting washed into coastal waters, putting beachgoers at risk.
With the increased frequency of extreme weather events, bacteria pollution could get a whole lot worse. Heavy precipitation could place an extra strain on outdated wastewater systems, causing further overflows and malfunctions.
Fortunately, we know how to solve these problems. Repairing and upgrading wastewater systems can dramatically reduce contamination in the places where we love to go swimming. The federal Clean Water State Revolving Fund was created to help local governments like Florence, Chapin, and Columbia make these projects a reality.
Unfortunately, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund is not currently getting the funding it needs.
The EPA estimates that the U.S. needs at least $630 billion over the next 20 years in order to upgrade wastewater systems and keep our waterways safe. But current funding for the revolving fund covers less than 20% of this annualized need.
And that may be about to get worse.
Last week, the House Appropriations Committee in Congress approved providing $1.21 billion for the revolving fund in fiscal year 2026. The spending proposal represents a $430 million cut compared to this year’s allocation of $1.64 billion.
South Carolinians should not have to risk coming into contact with raw sewage when they go swimming, fishing, or boating at their favorite lake or beach.
Our communities need the resources to fix their wastewater systems and make our beaches safer.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hand-in-water-illustration-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.). (Photo by Leah Romero)Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District on Monday met with Sunland Park law enforcement, Gadsden Independent School District representatives and other community leaders of the border city to discuss public safety and steering children away from organized crime influences.
Vasquez recently introduced two bills in Congress – the No More Narcos Act and the Stop COYOTES Act – that would create an educational campaign for middle and high school students who attend school within 100 miles of the border with Mexico, as well as improve communication between federal agencies and local law enforcement.

“One of the things that is of great concern to me, and continues to be a concern, is the way that our young people are…being used by the cartels as mules. Being used by ‘coyotes’ as expendable bodies, essentially,” Vasquez said during the meeting. 
Gadsden Independent School District Superintendent Travis Dempsey pointed out the difficulties in addressing  online recruitment because cartels move quickly. Moreover, the district includes many grandparents raising grandchildren, which can lead to less monitoring of  children’s online activities.
“We want to make sure our kids get a great education and move on to bigger and better,” Dempsey said. “We just want to make sure kids are safe. We do not want those drugs or anything of that nature in our schools or community, and getting kids to understand how detrimental that one time experiment they might try could be a lifelong lesson for them.”
Vasquez mentioned the D.A.R.E. Program, or Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program, with which he and many others around the table grew up. The program typically involves fifth grade students, but the discussion revealed that students even younger than that may already be exposed to drug use, whether by family or outside influences.
GISD Chief Academic Officer Maria Hernandez said early elementary students are being caught with cannabis and vapes in school, so the D.A.R.E. Program is reaching them too late. 
“I really think it has to start with the parents. And I think it almost has to be a shock factor at this point because it’s so out there all the time, that it’s very common to the community for kids to have this,” Hernandez said. 
Sunland Park Police Chief Eric Lopez said his department supports starting such drug education programs earlier, but funding and personnel are hurdles. Sunland Park Fire Chief Danny Medrano added that his department has seen a drop in calls, but he also faces financial issues with recruiting and maintaining needed resources. And while training is available for his personnel to better handle medical callouts, it takes time and removes personnel from being available to respond to calls. Sunland Park also doesn’t have the call volume to warrant immediate federal attention, he added.
Vasquez told Source NM that he believes the Trump Administration is focusing on the wrong area – “deporting American citizens” and militarizing the border, while youth are being targeted across the four border states. 
“This is an area where if we invest in our dollars, federal dollars, wisely, we can prevent American citizens from being involved in trafficking, human trafficking, sexual exploitation, all those horrible things,” Vasquez said. He added that one big takeaway from the conversation was the need to start  earlier and involve the entire family in educational programs. “For the parents as well, they need to know that if they care about the safety and wellbeing of their kids, they also can’t be engaged with this type of activity.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/vasquezsunlandpark-1024x683.png,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

Bellows told Maine Morning Star she will respond in the next few days by telling the DOJ that it does not have the right to such information.  “The federal […],"Shenna Bellows waits outside the Maine House of Representatives chamber before legislators elected her to serve another term as Secretary of State. (Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)The U.S. Department of Justice asked Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows to provide access to the state’s voter registration list and other sweeping election data. Bellows told Maine Morning Star she will respond in the next few days by telling the DOJ that it does not have the right to such information. 
“The federal government has overstepped its bounds,” Bellows said. “We will be denying their request for the citizen voter information of every Mainer.”
Bellows said, according to the National Association of Secretaries of State, the DOJ is asking for voter information from all 50 states. Maine Morning Star’s partner outlets have been following these probes in at least nine other states so far. 
“Why on Earth does the Department of Justice need the voter information from all 50 states?” Bellows said. “If Congress thought it was appropriate that there be a national voter file, Congress could have authorized the Department of Justice to do that, but they have not.” 
The latest request in Maine follows a less expansive inquiry earlier this month.
In a July 10 email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, requested a phone call with Bellows to discuss a “potential information-sharing agreement” to provide the DOJ with information on registered voters in Maine who are ineligible to vote or “may otherwise have engaged in unlawful conduct relevant to the election process.” The Department of the Secretary of State sent a response acknowledging receipt of the email that same day. 
Then, on July 24, the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ sent a vastly more detailed request for specific data, including the statewide voter registration list, names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance and the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship, among other information about the state’s election processes.
“We don’t know why they’re doing this, whether it is to change the subject away from topics like the Epstein files, or whether it is to undermine voter confidence in our strong election systems,” said Bellows, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026.
But it doesn’t matter why, she said, it violates the U.S. Constitution, which puts states in charge of elections.
The DOJ declined to answer Maine Morning Star’s requests for comment on the emails regarding why the administration is seeking the information and how it intends to use it. 

DOJLetter 
During Trump’s first term, Bellows’ predecessor Matt Dunlap denied Trump’s voter fraud commission access to the state voter file, which Bellows said was the correct move. Dunlap served on the panel and after it was disbanded said it was set up to validate Trump’s voter fraud claims. He did not respond to requests for comment for this story. 
“The secretary of state at the time of the state of Mississippi, Delbert Hosemann [a Republican], told the DOJ to go jump in the Gulf of Mexico,” Bellows added. “My answer to the DOJ is, ‘Go jump in the Gulf of Maine.’”
The request
While Bellows intends to tell the DOJ they have no right to the information, it is due within 14 days of receipt, according to the letter which came from the division’s Deputy Assistant Attorney General Michael Gates and Acting Chief of the Voting Section Maureen Riordan. 
The requests are for data specifically from November 2022 through the receipt of the letter.  
One of the demands is the number of registered voters identified as ineligible to vote in Maine for that time period specifically because of the following reasons: “non-citizen,” “adjudicated incompetent,” and “felony conviction.” Maine is one of two states that have no restrictions on eligibility to vote based on criminal convictions. For each of these categories, the DOJ also requested the individual’s registration information on the statewide voter registration list, including their vote history. 
The requests in other states have ranged in scope. Other states received “information-sharing agreement” inquiries, including nearby Rhode Island. Meanwhile, at least nine states have received requests from the DOJ for more detailed voter information like the latest in Maine, such as turning over full voter registration lists and each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. 
These nine states include Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Colorado — the latter being the most sweeping publicly known request. The DOJ is demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. 
These requests have raised fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information. 
Jen Lancaster, communications director for Democracy Maine, a collaboration between nonpartisan organizations working to make government more equitable by improving elections, protecting and engaging voters, described the probes as “a nefarious data grab” that is likely intended to target groups that have already been subject to other data probes by the Trump administration, such as immigrants. 
“We hope that our election officials, if it came down to being pushed to share that sensitive data, we would hope that they resist that,” Lancaster said.
The latest request of Maine cites state data provided for the election administration and voting survey conducted by the Election Assistance Commission, an independent agency of the U.S. government created by Congress in 2002 to aid the states in conducting safe and secure elections.
For example, the letter noted that Maine’s survey response showed that there were nearly as many registered voters listed as active as the citizen voting age population in Maine in 2024, with a registration rate of 92.4%. The letter went on to request further details about the state’s response, such as information about the actions Maine is taking to ensure that ineligible voters are being removed and a list of all duplicate registrants the state has removed.
Secretary of State finds dual voting accusations from Maine GOP to be false

“Again, the Trump administration and the DOJ are blurring the lines and overstepping their bounds,” Bellows said in response to these asks. “… We are proud of our high voter registration rates. I work hard on school campuses, in community outreach events, to promote voter registration.” 
Bellows added, “The nature of these questions suggest that the DOJ is more interested in keeping people that they don’t like from voting than promoting voter registration and participation.”
The DOJ requests for Maine voter data come after the state GOP accused multiple Maine citizens of voting twice in the same election, claims that Bellows determined to be false earlier this month. 
The state party, along with the help of the Republican National Committee, found more than 600 voters who registered to vote twice and more than 50 who voted twice in the same election, using a state voter file provided by the Secretary of State, according to details shared in a June 26 Facebook post. 
According to Bellows’ office, of the 51 names in question, 11 were different people with the same name and another 19 were erroneously recorded by their local municipality as having voted twice but in fact had not.

Mississippi AG wants explanation,Taylor Vance and Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/29/did-federal-judge-use-ai-to-write-order-mississippi-ag-wants-explanation/,AG lawyers are calling for the order to be restored to the public docket and asking for an explanation for how the errors were written into the order.,"U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate Credit: Rogelio V. Solis / Associated Press

The state attorney general has asked a federal judge in Mississippi to explain errors in a recent ruling, which some lawyers speculated were made by artificial intelligence.
U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate issued a temporary restraining order on July 20 that paused the enforcement of a state law that prohibits diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools. But the order was riddled with mistakes — naming plaintiffs who weren’t parties to the suit, quoting state law incorrectly and referring to cases that don’t appear to exist.
After lawyers with Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office asked him to correct the order last week, Wingate replaced the error-laden ruling with a corrected version. He removed the original order from the public docket entirely and backdated the new one. 
Now, the AG lawyers are calling for that order to be restored to the public docket and asking for an explanation for how the errors were written into the order in the first place. 
The state argues in court documents that the pending litigation will likely be appealed to the conservative U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, so maintaining a clear record of all of the documents filed on the court docket is crucial.
“All parties are entitled to a complete and accurate record of all papers filed and orders entered in this action, for the benefit of the Fifth Circuit’s appellate review,” the court filing states.

Wingate has not responded to previous requests for comment about the factual errors, and it’s unclear when he would rule on the state’s motion. 
Ben Cooper is a professor at the University of Mississippi School of Law who studies AI and is a member of the Mississippi Bar’s Ethics Committee. He told Mississippi Today it may be virtually impossible to know if someone on the judge’s staff used AI to craft the order.  
“The fact that it had things in it that sounded real but weren’t actually real — that’s the hallmark of somebody in the judge’s chambers using AI,” Cooper said. “But I can’t prove it and I don’t know that anyone can.”
When attorneys are caught using artificial intelligence, judges typically apply sanctions and ask for an explanation. A federal judge in Alabama last week disqualified three lawyers from the law firm Butler Snow from a case after they inadvertently included made-up citations generated by artificial intelligence in court filings.
But the power imbalance makes it more difficult to demand an explanation from a judge when the roles are reversed — especially a federal judge who has a lifetime appointment to the bench.
“I can’t say for sure that Judge Wingate has done anything wrong, so I don’t want to suggest he should be disciplined, but the system is completely different,” Cooper said. “There often is not the same kind of accountability, and it’s not as fast as with lawyers.” 
The parties are scheduled to appear in front of Wingate for a hearing on Aug. 5 to argue about a preliminary injunction in the case.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/06092032/AP23255739902857-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

Republican Eric Small is challenging incumbent U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree for Maine’s 1st Congressional District in the November 2026 election, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. The Democrat has held her seat since she was first elected in 2008.
“We need someone with a new sense of urgency in Washington looking out for our great state,” Small told Maine Morning Star in an email Tuesday.
He went on to say that as a career law enforcement officer, he has seen firsthand how homelessness, mental illness and substance use disorder are devastating communities, “while Washington offers more politics than progress.”
“We need to restore trust in government, support law enforcement, and ensure that our most vulnerable neighbors get the help they need, not just lip service,” Small added.
He will first face at least three other candidates in the Republican primary on June 9, 2026. Two of the Republican challengers, Ron Russell and Andrew Piantidosi, ran against Pingree in 2024. Small will also face Joshua Duprey, who filed to run in mid-May, in the primary. 
In a Facebook post last week, Small said he believes the federal government has a role in solving the national crises of substance use, mental health and homelessness without wasting taxpayer money. He added that he believes in personal responsibility and accountability, as well as “strong borders, secure communities, and the freedom to live without government overreach.” 
Small’s law enforcement career began in 2001 at the Berwick Police Department where he spent seven years before moving to the Sanford Police Department, according to reporting from the Sanford Springvale News. He served as deputy chief before being appointed to lead the department last October.

After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.

“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.

Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.










They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that … all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party.


– Justin Mcelwain, Pittsburg, Kan., resident


Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”

‘Not a bumper sticker bill’

The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.

Nevada House Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”

In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.

Democrats ‘fight back’

This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.

Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

“I know in my heart he’s probably not alive anymore because he never would’ve stayed away from those kids this long, or me,” Deana Floyd said.
Floyd left Hummel, a Choctaw citizen, and her other son at home for a trip out of town in January 2024. Hummel stayed in Atoka while his brother reported going to the movies in Ada. When the family returned, Hummel had vanished.
“Yeah, he made mistakes, but through it all, he loved them kids,” Floyd said. “He was just a down-to-earth guy. Even when he got in trouble with the police before, they all liked him. It wasn’t like he was a bad guy or anything, he just had some issues that he got in trouble for.”
Hummel had a track record of leaving home without a lot of communication, so Floyd didn’t contact authorities to report him missing until a month passed. What followed, she said, was a disorganized and lackluster performance from law enforcement resistant to cooperation.
The first organization involved in the search for Hummel was the Atoka County Sheriff. Floyd said the agency initially responded, but passed the case to Choctaw Lighthorse police without further involvement. That was something new, Floyd said, because the sheriff helped the family before.
“When [Brandon] was in his addiction, they didn’t have a problem coming out and arresting him and taking him to jail,” Floyd said. “He was in their jail before.”
Things changed in Oklahoma after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the McGirt case. That 2020 decision drastically altered the state’s legal landscape, finding much of the eastern portion to be reservation land. As a result, cases that the state would have previously handled were scheduled for tribal or federal courts.
“I think this law that they passed is ridiculous,” Floyd said. “They just want to shove everything over to the [Bureau of Indian Affairs] or the Lighthorse. If they’re Indian, they want nothing to do with it.”
Atoka County Sheriff Kody Simpson was elected last summer, defeating the incumbent after Hummel’s disappearance. Simpson said relations between his office and the Choctaw Nation have improved and it’s no longer policy that cases be sent without follow-up to the tribe.
“I hate to say this, but it’s the truth: in the municipal police and the county sheriff’s offices, it is a way to be lazy,” Simpson said. “It’s absolutely what it boils down to, 100%. They don’t want to deal with the call; they don’t want to deal with any call. The municipalities and the county sheriff’s offices that hand every call off, for tribal citizens, it is a way to be lazy.”
Under the purview of the Lighthorse police, Hummel’s case languished, Floyd said. They weren’t interested in helping because of Hummel’s criminal record. In a written statement, Lighthorse police denied negligence, saying it “investigated and followed local leads diligently for a year before the remaining leads were identified to be individuals located out of the state.”
Lighthorse eventually requested help from the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation and the BIA. Floyd said the first BIA agent in charge left without an explanation. His replacement, who is based in Tennessee due to a staff shortage in Oklahoma, has been scarce.
The BIA did not respond to requests for information.
Advocates note similar breakdowns in procedures and relationships. The Northeastern Oklahoma Indigenous Safety & Education advocacy network creates reports for cases it handles. Last year, the group was involved in the search for Trey Glass, a 19-year-old United Keetoowah Band member found dead in a well belonging to a former Kansas, Oklahoma police chief.
In its report on Glass, NOISE noted a tangle of issues, including a delay before tribal authorities were notified of Glass’ disappearance by the family, not the police.
“Much of the confusion could have been delayed, and more resources could have been deployed if the Kansas PD had some foundational knowledge of operating a police department within the exterior boundaries of the Cherokee Nation Reservation,” the NOISE report stated.
The confusion was compounded by an intertribal dispute. Because Glass’ family is UKB, they chose to contact their tribe for help, but the UKB and the Cherokee Nation are at odds over a recent opinion that they legally share the same reservation. The initial search for Glass was a “cluster,” according to the report, as the UKB, the Cherokee Nation and the police tried to sort out who was in charge.
Chaos, apathy and uncooperative interagency behavior are not uncommon in missing or murdered Native cases such as Hummel’s and Glass’. That’s according to Karrisa Newkirk, president and founder of Missing Murdered Indigenous Women Oklahoma, who said it can be difficult to get law enforcement at any level across the state involved, even in violent emergencies.
“There’s been many domestic violence cases too,” Newkirk said. “So there’s been many times when someone has called because of a domestic violence incident and the city police are like, ‘Oh, you’re tribal? You’re going to have to call tribal police.’ Even though they’re in the city limits. And when you’re in a time of need, that’s not something you want to hear.”
Newkirk, who also collaborates with the Department of Justice, said responses improve if a cross-deputization agreement is in place, but the responsibility for contacting tribal police often still falls on the shoulders of victims, which breeds distrust and confusion.
“I can’t tell you how many times I have been told, ‘Well, they said this, but I was so flustered in the moment, I didn’t do it. I called you,’” Newkirk said.
Newkirk advocates for a range of solutions, including greater resources for the BIA, continued involvement of a responding officer and a standardized approach to police notifying tribes of arrests.
“They probably don’t have a manual, but I really do think there needs to be some kind of workflow,” she said. “Like, ‘Oh, this is a tribal member. How many hours do we have to contact the tribal authority?’”
Newkirk also said agencies that work together should have biweekly check-ins, networking events and annual training.
“A lot of these small PDs don’t even have proper training in human trafficking, or missing children, or even murder cases,” Newkirk said. “It should not take 10 hours to issue an AMBER Alert when it meets all the criteria. Training is a necessity.”
In the meantime, Deana Floyd and other families with missing loved ones wait.
“It’s a nightmare when you don’t know where your child is,” she said. “At this point, I don’t care about anything anymore, except for finding him.”

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas attorney general wants U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate a Chinese energy organization he accuses of waging “environmental lawfare.”
In a letter sent to Bondi on Monday, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach urged the Justice Department to open an investigation into The Energy Foundation’s actions in the United States, “including its ties to climate lawfare in the courts,” he said. He linked The Energy Foundation, commonly called Energy Foundation China, to the Chinese Communist Party. He offered no evidence of such connections. “Lawfare” refers to the use of lawsuits or legal challenges to drive political goals.
The letter came after Kobach sounded the alarm on new threats in environmental litigation in June testimony to a U.S. Senate subcommittee.
“Environmental lawfare threatens not only American economic prosperity and energy security,” Kobach said in written testimony. “(In) its latest forms, it also threatens the American constitutional order.”
Energy Foundation China previously operated with the United States Energy Foundation before splitting in 2019 into two separate charitable nonprofits. Energy Foundation China, headquartered in San Francisco with a Beijing office, works to further Chinese industry in climate change, emissions reductions and clean energy transitions, according to its website. The U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce found in 2024 that Energy Foundation China has given money to American organizations to further green energy and climate education, research and projects.
Kobach argued in his testimony that the Chinese Communist Party “plainly has a strategy of driving the United States away from domestic energy sources and increasing U.S. dependence on sources that rely on a Chinese supply of solar panels, electric vehicle batteries, and other technologies.”
He identified two new threats in environmental litigation in the U.S.
The first involves state legislatures and state regulatory bodies that, in recent years, have placed “themselves in the shoes of the federal government adopting draconian environmental standards,” Kobach said. The way to stop them is by suing, Kobach said.
The second is local governments, such as cities and counties, suing energy producers seeking massive compensation for alleged harms to people and the environment, he said. One such case is in Ford County, Kansas, where a group of citizens sued companies in 2024, including ExxonMobil, Chevron and the American Chemistry Council. They argue that the plastic and chemical companies lied for decades about the recyclability of plastic, creating a pollution crisis.
Kobach says Ford County residents claim to represent every county in the United States.
“Setting aside the merits of their environmental claims, which are dubious at best, the plaintiffs in this case are attempting (to) usurp the authority of the 50 states, as states,” he said. “Only a state attorney general can bring a case of this nature, which seeks to remedy an alleged injury to the health, safety, or welfare of the public at large.”
He encouraged Congress to modify the Clean Air Act to add that “no state may penalize, fine, or regulate the emissions of companies engaged in the production of energy or extraction or transmission of fossil fuels.”
In the letter to Bondi, Kobach said the hearing before the subcommittee contained ”dramatic disclosures” about significant financial support to “the environmental lawfare campaign” from the Chinese Communist Party. He also alleged that Energy Foundation China plays a central role in the new threats in U.S. courtrooms and state legislatures.
“It is one thing to watch left-wing law firms and non-profits use laws designed to impose extraterritorial burdens to advance their radical policy interests in the courtrooms of America to the detriment of our consumers and our economy,” he wrote, “but when such legal actions are tied to China, it likely reveals a foreign adversarial attack on American energy independence.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kris-Kobach-election-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

“Should I stay or should I go?”
That classic line sung by The Clash could be the theme song of the Mississippi brain drain.
It’s the stark choice young people are faced with when they graduate from high school or college, and it’s often fraught with tension. As much as I wanted to spread my wings when I turned 18, leaving Mississippi came with a heavy emotional toll. 
Moving away from family was only part of the guilt. I was also made to feel like I was abandoning my community. All the messages I internalized from local media and state politicians over the years blaming the brain drain for our population loss made me feel like I could only do something that would benefit myself at the expense of everyone else.
When I got to my out-of-state destination — an elite urban university with a reputation for producing public servants — there were only three other students from Mississippi in the entire undergraduate program. Some high schools from the Northeast and California sent more students in a single year, and none of them seemed to feel bad about it. Yet I can’t tell you how many former Mississippians I’ve met in other states — not necessarily internationally, just across the country — who call ourselves expats, displaced, itinerant, even prodigal.

What if it didn’t have to be that way? We’ve created a false dichotomy with the “stay or go” debate when those aren’t the only paths. Ironically, giving young Mississippians just two options for their future fuels the vicious cycle of the brain drain.
The truth is, we could go a long way toward reversing our fate by welcoming home the native Mississippians who’ve spent time away. 
Mississippi’s biggest export isn’t catfish or chicken or lumber. It’s talent.
Going out of state, for any amount of time, is an opportunity to learn new things and expand professional networks. We should encourage Mississippians to pursue their dreams and then bring back the experience they’ve gained.
I finally had that epiphany when I decided to move back in my mid-30s. It wasn’t an overnight decision, but after about three years of hemming and hawing, I finally pulled the trigger on my 34th birthday in January 2020.
I moved back with one thing in mind: to be part of reversing the brain drain. I ultimately took a six-figure pay cut in the process.
Of course, I expected to have a reversal in my earnings relocating from Washington, D.C., with the highest median income nationally, to Mississippi at the other end of the table. But what surprised me wasn’t that jobs would pay less, but that there were so few jobs that could use someone with a master’s degree in business. I had work experience at a Fortune 500 technology company, but the jobs in tech in Mississippi were at call centers.
Business school provided me with one ace up my sleeve: an interest in entrepreneurship. With the low cost of living that Mississippi so prominently advertises, I made the ultimate gamble and opened a small business. I knew I was taking a big risk, but I wasn’t prepared for how hard it would be to sustain a brick-and-mortar which depends on the economic health and social infrastructure of a rural community. I’m only still hanging in there because I’ve been able to raise funding from out of state.
Now that I’m getting older and my fellow elder millennials are starting to think about coming home to raise their families or care for aging parents, I believe there is a real opportunity for Mississippi to welcome its prodigal sons and daughters home. Yet this would only be tougher if I had more personally at stake. When I uprooted, it was just me and my dog. But for those who are married and have kids, who have different racial backgrounds, and who are gay, it’s a much more complicated decision.
Do you move to Mississippi if you’re worried your spouse can’t get a job as good as yours?
Or do you move to Mississippi if you are concerned about the quality of the schools your children would attend; the local public university will get shut down by the state Legislature; that there is no bookstore or movie theater or music venue to give you something to do on the weekends; the quality of the drinking water; the quality of medical care in an emergency because rural hospitals have closed down?
Or what if you are concerned that you might be discriminated against looking for an apartment to rent, or ostracized socially, or physically threatened because of who you are?
These problems are solvable. The only problem is if we have the political will to solve them.
Here’s the funny thing: These concerns aren’t all that different from what anyone would care about when deciding where they want to live. We don’t have to shame people into never leaving or put golden handcuffs on them to make a deal to stay or devise a crazy scheme to poach people. We just need to invest in our own well-being.
I’ve made the best friends of my life since returning to Mississippi, and I’ve seen them leave one by one as it became impossible for them to stay because they could make a better living somewhere else. In the end, it’s that simple.
The more that Mississippi does to welcome back expats, the more native Mississippians will want to stay, and the more it will attract new first-time residents, too. We just have to build a Mississippi that will be better tomorrow than it was yesterday.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)As Republicans in the General Assembly geared up to override several of his vetoes Tuesday, Governor Josh Stein made a plea: stay in town and pass a budget.
Speaking to reporters alongside public servants and North Carolina residents impacted by funding shortfalls, Stein urged lawmakers to enact a “budget that invests in the people of North Carolina,” with a focus on increasing pay for teachers and law enforcement officers, expanding the Department of Motor Vehicles to improve efficiency, and funding rebates to retain expanded Medicaid coverage amid cuts at the federal level.
“It is past time for this General Assembly to pass a budget that puts the people of North Carolina first,” Stein said, noting that the state’s budget deadline was June 30. “They need to pass a sound budget to do what the people of North Carolina sent us here to do: set our state up for success.”
Soon after the conclusion of the Governor’s press conference, Raleigh’s News & Observer reported that House and Senate Republican leaders had reached an agreement on a new budget proposal and would be unveiling it later today.
Teachers, law enforcement officers plead for help 
Among those who joined Stein to advocate on behalf of his budget request were 2025 North Carolina Teacher of the Year Rachel Candaso and Captain Kimberly Lane of the Durham Sheriff’s Office, as well as residents who advocated for greater funding for Medicaid and the DMV.
Candaso said she has always had to work a “side job” during her time as a teacher and that other educators she has spoken to have told her that without a raise, they will be unable to remain in the profession as cost of living continues to outpace teacher salaries.
“This is not just about numbers on a page. It’s about whether we truly value the people shaping North Carolina’s future. Whether we believe every child, whether they are in Swain County or at Parker’s Island in our eastern side of the state, deserve a fully supported high-quality educator,” Candaso said. “Pass a budget that honors our work, invest in our teachers, invest in our 1.5 million students, invest in North Carolina’s future.”
Stein said his budget proposal would raise starting teacher pay to the highest in the Southeast, reinstate Master’s pay, and provide a school-supply stipend. He noted that currently, North Carolina teachers pay the second most in the country out of their own pockets for school supplies, and that starting pay is lower than every neighboring state.

“When we do not pay our teachers, when we do not respect our teachers, when we make the teachers pay for the students’ school supplies out of their already low earnings, we make the teaching profession less appealing to our best and brightest,” he said.
Lane, the sheriff’s office captain, said law enforcement agencies across the state are understaffed, which leads to more officers wanting to leave and further worsening the staffing shortage. In her own agency, she said two highly qualified deputies left in part due to insufficient income, a brain drain she said compromises the efficacy of law enforcement and the safety of North Carolinians.
“My agency has worked tirelessly to recruit and bring in qualified individuals that want to put their life on the line to serve their community,” she said. “Yet our efforts are in vain as retirements and natural attrition create vacancies that cannot be filled at the same rate as which they occur.”
Electric bills, DMV delays, health care access
Stein criticized legislators for prioritizing veto overrides over getting a budget done to address the needs of North Carolinians, singling out a bill allowing Duke Energy to raise rates that he said will only worsen the cost-of-living crisis.
“Instead of taking action on all of these important issues that will make a real difference in people’s lives, the General Assembly is in town today to act on a number of veto overrides, including one that will raise folks’ power bills precisely when people are struggling with already high bills,” Stein said. “The legislation could increase residential power bills by $23 billion over the next 25 years.”
Milltrene Newell, a resident of Louisburg who lives on a fixed income, said her electric bill has shot up from about $250 a month in May to $765 in the most recent bill.

“It is devastating for me, and that’s why I’m here today, because people on a fixed income cannot pay these expensive electric bills,” she said. “The last thing we can afford is for the General Assembly to pass this bill that is going to skyrocket the costs in the future.”
Also speaking were Sarah Morgan, a Durham resident who recounted visiting the DMV six different times trying to update to a Real ID due to inadequate staffing, and Joanna Parker, a Garner resident who described how Medicaid expansion changed her life, allowing her to receive treatment for degenerative disc disease and spotting a pre-cancerous mass she would not have caught otherwise.
“Some days, the pain was debilitating, but out of pocket expenses for physical therapy and doctor’s visits were not manageable,” Parker said. “Then, in December 2023, I was one of more than 270,000 people in North Carolina to automatically be enrolled in Medicaid expansion and suddenly, my world changed. I was able to go to the doctor regularly, go to physical therapy appointments, and get the necessary X-rays and receive medications that allowed me to return to work full-time.”
Stein called on Republicans to do the work to protect Medicaid expansion in the wake of federal cuts that, due to a state trigger law, are expected to force the program’s rollback if no action is taken. He said that 900,000 North Carolinians are at risk of losing health insurance, including both residents covered under expansion as well as many under the traditional Medicaid program.
“Our entire Medicaid expansion program is at risk if the state legislature does not pass a fix to pay for new administratively burdensome work requirements,” Stein said. “Passing Medicaid expansion into law was a bipartisan victory for North Carolina. Saving it must be as well.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7293118-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

That was the consensus from six school association heads and administrators in a roundtable news conference hosted Tuesday by the Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity.
The group touched on the real-time impact to Michigan schools while they wait for a budget deal between the state’s House, Senate and governor’s office. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That deal is a long way out, however, due to a breakdown in negotiations between the three parties, particularly the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-led Senate.
Lawmakers blew past the state’s July 1 deadline for a budget deal, and at present the House has only passed an education spending plan but not a full budget funding the whole of Michigan government. Conversely, the Senate has passed a full budget but has not yet delivered a road funding plan. 
Meanwhile, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are both currently collaborating on a road funding plan. 
Either way, Peter Spadafore, executive director of the Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity, said the current morass was a manufactured crisis.
“We are now four weeks past the statutory deadline to deliver a budget to Governor Whitmer, and every day that ticks by only makes the situation worse,” Spadafore said. “The Legislature has the resources and the authority to get this done, but they’ve chosen not to. It’s time to pass a budget that is sustainable, significant, and puts the needs of our most vulnerable students first.”

Tina Kerr, the executive director for the Michigan Association of Superintendents & Administrators, said her association’s 600-plus members are already confronting the possibility of layoffs and reductions in school services due to the conflict between the House and Senate.
“Public schools began their fiscal year on July 1. They were forced to build budgets without knowing what they’d receive from the state,” Kerr said. “That’s unacceptable and it’s illegal. We’re urging the Legislature and the governor to do their job and finalize a responsible school aid budget immediately.”
Kerr added that the state is not in a recession, nor is it lacking resources, and that the budget delay has nothing to do with school funding.
“It’s being held up by unrelated issues at the expense of our kids,” Kerr said.
Public school board officials are required by law to pass balanced budgets by June 30, whether the state has given them any guidance or not, said Kimberly May, board president of Wayne-Westland Community Schools.
“We do our jobs. Our lawmakers should be held to the same standard,” May said. “By missing their deadline, they’ve violated the law and created confusion that directly impacts how we fund classrooms, programs, and staffing. This isn’t just a breakdown in process, this has real consequences for kids.”
May said the state’s continued delay is only compounded by further uncertainty at the federal level given the amount of funding that has been withheld or redirected by the U.S. Department of Education under Republican President Donald Trump.
“These problems weren’t created by school districts, they’re the result of inaction in Lansing and Washington,” May said.
Others also called the stalemate a manufactured political crisis, including Piper Bognar, superintendent of Van Dyke Public Schools. She said the current situation is taking a toll on under-resourced districts like hers, which is planning to offer fewer resources to students.
“Our budgets were legally approved by June 30, based on current per-pupil funding, but that doesn’t cover the many categorical grants, like 31AA, that support student mental health and school safety,” Bognar said. “Whether or not we can afford School Resource Officers depends on that funding that’s being withheld.”
Bognar said the Legislature – and particularly the House in its rhetoric focusing on roads – was putting “concrete over our kids” and prioritizing roads over education.
“But public education was never meant to be a bargaining chip, it’s supposed to be the great equalizer,” Bognar said. “I serve students who are first-generation college hopefuls, students like me. They succeed because of what we invest in them. And when we delay or underfund schools, we deny them the tools to succeed.”
Wendy Zdeb, executive director of the Michigan Association of Secondary School Principals, said that school leaders are being asked to make academic, staffing and program decisions without knowing what kind of funding they’ll receive in the next school year.
“We’ve built schedules, hired staff, planned course offerings and interventions,” Zdeb said. “Now we’re asking: Will we have to cancel classes? Increase class sizes? Cut mental health supports, AP courses, or CTE programs?”
Without a budget that both hits the mark for schools and is delivered on time, those choices could be heartbreaking, and could result in a loss of opportunity for Michigan students trying to get ahead in their studies, said JoLynn Clark, principal of Frankenmuth High School.
“The state must pass a budget that increases the per-pupil foundation and includes weighted funding for high-need students,” Clark added.
The group was asked about Hall’s focus on roads and removing the sales tax on fuel to pay for them, which would in turn alter the sales tax structure for the state’s school aid fund.
Spadafore said that discussion has been going on for years and before Hall stepped into the speaker’s office. He said it was “a cute turn of phrase to say that every penny at the pump should go to the roads,” but that’s not how Michigan’s sales tax works. 
“We’ve had that discussion, and it usually fizzled off quite quickly,” Spadafore said. “The difference with the last plan was that it did earmark replacement revenue to accommodate that switch, so we didn’t see that as a choice at the time.” 
Now, the discussion includes more and more dollars coming out of the school aid fund to pay for higher education. To remove the sales tax on fuel to pay for roads, or to talk about paying for other non-K-12 related functions, Spadafore said policymakers in Lansing have set up a false choice between roads and students.
That’s why the group is attempting to draw a line in the sand, demanding that the Legislature back away from that plan and to just get the job done.
“Get our budget done right, and then figure out what’s left to cover up the other resources that are necessary,” Spadafore said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1000067998-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-29 15:22:38.240314

REHOBOTH BEACH – Three Sussex County nonprofits received a significant boost this week from a newly established charitable foundation affiliated with the Rehoboth Beach Country Club (RBCC).
The 1925 Eagle Foundation, launched in honor of RBCC’s 100th anniversary, awarded its first round of grants on Friday, July 25.
Each organization — the Rehoboth Beach Volunteer Fire Company, Cape Henlopen Food Basket, and the Community Resource Center — received $7,500.
The grants reflect the foundation’s core giving priorities: supporting first responders, combating food insecurity, and aiding at-risk individuals.

“This money is a big boost to our ability to help the homeless who are vulnerable and need assistance,” said Nancy Alexander, director of the community resource center.
Leslie Kulick, treasurer of the Rehoboth Beach Volunteer Fire Company, said the funds would go toward purchasing updated hydraulic rescue tools, such as the “Jaws of Life.”
In addition to community grants, the foundation also supports RBCC employees — known as the “Talon Tribe” — through scholarships and emergency aid.
On Friday, the foundation awarded a $10,000 scholarship to a Talon Tribe member planning to attend Delaware State University, and a $5,000 emergency grant to another employee facing financial hardship.
“Supported by the generosity of the RBCC members, the foundation is helping our greater community,” said Scott Talbott, president of the 1925 Eagle Foundation. “We are excited to make a difference to Talon Tribe members and these three important local organizations.”
RBCC President Sharon Covington added that the foundation reflects the club’s century-long commitment to service.

After UVA president’s exit, Dems say they want to prevent further politicization of higher education

The case stemmed from eight of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointees continuing to serve on three university boards after the Virginia Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected them. Democratic lawmakers said it represented a break from state law and reflected a pattern of politicizing Virginia’s institutions of higher learning. 
Simultaneously, the governing boards at the three institutions are using their authority to remove and consider new school leadership amid pushback by Democrats and federal investigations into DEI practices at GMU. The case comes weeks after UVA’s president resigned after President Donald Trump’s administration pressured the school to end its DEI efforts.
Amid a court battle over appointments, UVA begins president search despite Democrats’ opposition

The court found that the lawsuit, brought by nine Democratic Senators including Senate President Pro Tempore L. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and Committee Chair Aaron Rouse, Virginia Beach, can proceed. Circuit Court judge Jonathan D. Frieden opined that the Senate committee’s rejection of the appointees served as a signal that the legislature wasn’t willing to confirm the new additions to the boards. Frieden issued his opinion Tuesday morning, following a two-hour hearing on Friday. 
“Because confirmation of a gubernatorial appointee requires the majority vote of a quorum of each chamber of the General Assembly, the action of the Senate committee manifested the General Assembly’s ‘positive unwillingness’ to make the requested confirmations and constituted a refusal to confirm under the Constitution of Virginia,” wrote Frieden. “Accordingly, the Constitution of Virginia required the rejected appointees to immediately cease their participation on their respective boards. They have not done so.”
The court affirmed that, following the legal advice of Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, the rectors of the institutions have continued to recognize the rejected appointees as members of their respective governing boards and intend to continue doing so. 
“Defendants’ actions, past, present, and promised, demonstrate plaintiffs’ injury, which is particularized, distinct, traceable to defendants’ actions, and redressable by the court,” Frieden wrote. “Therefore, plaintiffs have standing to pursue their claims.”
Frieden determined that the case is not a “political question” that courts should avoid. The main issue is interpreting what the Virginia Constitution and law means. Additionally, he wrote that the senators have the right to sue, as they have a direct stake in the outcome and have suffered “substantial” harm, considering their votes were nullified.
Lucas said in a statement on Tuesday that the “Trump-Youngkin administration” failed in an attempt to “break the law” to force university leaders to submit to their ideas.
“The Code of Virginia makes it crystal clear that appointees to Virginia’s public colleges and universities are under the constitutional authority of the General Assembly. Therefore, we are prepared to fight them every step of the way because the stakes are too high for students across the commonwealth,” Lucas said. “This isn’t just about who sits on a board. It’s about whether the future of Virginia’s colleges and universities will be guided by educators and experts, or hijacked by Trump, Youngkin, and their MAGA allies.”
Rouse added that the court affirmed what Democrats have maintained throughout the process, that the Senate has the constitutional authority to confirm or reject board nominees and it cannot be bypassed.
“The ruling is a victory for the rule of law and the people of Virginia,” Rouse said in a statement. “We will use every tool available to fight back against the attacks on our university system. We will continue to stand up for transparency, accountability, and the democratic process for Virginia, students, educators, and families.”

The defendants are likely to request that the preliminary injunction be suspended, with a judge’s decision expected by Friday morning.
“Although we are disappointed in the ruling, we were prepared for this possibility,” said Shaun Kennedy, a spokesman for the Virginia Attorney General’s Office, to the Associated Press.  “This case is straightforward.  The Constitution is clear that it is the General Assembly, not a fraction of a Senate Committee, that is authorized to act.  We will quickly file an appeal with the Supreme Court of Virginia and are confident in our position.”

Vote Save America is partnering with Elevate PAC (which is affiliated with Elevate Campaign strategies, a Utah-based political consulting firm) to “actively recruit candidates” for the Utah Legislature ahead of the 2026 elections, according to a news release issued Tuesday.

“Backed by an initial $20,000 investment from Vote Save America, Elevate PAC is already recruiting candidates in key swing districts who are ready to bring new energy and leadership to the state Legislature,” the announcement said. 
The “targeted” legislative districts include eight seats in the House and two in the Senate, both of which have been dominated by Republicans for decades. All but one district include areas concentrated in Salt Lake County, Utah’s most populated county. They include:

House District 10, currently held by Rep. Jill Koford, R-Ogden
House District 26, currently held by Rep. Matt MacPherson, R-West Valley City
House District 27, currently held by Rep. Anthony Loubet, R-Kearns
House District 36, currently held by Rep. Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville
House District 39, currently held by Rep. Ken Ivory, R-West Jordan
House District 42, currently held by Rep. Clinton Okerlund, R-Sandy
House District 43, currently held by Rep. Steve Eliason, R-Sandy
House District 44, currently held by Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan
Senate District 18, currently held by Sen. Dan McCay, R-Riverton
Senate District 19, currently held by Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Draper

Vote Save America is the political advocacy arm of Crooked Media, a media company founded by Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor, who were all aides to former President Barack Obama, according to Influence Watch. The company hosts podcasts including Pod Save America and Lovett or Leave It, and encourages listeners to support progressive policies and vote for Democratic candidates. 
The national group is “betting on Utah’s shifting political landscape,” Tuesday’s news release said. “Long considered safely Republican, Utah is showing signs of becoming competitive in the coming years.” 
Utah during the 2024 presidential election remained solidly red. About 59.4% voted for President Donald Trump and 37.8% voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to election results. 
Utah’s 2024 election is certified, capping off a ‘status quo’ year for Republican dominance

Democrats have a stronghold in Utah’s capital of Salt Lake City and some areas including in Salt Lake County, but they have struggled to gain traction in other parts of the state. 
“Utah is uniquely positioned for change,” Shaniqua McClendon, vice president of politics for Crooked Media, said in a prepared statement. “It’s the youngest state in the country, one of the fastest-growing, and the most college-educated red state. No state in the nation has moved further to the left over the past 20 years than Utah. There’s an independent streak here that national politics has ignored for too long.”
Gabi Finlayson, principal at Elevate PAC, said the partnership with Vote Save America “gives us the resources and reach to go find the people who’ve been shut out or ignored — people with real stakes in their communities, not just the usual insiders.”
“This initial $20,000 is going directly toward identifying and vetting potential candidates,” Finlayson said. “We’re grateful to have a national partner that sees Utah the way we do: a real opportunity to build something different, right now. If you’ve never run for office before, if you’ve felt written off or overlooked, this is your chance.”
Utah Republican Party Chairman Rob Axson did not immediately return a request for comment about the group’s targeting of legislative seats currently controlled by Republicans.

(Stock photo by Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)Parents trying to overturn a Washington law protecting runaway transgender youth have hit another roadblock in federal court.
A three-judge appeals court panel on Friday unanimously dismissed a constitutional challenge to the 2023 statute, which allows operators of emergency shelters to notify state authorities, rather than parents, when children seek refuge as they pursue gender-affirming care and support services.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco upheld a lower court ruling that concluded those challenging the law lacked legal standing to sue because they could not prove they suffered actual or imminent harm from the statute. The plaintiffs who brought the case included several parents whose teenage children exhibited signs of gender dysphoria, but were not runaways, and two nonprofits that oppose gender-affirming care for children.
In a statement, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown’s office said, “We are pleased that the court saw through this politicized attempt to create a case where none existed.”
America First Legal Foundation, counsel for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The conservative legal organization was founded by Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for President Donald Trump.
State law calls for parents to be notified within 72 hours of their child’s arrival at an emergency shelter unless there are “compelling reasons” not to do so. If there are signs of abuse or neglect, for example, shelter staff are to inform the state Department of Children, Youth, and Families, which would take the lead on reaching out to parents.
The court fight is over Senate Bill 5599, which expanded the list of compelling reasons to cover situations when a young person feels they could be subject to abuse or neglect because they are pursuing gender-affirming care or reproductive health services. The law’s passage incensed conservatives, who said it was an attack on parental rights.
America First Legal Foundation sued in August 2023, days after opponents of the law failed to gather enough signatures to get a referendum on the ballot.
The lawsuit argued the statute “deprives certain parents — but not all parents — of their fundamental right under the U.S. Constitution to direct the care and upbringing of their children, as well as their rights to the free exercise of religion, due process, free speech, and equal protection.”
‘Radical transgenderism’
Miller, in a statement issued at the time the suit was filed, said his group was “leading the courtroom charge against radical transgenderism and the sexual exploitation of our children by militant gender activists.” He added: “No state action more frighteningly illustrates the threat to our children than this law.”
International Partners for Ethical Care Inc. and Advocates Protecting Children joined the parents as plaintiffs.
After the state responded that the plaintiffs lacked standing, America First Legal amended its complaint to broaden the original challenge. That didn’t work.
In May 2024, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Bryan dismissed the suit, citing the plaintiffs’ lack of standing.

The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.
Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
 ‘Not a bumper sticker bill’

The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”

In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
 Democrats ‘fight back’

This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.

In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

Joe Nicola laughs during his introduction to the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).An ethics complaint alleging a GOP state senator from Grain Valley was using his church as a political action committee has been formally dismissed. 
The Missouri Ethics Commission determined the allegations against New Covenant Ministries and state Sen. Joe Nicola were unfounded, dismissing them at a meeting earlier this month. 
Brad Ketcher, a Democrat attorney from St. Louis who filed the complaint, said he was “disappointed in the outcome, but respect the commission’s decision.”
In an email to The Independent, Nicola said he appreciated the commission’s “thorough review” which found no violation had occurred. 
“I take seriously my responsibility to follow both the letter and the spirit of the law,” Nicola said, “and I’m grateful this matter has been resolved appropriately.”
The complaint alleged the church, where Nicola serves as president and pastor, should have registered as a political action committee because it raised money to boost Nicola’s campaign for state Senate last year. 
The church donated to Truth and Light PAC, which was established to support Nicola’s candidacy. The PAC reported contributions received from New Covenant Ministries rather than from the individual contributors. 
The complaint alleged that in doing so, New Covenant Ministries attempted to conceal the source of the contributors. Finally, the complaint alleged if contributions were accepted at church in the collection plate it is likely there were also violations of cash contribution statutes.
Nicola told The Independent earlier this year that Ketcher’s complaint was “ridiculous.”
“My church made donations to a PAC,” Nicola said, but added he doesn’t believe it was a violation of campaign finance law because his church isn’t a registered nonprofit.
The commission seemed to agree. 
“The investigation found that New Covenant Ministries did not accept contributions,” the ethics commission wrote in its ruling. “Rather, it accepted donations, which became the church’s personal funds, and the church’s financial board then decided how that money would be spent.”
There was no proof, the commission determined, that donations were earmarked to support Nicola or that the donations were given after solicitations to support his campaign. 
“Because New Covenant Ministries is not a committee, it had no obligation to register with the (Missouri Ethics Commission) or disclose the source of its donations,” the ruling stated. 
Ketcher’s complaint was originally dismissed in April because the commission was unable to meet due to the lack of a quorum. Gov. Mike Kehoe had not filled open seats on the board, leaving it unable to take action on any complaints.
He refiled the complaint soon after, and this month the governor finally filled enough seats for the commission to convene.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010825_nicola1-1024x659.jpg,,,2025-07-29 11:53:32.748721

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.
The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Lowery announced his resignation in a message sent Tuesday morning to university and government officials. His departure will take effect Oct. 10.
“After considerable thought, contemplation, and prayer, I have decided to step away from my role as Commissioner for Higher Education,” Lowery wrote in the email obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “Serving students has been the highest honor of my professional career, and one that has been humbling and blessed.”
CHE officials did not immediately reply to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment.











Serving students has been the highest honor of my professional career, and one that has been humbling and blessed.


– Indiana Higher Education Commissioner Chris Lowery


Lowery, who previously held leadership roles at Ivy Tech Community College and in the private sector, was appointed to the state’s top higher education post in 2022.
He cited a “health scare” earlier this year that prompted his decision to step down.
“Everything is ok, but for a brief period I was left unsure and deeply reflective,” Lowery wrote. “Again, considerable thought, contemplation, and prayer went into this decision.”
During his tenure, Lowery spearheaded multiple policy overhauls, including a revamped higher education funding formula, a tuition freeze at public colleges, and efforts to simplify student aid access and boost completion rates.
He noted, too, that Indiana’s college completion rates and ranking have improved, up from 14th in the nation to 9th.
Indiana higher ed board updates degree review process after hundreds of programs cut, merged

Even so, Indiana’s overall college-going rate has fallen in recent years. State data released earlier this month showed just 51.7% of the state’s 2023 high school graduates enrolled in college, a slight drop from the prior year and far below the state’s peak of 65% a decade ago.
Still, Lowery pointed to improvements in several key areas. He emphasized that the number of students enrolling annually in the state’s 21st Century Scholars program has grown from fewer than 20,000 to about 50,000 in three years. That is partially due to a move to automatic enrollment.
Filing rates for Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, have jumped, as well — boosting Indiana’s rank from 39th in the nation to 15th.
Also under his leadership, Indiana became the first state to require a regular cycle of review for all of its public institutions’ degree programs. So far, more than 400 degree offerings have been eliminated, suspended or merged.
Lowery additionally highlighted that, for the first time, all public institutions in the state have adopted the commission’s recommendation to freeze tuition and fees for two years.
He said he plans to support his wife Jerilyn’s new writing and publishing venture while also “feed(ing) my own longtime desire to write and publish works of fiction and nonfiction.”
Lowery said he would continue to advocate for improved postsecondary attainment in Indiana, which he called “the decisive differentiator” for economic and social prosperity in the state.
“Hope grows in Indiana,” he said. “Please continue to expect the same from me, just from a different place.”
The 14-person commission will conduct a search and select a replacement.

These organizations are now focusing more on expanding community-based crowdfunding and scaling up revenue-generating programs to address anticipated financial gaps and ensure continued support for refugees.
City of Refuge, a Columbia-based nonprofit that provides services for refugees resettled in mid-Missouri, was notified that 40% of its federal and state funding might dry up by October 2026.

Jackson Efuta, a former refugee and now a staff member at City of Refuge, said witnessing the ongoing funding cuts is deeply painful.
“I have personally experienced how vital these resources are during the most vulnerable time in a person’s life, when they are trying to adjust, heal and survive in a completely new environment,” Efuta said. “It is life-changing, providing emotional, practical and community based help that gives individuals the chance to thrive, not just survive.”
Garrett Rucinski, director of engagement at City of Refuge, said the organization is making plans in case its funding dries up.
“We already have a plan now,” Rucinski said. “It’s to grow the revenue producers, grow the monthly donors.”
Hilary Cohen Singer, executive director at Jewish Vocational Service of Kansas City, said it’s hard to determine a specific number of funds lost, as some programs have been discontinued permanently, others temporarily paused and some funding has fluctuated between being frozen and unfrozen.
“We are increasingly looking to our local community to help provide the vital services for refugees and immigrants to help them integrate into the community,” Cohen Singer said. “We are certainly affected in significant ways by the loss of federal funding.”
David Gonzalez, vice president of development at the International Institute of St. Louis, thinks the future for these service providers is going to be less reliant on government funding, and that is the direction his organization is moving in.
The Missouri Office of Refugee Administration reported 3,272 refugee arrivals in Missouri during the 2024 fiscal year, which extended from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 30, 2024 — the highest number in the past eight years. According to the American Immigration Council, the total number of refugees in Missouri is estimated to be around 24,600.
 Expanding revenue-generating services

City of Refuge launched a campaign to recruit 1,000 donors contributing $50 per month. According to Rucinski, it has reached 20% of that goal within just a couple of months.
The organization is also focusing on its three revenue-generating initiatives — City Boutique, City Cuisine and City Preschool. City Boutique is a thrift shop that sells goods from local donors and refugee artisans; City Cuisine operates a food truck and provides catering services; and the preschool program supports young children’s social and language development.
Together, these initiatives help fund the larger organization, with revenue from the boutique funding 15% of the total annual budget, Rucinski said.
“We are knocking on every door possible, asking for monthly gifts, asking for end-of-year gifts. That’s what every nonprofit is doing right now,” Rucinski said. “We have the benefit of having those three revenue generators, and those revenue generators are going to help us.”
Amid news of future funding cuts, an unexpected opportunity arose for City of Refuge — the building next to its location was listed for sale. The organization purchased it using previously awarded American Rescue Plan Act funds to expand on its services.
“When the building came up, we realized that we could put down the down payment,” Rucinski said. “With tenants still in the building next door, we can continue to operate as we were, while affording the building next door to us, so it is self-sustaining.”
City of Refuge is now planning to use the remaining space in that new building for youth programming and a commercial kitchen, which it hopes will generate additional revenue for the organization, Rucinski said.
“If we keep getting more monthly donors and end-of-year donors, if we keep getting more visitors to the Boutique, Cuisine and people attending our preschool, more sponsors and we continue on the pace that we are at, I feel very positive about October 2026,” Rucinski said.
 Leaning on community support

Jewish Vocational Service of Kansas City continues to support refugees despite the ongoing challenges caused by the federal funding cuts. The organization has adapted by reducing staff and expanding its search for alternative funding sources.
Katie Norman, communication manager at JVS, said that the organization supports approximately 7,500 refugees and immigrants each year, with community integration, health and education.
“We do receive quite a bit of funding from the federal government, so we have been impacted by the cuts and freezes to federal funds,” Norman said. “But we also receive funding from private foundations and the state as well.”
Due to federal funding cuts, JVS has already reduced its services and is now seeking and has received new funding to continue much of its work, Cohen Singer said.
“We did have to make staff reductions, and so we have done that,” Cohen Singer said. “We anticipate being able to continue with our operations at the size and scale that we are certainly into next fiscal year, and that is probably as far as we are able to plan for.”
Agencies like JVS have traditionally been closely involved in the initial resettlement period of refugees. That program has now stopped, and there are no new arrivals associated with it. Following that, there is no funding available for refugee resettlement, said Cohen Singer.
“But that doesn’t mean that our work stops, because the work that we do provides support to people who have been here one year, but also three years or five years or 10 years, depending on what their needs are,” she said.
According to Cohen Singer, the organization now reaches the local community, individuals, foundations, and state and local governments that have programs to support people’s wellbeing, even if the funding is not specifically for refugees and immigrants.
“The people that we serve can benefit from funding that is targeted towards employment or education or youth services or mental health, or any number of things,” Cohen Singer said. “So we are talking to folks that provide funding in all of those areas so that we can bring additional resources into the organization.”
 Less reliance on government funding

The International Institute of St. Louis, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping refugees, has been forced to make staff reductions and a renewed push for community and private-sector support to adapt to the federal funding cuts.
The organization has been a government contractor since the 70s, working to safely and legally bring refugees to the area and support them by providing housing, education and employment. Last year, the organization served over 3,500 individuals. However, since January, things have been tough due to a roughly $500,000 funding cut.
Gonzalez said that even when federal funding was frozen, the organization still had an agreement with the federal government to bring refugees to the St. Louis region and provide support.
“We immediately found a shortfall of about half a million dollars that we had to come up with,” Gonzalez said. “This money would be used for things like housing.”
To continue that support, the International Institute of St. Louis launched a campaign in February called Keeping Our Promise, aiming to raise $500,000. The organization also made workforce reductions in areas that didn’t have much direct client access, Gonzalez said.
“We had about 125 people here locally, and we had to cut about 60% of those,” Gonzalez said. “So we were down to under 60 staff in February and March.”
Gonzalez said the organization has now been able to bring some staff back, bringing the current team size to around 70 to 75, with some community support.
The annual budget of the International Institute of St. Louis is roughly $24 to $25 million, with 70% to 80% of that coming from federal funding, Gonzalez said.
“That is not a long-term solution for funding, particularly when our funding is at the whims of whoever’s in the White House,” he said. “So we have looked at re-establishing or establishing alternative sources of funding.”
Gonzalez outlined three key strategies for future financing: increasing support from the corporate sector by making them understand the importance of new people in the local economy; uncovering new grant opportunities from organizations that are new but interested in the program outcomes; and engaging the broader community, which values the long-term impact of this work.
“They understood the cuts, they understood what was happening. And so we had a tremendous response to the Keeping Our Promise campaign,” Gonzalez said. “I will say now we’ve had more individual donors already, at this point, halfway through the year, than we had all of last year.”
Last year, the International Institute of St. Louis increased its non-governmental fundraising by 33%, which amounted to over a million dollars, Gonzalez said.
Urge for more support
Kindness Begins with Me supports refugee women in the greater St. Louis area, providing English lessons and driving instruction. The organization serves 225 refugees each week.
Half of its annual budget comes from federal funding through the Missouri Office of Refugee Administration, which is about $125,000.
Jessica Pachak, executive director at Kindness Begins with Me, said its funding was temporarily frozen, then came back after the freeze. But it’s still unstable.
“We are going to have to be a mixture of fundraising initiatives, which will be individual donors and then additional foundations,” Pachak said. “So in the past, we relied 50% on federal funds, and now that 50% of federal funds, potentially, is going to need to be replaced with foundation donors.”
Pachak thinks that Kindness Begins with Me is going to be able to raise most of that money but not all.
KC for Refugees, an organization that supports refugees in the Kansas City metro area, is mostly funded by donations from the community and friends. It has not received any federal funding since 2019.
Linda Zemke, president of the Board of Directors at KC for Refugees, said it is planning to expand its program in the coming days.
“We’d like to have more to be able to help the refugees with more things, maybe with rent and emergency assistance,” Zemke said. “But right now we don’t have the money for that. So that would be a good thing to be able to get donations for that, for grants for that.”
Carson Myers, interim executive director at Refuge KC, said its programs are funded 100% by donations from individuals and churches.
“We have experienced an increased bandwidth for operations and support and future planning in the midst of a time of deep need,” Myers said in an email.

(Provided by the SC Forestry Commission)COLUMBIA — Harbison State Forest reopened Tuesday, two weeks after closing so officials could track down aggressive dogs that attacked joggers.
The forest parking lot will be open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., the same hours as the forest’s office. Previously, visitors could arrive as early as sunrise.
A nearby homeowner shot and killed one of the two dogs believed to have attacked two joggers. Law enforcement officers patrolling the 2,100-acre forest have found no trace of the second dog in the forest since soon after the attacks, according to a news release.
Aggressive dog killed as closure of Harbison State Forest extends through end of week

Officials from the Forestry Commission, Department of Natural Resources and local law enforcement agencies used trail cameras, drones with heat-detecting technology and a state helicopter to search for the dogs after an attack sent Columbia attorney Winston Holliday to the hospital.
Holliday, a frequent jogger in the forest, received 17 stitches for dog bites on his arm and leg. A 19-year-old jogger also reported dogs cornering him, but he escaped uninjured.
One of the traps officials set up in the forest captured a docile stray dog, but officials have spotted no other canines running loose, according to the Forestry Commission.
Visitors to the forest should remain cautious and stay aware of their surroundings, the state Forestry Commission said.
Anyone who encounters an aggressive dog should stay calm and avoid making sudden movements or running away, since the dog is likely to chase. Instead, turn so your body isn’t directly facing the dog without losing sight of it and back away slowly until you can put a barrier between yourself and the dog, the Forestry Commission said.

(Photo illustration by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Changes to Medicaid could leave thousands of South Dakotans uninsured and impair an already fragile rural health care system, advocates worry. But a concurrent $50 billion in federal funding for rural providers nationwide over the next five years could blunt the impact on the system.
That’s a “mixed bag for South Dakota,” said Shelly Ten Napel, CEO of the Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas.
President Donald Trump signed changes into law earlier this month as part of his One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The changes to the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes aim to rid the system of fraud and waste and save the federal government $1 trillion over a decade, according to Republicans who supported the bill. The savings support tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
The nonpartisan health research organization KFF estimated 13,000 South Dakotans could lose Medicaid coverage, primarily by failing to meet new work requirements. Combined with the expected expiration of the Obama-era Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits at the end of this year, the projected number of uninsured South Dakotans rises to about 20,000, according to KFF.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

Key changes to Medicaid aside from work requirements don’t significantly affect South Dakota, state Department of Social Services officials said. The state doesn’t rely on provider taxes capped in the law, doesn’t have problems with deceased or duplicate people enrolled, they said, and uses a different type of payment model than other states. Medicaid Director Heather Petermann said South Dakotans should not “despair.”
“South Dakota is in a much different place,” Petermann said. “When people hear the news of ‘doomsday is coming,’ but it reflects the kinds of cuts that are occurring for states that use other types of models or mechanisms to pay for Medicaid than South Dakota does, that projects fear instead of informing people that there’s going to be a pathway for them.”
How work requirements will affect state government, hospitals
South Dakota had proposed its own Medicaid work requirements, but Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff said the state will withdraw those now that work requirements are included in the new federal law.
By 2027, states must require able-bodied Medicaid enrollees to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or be in school at least half-time. Exemptions include people who are pregnant or postpartum, disabled, eligible for the Indian Health Service, and recently released from incarceration, among others.
South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level. Most South Dakotans on expanded Medicaid already work or would meet the exemptions, according to Ten Napel.

“It’s unfortunate there has to be a lot of administrative work just to confirm that,” she said.
The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must release additional guidance by the end of this year, leaving a year before the work requirement implementation guideline. Althoff said he’s confident South Dakota can meet the deadline.
He’s unsure how the new requirements will affect the state’s budget, since it’ll mean an upgrade in technology and potentially more staff.  The change requires Medicaid recipients to verify their eligibility more frequently.
“That is precisely why we want to lean in to technology,” Althoff said. “Can we do twice the workload of determinations with the equivalent amount of staff?”
Althoff told lawmakers on the state’s budgeting committee this month that he is unsure “all of the federal dollars for one-time costs will meet” the state’s needs for Medicaid changes.
State officials aren’t sure how many South Dakotans will remain on Medicaid, especially because the change requires applicants to meet work requirements for four weeks prior to enrollment. As of June, 29,843 South Dakotans were enrolled in the expanded portion of the Medicaid population. There were 144,310 total Medicaid recipients in the state.

Ten Napel urged caution, suggesting the state should apply for an extension to ensure the program is set up properly before it’s implemented.
“Where work requirements have been implemented in other states, we’ve seen a lot of checking in and people having to remember to do it and get paperwork done,” Ten Napel said, “and many people just drop out of coverage either because they don’t understand the requirements or because of the complexity of other things happening in their lives.”
Tim Rave, CEO of the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, said work requirements could also take a toll on providers.
“It could take two to three years before work requirements are fully implemented,” Rave said. “From there, if it impacts us as the models say it could, I think services will be cut, or potentially locations will close. We have to see how this all rolls out and what actual impacts are.”
Funding injection in rural health could soften cuts
In a statement, representatives with Sioux Falls-based Sanford Health said the law “introduces financial pressures” for health systems.
Twenty percent of hospitals in South Dakota run in the negative margin, according to Rave.

“Obviously, every facility will do what they can to remain open,” Rave said. “It’ll just be a matter of what services they’ll be able to provide.”
Services most at risk in rural areas include maternal and women’s health, behavioral health and dental, Ten Napel said.
People who live in rural areas nationwide are more likely to have health insurance through Medicaid, which puts rural health facilities at risk of lost funding and a rise in unpaid care if patients lose coverage.
Concern about rural health led to the creation of the $50 billion rural health fund in the Big Beautiful Bill Act. South Dakota is set to receive at least $100 million a year over the next five years, as long as the state submits a “detailed rural health transformation plan.” The state could receive more, based on how the rest of the funding is distributed to states. 
“Our budget is smaller than most states, so disproportionately, we’re probably impacted for the good,” Rave said. “It certainly doesn’t have the sting it does in other states.”

According to KFF, the largest declines in federal Medicaid spending will be in states with expanded Medicaid and higher shares of rural residents. While Kentucky will be impacted the most, losing a projected $12.3 billion, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas in South Dakota over the next decade will decrease by a projected $487 million. Questions remain, according to KFF, about how the funding will be distributed among states.
The state and health providers plan to collaborate about how the funds can be used. Ten Napel said the money can be invested in training, recruitment and shoring up rural preventative and primary care access.
“How do we invest these resources so that in 10 years, we’re in a better place than we are today?” Ten Napel said. “We know investment in the front end can save money on the back end.”
But that funding alone likely won’t “fully address the broader challenges rural providers will face,” Sanford representatives said.
“We look forward to working closely with our state and federal elected officials,” the statement read, “to implement these changes in ways that protect access, support innovation and strengthen care for rural America.”

(Screenshot)Louisville has confirmed a second case of the highly contagious measles, bringing the total cases in Kentucky to 14. 
Dr. Kris Bryant, the associate medical director at the Louisville health department and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Norton Children’s Hospital, said the latest patient is “a known contact” with the city’s first case of 2025, which was reported in mid July. 
“This individual has been in quarantine since becoming aware of their exposure, and so there are no new public exposures as a result of this case,” Bryant said during a Tuesday press conference. 
The city’s latest case, which health officials confirmed Monday, is unrelated to an outbreak in central Kentucky, she said. An outbreak is defined as three or more related cases. 
Of the 14 cases across Kentucky, 13 were in unvaccinated individuals and one was in a person who only received part of the recommended vaccine series, Bryant said. 
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the two-dose measles vaccination series for children 12-15-months-old and then at 4-6-years-old. One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says, making measles extremely contagious. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. 
Measles can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death. Three people have died from measles in the United States in 2025, according to the CDC. 
Measles has made a comeback in Kentucky and beyond as routine vaccinations have declined. A school immunizations survey for the 2024-2025 school year shows that about 87% of Kentucky kindergarteners are fully vaccinated against measles, which is lower than the national average of 93%. 
“We encourage everyone to protect themselves with vaccination,” Bryant said. “If you are a parent with a child heading back to school, please make an appointment with your child’s pediatrician or primary care provider.”

People with disabilities now have greater access to Delaware’s state parks, thanks to an expanded program offering all-terrain wheelchairs at five park locations.
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) announced that Action Trackchairs, motorized off-road wheelchairs, are now available at Cape Henlopen, Lums Pond, Killens Pond, Trap Pond, and White Clay Creek state parks.
The initiative marks the first time all-terrain wheelchairs have been made available for public use in Delaware, enabling visitors with mobility impairments to explore trails, wooded areas, and attend events in park settings that were previously inaccessible.

“It was a lot of fun going on the trails, and I felt very independent,” said Dawn Worthley, a 60-year-old mother of two who has cerebral palsy. “I was never able to see the trails before. I went in October, and it was very pretty with the different colors, and I could hear the crunching of the leaves.”
Worthley has become an advocate for the program, encouraging others to take advantage of the opportunity.
A lot of people that we talked to said it was very cool,” she said, adding that she also used the Trackchair to attend the park’s outdoor concert series.
The program began in June 2024 at White Clay Creek and has since expanded with the help of funding from the Bronco Wild Fund Access Grants, the National Association of State Park Directors, and DNREC itself.
Each Action Trackchair costs around $20,000 and comes equipped with motorized treads for navigating rough terrain, headlights, a horn, and adjustable seating to handle slopes.
DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson praised the program’s impact in a video promoting accessibility.
“One of the opportunities Delaware State Parks took last year was to get a Trackchair to allow people with accessibility challenges to get out on our trails, to get out in our fields and to get out to concerts,” HE SAID. “Now in the summer of 2025 we will have the Trackchairs at four more of our parks and may be able to expand it after that.”
White Clay Creek State Park serves as a model for the initiative, where seniors from the Mary Campbell Center for adults with disabilities make regular visits to explore the Carpenter Recreation Area Trail.
This year, the park plans to open the Opossum Hill trail for use with the Trackchair.
Park staff have also embraced the program.
“The White Clay Creek staff have become connected to how lucky we are to just take a walk and how meaningful it is for our visitors,” said Laura Lee, park superintendent. “Everyone is onboard to get more people involved.”
The Trackchair program is part of a broader accessibility effort outlined in the Delaware State Parks Strategic Plan, which includes over 70 upcoming improvements.
Other initiatives include mobility mats on beach crossings, braille signage, sensory programming at the Brandywine Zoo, multilingual park signs, and new wheelchair-accessible cabins at Lums Pond.
Trackchairs are available by reservation at no cost for up to three hours.
Users are required to view a brief instructional video, and each chair includes companion controls so caregivers or family members can assist as needed.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KPSP-Track-Chair-JAU-Final.jpg,,,2025-07-29 10:56:45.743014

Time is a funny thing.
When we are young, tomorrows seem so far away, like they will never come.
Today, I think of time in multiple ways. There’s the NFL season, when I get to watch my favorite sport. There are times where I think, “Come on, let’s get this over with,” and there are moments where I think, “Where has the time gone?” But more than anything, there’s the time I’ve spent contemplating how and why I destroyed my life, her life and their lives.
Before I killed someone, I never thought about what my actions would do to so many people, and how it would affect time for others as well as myself.
On Oct. 6, 1993, I took a woman’s life and forever destroyed the dynamics of the people who relied on her and loved her — a ripple effect that has played out over years.
My devastating decision that day took precious time away from a husband and, most importantly, a child. I deprived a husband of time he assumed they would have together — to raise a family, to enjoy their lives. I deprived a child of her mother, and the years they would spend together.
I stole time from them.
A tragic death
In 1994, I was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, plus 120 months. This meant that the earliest I could be released from prison was about 30 years after my conviction.
In the beginning, I refused to think of the harm that I caused. I refused to take responsibility for what I had done. I blamed everyone but myself. I told people that I was innocent, and that I had been wrongfully convicted, and that I was a victim of the system. In this way, I was able to deny what I had done and convince myself that I would be set free. But the man in the mirror does not lie, and so I drank alcohol and played sports to try to bury and forget the pain of my actions.
At times, I wanted to die. I thought about taking my own life, but was afraid of the cost. Then, in 2000, my mother informed me that she needed a new liver. She was dying from alcohol abuse.
I thought to myself that maybe this was the reason I hadn’t killed myself yet, that this might be a way to atone for what I did, for all of the hell that I had put so many people through. I thought that if I died and gave her my liver, I just might be able to clean some of the dirt from my soul.
But, in the midst of this, her mother’s intuition read my mind. She told me I couldn’t kill myself.
“I did not give you life for you to take it away!” she told me.
My mother and I had not always seen eye to eye. We had both found disappointments in each other over some of the decisions we had made. But we did love each other, even if we were often unable to express it.
In December 2000, I lost my mother to alcoholism, something she had been fighting for years.
My true sentence
Within the prison culture, lifers tend to ink themselves with some type of tattoo that represents loss of freedom, that time itself has stopped for them. Usually a stopwatch with no hands, or an hourglass with no sand. For me, no such tattoo. Within my mind, I always heard the ticking of the watch or the sands of time. I needed to hear them, for inside my heart and soul I knew the harm that I had done, and that the consequence was me doing time.
Coming to accept the sentence I was given was a hard thing. Losing my mother, without a chance to see her before she died or the chance to ask for her forgiveness, brought home the reality of my actions. In some ways, this was my true sentence.
The ticking of the clock was my reminder of what I had done. It brought home the knowledge that I never would be able to be there for her.
For some, thinking of the length of their prison sentence drives them to try to escape that reality. In the beginning, for me, it was denial, alcohol and playing sports to help distract me from the cavern of my mind. But Father Time eventually breaks down the body, and the hooch is not always available.
I turned to my love of books to help relieve some of this pain. Books helped me to escape. I preferred to select novels where I could grow with the lead character. I love Laurell K. Hamilton and Robert Jordan, as well as J.D. Robb (a pseudonym used by Nora Roberts). Each of their main characters have given me the opportunity to live a life through them.
But my love of Minnesota sports has helped me most. I am a diehard Minnesota Vikings football fan.
Once I ratcheted up my Vikings fandom, a year was no longer January to December, but from NFL training camp to the Super Bowl, with a little stopover for the NFL draft combine and the greatest promoter of hope, the NFL draft, where college players are selected by NFL teams.
New hope
Around 2013, I started hearing rumors about the possibility of getting paroled. At first I didn’t really pay attention, because there are always rumors. To distract myself, I focused on my Vikings and fantasy football, but the rumor wouldn’t die.
Over the years, I had taken some courses on cognitive thinking improvement to help me understand some of my mistakes. I had taken them simply out of curiosity: I wanted to understand why I had killed someone. Those classes, to my surprise, were enough to get me moved into a medium-security facility before my first parole hearing 27 years into my sentence.
In June 2021, I went before the parole board and was denied. I was given three years to make more improvements for a shot at parole in 2024.
I measured that time as three Vikings seasons, three Super Bowls and three NFL drafts. Regardless of whether or not I am paroled, I know that the work I have put in to better myself will give me the tools I need to make the gift of time work for me.
(Editor’s note: His parole was again denied, and Matata remains at Stillwater Correctional Facility.)
I recently realized that I’ve stopped hearing the ticking of the clock and the sands of time. Now that I’ve acknowledged and accepted my actions and the harm I have caused, along with the time that came with it, I no longer care whether I hear those things.
As with the NFL draft, I now have hope. Hope that I could be paroled. Hope that I could possibly have a life. Hope that one day I will be in the stands at a Minnesota Vikings home game, cheering on the team that helped me get through my time.

But as his administration pares back federal rules and programs designed to protect patients from the high cost of health care, Trump risks pushing more Americans into debt, further straining family budgets already stressed by medical bills.
Millions of people are expected to lose health insurance in the coming years as a result of the tax cut legislation Trump signed this month, leaving them with fewer protections from large bills if they get sick or suffer an accident.
At the same time, significant increases in health plan premiums on state insurance marketplaces next year will likely push more Americans to either drop coverage or switch to higher-deductible plans that will require them to pay more out-of-pocket before their insurance kicks in.
Smaller changes to federal rules are poised to bump up patients’ bills, as well. New federal guidelines for covid-19 vaccines, for example, will allow health insurers to stop covering the shots for millions, so if patients want the protection, some may have to pay out-of-pocket.
The new tax cut legislation will also raise the cost of certain doctor visits, requiring copays of up to $35 for some Medicaid enrollees.
And for those who do end up in debt, there will be fewer protections. This month, the Trump administration secured permission from a federal court to roll back regulations that would have removed medical debt from consumer credit reports.
That puts Americans who cannot pay their medical bills at risk of lower credit scores, hindering their ability to get a loan or forcing them to pay higher interest rates.
“For tens of millions of Americans, balancing the budget is like walking a tightrope,” said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. “The Trump administration is just throwing them off.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond to questions about how the administration’s health care policies will affect Americans’ medical bills.
The president and his Republican congressional allies have brushed off the health care cuts, including hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid retrenchment in the mammoth tax law. “You won’t even notice it,” Trump said at the White House after the bill signing July 4. “Just waste, fraud, and abuse.”
But consumer and patient advocates around the country warn that the erosion of federal health care protections since Trump took office in January threatens to significantly undermine Americans’ financial security.
“These changes will hit our communities hard,” said Arika Sánchez, who oversees health care policy at the nonprofit New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty.
Sánchez predicted many more people the center works with will end up with medical debt. “When families get stuck with medical debt, it hurts their credit scores, makes it harder to get a car, a home, or even a job,” she said. “Medical debt wrecks people’s lives.”
For Americans with serious illnesses such as cancer, weakened federal protections from medical debt pose yet one more risk, said Elizabeth Darnall, senior director of federal advocacy at the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Action Network. “People will not seek out the treatment they need,” she said.
Trump promised a rosier future while campaigning last year, pledging to “make America affordable again” and “expand access to new Affordable Healthcare.”
Polls suggest voters were looking for relief.
About 6 in 10 adults — Democrats and Republicans — say they are worried about being able to afford health care, according to one recent survey, outpacing concerns about the cost of food or housing. And medical debt remains a widespread problem: As many as 100 million adults in the U.S. are burdened by some kind of health care debt.
Despite this, key tools that have helped prevent even more Americans from sinking into debt are now on the chopping block.
Medicaid and other government health insurance programs, in particular, have proved to be a powerful economic backstop for low-income patients and their families, said Kyle Caswell, an economist at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.
Caswell and other researchers found, for example, that Medicaid expansion made possible by the 2010 Affordable Care Act led to measurable declines in medical debt and improvements in consumers’ credit scores in states that implemented the expansion.
“We’ve seen that these programs have a meaningful impact on people’s financial well-being,” Caswell said.
Trump’s tax law — which will slash more than $1 trillion in federal health spending over the next decade, mostly through Medicaid cuts — is expected to leave 10 million more people without health coverage by 2034, according to the latest estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The tax cuts, which primarily benefit wealthy Americans, will add $3.4 trillion to U.S. deficits over a decade, the office calculated.
The number of uninsured could spike further if Trump and his congressional allies don’t renew additional federal subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans who buy health coverage on state insurance marketplaces.
This aid — enacted under former President Joe Biden — lowers insurance premiums and reduces medical bills enrollees face when they go to the doctor or the hospital. But unless congressional Republicans act, those subsidies will expire later this year, leaving many with bigger bills.
Federal debt regulations developed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Biden administration would have protected these people and others if they couldn’t pay their medical bills.
The agency issued rules in January that would have removed medical debts from consumer credit reports. That would have helped an estimated 15 million people.
But the Trump administration chose not to defend the new regulations when they were challenged in court by debt collectors and the credit bureaus, who argued the federal agency had exceeded its authority in issuing the rules. A federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump ruled that the regulation should be scrapped.

Mari-Lynn Poskin speaks with attendees at the Kansas House Democrats’ “Fight Back” event in Pittsburg, Kan., in July. Statehouse Democrats across the country are aiming to link their Republican counterparts to President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending cuts package. (Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)PITTSBURG, Kan. — Amid a summer swelter last week, more than 80 people crowded into a trendy gastropub in downtown Pittsburg, Kansas, for cold drinks and hot talk.
The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.
Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
 
‘Not a bumper sticker bill’
The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”
In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
 
Democrats ‘fight back’
This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.
In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)With the White House slow to distribute congressionally appropriated funds for the National Institutes of Health, some senators from President Donald Trump’s party, including Maine’s Susan Collins, are making appeals to his agenda in an attempt to urge follow through. 
Maine is still waiting on roughly $50 million in NIH funding, according to Collins’ office.
Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, and 13 of her Republican colleagues sent a letter to Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, last week raising concern about the slow pace of NIH funding disbursement, which was allocated for research related to cancer, cardiovascular disease, rare pediatric disorders and more.
“These vital efforts are not only necessary to Make America Healthy Again,” the senators wrote, referring to the slogan used by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “but also have a direct impact on American families, biomedical innovation, our economy, and competing with Communist China.” 
The senators went on to write that they share Vought’s “commitment to ensuring NIH funds are used responsibly and not diverted to ideological or unaccountable programs,” a nod to Trump’s vow to eliminate federal support for what the administration deems diversity, equity and inclusion programs and government waste. 
“Withholding or suspending these funds would jeopardize that trust and hinder progress on critical health challenges facing our nation,” the senators wrote. “Ultimately, this is about finding cures and seeing them through to fruition.”  
The Trump administration has suspended and cut many NIH and other federal grants this year in ambition of those goals. Some have been reinstated piece by piece following congressional pushback, including the recent unfreezing of billions in Education Department funding following bipartisan criticism. 
As of the latest available data from June 21, Maine has received about $65 million from NIH awards so far this fiscal year, which ends September 30, with most  — almost $49 million — going to Jackson Laboratory. In fiscal year 2024, Maine received nearly $125 million from NIH funds, again with most — nearly $82 million — allocated to the Bar Harbor biomedical research organization. 
Of that, almost $68 million of the NIH funds in 2024 were specifically research project grants, whereas so far based on available 2025 data the state has received just shy of $40 million in grants. 
Jackson Laboratory declined to comment on the delayed distribution and also declined this past spring to comment on Collins’ performance as a top appropriator during Trump’s second term, in light of criticism that her power is being undermined by the president’s withholding of congressionally appropriated funds. 
The pushback from Republicans regarding the slow distribution of NIH funds could preview what is now looking to be another rebuke from the president’s own party to his attempt to gut future science research funding. 
In May, the White House proposed the agency receive $27.9 billion in the next fiscal year, about $18 billion lower than fiscal 2025 levels. This would amount to a cut that is so large that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn’t been able to predict the impact using its current models. 
However, it doesn’t appear that the House or Senate bills will propose such a drastic cut based on spending blueprints released by appropriations committees. 
As members of Congress are debating the federal medical research budget, new national polling on the topic is being shared by the Republican-aligned Public Opinion Strategies, who conducted a national survey on behalf of a campaign, United for Cures, launched by the advocacy group UsAgainstAlzheimer to oppose the Trump administration’s funding cuts to health agencies and medical research. 
The opt-in online national survey of 1,000 registered voters conducted in late June, with a credibility interval of +3.53%, found that nearly two-thirds of voters oppose Trump’s proposed cut, with 62% of voters saying they would be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for the cuts.
“As we approach the midterm elections, this is something that does have the potential to be a political liability,” Jim Hobart, partner with Public Opinion Strategies, told Maine Morning Star.

(Photo: Getty Images) The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee filed a religious discrimination suit Friday against the Bartlett Board of Mayor and Aldermen for turning down plans by the Bartlett Muslim Society to build a mosque.
Nashville attorney Daniel Horwitz joined the ACLU-Tennessee in suing the city board for rejecting a special-use permit for mosque construction, even after the Bartlett Planning Commission required an extensive traffic impact study that found the building would have no adverse effect on local streets.
“This is a clear case of interference with religious freedoms cloaked in bureaucratic language,” said Stella Yarbrough, ACLU-Tennessee legal director, in a release. “The facts don’t support the permit denial, but they do reveal something deeper — an attempt to restrict a community’s religious practices based on who they are.”
Bartlett’s Planning Commission voted unanimously to recommend denying the Muslim Society’s application for a special-use permit to build the mosque on eight acres it purchased. The group wants to move out of a leased building that doesn’t have enough space to accommodate the congregation’s worship needs or those related to Ramadan, a month of fasting, prayer and reflection in the Islamic religion.
The rejection came even though the city’s planning and economic development director backed approval and the commission approved similar permit requests for Christian churches.
ACLU-Tennessee’s lawsuit says the city violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause.
“We have tried very hard to work with the city and have responded to any and all concerns raised, yet we were still denied a permit,” said Badrul Hossain, Bartlett Muslim Society board president. “Sadly, we had no choice but to file this lawsuit in order to continue practicing our faith.”
Horwitz said “targeting” one faith group through zoning without subjecting other groups to the restrictions is illegal.
Bartlett officials had not been served with the lawsuit Friday and had no comment, a spokesperson said.
The lawsuit says residents who spoke against a special-use permit for the mosque expressed animosity toward the Islamic faith. It also says Vice Mayor Jack Young, a member of the planning commission, admitted his decision to vote against mosque construction had nothing to do with traffic.
“It doesn’t matter to me about a study. I actually live through it,” Young said, according to the filing.
The Muslim Society bought 8.2 acres on Broadway Road for $167,000 to construct a 5,000-square-foot mosque with 165 parking spaces. The group also spent $36,000 on land improvements and paid $20,000 for the parking study, in addition to agreeing to reduce parking to 52 spaces, before being rejected.

(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers  from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.

“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture where officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, though most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health issues in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health issues.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would negatively affect an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers also disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that –– to provide those services,” Archbold said.

A three-month pilot program is working to tackle the century-old problem of pollution at King's Beach using ultraviolet light. The initial results have been promising, but between the high cost projected for a long-term fix and cuts to federal funding, whether the system could be permanently implemented remains to be seen.
The post Lynn, Swampscott team up[...]","THE CLEANUP of Boston Harbor is one of the great environmental success stories of recent decades, transforming one of the dirtiest harbors in the country into one of the cleanest. But a handful of beaches in Greater Boston remain heavily polluted and unsafe for swimming despite that multibillion-dollar effort. Among the worst: King’s Beach, which straddles the shorelines of Lynn and Swampscott, about 15 miles north of Boston.  
Groundwater mixed with sewage and polluted urban runoff containing animal waste, trash, and fertilizer have long contaminated the beach – often in amounts 800 times greater than safe levels.  
“We’re a city of over 100,000 people here on the Atlantic Ocean. This is our only beach, and it’s too dirty to use,” said Mayor Jared Nicholson of Lynn. “It’s absolutely unacceptable.” 
After years of inaction, there is finally a glimmer of hope for the tainted stretch of coastline. 
A three-month pilot program launched in June is tackling the pollution using ultraviolet light to kill wastewater bacteria. It’s part of a collaboration between the city of Lynn and the town of Swampscott, and the initial results have been promising. But between the high cost projected for a long-term fix and cuts to federal funding, whether the system could be permanently implemented remains to be seen. 
Poor water quality at King’s Beach is a century-old problem. Nearly 100 years ago, East Lynn and Swampscott channeled Stacey’s Brook through a culvert – carrying sewage and stormwater through a pipe that empties into the ocean at the beach. Unlike most Boston area beaches, it receives daily discharges of waste. More than two decades ago, the Lynn Water and Sewer Commission separated the sewer and stormwater systems, which reduced the contamination, but did not eliminate it. Cracked sewer pipes have exacerbated the issue.  
A temporary generator now powers a UV light unit that has been rented for the summer. A pump takes stormwater from underground, exposes it to UV light in a tank, and then discharges it into the ocean at King’s Beach. The pilot program comes with a price tag of around $800,000, a cost being shared by Swampscott and Lynn. It would take an estimated $25 million to install a permanent UV light system, according to Nicholson. 
King’s Beach is one of the dirtiest in Massachusetts and has been ranked as the worst for water quality in the Greater Boston area, according to Save the Harbor/Save the Bay’s annual report card evaluation of 15 beaches. It failed nearly half of the daily water quality tests conducted in 2023 – a record low.  
“At the height of the summer, we’ve all seen families ignoring the red flags and coming to swim because it’s the only option that they have. But clean water shouldn’t depend on your ZIP code,” US Rep. Seth Moulton said at the pilot program’s July 25 ribbon-cutting ceremony. “We know that low-income communities and communities of color are often the ones most impacted by environmental issues.”

“This is a century-old problem that we’re applying 21st century technology to,” said state Rep. Jenny Armini of Marblehead, who represents Swampscott and a section of Lynn, at Friday’s ribbon-cutting. 
Any discussion of a long-term solution won’t take place until the pilot concludes at the end of the summer and more data is gathered, but preliminary results of the pilot are encouraging, despite a few roadblocks along the way. The UV-treated water has, for the most part, measured at or below 10 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters of water, according to Lynn’s public beach sampling data. At marine beaches, the accepted level of bacteria is 104 units or fewer per 100 milliliters of water, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.  
Due to seaweed blockages that affected the UV system’s functionality, two screens had to be installed. They have to be monitored and cleaned to keep the system clear of debris that could interfere with the pumps.  
Rainfall also leads to heavy stormwater runoff that raises bacteria levels in places like King’s Beach. It also causes more trash to be swept down through stormwater drains – some of which has gotten stuck in the UV tanks. Nicholson said they are still determining under what conditions the UV system will work, considering that too much rainfall can quickly overwhelm the system and increase bacteria levels. 
Though the cleanup effort is being hailed as long overdue, it has brought its own environmental issue: A handful of residents who live on the waterfront have already complained about noise caused by the generator, which they say violates local ordinance levels. A few held signs in protest at the ribbon-cutting event, where Nicholson addressed the noise complaints.

“I want to acknowledge the impact that this has had on our neighbors, because it’s real,” Nicholson said in his speech. “We will continue to try to do everything we can to mitigate it.” 
Moulton criticized the Trump administration’s sizeable cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, adding that the very program that could have provided federal funding for the project was canceled.  
The city of Lynn had applied for the EPA’s Community Change Grants – a Biden-era program funded by the Inflation Reduction Act – to help cover the cost of the UV pilot program, as well as for both Lynn and Swampscott’s efforts to eliminate the sources of water pollution.  
After receiving assistance with their grant submission, the program was abruptly discontinued in January, which left project leaders without a status update. 
“When Washington fails to show up, when critical EPA programs are slashed and grant opportunities dry up mid application, it’s more important than ever that communities work together to leverage your expertise and wisdom and resources to make things happen,” Moulton said in his speech. 
Despite living in Lynn his entire life, state Sen. Brendan Crighton, who is 42, said he couldn’t remember ever once swimming at Kings Beach. Nicholson highlighted why the cleanup project is so important not just for residents, but also for the region.  
“We’re surrounded by towns who have multiple beaches, all of which are exclusive –  you have to be a resident, or you have to have a resident parking sticker,” Nicholson said. “This is our only beach, and it’s one of the only beaches that’s open” – accessible to all, with no parking fees.   
The waterfront is one of Lynn’s major attractions, and a clean, swimmable beach would only add to ongoing growth and revitalization efforts. 
“It’ll be a huge asset,” said Nicholson, “but most importantly, the residents of Lynn that are here now deserve this clean beach.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The former U.S. ambassador to the Arctic, Mike Sfraga, began a new job as interim chancellor of the University of Alaska Fairbanks on Monday. He replaced the outgoing chancellor of eight years, Dan White, who announced his retirement in May.
UAA President Pat Pitney named Sfraga as interim chancellor on July 18, as a search for a permanent chancellor continues. 
Sfraga has had a long career focused on the Arctic – international diplomacy, political relations, climate policy, science and research. He served briefly as the first U.S. ambassador-at-large to the Arctic, appointed by former President Joe Biden. Prior to that, he chaired the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, and founded the Polar Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. He has worked in various faculty and administrative roles in the University of Alaska system, from professor to vice chancellor. He also graduated with UAF’s first doctorate in Northern studies and geography in 1997.
“Ambassador Sfraga is a fitting choice to lead America’s Arctic University,” Pitney said in a statement released with the announcement. “Mike brings a strong record of accomplishment, international networks, and over 31 years of experience at UA to the role, and he will be an excellent leader and steady hand at the wheel as we commence a search for a permanent chancellor.” 
Sfraga’s appointment comes after the retirement of White, who served as UAF chancellor since 2017 and in several faculty and administrative roles since 1995. Sraga will lead UAF on an interim basis, while the university conducts a search for a permanent chancellor. He will not be a candidate for the permanent position, according to a university announcement. 
“Returning to UAF is both a homecoming and recommitment, and I’m grateful to President Pitney for the opportunity to serve my alma mater and its mission once more,” Sfraga said in a statement with the announcement. “UAF has long stood at the nexus of Arctic research, innovation, and leadership; a place where policy and science converge, and local knowledge informs global decisions. From its inception over a century ago, members of the Fairbanks community and communities throughout the state worked tirelessly to build a unique institution – committed to serving Alaskans and the Circumpolar North. 
“UAF is well-positioned to address the many opportunities and challenges evident in the age of a more connected and globalized Arctic. I’m honored and humbled to rejoin America’s Arctic University and contribute to its mission at a time when the Arctic matters more than ever, not just to Alaska, but to the world,” he said. 
The university is expected to announce further details on the chancellor search process, the hiring committee, and timeline by mid-August. 
The University of Alaska is also in the process of hiring a new chancellor for the University of Alaska Anchorage, after the retirement of former Gov. Sean Parnell in May. Cheryl Siemers, former director of UAA’s Kenai Peninsula College, is currently serving as interim chancellor.

Community college officials told board members that changing the formula that determines how federal funding for career and technical education (CTE) is dispersed between community colleges and school districts would lead to students having less access, with colleges possibly having to close programs that school districts could not provide alone, even with additional dollars.
“I hope that the amount to which our community colleges are already integrated into K-12 will be taken into account with some of these federal and state decisions, because we do have just such a different landscape, and it will get harder for us to serve K-12, as well as adult populations, if some of these funding sources change,” said Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields.

The Iowa State Board of Education voted in June to approve its 2025-2029 Perkins V plan, which would change the ratio of allocations to community colleges and K-12 school districts from a 53.5% and 46.5% split to a 60-40 split, with K-12 schools getting the larger share. The more even ratio will be used for funding allocations in the 2025-2026 school year, with the new rates being implemented for the rest of the plan’s timeline.
Perkins V funding comes from the Strengthening Career and Technical Education (CTE) for the 21st Century Act, and provides around $14.5 million to Iowa annually, according to the Iowa Department of Education website. These funds are distributed for use in CTE programs across the state, including career academies and other initiatives aimed at helping high school students start their career training.
The board approved this plan with the expectation of revisiting it at its December meeting, as members said during discussion they’d like to hear more information and feedback from community college and school district stakeholders before the new rates .
Shields said part of the reasoning behind the decision to change the ratio was that the shift would bring Iowa closer to national averages of the same metric, but she disagreed that the comparison would work since Iowa has much higher rates of concurrent enrollment among high school students than the rest of the country.
“While we’re open to change and looking at efficiencies and funding, always, we are operating a national model, a very efficient system, our adult literacy rates are higher than the national average, or concurrent enrollment is higher than the national average,” Shields said. “So we’re always concerned that changes in that funding mix will disrupt what is a highly successful model.”
Kyle Collins, associate vice president for academic affairs at Des Moines Area Community College, spoke during public comment at the meeting in opposition to the change and said in an interview moving dollars away from college CTE programs will negatively impact the quality of education students will receive in their career training, ultimately harming the workforce pipelines career academies and other initiatives create for local industries.
Around $400,000 of the $1.4 million DMACC usually receives in Perkins funding would instead be allocated to school districts, he said, and if that number is broken down among the 89 public, private and charter schools the college works with, each would receive an average of $4,500.
“I believe they would need many more resources to be able to do what we provide at each school district, so it would cost more for each school district to replicate what we provide their students through our academies,” Collins said in an interview.
Iowa Valley Community College District President Anne Howsare Boyens also spoke during public comment period, adding that an estimated $2 million will be allocated away from Iowa’s 15 community colleges and spread across the state’s more than 300 districts.
This change will hurt both community colleges and school districts, Howsare Boyens said, some of which don’t have high enough demand from students to offer the specialized programs if they could even afford the equipment and other costs that come with running them. Smaller community colleges who rely on Perkins funding to keep their programming maintained could also have to close their doors, eliminating opportunities for students.
“Without this Perkins funding, rural community colleges may be forced to scale back or eliminate specialized CTE programs that are costly to maintain, threatening the long term viability and responsiveness of academic offerings to our community and industry needs,” Howsare Boyens said.

With over 11,000 inland lakes, Michigan’s waterways are a central part of the state’s ecology, economy, and identity. And yet they’re also a growing source of concern. In response, state Representatives Jennifer Conlin (D–Ann Arbor Charter Township) and Noah Arbit (D–West Bloomfield) assembled a panel of environmental experts Monday to address community concerns and launch a broader conversation about lake stewardship.
The panel of experts consisted of Melissa DeSimone, executive director of the Michigan Lakes and Streams Association, the Michigan Environmental Council’s Chief Policy Officer Charlotte Jameson, and Jeff Pierce, the district supervisor for the Water Resources Division of the Department of Environment Great Lakes, and Energy.
Conlin and Arbit have formed what they’ve dubbed the “inland lake caucus” – a title originally stemming from a lighthearted rivalry over which state House district has more lakes. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Arbit explained that Monday’s forum was meant to emphasize “local lakes and local voices.”
In May 2025, Conlin was one of the twelve state representatives to sponsor House Bill 4499, a pilot program to assess the effects of PFAS on individuals and the environment. The bipartisan effort also establishes funding to support research and testing related to PFAS exposure. Conlin said she also attended the Great Lakes State Legislative Council conference in Milwaukee. 
The community forum, however, was not overly concerned with PFAS and microplastics, with comments instead focused on algae, drawdowns, boating restrictions, and dams. 
One homeowner elaborated extensively on the “green slime” that was growing in the water near her home. The expert panel explained that the substance was most likely algae. 
The growth of algal blooms is often precipitated by increased phosphorus levels in the water, as phosphorus enhances vegetation growth.
Algal blooms are nothing new for the Huron River Chain: The 2024 Annual Report found that there were high levels of phosphorus in Little Portage, Base Line, Tamarack, and Whitewood lakes. Indeed, reports from 2020 through 2024 indicate that most of the lakes in the Huron River Chain have had consistently elevated phosphorus levels over the past five years.

Noah Arbit (D-West Bloomfield); and Jeff Pierce, district supervisor of EGLE’s Water Resources Unit. | Photo by Leah Craig/Michigan Advance
The expert panel explained that there’s no quick solution for algae growth, and Pierce urged citizens to “not take this into their own hands.”
Residents were quick to point out that the heightened phosphorus levels are undoubtedly the result of lawn fertilizers. 
“All you have to do is look around in the surrounding areas around Portage Lake and the canals and so on to see the pollution and what’s going on,” said Portage Lake resident Ty Cathy. “We’re not supposed to put anything in the lake, and most people are taking good care of it.” 
Melissa DeSimone confirmed that position, noting that it’s important to limit the amount of fertilizer.
“If you’re adding phosphorus to a freshwater ecosystem, you’re going to get algal blooms, you’re going to get weed growth, you’re going to get all sorts of really concerning water quality issues,” DeSimone said.
In April 2024, Hamburg Township passed an ordinance prohibiting the use of fertilizer within 50 feet of lakes or streams. However, residents noted that some lakeshore homeowners aren’t adhering to this guideline. 
And yet, as Cathy pointed out, fertilizer trucks are a frequent sight around the lakes. 
“And for some reason, our neighbors are not saying anything to our fellow neighbors,” he added. “I wish we could get that message across, and we need a little pressure on some of these people not to fertilize.”
The other pressing issue was the drawdown date. A drawdown is the intentional lowering of a lake’s water level, conducted seasonally and mandated by local courts. Traditionally, the drawdown is slated for mid-October, though Portage Lake residents were informed that this year’s drawdown would begin on October 1.
Drawdowns are an essential aspect of lake maintenance, providing an opportunity for aquatic weed control, shoreline repairs, flood prevention, and improvements to wildlife habitats. For lakefront homeowners, drawdowns mean limited lake access. 
The primary issue is the nature of October itself. Some residents protested the earlier drawdown, citing the past few years as being unseasonably warm. Others pointed to previous Octobers when the lakes froze over. In short, determining the right time to lower the water is complicated by Michigan’s unpredictable climate.
Additionally, as DeSimone emphasized, the drawdown date is not mandated by environmental organizations, state environmental officials or the state Legislature, but rather by local courts. 
Many lakeshore homeowners are resistant to change, often operating under the belief that if something has worked in the past, there’s no reason to alter it. However, as the Michigan Environmental Council’s Jameson outlined, the environment itself is changing. 
“In Michigan, we have a steadily increasing amount of precipitation, and extreme storms are impacting how we manage our lakes and how we protect the wildlife that is also dependent upon the lakes,” Jameson pointed out. As a result, she explained, these factors must be taken into consideration. 
“I get we’ve been doing certain things certain ways for a long time,” Jameson added. “But things change, and we have to adapt.”
Environmental changes aren’t the only shifts impacting inland lakes. 
Many homeowners expressed dissatisfaction with the research and survey process, their chief grievance being the lack of substantive answers to their concerns. 
Such endeavors are typically a joint effort between state and federal funding. In March, the Trump administration announced that it was cancelling $1.7 billion in grants aimed at improving water and air quality. The cuts to environmental funding at the federal level mean that states are left scrambling to make up for lost funds.

Let’s dive into some news affecting California education:

Candidates for school chief: On Monday former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said he is running to be the next State Superintendent of Public Instruction after the current superintendent terms out in 2026. Rendon served in the Legislature as a Lakewood Democrat for 12 years. During his tenure as speaker, California doubled its K-12 funding and introduced transitional kindergarten. Rendon joins the race with at least three other candidates, including the chairperson of the Assembly’s education committee and the president of the Chino Valley school board, who pushed for policies requiring schools to notify parents if their child identifies as transgender. Read more from CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.


Battle over adult education: Last week California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state is suing President Donald Trump’s administration over its policy to ban adult students who do not have legal status from federally funded career technical education classes, English-language programs and high school equivalency courses. The U.S. Department of Education said it will begin enforcement starting Aug. 9. About 500,000 adult learners take classes in California. In addition to the likelihood that thousands of adults would be expelled, the memo also bans high school students without legal status from taking college-level courses in high school. Read more from CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.


K-12 funding restored: The Trump administration said it plans to release, beginning Monday, the rest of the $6 billion in federal grants it initially froze in June to K-12 and adult schools. Congress set aside that money, including more than $800 million for California, to fund teacher professional development, after school programs and other services. The move follows the administration’s conditional release of some of the funds earlier this month. Said a spokesperson for the California School Boards Association: “We’re moving in the right direction. The funds never should have been held in the first place.” Read more from CalMatters’ Adam.

Newsom: Have we tried gerrymandering?


Gov. Newsom calls for a new way to redraw California’s congressional district maps during a news conference in Sacramento on July 25, 2025. Photo by Rich Pedroncelli, AP Photo




As the Texas Legislature continues its special session this week to redraw the state’s congressional districts, calls for a Democratic response in California are intensifying under Gov. Gavin Newsom, reports CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the session after receiving pressure from Trump advisers to redistrict the state’s maps to help the GOP maintain its control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2026’s midterm elections.
Newsom gathered with a group of Democratic legislators from Texas last week in Sacramento to reaffirm his plan to counteract the Lone State’s efforts by potentially redistricting California in a way that would benefit Democrats.
But there’s a rub: Though the Texas Legislature can redraw the state’s congressional maps, California relies on an independent redistricting commission protected by the state Constitution to do the same.
Some of Newsom’s options to work around this hurdle involves calling a special session and asking voters to overturn the commission — a prospect that Common Cause California, a good governance advocacy group, condemned as “dangerous.”

Trump, Newsom have similar approach to homelessness

California homelessness service providers are in a bind after Trump issued an executive order last week that breaks away from years of federal and state precedent, writes CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall.
In many ways, Trump’s order to crackdown on homeless encampments is similar to the calls Newsom has been pushing local governments to follow: Both want to ban homeless people from sleeping outside, and both want to make it easier to force homeless people into treatment if they have severe mental illness or substance use disorders. 
But Trump also plans to eliminate federal support for services that use a “housing first” framework, which prioritizes giving homeless people a place to live, even if they use drugs or alcohol. The order also ends support for “harm reduction,” which focuses on preventing overdoses.
Both strategies are core tenets to California’s approach to homelessness, leaving some experts worried that Trump could accuse the state for failing to comply with his order and then cut funding.

A Wilmington tax preparer was sentenced Monday to more than six years in federal prison for orchestrating a nationwide fraud scheme that siphoned off more than $9 million in COVID-19 relief funds.
Jady Solano, 43, was sentenced to 80 months behind bars after prosecutors said he led a wide-ranging effort to defraud the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was created to help small businesses retain employees during the pandemic. None of the loans tied to the scheme were repaid, authorities said.
According to court documents, Solano used his position as a tax preparer to file 62 fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of shell companies that had no actual business operations or employees.
The applications falsely claimed the businesses had payrolls exceeding $1 million in some cases. Solano also submitted fake tax documents and bank statements to support the applications.

The scheme resulted in more than $9.1 million in pandemic relief funds being disbursed. Solano personally pocketed nearly $1.4 million, which he has been ordered to repay as part of a federal restitution order.
“The American taxpayers work hard for their money,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware Julianne Murray. “And we will work hard to ensure that, when taxpayer money is misused—through waste, fraud, or abuse—the wrongdoers are brought to justice.  Jady Solano led a nationwide scheme to steal more than $9 million from the federal government.”
And, she said, the funds he stole were meant for an especially important purpose: helping American workers keep their jobs during a deadly pandemic.
“Solano’s egregious misconduct warranted the substantial prison sentence the Court handed down today,” she said. “We hope that sentence sends a message to other potential white-collar criminals: in this District, financial crimes simply will not pay.”
Seven others connected to the fraud operation have also been charged, authorities said.
The case was prosecuted by First Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin L. Wallace.

California made it easier for young people convicted of serious crimes to get a second chance, except for those sentenced to life without parole. New legislation could change that.


Nathan Gould wakes up in a California state prison cell every morning at 6 a.m. He stirs a cup of instant coffee, prays with his Bible and reflects on the day in 1994 when he killed a man in Bakersfield.
Homeless and drifting from one drug score to the next, Gould and his wife holed up with another transient in an abandoned warehouse. Gould attacked him with a knife, beat and tied him up, and proceeded to rifle through his belongings for a wad of cash he’d flashed earlier. When the man began yelling, Gould stuffed a sock in his mouth. 
“I hate having to relive this sometimes,” Gould said before describing how he heard the man’s muffled grunts and failed to realize he was suffocating. “I didn’t know I broke his nose.”
The wad of cash turned out to be $68 — a lone $20 bill wrapped around dozens of smaller bills.
Two weeks later, and racked by guilt and remorse, the 21-year-old Gould hightailed it back to his mom’s house in Kansas and confessed what he’d done. “She told me just to be honest and tell the truth, so I called the police and turned myself in.” 
Today, he’s among more than 5,000 people in California prisons serving life without parole sentences that all but guarantee they’ll die incarcerated. And more than half — roughly 2,800, including Gould — committed their life crimes while they were under age 25, according to an advocacy group called The Sentencing Project.
Over the last two decades, California adopted laws that defined people who committed their crimes before they were 25 as “youth offenders” and softened parole criteria for them. Laws now require that youth offenders with so-called indeterminate sentences, meaning those that include a possibility of parole, be allowed to appear before the Board of Parole Hearings after 25 years of incarceration. That holds regardless of the sentence length — whether it’s 40 years to life, 80 years to life or beyond.
But for individuals like Gould whose original sentence mandates zero chance of parole, youth offender considerations still do not apply. Last year, the California Supreme Court ruled explicitly that life without parole sentences are excluded from youth offender parole reforms.
That could change. In April, state Sen. Susan Rubio of West Covina introduced a bill that could soon offer Gould and hundreds of others a chance at parole. She characterized her proposal as an “opportunity (for incarcerated people) to demonstrate their growth and rehabilitation.”
“This is not a guarantee of release — so let’s be clear about that. Not a guaranteed release,” she said in June just before the Senate passed the bill 24-11, with all of the chamber’s 10 Republicans and one Democrat, Sen. Melissa Hurtado, voting against it.
The bill won’t pass this year. Democratic lawmakers agreed to hold it in the Assembly until 2026, giving them time to refine the proposal.
Supporters hope the bill will help address what they see as disparities in who receives the most stringent sentences. Local prosecutors hold great discretion to pursue so-called special circumstance murder convictions. From county to county and courtroom to courtroom, any first degree murder allegation could be defined as special circumstance — and therefore lead to mandatory life without the possibility of parole.
That’s reflected in California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation data that shows a wide range in how county prosecutors pursue life without parole. Lassen, Sacramento and Los Angeles counties sentence people to life without parole at some of the highest rates. Of currently incarcerated people, 7.2% sentenced in Lassen County are serving life without parole, compared to 5.6% statewide.
How parole works
For anyone serving a life sentence — even with the possibility of parole, there is never a guarantee of release. California’s parole board prides itself on setting arduous and stringent layers of review that prioritize public safety.
Every aspect of an offender’s criminal footprint is documented and scrutinized through the parole process — their childhood history and trauma, prior convictions, prison record, disciplinary infractions, social achievements, educational milestones, relapse prevention plans, vocational training and realistic career prospects.
In usually a two to three hour hearing, a person must discuss all fluidly and clearly with parole board commissioners trained to observe and root out inconsistencies. Specific insight into the crime and how the person’s outlook on criminality has changed over time must be fully articulated.
The slightest semblance of a red flag might result in a parole denial.
“Without reservation, in California we have the most thorough process with the most checks and balances than anyone, anywhere,” said Jennifer Schaffer, former executive officer of the Board of Parole Hearings for the last 13 years. She cited Canada as having, perhaps, the only system of parole more rigorous.
Schaffer said the board’s deep reliance on quantifiable science in every parole decision includes comprehensive risk assessments by a specialized team of forensic psychologists and peer review of all reports to ensure accuracy and lack of bias.
“And for the last 10 years, they’ve looked at every single person who’s been released as a result of a grant,” she said. “Only two to 4% have gone on to commit any new crime, misdemeanor or felony — and less than 1% have gone on to commit any new felony involving harm to another human being.
“It’s like 99.5% go on to never harm another human being, within three years of release, which is extraordinary.”
Su Kim, senior policy manager for nonprofit justice reform organization UnCommon Law, has helped see over 300 clients — many of them youth offenders — successfully earn parole. 
“I think it’s safe to say that anyone who has been granted parole through this process has done tremendous work to transform their lives to reflect deeply on their crimes and their past mistakes, and to demonstrate accountability and remorse,” said Kim. “The board doesn’t really take chances on people.”

Is Nathan Gould a different person today?
After his first 15 years immersed in a prison culture fueled by bootleg alcohol and narcotics, Gould said he began to embrace sobriety. 
“My cellie and I had been high for a good few days straight. We looked around at our shelf. We got nothing. All we were living for was getting high each day. But I had this dusty old Bible.”
While elements of his story are documented in court records and prison files, CalMatters was unable to independently verify every detail.
Gould took to the scripture, renewed his faith and found fellowship within the Christian community. “I started going to church and hanging around with people who had a positive vibe,” he said. “You can feel all alone in here doing your time, so I saw the camaraderie and felt wanted by guys who were choosing to live right.”
At the time, his only rehabilitative options outside the church were through mail correspondence. But eventually, he transferred to a prison with more opportunities in 2015. He discovered Celebrate Recovery, a Christian-based 12-step program, and he started to join self-help groups and take college courses.
“I was in special education as a kid and ended up graduating from high school while I was in juvenile detention,” he said. “I never really felt I was good enough for college even though I saw others doing it here.”
Tackling one class at a time, Gould methodically plodded through his coursework, earned his first “A” and began to look at himself a bit differently. He completed two separate associate of arts programs, and is one course away from completing a third — all with nearly a 4.0 grade point average.
He also learned to seek help to battle the depression that overwhelms him at times. “I see a mental health specialist once a month — by choice,” he said. “I don’t have to, but I do.”
Gould spoke about completing self-help groups that focus on anger management, alternatives to violence, conflict resolution and positive psychology. His current group discusses Greek philosophy, self-mastery and learning to accept external circumstances beyond one’s control.
“The only groups I take are the ones that I feel I’m gonna get something out of,” he said. “I know they’re good for me and they help me to dive into myself and understand the root causes of why I acted the way I did.”
According to Gould, the self-help groups and rehabilitative programs helped him address the childhood trauma and shame of having an abusive alcoholic father. His first stint in juvenile detention came at age 14, after he broke his father’s leg with a baseball bat to stop him from beating his mother.
“I got locked up for aggravated assault. Nothing happened to him.” When Gould returned home after serving 14 months, he said his father chased him out of the house with a shotgun and shot him in the back as he ran away. 
“Police asked if I wanted to file charges, but I couldn’t. He told me if I ever got him locked up, he’d kill me as soon as he got out.”
But Gould said he doesn’t blame his father for anything. Instead, he looks at his father’s behavior through the same lens he views his own. “He was a Korean War vet. He ran off to join the military when he was 15, so I’m sure something bad was going on at home for him to want to leave.”
Giving life without parole a second look
Schaffer, the former parole board executive officer, supports Rubio’s bill. While cognizant of the trauma that parole hearings bear upon victims of crime, her years of experience in the criminal justice landscape inform her opinion.
“Human beings who have no opportunity for review, it’s really hard to maintain hope,” she said. “I think hope can be really powerful — and the absence of hope can be very dangerous. So even for staff and volunteers and people who work in the prisons, I think people having a meaningful opportunity for review and having hope for that can actually make our prisons safer. I truly believe that.
“I also think that giving people an opportunity to show that they’ve truly transformed is a very meaningful thing. I just think it’s something important for humanity in general.”

Through her position at UnCommon Law, Kim has seen the real-life impact of youth offender parole opportunities.
“We now have a decade of evidence showing that youth parole works,” said Kim. “It promotes public safety and fiscal responsibility, and offers a fair second chance to those who’ve grown and changed. Recidivism rates for people released after life sentences have dropped since youth parole was implemented.”
Sen. Kelly Seyarto is not convinced. He spoke in opposition to Rubio’s bill on the Senate floor before the vote in June.
“Let’s let the system work the way it’s been working,” said Seyarto, a Republican from Murrieta. “Now ultimately everybody has the option to have the governor commute their sentence and they can be freed and they can be rehabilitated. Once they’re rehabilitated, they can get back out there in society.”
Governors hold executive power to absolve or alter a person’s sentence, but it’s generally considered a rare act of mercy — a mercurial process without clear layers of objective review. In the last 30 years, fewer than 200 offenders serving life without parole sentences have been offered clemency or commutation.
Former Gov. Jerry Brown commuted no sentences from 2011 to 2015, then 282 from 2016 to 2018 — about half which were life without parole sentences. Gov. Gavin Newsom has commuted the sentences of 141 people since the beginning of his term in 2019, including 49 serving life without parole. Of those, 33 committed their crimes when they were 25 or younger, according to an analysis of executive clemency reports.
Rubio’s bill would offer a more equitable mechanism for second chance opportunities. 
Gould knows legislation is out there that could radically change his life overnight. “It’s definitely giving me a light,” he said. “There’s hope. I’d have a purpose now. I’d have a goal. There’s an ending.”
But for now he said he remains pessimistically optimistic. “I always kinda think, ‘Here we go again,’ because they wiggled carrots in front of my face so many times, and then they just kick your feet out from underneath you.
“I try to wake up with a good attitude and focus on positivity — just let the day come to me.”

The post Bar advocates dispute Beacon Hill’s forecast for labor crisis[...]","BAR ADVOCATES said Monday they have not been involved in any conversations with legislative leadership about a resolution to the labor crisis that’s resulted in more than 100 court cases being dismissed, even though top House and Senate Democrats suggested the situation could be fixed “soon.”
House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka told reporters their teams continue to work on a solution to the pay dispute that has led bar advocates to stop accepting new cases representing indigent defendants. Spilka called on the attorneys to reverse course in the meantime, contending that “people are being hurt” as a result of their stance.
“We hope to get it resolved soon, but in the meantime, they should be working,” Spilka told reporters Monday afternoon following a private leadership meeting with Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll and Mariano.
But Sean Delaney, a veteran attorney who has been heavily involved in organizing the labor action, said he was surprised by Spilka’s assessment of where things stand.
“No information to that effect has made its way to the bar advocates as of, what is it? 4:49 p.m.?” Delaney said in a late-afternoon interview.
Delaney said he and fellow bar advocate Jennifer O’Brien began speaking in “mid- to late winter” about their concerns with comparably low pay and the effects on cases. The private attorneys appointed to represent those who cannot afford counsel earn $65 per hour in District Court and $85 per hour in Superior Court, in both cases lower than in neighboring states. 
In late May, hundreds of bar advocates decided to stop taking new cases to protest pay rates. The attorneys handle about 80% of the overall public defense caseload in Massachusetts.
“And I just want to add that I strongly urge the bar advocates to get back to work,” Spilka said. “They are being paid. They continue to be paid.”
Asked to provide more details about negotiations and a potential legislative vehicle, Spilka responded, “Nope.” 
Pressed about her reticence, Spilka said, “Because discussions are happening right now, and we’re trying to work it out.”
Delaney stressed that bar advocates continue to work on cases they accepted before late May, and disputed use of the phrase “work stoppage.”
“I’m in court representing and defending, to the best of my ability, the poor in the commonwealth, as all my fellow bar advocates are,” Delaney said. “All we’ve done is said, ‘Listen, enough is enough. We’re not taking on any new cases.’ So for the governor, the speaker, the Senate president, to say we must go back to work — we have not stopped working. It shows me they don’t have any regard for us, the work we do, or the clients that we represent.”
Top legislative Democrats have called the situation a “$100 million issue,” as the state continues to assess the economic and federal funding outlooks in Massachusetts. 
Healey has maintained that bar advocates did not raise the issue with her before she filed her proposed fiscal 2026 budget in January. Spilka on Monday reiterated that point. 
“The governor came out with her budget — there were no discussions prior to that, nothing was in the governor’s budget. The House came out with their budget in April, nobody raised anything about the need for more funding, or the concern about the funding,” Spilka said. “The Senate came out with some increase that was rejected. So we are now trying to resolve the issue and work it out.”
Keith Alpern, an attorney who has worked as a bar advocate since the mid-1980s, said he finds the tone elected officials have taken to be “totally disingenuous.” He pointed to a Boston Globe report that attorneys asked lawmakers for a raise as early as February and continued those requests during the spring, before bar advocates stopped taking new cases in late May.
“The idea that this was some shock is just nonsense,” Alpern said.
Delaney added, “If there’s a legislator, especially leadership, who is saying they were blindsided, they must have been under a rock for not only months but for years.”
Delaney said he and O’Brien had a meeting with Spilka or her top aides tentatively scheduled for Monday, July 21. But a few days beforehand, he said, “word got back to us and said, ‘Unless we tell our colleagues to go back to work, there will be no meeting.'”
A spokesperson for Spilka said in response, “Our office has no record of a meeting or understanding of a meeting like this being planned or scheduled with our office.”
Mariano said the chairs of the Ways and Means committees are “trying to work on a solution that is fair and equitable for everybody.”
Bob McGovern, communications director at the Committee for Public Counsel Services, was in the House lobby speaking with reporters as the private meeting was underway, though he exited before the Beacon Hill leaders emerged. 
“We have been in frequent communication with leadership in both the House and Senate as they work toward a resolution,” McGovern said in a statement to the News Service. “We remain hopeful that an agreement will be reached that prioritizes and benefits our clients.”
The House and Senate have formal sessions slated for this week, before the branches transition into their August recess that will still feature biweekly informal sessions. A supplemental budget remains unfinished and has been eyed as a potential venue to bump bar advocates’ pay.
Asked if that looming break is putting more urgency on the work stoppage, or whether the issue could be put on the backburner without a solution reached this week, Spilka reiterated, “I expect it to be resolved soon.”
Healey said she wants the stoppage resolved “immediately,” but also refrained from offering specific details about a potential resolution. 
“I am hopeful that we will see one very soon, and that will be announced at the appropriate time,” the governor said. 
Healey has repeatedly called the issue a “matter of public safety” and said last week that she’ll “leave it up to the Legislature” to determine a dollar figure associated with a resolution.
Some bar advocates said they are unlikely to accept new cases until they secure a satisfactory raise, arguing that doing so would relinquish leverage.
“The bar advocates certainly are not happy about what’s happening in the courts right now, but the reality is that until we stopped taking cases, nobody cared. The Legislature ignored us for years,” Alpern said. “The notion that we should go back to taking cases based on some promise that in the future, they’re going to take us seriously — why would we think that when we haven’t been taken seriously for decades?”
Mariano acknowledged the thorny discussions at play. The Quincy Democrat said it is not a “traditional” negotiation due to individual contracts involved.
“So it’s hard to foresee where a middle ground might be, one that works for everybody because each one of these folks is an individual contractor. So you may be talking to someone who only represents five people – you don’t know,” Mariano told reporters. “So you make an agreement with five people, and then you gotta do it 55 more times. We’re trying to get a consensus of where these folks would come back to work, and how much it would take to get them to come back to work.”
Mariano later clarified the negotiations are not unfolding across every individual contract, though he said some bar advocates may have stiffer requests than others. 
“It may be some aggressive and adamant folks who are holding out for the full amount of X, and then you have other folks who will settle for X minus five,” Mariano said. “So you have a whole range of acceptances in this area, and we’re trying to find out something that works in our budget, because as you heard from the Senate president, they came to us after we were done. So now we have to go in and look for the money, and we have to start cutting things. So it’s a long, involved process.” 
Budget-writers gave themselves a $800 million cushion in their fiscal 2026 compromise budget amid federal funding uncertainty. 
Neither Healey nor legislative leaders have taken a stance on whether they believe attorneys’ pay should be raised, and have not dictated a specific figure they think attorneys should be paid. 
The work stoppage “has pushed our justice system to the brink,” according to Boston Bar Association President Matt McTyge. “What began as a crisis of compensation has escalated into a full-blown emergency, one that threatens the safety of our communities and the public’s faith in the justice system,” he said in a statement Friday. 
The attorneys are not accepting new cases at the same time that Republic Services sanitation workers and Fenway Park hospitality workers are on strike. Asked why she thinks unions are “being more active” this year, Healey said she “can’t offer an explanation on that.”
“What you see here happening in Massachusetts is no different from what is happening around the country,” Healey said. “With respect to Republic, these are private contracts, and so the state doesn’t have an active role in this, other than for me to continue to ask that parties resolve this.”
Pressed about the tension in Massachusetts between labor and management, the governor said, “I don’t know enough to be able to opine on that.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)A new study from Los Alamos National Laboratory shows that New Mexico’s beloved piñon pine trees may be more flexible in how they handle extreme drought than scientists once thought.
Generally, all plants have a built-in drought alarm system called a “stomatal closure point.”
When soil gets too dry, the plant hits a tipping point where it closes up to avoid dehydration. While this can help the plant survive drought, it also pauses growth and energy production.
“There are lots of trade-offs in how plants manage their water use and how they optimize water use versus photosynthesis,” said Turin Dickman, one of the LANL scientists that published the study. “They can’t have their cake and eat it too.”
Dickman and her team studied piñon pine — an “isohydric” plant that constantly works to keep its internal water levels steady, even if it means shutting down photosynthesis during extreme drought.
Scientists once thought these plants stuck to this rigid water-control strategy, come torrential rain or abundant sunshine.
But, when given more water just before prolonged drought, Dickman’s team discovered that piñon started to change, mimicking the behavior of an “anisohydric” plant – where the plant will let its water levels match the environment around it.
“It suggests that our pine forests here might be more resilient to those hot dry periods if they’ve experienced some wetter times just before those come along,” Dickman said.
As climate change accelerates – prolonging droughts, increasing heat waves, and sparking more frequent and intense wildfires – Dickman said the discovery could have broad implications for land managers, offering a tool to predict how ecosystems might respond to drought.
That includes thinning dense forests to reduce wildfire risk.
“Available soil water is like a bucket,” Dickman said. “When it’s super dense, if you’ve got a lot of straws in that bucket, there’s less water for each individual straw, right? If you can do some thinning, you can make more water available for those that are remaining.”
While priorities for scientific research shift heavily towards weapons modernization programs at New Mexico’s scientific laboratories under the Trump administration, the LANL team has plans to look at the drought tolerance of other pine tree species if they can secure a financial sponsor.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Burn-Scar-in-Alto-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

A groundbreaking workforce development initiative marked a major milestone Monday as 24 participants became the first graduates of the BioConnect DE Biomanufacturing Training Program, an intensive, tuition-free course aimed at preparing Delawareans for careers in the state’s rapidly expanding life sciences sector.
The graduation ceremony, held Monday at EastSide Charter School’s Chemours STEM Hub, celebrated the achievements of the program’s inaugural class—96% of whom completed the rigorous eight-week curriculum.
The initiative is spearheaded by the Delaware Center for Life Science Education and Training and the Delaware BioScience Association (Delaware Bio), with funding from a federal Congressionally Directed Spending grant and support from industry partners.
“This graduation marks a critical step in addressing workforce gaps in the life sciences while creating new opportunities for individuals across our community,” said Katie Lakofsky, executive director of BioConnect DE. “We’re thrilled to celebrate our first group of graduates and excited to connect them with employers who are ready to invest in talent.”
The BioConnect DE training program was launched to respond to both state economic priorities and national security concerns around the biomanufacturing workforce.
A recent report by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology emphasized the urgent need to build a competitive U.S. workforce in this strategically vital industry.

Michael Fleming, president and CEO of Delaware Bio and founding chair of the training center, praised the collaboration that brought the program to life, calling it  the result of years of planning and focused, effective collaboration with partners across industry, government, and community organizations.
“But most importantly, it recognizes a remarkable group of individuals who – with many obligations and sacrifices – courageously raised their hands to serve patients and secure our state’s economic future,” he said.
A new talent pipeline for biomanufacturing
The $3 million, three-year pilot program trains individuals in foundational lab and manufacturing skills, including Quality Management Systems, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), and Clean Room Procedures.
The program places special emphasis on accessibility—no college degree is required—and actively recruits candidates from diverse professional backgrounds, including retail, hospitality, and healthcare.
Guest lecturers from major employers such as Agilent, AstraZeneca, Tru Global, and the University of Delaware provided insight into industry practices.
Participants also completed a capstone project, designing and delivering training modules to their peers—an exercise that emphasized communication and collaboration.
Job placement efforts already underway
With graduation complete, BioConnect DE is now working to place graduates into entry-level roles with life sciences employers across Delaware.
Participating companies have already received student profiles, taken part in mock interviews, and attended site tours. Employer roundtables are planned in the coming months to accelerate job placements.

The Delaware Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) has launched the Delaware School Safety Center (DSSC), a new initiative aimed at bolstering school safety across the state.
The DSSC includes a newly launched website designed to serve as a centralized hub for training, resources, and best practices for educators, parents, and emergency responders.
Located here, the user-friendly site offers guidance and tools for crisis response planning, threat assessment, and safety coordination.
The move marks a significant expansion of Delaware’s long-standing Comprehensive School Safety Program (CSSP), originally established in 2012.

“Ensuring a safe learning environment for every Delaware student is a shared priority of the highest importance,” said Joshua Bushweller, secretary of Safety and Homeland Security. “This critical collaboration between first responders, school officials, parents, and students – supported by the integration of technology and emergency management expertise – will serve to strengthen our ongoing commitment to school safety.”
The DSSC is designed not only to support schools during emergencies, but also to help prevent incidents before they occur.
The Center offers a range of services including Behavioral Threat Assessment (BTA) training for school-based teams, secure case management software for consistent documentation and follow-up, and onsite physical safety assessments.
“The DSSC represents a collaborative effort to support educators and first responders, and to engage students and parents in building safe and resilient school communities,” said DEMA Director A.J. Schall.
Delaware has been a national leader in school safety.
It was the first state to create standardized digital maps and blueprints of all public and charter schools, streamlining emergency response.
In 2023, the state also launched Safe DE, a 24/7 anonymous reporting system that allows students and families to report safety concerns and access mental health and crisis resources.
“The Delaware School Safety Center is designed to prevent school-based incidents by preparing the education community to work with community partners to effectively mitigate and manage crises,” added DSSC Executive Director Joey Melvin.
In addition to safety planning tools, the DSSC offers specialized training for school resource officers, guidance on managing after-school events, and recommendations for improving physical school security.
State Education Secretary Cindy Marten emphasized the importance of a proactive approach to school safety.
“Nothing is more important than student safety, because students learn, and teachers are able to teach when they feel safe,” she said. “Safety doesn’t happen by accident; it happens by design. That’s why the launch of the Delaware School Safety Center matters so much.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-29-at-8.03.42-AM.png,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Members of a network of 83 after-school programs in Utah were relieved to hear this month that the Trump administration would release frozen funds essential to run their programs. But, weeks of financial uncertainty have already resulted in cuts.
Past the middle of July, amid a bipartisan push to release the funds, the Trump administration decided to release part of the $6.8 billion allocated for before- and after-school programs, as well as summer programs. 
Now, after-school organizations in the state are preparing for change aligning with Trump policies. And, while the Utah State Board of Education has secured the funding, questions about the future of the program that serves about 10,000 children in the state remain unanswered.

The board is currently reviewing any additional requirements that may be attached to the funding, said Ben Trentelman, executive director at Utah Afterschool Network. Then, the state will be able to reimburse summer and after-school programs for their operational costs.
“​​It was referred to by the administration as guardrails to ensure that the programs were not implementing programming or activities that are counter to the focus of the administration,” Trentelman said. “And so I think that that does pertain to some things like diversity, equity and inclusion and similar areas.”
Utah after-school and summer programs blindsided by federal funding freeze

Utah already has a law restricting DEI initiatives in public institutions, which has led programs overseen by the board of education to pivot to ensure compliance with state code.

Before the administration change and the freeze, the programs followed requirements to qualify for the federal 21st Century Community Learning Centers Grants — maintaining an average daily attendance, serving a certain minimum number of students, and ensuring the programs aren’t used for political activities, among others, Trentelman said. Now, word from other states is that there may be additional anti-DEI and U.S. citizenship requirements.
The after-school program network hasn’t seen any official guidance from the board, Trentelman said. The board didn’t reply to an interview request from Utah News Dispatch. 
“We still have a lot of questions about how programs are able to operate moving into the future,” Trentelman said. “We know that the funding is available, but we’re unsure about what guardrails may exist and how these programs are allowed to move forward.”
The programs don’t currently ask for students’ citizenship status, aside from demographic surveys which include a question on refugee status. The citizenship question hasn’t come up in Utah programs, but other states are already looking into the requirement’s legality.
“Something that I think is important is that when we think about inclusion, we’re really looking at ensuring that youth of all abilities have a place to go, that youth are able to participate in an after-school program,” he said, “regardless of their background, or ethnicity, or income, or any of those things.”
A challenging time
After-school and summer programs have been alternatives for families looking for safe spaces for their children while they are busy with work or other responsibilities. 
Trentelman has watched how the stability and routine of the programs allow children to thrive in their educational paths. However, that stability was called into question with the funding unpredictability.



Let us know what you think...


 


“A number of organizations were thrown into a bit of disarray as they were trying to navigate exactly how they could best move forward,” he said. “We did see some programs that did elect to reduce their staff size, or move staff to more limited hours. We did see some organizations that did shut down for the summer prematurely because they did not have the savings established to be able to support their operation without consistent payments on funds that they had been promised.”
The uncertainty is extending beyond this year, even if the funding has been released. It was already difficult to keep a full staff with typically low-paying, entry-level positions. Wages for after-school staff start between $13 to $15 an hour, and the work week is usually 20 to 30 hours.
“(Providers) are faced with the additional challenge of the uncertainty of the field, knowing that funds may have come out for this year, but we still don’t know what’s happening in the next year,” Trentelman said. “People are going to be questioning the stability of entering this work.”
In an informal survey of the programs, Trentelman heard about four organizations, which manage about 15 programs, planning to reduce staff and program hours. That may hit rural communities the hardest, where there are fewer child care or after-school options.

Members approved a policy to collect information regarding deaths in custody to help the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs receive grants from the federal government. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Justice Information Commission established a policy on Thursday to require law enforcement to report when someone dies while in custody.
But the Commission left it up to the individual agencies to make the information available to the public.
The policy was one of two that members of the commission unanimously voted to approve during its quarterly meeting to create a platform that allows law enforcement agencies to report incidents of people dying in their custody. It also establishes the process for reporting deaths and the information that must be included.
The policy was adapted to fit the needs of the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, another state agency in Alabama, to report those statistics to the U.S. Department of Justice so it can continue to distribute grants from the U.S. DOJ to law enforcement organizations throughout the state.
Currently, the Alabama Department of Economic Affairs cannot require law enforcement agencies to report incidents in which people have died in their custody. The updated policy allows it to partner with the Commission to obtain the information.
“Basically, we are depending on the goodwill of any entity that can hold individuals to give us that information.” said Bill Babington, chief of the Law Enforcement and Traffic Division of the agency.
The recently updated policy applies to all agencies in Alabama and must be reported each quarter. The updated policy defines those in the custody of law enforcement as people who are detained or arrested, as well as incarcerated in a jail or prison.
Law enforcement agencies must report when and where people died while in their custody, as well as how people died along with information pertaining to any investigation into the death of the individuals.
Agencies must also report the name, date of birth and race of the individuals who died, as well as data related to the individual reporting the death, such as the name and title, as well as the name of the agency.
The policy states that the Alabama Justice Information Commission will outline the procedures to collect and distribute the information about those who died while in custody. The Commission will also provide a uniform method for collecting the information.

This story was originally reported by Jennifer Gerson of The 19th.  Meet Jennifer and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Content warning: This story contains graphic depictions of domestic violence.
Rep. Debbie Dingell doesn’t want to talk about this, but I’m here in her office because she says she needs to.
Dingell grew up in Michigan and had what she describes as a “comfortable childhood.” Her father owned a business. Her mother was a member of Michigan’s famous Fisher family, whose company became part of what is now General Motors.
But her father also was addicted to prescription drugs and suffered from mental illness.
“He was paranoid. You just never knew what his mood was going to be and so he would just — trigger.”
It all came to a head on what Dingell described as “the night that I just really was convinced we were all going to die.”
Dingell’s father had a gun, and her mother had bought one of her own to protect herself. A fight broke out between the two “and I got in the middle of them,” Dingell recalled.
“I tried to keep them from killing each other. My mother ran out of the house. He took the door knobs off of every door, so that we kids couldn’t get out. I tried to call the police. He ripped the phone out of the wall — not that anybody would have come anyway, the way they do today. So we hid in a closet and we didn’t know if we were going to live or die.”
At the time, Dingell was in middle school. Her baby sister was set to start first grade in the morning. Dingell walked her to school that next day, both pretending nothing had ever happened. Her younger sister, Dingell said, was forever traumatized. “She was never OK. This all was happening from the time she was born.”
She died of an overdose years later, something Dingell continues to connect to the impact of that night, and of years of experiences like it.
Which is why, though she doesn’t like to talk about it, she will when she thinks it’s important, when she thinks her story might have the opportunity to change things, to shine a light, to ensure that another family can get the resources they need to reclaim their future. It’s why she’s talking to me today, even if she doesn’t really want to. She’s talking to me because I wanted to hear more after we spoke in early June about a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi critical of the administration’s actions to roll back resources and protections for survivors of domestic violence — and because she thinks it will help.










For many reasons, you just didn’t talk about it. You didn’t want your family stigmatized, you didn’t want yourself stigmatized.


“There’s always been a stigma associated with domestic violence,” Dingell tells me. “People think it doesn’t happen in ‘good homes’ — I don’t know what’s a ‘good home,’ by the way — or happen in certain families or in certain places, but it happens anywhere. For many reasons, you just didn’t talk about it. You didn’t want your family stigmatized, you didn’t want yourself stigmatized. But at some point — for me, for a long time, I always tried to figure out, how do you keep this down inside when there are guns getting into people’s hands in times when that shouldn’t happen?”
Dingell has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2015, after she ran for and won the seat vacated by the retirement of her husband — Rep. John Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history, who died in 2019. She’s a former executive as well as an experienced Democratic operative, a connector and convener of people. Dingell is also widely known for her frank, direct speech — see her public spats with President Donald Trump. Since joining Congress, she has become one of the clearest, most consistent voices speaking out about the need to support survivors of domestic violence.
She’s been talking about her childhood experiences with domestic violence since 2016, when her longtime friend John Lewis, the civil rights legend and new colleague in the U.S. House, took her by the hand during the 26-hour sit-in Democrats had staged at the Capitol to push for a vote on new gun safety legislation.
“John Lewis knew my story and said, ‘Tell it.’ It wasn’t planned. It wasn’t rehearsed. It was in the middle of the night. And I got up and told the story. I never know what I’m going to say. I never pre-planned. I just talked about it in the minute there,” Dingell told me on a Monday afternoon in July as we sat opposite each other in arm chairs  in the Cannon House Office Building, surrounded by paraphernalia from her home-state and photos with political power players through the years.










My sister was like, ‘If we could prevent anybody from going through what we went through, then we have a moral responsibility.'


It wasn’t until that House speech that she had ever even used the term “domestic abuse” to describe her own experiences, Dingell said. When she did, she was “shaking like a leaf,” she recalled. But she understood why speaking up was important.
“My sister was like, ‘If we could prevent anybody from going through what we went through, then we have a moral responsibility.’”
They were words that have helped empower her to talk about her experience multiple times on the House floor in her 10-year tenure. But still, Dingell said, she and her surviving siblings don’t really ever discuss what happened to them. Dingell’s mother is alive, as are her brother and one sister, and she feels discomfort talking about a story that she says isn’t wholly hers.
“When you grow up in this kind of situation, you learn to cope. You want to go on with your life. You don’t want to be demonized, or have that happen to your sister or your brother,” Dingell said. “That’s why I feel this probably isn’t my story to tell, nor should I really be talking about it. You just want to make a difference in people’s lives — and you want to move on. You don’t want to remember.”










Domestic violence is real. Domestic violence happens in every kind of family.


The making a difference part means speaking honestly and frankly about domestic violence with the microphone she has in Congress.
“Domestic violence is real. Domestic violence happens in every kind of family.”
She worries people will ask why her mother didn’t leave and wants to protect her.
I did not ask, but Dingell went ahead and answered the question: “You know, in those days, people said, ‘Stay together.’ The Catholic Church told you to stay together. So kids stay in situations where they shouldn’t stay.”
She hopes her story can provide a kind of reference point for anyone navigating a similar situation.
“Parents have to understand that when a child is in that kind of unstable, dangerous situation, it is not the best for the child. That would be one message I would have. And the other message is that when someone is unstable, when they have mood swings, when it can all just change in an instant, being armed in that situation is a dangerous situation.”
It’s these two things that have driven so much of Dingell’s legislative work in the area.
Dingell established the Bipartisan Working Group to End Domestic Violence, bringing together a group of House members to identify ways to strengthen resources and protections for survivors. There was the letter to Bondi urging the Trump administration to reinstate funding opportunities through the Department of Justice’s Office of Violence Against Women (OVW) that provide critical resources and support to domestic violence survivors. (This funding was ultimately revived, though with new restrictions.) Another letter, to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., expressed deep concern about staff and budget cuts to programs that support survivors of domestic and sexual violence and their families.










Half of this is just awareness and we need to go for that. That’s what I’m doing right now.


She was a key voice in helping the House pass the 2019 updates to the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which included two provisions she authored. One was the bipartisan Zero Tolerance for Domestic Abusers Act, which closed loopholes that made it possible for perpetrators of dating violence and those convicted of misdemeanor stalking to legally access guns. The other strengthened the health care system’s identification, assessment and response to domestic violence, sexual assault and dating violence survivors, helping them better access behavioral health and safety resources.
Dingell is particularly concerned about the way the Trump administration has delayed and restricted funding for the kinds of community-centered groups that provide services to women and children. She pointed to what’s happened in Detroit, where nonprofit support organizations worked for years to raise funds to build a shelter with 85 beds for domestic violence survivors. Now the future of the federal funding the shelter was relying on is unclear, putting its ability to operate in question. It’s just one example of why she’s once again choosing to talk about her personal experience with domestic violence now.
“I’m working with the groups. We’ve had bipartisan conversations. You’re going to write an article. Half of this is just awareness and we need to go for that. That’s what I’m doing right now.”
These community-based resources, she said, are essential to helping children in particular.
“I thought I needed to call the police because I thought we were going to die. But I don’t think many children, especially younger children, understand that there are other resources there,” she said. “This is why you educate teachers and people who work in emergency rooms, in case a child’s had a bone that’s been broken. That’s what you have to do — you have to raise community awareness.”
Though Dingell doesn’t care to talk about her personal experience with domestic violence, she does care about action and change — especially in the form of practical resources for other survivors.
“I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about it. For me, it’s just about trying to keep other people from having to go through what we did and for mothers and fathers — there are men that are victims too — to know that there are resources. I want to make sure that there still are places that people can go so that we don’t make it so that people have to stay in those kinds of situations.”










We have to raise our voices, collectively, across the country, and say, ‘We have to get this fixed.'


The other thing that Dingell wants to talk about is hope. “If we give up and we don’t have hope, then — then it’s all gone. So I’m gonna give up? No. … When we come together, when we know that there’s something that’s not right, we have to raise our voices, collectively, across the country, and say, ‘We have to get this fixed.’”
Her model for practicing this kind of hope paired with deep conviction and action were the nuns who taught her at the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. They are the women who continue to inspire her today, she said.
“The nuns taught me to be who I am, that I can be anything I want. They taught me the values that I have, that I have a responsibility to my community. They taught me to be tough.”
So Dingell talks, even about things she doesn’t want to remember, even in situations like this — sitting with a reporter, a stranger — to make sure her voice is heard.
“I want somebody to know there are people there to help them. I want someone to recognize that they’re in a bad situation and that they need support and their family needs support — and that there need to be programs for them to get that support,” Dingell said. “I can remember talking to my priest when I was a kid in grade school, but nobody would do anything about it then because my parents were very generous contributors to the church and people didn’t want to upset anybody. We have to be willing to tell the truth. We have to be willing to intervene. And we have to be willing to get people the help and resources they need.”










You can have a life. You can. And we have to help get you the resources so you can.


She is introducing bills. She’s giving speeches. She’s doing whatever she can to call attention to the way the entire domestic violence safety net is at risk as a result of actions of the Trump administration. All of these things, though, are also ways for her to not dwell on her past and what she has survived.
“I’m focused on living and helping people and helping people learn how to live through what we lived through,” she said. “Every person has strengths within themselves. Nobody has to put up with someone beating them or mentally abusing them or abusing them in any way. But we have to give people community places that people can go to get the help they need to escape it. We have to do the training in the community to identify where the problem is occurring, so that you can help get people out.”
She looked me squarely in the eye as she asserted what she wanted me to most know that day: “I’m not a victim. As my sister said, if we can help anybody escape what we went through, we should and that’s why I talk about it. But why bring up memories that only will make me not sleep tonight?”
She was emphatic about the crux of her message: “You can have a life. You can. And we have to help get you the resources so you can.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AMR_0190-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

Reno City Council last week gave city staff the green light to review its existing child care ordinances and offer amendments, which will have to go through a public feedback process before being considered by the city’s zoning commission and then city council. There is no set timeline for when any future ordinance might be considered.
The review was requested by Councilmember Kathleen Taylor, who said a constituent came to her and said the city needs more child care. Taylor said her initial reaction was “we don’t really do child care at the City of Reno,” but after speaking to the city manager she recognized there are some things that can be done “within the confines of what the city does.”
Grace Mackedon, a senior management analyst with the city, told council members that her staff does not have specific changes in mind but will review best practices in other cities and collect feedback to see what barriers can be reduced for existing or prospective child care providers.
“We’re going to look at: Can we streamline that (permitting) process?” Mackedon said. “Is there anything else we can do to make it easier?”
In-home providers and businesses that offer on-site child care for their employees pay the city around $4,300 when applying for a minor use permit, and there is no guarantee of approval. The city’s review process takes about 30 days.
Standalone child care facilities pay around $5,000 for a conditional use permit when in residential zones, and the review processing time is 65 days.
“That’s a risk for the child care providers because they’re investing that time, investing that money, not knowing if they’ll get approval,” said Mackedon. “Can we put standards in code so they know that, if we follow these standards, we know we’ll get approval?”
Seven organizations, including The Children’s Cabinet, United Way of Northern Nevada and the Sierra, and Children’s Advocacy Alliance, expressed support for Reno revisiting the local zoning ordinances.
“Child care is an everybody problem,” Tara Raines, deputy director of Children’s Advocacy Alliance, told the Nevada Current.
Child advocates often focus on federal and state policies that they believe will have the greatest impact on families, like the federal child tax credit, which was temporarily expanded under the Biden administration but whose accessibility will constrict under the Trump administration. But efforts at every level of government are helpful, say advocates.
The 2025 legislative session saw some efforts to expand the availability of child care, but most proposals failed. One bill that would have prevented home owners associations from prohibiting licensed home-based child care providers was vetoed by Gov. Joe Lombardo. A proposal to adopt universal pre-K was proposed by Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro but was scaled back to become dependent on available funding after the state’s economic outlook deteriorated.
Raines notes that cities are heavily involved in recruiting businesses and often offer incentives in the name of spurring development. They could incentivize companies that offer workplace-based child care options.
“We’re seeing more people make the business case for child care,” she added.
A 2023 business survey conducted by the Nevada Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation found that half of businesses said employees and potential hires have expressed child care as a barrier to work. Nearly all – 94.5% – of respondents believed greater access to child care could improve their business by improving workforce retention.
Raines recalled seeing a recent social media post from a Las Vegas parent saying they had no child care for an elementary-aged child. The parent wanted to know what people thought the best option was: quitting, getting fired, or leaving a 7-year-old home alone for a full shift. The child was enrolled in a summer program but the parent wrote they didn’t have enough money to pay for the upcoming week.
Having to make these sorts of mental calculations in your head isn’t an anomaly for families across the state.
“It happens all the time,” said Raines. “If you want to be able to check out your groceries at the store, have someone make sure your utilities are working, get your oil changed, get your food served… child care is a community issue.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1385208719-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

A U.S. District Court judge ruled that the U.S. Department of Labor violated the law when it terminated contracts with organizations that managed 99 JOb Corps centers throughout the country, including two in Alabama. (Official Department of Labor photograph)A federal judge on Friday prohibited the U.S. Department of Labor from terminating management contracts for 99 of 124 Jobs Corps Centers in the country, keeping the centers in Gadsden and Montgomery open in Alabama for the time being.
U.S. District Judge Dabney L. Friedrich of the District of Columbia wrote that the department violated the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) in closing the centers down.
“The WIOA requires DOL to engage in certain procedures — including a period of notice and comment — before closing any Job Corps center,” Friedrich said in her ruling. “The Department failed to comply with these statutory requirements.”
According to the accompanying news release, a federal district court in New York issued a ruling to halt the closures at the end of June but then narrowed the application of the preliminary injunction to prevent the closing of only 31 job centers while allowing the rest to close in light of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. CASA Inc. that limits the use of preliminary injunctions by lower courts.
Job Corps was established in 1964 by President Lyndon Johnson to provide not only education and job training, but also a place to live for low income individuals.
This ruling halts the closures once more and allows students who are lower income to continue receiving benefits and education.
“This program has consistently reduced unemployment and homelessness, empowered underserved communities — especially for Black and Brown youth—and breaks the cycle of poverty through education, training, and opportunity,” said Scott McCoy, deputy legal director of Southern Poverty Law Center, which sued to block the closures.  “Now is the time to double down: Job Corps is a direct investment in our nation’s future which must be protected, expanded, and fully funded to deliver on its promise of equity and upward mobility.”
In a statement Monday Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed called the ruling “a big win for Montgomery and all of Alabama.”
“Job Corps isn’t just a program — it’s a lifeline,” the statement said. “It creates opportunity, reduces unemployment, and gives hope to those who need it most.”
A message was left with the national and regional office of the Department of Labor on Friday seeking comment. 
The lawsuit is one among many challenging the Trump administration’s attempt to eliminate federal education and training initiatives.
Russell T. Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a May letter to Congress that the administration was eliminating the Job Corps program.
The lawsuit states that the Department of Labor did not follow a prescribed process to eliminate the Job Corps program.
Students enrolled in the program, including Anaria Cabrera, one of the named plaintiffs, would be able to continue with their education. Cabrera is currently studying to obtain a certified nursing assistance degree and was told that she must leave the center.
The department argued that  it was only pausing the operations at the centers and not eliminating them and claimed the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge them.
Montgomery Mayor Steve Reed said the ruling is a win for the city and will ensure that more young people will have access to training and education.
“Job Corps isn’t just a program — it’s a lifeline,” Reed said. “It creates opportunity, reduces unemployment, and gives hope to those who need it most. We’re thankful for this decision, but the fight isn’t over. We need permanent support to protect these vital centers for the future.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Frances-Perkins-building-for-Aug-20-2024-story-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.
Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
 ‘Not a bumper sticker bill’

The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”
In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
 Democrats ‘fight back’

This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.
In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SteveYeager-3-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-29 08:56:44.789860

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture in which officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, although most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health problems in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse, and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health problems.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would harm an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county, and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that – to provide those services,” Archbold said.

Regulating the University of Vermont Medical Center is not a bold solution and should not be messaged that way.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Roger Brown: A response to a commentary on health care costs.","Dear Editor,


With due respect to Julie Wasserman, the Green Mountain Care Board using its legal authority to regulate what has become a de facto public utility is not a bold solution. It is what the board was created to do and should be supported in doing year in and year out.  
I believe the University of Vermont Health Network chose to pursue monopoly market power and has used that to force the highest payor reimbursement rates in the country (the “rescues” of smaller practices and hospitals were purely driven by revenue side economies of scale — there were no savings on the cost side). 
Now there is no choice but to regulate them as such. This is authority given by the Legislature to a board charged with such regulation. That is not a bold solution.

A bold solution? Force the hospital into receivership and bring in competent operational leadership to lower costs across the network. Publicly guarantee the University of Vermont Medical Center debt rating to eliminate the need for cash reserves to hold that debt rating. Sell the hospital to a private group with ownership split between private equity, hospital employees, and the state and community.  
Regulating the University of Vermont Medical Center is not a bold solution and should not be messaged that way.
But yes — this tragedy needs bold solutions and we need to start making some bold changes.

(Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Jim Baird, R-4th, and his wife enjoyed a five-day retreat on Lake Como in Bellagio, Italy, in April 2023. 
In Vienna, U.S. Reps. Rudy Yakym, R-2nd, Erin Houchin, R-9th and former Rep. Larry Bucshon, R-8th, spent an evening at the Spanish Riding School with their spouses in November 2024.
During her 2022 trip to Israel, Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-5th, and her husband stayed in the five-star David Citadel Hotel in Jerusalem and spent an average of $485 per day on meals alone.
Indiana’s representatives saw little expense spared during international trips paid for with special interest groups’ money.
Members of Indiana’s U.S. House of Representatives delegation and their staffers have accepted roughly $640,000 in privately sponsored international travel since 2020, an Arnolt Center for Investigative Journalism analysis of travel disclosures found. 
Six current and former representatives took 26 international trips in those five years, according to congressional travel disclosures, and sent staff members on nine global getaways. Representatives and their staffers took over 138 domestic and international trips sponsored by private organizations for a total cost of over $760,000.
 The Arnolt Center’s review of travel disclosures found:


Baird traveled the most internationally among Indiana’s representatives, taking 10 trips in five years to Israel, United Kingdom, Kenya, Japan, Australia, South Africa, Colombia, Ireland, Spain and Italy, costing $201,133.
Bucshon’s weeklong $35,000 trip to Japan in 2024, was the most expensive. Bucshon and his wife stayed at the Okura Tokyo, a five-star hotel, and ate at fine dining restaurants like NOBU Tokyo on the trip, according to travel disclosures. 
Spousal travel for Baird, Houchin, Spartz, Yakym, Bucshon and Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-3rd, accounted for more than $274,000 worth of privately sponsored travel.
Rep. Andre Carson, D-7th and Rep. Jefferson Shreve, R-6th; plus former Reps. Jim Banks, R-3rd, and Jackie Walorski, R-2nd, did not travel internationally during the last five years, but sent staffers to Somaliland, Gambia, Mexico, Japan and Israel.
Reps. Frank Mrvan, D-1st, and Mark Messmer, R-8th, did not take or send staffers on international trips.

A 2024 investigation by The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland and Boston University found lobbyists use loopholes to fund international and domestic trips for representatives, their families and congressional staffers.
House rules prohibit representatives from knowingly accepting privately funded travel or gifts from registered lobbyists or foreign agents, but interest groups commonly create charitable nonprofit arms to continue sponsoring congressional travel.
Senators are subject to similar regulations for accepting gift travel, but the Senate Ethics Committee does not make the travel filings available. 

This story was written by journalists at the Arnolt Center for Investigative Journalism at Indiana University. Zoe Benson, tanka dhakal, Jon Eckert, Edith Morales, Ethan Roberts and Taylor Satoski are students with the Arnolt Center.

Don Fox, former acting director and general counsel of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said privately sponsored travel for representatives, especially to luxurious destinations with their spouses, is designed to buy access. 
“(Sponsors) get access to lawmakers that you would not otherwise get if you had to schedule an appointment in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
He said that the interests of trip sponsors may impact future votes cast by the representatives. 
“(If) you’re there as a lawmaker, sitting in a committee. It may be a lot harder to cast a vote that is against the wishes of somebody that’s just hosted you and your spouse at an all-inclusive resort than it is somebody with whom you’ve not developed any sort of relationship,” Fox said.  
While lawmakers and their spouses enjoy comfortable accommodations on international trips, experts say these trips may still serve a key function for their official duties. 
Michael Leppert, a former lobbyist and current professor at Indiana University, said congressional travel can offer unique insights into issues that only reading about them may not provide. 
“Actually seeing the issue with your own eyes, touching with your own hands, actually has a big impact,” Leppert said. “Oftentimes, multiple sides of an issue will argue about the reality, and it’s always going to be better if the policymaker can see it and form their own opinion.”
Lawmakers meet with officials, sponsors get access
Zachary McGee, a political science professor at Kenyon College, said congressional travel started for the purpose of being a check on the executive branch. While the executive branch represents the country internationally, the legislative branch plays a crucial role in the country’s foreign relations.
“I do think there’s a legitimate reason for us as Americans to support our members of Congress gathering information on their own in the face of the executive branch no matter who’s in it,” McGee said. “Do they need to stay in the Four Seasons when they do it? No. But in my mind, those are separate questions.”
Discussions during the trips regularly focus on economic relations, national security and U.S. foreign policy by having meetings with government, business and cultural leaders, according to travel itineraries.

Spartz met with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, as well as diplomatic and economic representatives, and received a tour of the Al-Rayyan World Cup Stadium during her 2021 trip to Qatar. The United States Qatar Business Council paid nearly $13,000 for the transportation, food and five nights at the Four Seasons Doha. 
“The Congresswoman periodically participates in official CODELs as part of her work in the House to address foreign policy and conduct oversight, which are part of her congressional duties and responsibilities to the people she represents,” Spartz’s office said in a written statement.
CODELs are congressional delegations that travel internationally and are funded by the government — not privately sponsored trips like Spartz’s trips to Qatar and Israel. Her office did not comment on privately sponsored travel. 
No other representatives agreed to comment for this story.
Steve Dorsey, head of communications and public affairs at the International Committee of the Red Cross acknowledged, in a written statement, that the group organizes trips for staff members of representatives. The organization funded a 2023 trip to Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia for Baird’s legislative director. 
“They enable offices to gain a firsthand understanding of ICRC’s unique role as a neutral and independent humanitarian organization providing protection and assistance to vulnerable populations in conflict settings,” Dorsey said.
Travel disclosures listed 22 sponsor organizations, and only the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Rockefeller Foundation responded to a request for comment. The Rockefeller Foundation provides facilities during trips organized by the Aspen Institute.
While the purpose of these trips is expressly educational, Beth Rosenson, a political science professor at the University of Florida, said that parts of the excursions only seem loosely related to their stated purposes.
“I’m sure some learning goes on, but certainly they build in a lot of time to do things that are not primarily educational,” Rosenson said. 
Craig Holman, a public-interest lobbyist at Public Citizen, said organizations want to peddle influence, so they send representatives on trips to nice places. He said providing travel is far more influential than a lobbyist showing up at the office.
“Privately sponsored travel is usually designed to try and influence the opinions of lawmakers,” Holman said. “It’s most effective when it can be done at a very pleasant resort under nice conditions with your spouse.” 
Luxurious outings are ‘pure influence peddling’
Some international trips are not tailored exclusively to meetings with ambassadors or representatives. 
In November 2024, the Franklin Center for Global Policy Exchange and the Ripon Society hosted Houchin, Yakym, Bucshon, and their spouses in Vienna. Indiana representatives engaged in panels and roundtable discussions on U.S. foreign relations. 
Representatives and their spouses also attended events loosely justified by the educational purpose of the trip. The second day of the Austria trip included a two-hour visit to the Spanish Riding School, where they watched a demonstration of the world-famous Lipizzaner horses in an 18th Century baroque palace.
State agencies spend $5 million on travel in 2024 fiscal year 

“I see it as pure expense and pure influence peddling,” Leppert said. “And coming from someone who used to pedal influence, that’s clearly what some of these trips are.”
The Aspen Institute and Rockefeller Foundation sponsored a five-day trip to a Lake Como retreat in Bellagio, Italy for Baird and his wife in April of 2023. Travel disclosure documents referenced security as a key factor in choosing the location. On the trip, Baird met with executives of the organizations and attended a roundtable discussion that highlighted philanthropic efforts made by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
The Republican Main Street Partnership in 2024 paid $22,722 per representative for Houchin and Bucshon to travel to Florence and Rome, Italy. Attendees received 13 hours of privately guided tours, with stops at the Ferrari factory, the Colosseum and the Vatican, according to travel disclosures. 
Seven hours of the trip were designated for official meetings and “stakeholder presentations,” according to travel disclosures.
Bucshon and his wife received more than $600 a day on food alone in Italy according to his travel disclosure.
The American Israel Education Foundation sponsored separate trips to Israel for Spartz, Baird and Yakym, which included stays at five-star hotels costing an average of $396 per night. The trips all included tours of the Western Wall, The Church of the Holy Sepulchre and Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial and Museum. Congressional delegates met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, as well as the director of Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency.
Baird and his wife stayed at two separate five-star hotels during an August 2024 trip to Ireland. Their stay at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin cost $449 per night and the Merchant Hotel in Belfast cost $315 per night, according to travel disclosures.
Little impact at home with representatives away
Indiana representatives rarely issued press releases or public statements explaining the benefit of the sponsored international trips. The Arnolt Center reviewed representatives’ websites looking for connections to international destinations for mentions of the countries they visited.
“Travel provides the members of Congress with the opportunity to get to know their constituents and vice versa,” Holman said. “When we talk about foreign travel, it usually doesn’t provide constituents with much benefit.” 
One exception was Baird and Bucshon’s meetings with the Congressional Study Group on Japan’s Business Advisory Council with executives from Honda and Toyota. Both companies operate assembly plants in Indiana.
After Carson’s staff trip to Somaliland, he signed a letter to then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging the State Department to establish an embassy in the region as a part of his role on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Following Baird, Yakym and Spartz’s trips to Israel, the representatives all posted on social media about their continued support for an American-Israeli alliance. The three representatives have no references to any other international travel they took sponsored by private organizations, the Arnolt Center found.
Rosenson said representatives in competitive electoral districts tend to travel less to avoid electoral blowback.
“Constituents don’t think highly of this,” Rosenson said. “The average constituent thinks this is some trip that I’m not going to go on, this is bad news, this is unsavory. And that might be one reason they vote against the legislators.”
Expert: Reform efforts lacking
In 2007, Congress passed the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which Holman helped write, to restrict lobbying groups’ ability to fund congressional travel. 
“We saw a radical decrease in privately sponsored travel after 2008, by about two-thirds,” Holman said. “They’ve increased in time, but they’re not at the level they used to be prior to 2008.” 
The House Clerk’s Office is only required to publish travel data for the last six years.
The attempt at reform created a new loophole and allowed 501(c)(4) political action organizations to make charitable arms to continue paying for trips. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, for example, created a 501(c)(3) charity arm that allowed it to fund congressional travel while keeping lobbyists involved, which Holman called the “AIPAC loophole.” 
Restrictions on privately funded travel still exist, but Holman said he expects congressional travel rules to weaken as special interest groups and Congress try to loosen them. 
Holman said he’s concerned about Congress’ self-policing of travel rules and the lack of an independent body to oversee ethics concerns outside of the House Committee on Ethics. 
“It’s up to watchdog groups to catch the abuses,” Holman said. “The Congressional Ethics Committee are members of Congress themselves overseeing their fellow colleagues. So, they are not great ethics cops.”
McGee said while there is significant oversight in the details of planned travel itineraries, there is no legitimate oversight about whether the itineraries are followed.
“We’ve got to figure out where to draw the line between allowing members of Congress to accept some travel and trying to eliminate the role of lobbyists and influence peddling out of these types of free trips,” Holman said. “It’s a difficult line to draw.”

The money is part of multistate settlements with Purdue Pharma, Alvogen, Amneal, Apotex, Hikma, Indivior, Mylan, Sun, and Zydus. 
The Purdue Pharma settlement was announced on June 16. The other eight settlements were announced July 10. 
Signups for local governments to get in on the settlements opened Monday. While there is no deadline to join the $16.7 million settlement with the eight generic opioid manufacturers, the deadline to join the $105.5 million settlement with Purdue Pharma is Sept. 30. 
The attorney general’s office encourages local governments to sign up for all nine settlements and complete other related paperwork at the same time.
These settlements will be paid out over 15 years, with much of the funding distributed in the first three years. 
If all eligible city and county governments join the settlements, it would raise the total amount of money the attorney general’s office has won from opioid manufacturers to $1.3 billion. 
This money is designated for programs that combat the opioid epidemic, support first responders, build treatment clinics, and provide overdose reversal kits.
In 2024, fatal overdoses in Washington totaled 3,137, according to preliminary data released in June by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That marked an 11% decline from the prior year, but the deaths were still 14% higher than in 2022.
The powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl has driven increases in fatal overdoses in recent years.
“Companies made millions while our communities were harmed because of the opioid epidemic,” Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement on Monday. “These funds can help save lives and support community projects across the state.”
Under the terms of an agreement, city and county governments will collectively receive 50% of Washington’s share of the settlement, and the state government will receive the other 50%. 
Of the state’s $61.1 million share, 20% will go to Washington’s tribal communities. 
Cities and counties split the money based on a formula developed through the One Washington Memorandum of Understanding, according to the attorney general’s office. Cities are eligible for funds based on their size from 2019 U.S. Census Bureau estimates. 
A total of 129 local governments in Washington are eligible for settlement funding. If all of them sign up for the nine settlements, each local government would receive between $18,300 and $840,000. 
As with the prior opioid settlements, the new amounts are contingent on eligible cities and counties in Washington state joining. If not enough cities and counties join, the settlement is void, according to the Brown’s office. 
“For every other prior opioid settlement, 100% of eligible counties and cities in Washington have joined, and we’re hopeful the same thing will happen this time,” said Ashley Goss, spokesperson for the attorney general’s Office. 
Lower participation by local governments reduces the portion the state receives, according to Goss.  
The Attorney General’s Office is maintaining a tracker showing the status of eligible governments’ signup forms. The tracker will be updated every few weeks initially and then more often as the Sept. 30 deadline nears.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/opioids-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 07:56:17.739876
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-29 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Saving for a future, paying for a funeral: Why are many families of young crime victims shut out of state compensation?",Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/29/many-families-of-crime-victims-shut-out-of-state-compensation/,Mississippi has one of the highest denial rates in the country for crime victim compensation attributed to “contributory misconduct.”,"Lucinda Wade-Robinson watched her 22-year-old son, Zachary, hit the pavement feet from her front door on April 28, 2014. She saw the shooter and his friends hightail it to the highway. She helped her son into a neighbor’s car as he bled out. After he was pronounced dead at a hospital and investigators processed the crime scene in her front yard, she says she waited weeks for the fire department to bleach his blood from her bullet-strewn driveway.
Wade-Robinson, worried she wouldn’t be able to cover the $8,000 funeral bill, applied in Hinds County for help from Mississippi’s victim compensation program, a fund that each state has to reimburse victims of crime and their families for funeral expenses, medical costs, crime scene clean-up, execution travel and counseling, among other disbursements. 
A funeral home director told Wade-Robinson about it and suggested she apply. But the state attorney general’s office, which administers the program, denied her claim, alleging her son was responsible for his death, a type of denial known as contributory misconduct. 
“It was a nightmare,” said Wade-Robinson.
Mississippi’s definition of what kind of conduct contributes to one’s death is broader than most states, and a Mississippi Today investigation found that Wade-Robinson’s denial is not unusual. Mississippi has one of the highest rates of denials attributed to “contributory misconduct” when compared to other states, with about 6% of all applicants getting denied for this reason.
Mississippi’s overall denial rate is 42%, for years 2021 to 2024. From 2021 to 2023, roughly 2% of claims were reduced.
Arkansas, West Virginia and South Dakota have similar outcomes, with all four states rejecting for contributory misconduct at roughly three times the national average, according to federal data collected between 2017 and 2023.
It’s the language of the law that makes Mississippi unique, according to Jeremy Levine, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan who’s published research on victim compensation. If the victim makes “threatening and obscene gestures,” uses “fighting words,” even if the behavior was not directly connected to the circumstances of the person’s death, they would be ruled ineligible for compensation. The law also asks administrators of the fund to consider the victim’s behavior in the weeks leading up to their death.
The law is broad and open to interpretation, particularly when it comes to blaming victims for inciting their own killing.
“The provocation point is really fuzzy,” said Levine, and Mississippi “is on the top end of vagueness and discretionary openness.”
More than a third of compensation applicants in Hinds County were denied reimbursement from 2021 through 2024, according to records obtained by Mississippi Today. The attorney general’s office rejected 169 claims because of administrative rules like contributory misconduct. It approved 291 claims with a payment.
Mississippi’s victim compensation records are secret, according to a law enacted in 2000, meaning there is no way to assess racial and geographic bias in verdicts. And while these types of denials are falling nationwide, according to federal records, they are increasing in Mississippi, the poorest state with the highest homicide rate per capita.

“A lot of these exceptions make assumptions about communities and blame victims for their own deaths,” said Rep. John Hines, a Democrat from Greenville, a city with one of the highest gun homicide rates in the state.
The attorney general’s office chose not to provide comment. A spokesperson from the Office of Justice Programs in the U.S. Department of Justice wrote that eligibility requirements are at the discretion of states.
The attorney general paid victims an average of $1,877 less in 2024. The average claim was $2,459.
Contributory misconduct rejections can present an arbitrary barrier to financial help for victims of crime, said Tina Rogers, a victim assistance coordinator in Columbus, Mississippi.
“It is subjective and can be skewed depending on the type of crime,” wrote Rogers.
Not innocent enough

Wade-Robinson didn’t leave her house after her son’s death. Zachary Robinson had still been living in the family home; his sudden absence was painful. She was spending more quiet afternoons replaying the killing she watched take place from behind her front door.
Wade-Robinson appealed the contributory misconduct denial. As she waited for an answer, the prosecutor informed her that charges would not be pursued against her son’s alleged shooter and the six men who accompanied him. The Jackson Police Department determined Robinson’s murder was a self-defense killing. The victim compensation director swiftly issued a second denial letter, citing the department’s finding.
“It was like being victimized again,” Wade-Robinson said. 
Wade-Robinson was hurt. Seven men had come to their house with weapons, she said. After one man came to their door to threaten his mother, Robinson carried a concealed weapon outside and yelled at the men to leave their house, Wade-Robinson remembers. In return, they shot him. And as the seven men sped off, her son’s friend, Lamont Ford, returned fire.
Mississippi has a castle doctrine or “stand your ground” law. But the attorney general’s hearing officer felt it didn’t apply.
“Although the Hearing Officer certainly recognizes Victim’s Second Amendment right to bear arms, Victim was clearly the initial aggressor and his display of a firearm in this circumstance caused another individual to fear imminent death,” the hearing officer said.
Local law enforcement must typically summarize the victim’s involvement in the crime and fill out a document that asks if the victim’s behavior in any way contributed to the person’s death because of drugs and alcohol or fighting words. When it comes to how law enforcement officers interpret how and if a victim’s conduct led to the individual’s death, rationale varies by department and agency.
Law enforcement initially charged Ford, Robinson’s friend, with murder in Robinson’s death, but an assistant district attorney in that office couldn’t explain why. The charge was downgraded to shooting into a dwelling. Ford’s shots missed, entering a nearby home and a delivery driver’s car.
Wade-Robinson didn’t miss a day of the trial. And when the jury found Ford not guilty, Wade-Robinson requested that the victim compensation division reconsider its denial of her claim.
On March 31, 2016, at a private hearing held at the attorney general’s office in Jackson, Wade-Robinson’s claim was denied for the second and final time. The hearing officer cited her son’s “displaying of his weapon” and his refusal to call the police. They also cited his decision to drive to his home where two cars of potential adversaries were parked. 
“He was acting in a provoking manner that was greater than that of the offender,” testified Amy King, director of Crime Victim Compensation. “Robinson had used fighting words and obscene and threatening gestures based on the information that we received. And whether or not there was a causal relationship between his actions and the incident, I determined that there were.”
“So, I did find some level of responsibility on his part,” she added.
Being under the influence and taking risks isn’t behavior that would lead to outright denials by victim compensation programs in most other states.
The director also mentioned Robinson’s gun possession. 
Mississippi has the most relaxed gun laws in the country. During the pandemic, then-Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba tried to temporarily ban open carry of firearms in the wake of increased violence only to have Attorney General Lynn Fitch ask him to rescind it because it was in violation of the state’s open carry law.
During the trial of Lamont Ford, witnesses were grilled about their gun possession too. 
“I fear for my life when I come to Jackson,” said one of the witnesses. “I always keep a gun in my car.”

‘A national disgrace’
Some advocates, academics and victims argue Mississippi’s crime victim compensation division has failed to live up to the vision set forth by its chief architect, President Ronald Reagan.
In 1982, Reagan assembled a task force that looked into how national, local and state policies treat crime victims. The task force found treatment of crime victims to be a “national disgrace.” 
Reagan signed the Victims of Crime Act into law two years later, which established a fund for each state to disperse to “innocent” victims of crime. In 1991, Mississippi established its division responsible for dispersing money. 
Since establishment of the fund, many states have narrowed their definitions of “contributory misconduct” or removed it as a criterion for eligibility because of disproportionately high rejection rates for minorities and advocacy efforts from victim rights’ groups.
In a 2005 Kansas Supreme Court ruling, judges found that “contributory misconduct” must be directly contributory, ruling against the state’s Crime Victim Compensation Board. A couple had victim compensation diminished for their son who had died in a car wreck that was no fault of his own. The board had found that their underage son had drunk alcohol the night before and therefore had a blood alcohol content level that was illegal for someone his age at the time of his death. The board wrongfully reasoned, the court found, that this crime had contributed to his death.
Ohio in 2021 put a stop to rejections due to mere drug possession and allegations made about victims’ behavior leading up to their death. Pennsylvania prohibited the denial of claims for funeral reimbursements based on “contributory misconduct” in 2022. New Jersey, Delaware, and New Hampshire have made similar changes.
The Justice Department announced it would look into how subjective metrics like “contributory misconduct” can disproportionately discriminate against Black applicants. The DOJ’s announcement came on the heels of a 2024 Associated Press investigation, analyzing data in 23 states, which found that Black applicants for victim compensation were disproportionately denied at a higher rate for subjective reasons “rooted in implicit bias” like contributory misconduct.
On April 5, a group of 18 attorneys general, including Mississippi’s, joined Alabama’s attorney general and objected to what they perceived as the DOJ’s overreach. They found the updated guidelines “exceeded the agency’s authority” and “could result in the States losing vital funding for their victim compensation programs.”
“State resources available to compensate crime victims are not limitless,” argued Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall. “States thus have always had to make choices about how to justly allocate these funds,” he wrote, and this includes considering “whether an applicant was partially responsible for the crime that harmed him rather than being a purely innocent bystander.”
Scant resources for innocent crime victims is a common argument made by proponents of using the “contributory misconduct” stipulation to assess victim compensation claims. Applicants in Mississippi can also be denied if the victim or applicant has a prior felony conviction, didn’t cooperate with law enforcement or prosecutors and applied for ineligible reimbursement categories like property damage, to name a few.
At the end of Financial Year 2024 after all the reimbursements were paid, Mississippi’s crime victim compensation fund had at least $2 million unspent.
By the end of 2021’s reporting period, with 81 more homicides reported in Mississippi, rejections on the basis of contributory misconduct nearly doubled despite a slight increase in applications.
Crime victim compensation programs are mostly funded by court fines and fees, not taxpayer money. Traffic tickets, felony murder convictions and federal judgments all generate money for the fund. State legislatures and the federal government appropriate money, too.
Even Mississippi crime victims who are approved for victim compensation can wait months to over a year for reimbursement. Neighboring Louisiana offers $500 in emergency funds to victims to help cover immediate costs like medical expenses, crime scene clean-up and lost wages.
In 2023, reimbursements for funerals accounted for more than half of funds paid out. Funeral home directors can fill out forms for crime victim compensation, too, applying on behalf of the victim.
Scotty Meredith runs Meredith-Nowell Funeral Home in Clarksdale on top of serving as coroner for Coahoma County. The small Mississippi Delta city experienced a 250% increase in homicides from 2023 to 2024, with four in 2023 and 14 in 2024. Meredith’s funeral home has gained a reputation in the county as a place to seek help filling out applications for crime victim compensation. But when it comes to the contributory aspect, he finds it hard to anticipate who the division will reject.
“It helps the family at a tough time,” he said, sitting in a room dedicated to grief counseling and funeral planning. The Delta is the state’s poorest region and has the highest number of gun homicides per capita. “It takes a big burden off a family that is already grieving.” 
In Mississippi Today’s discussions with 17 funeral homes across the state, 10 confirmed they no longer handle services for families who depend on victim compensation funds to pay for the funeral. It’s too much of a gamble for some, given how subjective the criteria can be.
Funeral home director William Jefferson Jr. of W.H. Jefferson Funeral Home in Vicksburg helped out a young apprentice’s family with a discounted rate after their claim for their son’s funeral was rejected. 
The director had cited marijuana found in his toxicology report, Jefferson said.

Marijuana was cited in 15-year-old Kayden Mohon’s toxicology report – and in the denial letter sent to his mother Angel Mohon.
Angel Mohon found out about the killing through a social media post circulated by the teenagers she believes responsible for his death. For her, it was a nightmare come true. On a day when she should’ve been celebrating his 16th birthday, Mohon was burying her son.
During Memorial Day Weekend, he was driving his friend home after a pool party in Brookhaven. As he braked near the stop sign on Ozark Lane, shots rang out from the field beside him. His car was riddled with bullets in seconds.
A home security camera captured the shooting: Kayden Mohon opened the driver’s side door as bullets continued to hit the car and the gravel road in front of him. He was driven home to the friend’s house down the street where he succumbed to his injuries and police were called.
Brookhaven Police Department communicated to the attorney general’s office that his death was the result of his own negligence. They labeled it a shootout – and made no arrests. Allegations made in the crime victim letter of Mohon’s firearm usage are not supported by the incident report, which doesn’t identify him with a gun.
Angel Mohon reached out to Brookhaven PD to share the home security camera footage that might exonerate her dead son. But they wouldn’t watch. 
So, she took off work as a home health care aide and decided to investigate.
She first tracked down the Toyota Corolla in which her son was killed. She traveled to an Enterprise Rent-A-Car lot in Natchez where the vehicle was towed. She interviewed neighbors who lived on the street where the shooting took place, one shared home security camera footage that cast the incident in a new light. She interviewed a witness to the killing, her son’s friends and knocked on the doors of local parents.
In the weeks after Kayden’s death, Kenny Collins, Brookhaven’s longtime police chief, stepped down. Under his leadership, the department was criticized for incompetence and shoddy police work. The county’s grand jury that considered more than 60 criminal cases found that the “complacent” Brookhaven Police Department “shows a lack of professionalism,” “has a habit of witness blaming” and is prone to “poorly investigating their cases.”
Under new leadership, the police department is reinvestigating several cases and is hiring a new investigator. When Mississippi Today brought Mohon’s case to the new chief’s attention, he confirmed that the case will undergo new scrutiny.
Mohon is still afraid to leave her home. The boys responsible for her son’s murder have threatened to target her next. They have driven by her home and harassed the family from their vehicles, she says. One wears a sweatshirt bearing an image of her son’s dead body.
“It hurts,” she said. “Every time I sit still for too long or I close my eyes, all I see is my baby’s body lying on the ground.”
Kayden was taking classes in welding at the time of his death. His mom was picking up extra shifts as a home health care aide to help pay for the costs of his training. Angel Mohon had also recently taught him to drive.

“Why kill my child? Because he had a life, he had a future. He had hopes and dreams that he was fulfilling.”
Mohon doesn’t know how she will come up with the $7,000 to pay for the funeral. She is three months behind on her car payments and was told she would lose her only source of transportation next month if she couldn’t come up with $500.
The victim’s voice
When it comes to assessing a victim’s hand in their death, law enforcement officers are the first arbiters. In Mississippi, officers must file their assessment of victim involvement in a crime within 30 days of the victim’s survivors applying.
A law enforcement officer in Sunflower County, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of losing his job, said he checks the contributory box only if the victim “brought the fight to somebody else.”
Funding for local law enforcement agencies prevented officer salaries from keeping pace with inflation – and many Mississippi departments operate on small budgets with less staff than they require. Three police chiefs interviewed complain that witnesses are often reluctant to share information, and the department lacks the budget to retain talent.

Greenville Police Chief Marcus Turner recently mandated that all officers provide crime victim compensation applications to families regardless of what responding officers make of the crime scene at first. Even the family of victims responsible for their deaths need our support, Turner said. He also brings sympathy cards to the victim’s home before any interviews take place.
“It’s our responsibility to speak for the victim,” Turner said. “When there’s a murder, you have a suspect and a victim. The victim can’t say anything.”
Mississippi has few nonprofits or charities dedicated to helping crime victims cover even basic burial costs and that provide counseling to immediate relatives of homicide victims. Churches occasionally step in to cover burial costs for longtime parishioners who were the victims of crime. Stewpot, a homeless shelter in Jackson, will occasionally help pay for burial costs of low-income crime victims.
“The survivors of homicide are forgotten on every level,” said Felecia Marshall, founder and CEO of Grant Me Justice, a nonprofit that helps crime victim families navigate the criminal justice system, cover the costs of counseling and pay for burials. “Many parents are not prepared. There are so many layers that the family has to deal with while they are grieving.”
Legally, counties must have a plan in place for burial of paupers, or those who die without a place for their body. State law does not mandate that a pauper burial be marked, though many counties do.
Unmarked
No tombstone marks Chris Magsby’s grave. Jean Tenner, Magsby’s mother and a longtime employee at the Horseshoe Casino in Tunica, had a hard enough time covering the costs of his funeral before her claim was denied.
“I shouldn’t have to do this all by myself,” said Tenner, a single mother with another son in the armed services.
In 2023, Magsby was driving his youngest son when his cousin Decedron Johnson began to threaten him over the phone, trailing him in his car. The two pulled their cars off the road and when Magsby stepped out of his, Johnson started shooting. Johnson was later arrested in Clarksdale, and Magsby was pronounced dead at a hospital.
At the funeral, Magsby was laid to rest in a scarlet casket. Tenner still didn’t know how she’d pay for it. She neglected to make her car payments so she could save to give her son a proper sendoff. But she never saved enough.
While Johnson was out on bail pending a trial, the victim compensation division was still investigating Tenner’s claim for victim compensation. 
On July 22, 2023, over a month after the funeral, Tenner got her response: The Mississippi Attorney General’s Office had rejected her claim on the grounds her son had been on probation for a felony conviction. Magsby was never convicted of a felony.
On Aug. 18, 2023, her claim was rejected for a second time, this time on a posthumous accusation that he committed a felony at the time of his death. Police allegedly found a bag of cocaine in his car, which indicated to the attorney general’s office that he was not an innocent victim at the time of his death, and therefore, his mother would be ineligible for compensation. 
Also, his posthumous commission of a felony broke his non-adjudication agreement, meaning he was back under the supervision of the Mississippi Department of Corrections – another disqualifier. The initial charge was for “trespassing” into a local business when he was a teenager.
Tenner’s denial is hardly unique in the Mississippi suburbs of Memphis, Tennessee, where a tough-on-crime approach by law enforcement often puts victims under suspicion. The AG’s office denied over half of DeSoto County victims’ compensation claims from 2021 through 2023, records show.
Tenner struggled to make sense of the division’s decision in light of what she knew about her son. In the years before his death, Magsby had received his high school equivalency diploma, moved from the Delta to Horn Lake with his burgeoning family and secured a job at a nearby factory. 
Tenner thinks of her son every day, especially how he used to love to take his kids on trips to Disney World and to water parks in nearby Arkansas. She hopes her grandkids will get to go on another trip soon – but they haven’t since Magsby’s passing. Her grandson, who witnessed his father’s death, needs therapy, said Tenner, but with her debts from her son’s death, she feels that counseling is a long way off for the toddler.
As crime increases, more parents are finding themselves struggling with the financial aftermath of their child’s murder, said Turner, Greenville’s police chief. 
“Now, we’re living in a time where young people are losing their lives every day, and the parents are not in the position to have them covered under any type of burial or life insurance,” he said. 
Every witness or person present when Robinson, Magbsby and Mohon were killed, including the victim, were younger than 30. Since 2013, the number of young crime victims has more than tripled; 338 Mississippians younger than 34 were gun homicide victims in 2023.
Acceptance
Every year, Wade-Robinson attends the Christmas tree decorating party for crime victims hosted by the attorney general’s office. The office usually hires musicians to sing hymns and holiday songs. The families of crime victims hang ornaments on branches while the staff greet grieving families. Last year, she cried, touched by a rendition of “How Great Thou Art.”
Scott Colom, a district attorney in Columbus, organizes a similar event for each family at the end of trials. He plants a tree with the victim’s family in an intimate ceremony outside the courthouse. Victim coordinator Tina Rogers sings hymns and popular music.

“Grief is going to be long, but this tree’s going to be here longer,” Colom said, explaining the ceremony. “The victim’s going to be here, too. They can survive it. They can withstand it. They’ve got a reason to live on.”
He has also appealed crime victim compensation denials, in one case because the applicant was a few days from meeting the five-year threshold from a felony conviction. His appeal was ignored. The division upheld all 54 denials that were appealed on paper or in a hearing in 2021, 2022 and 2023, according to records obtained.
“The only way we’re going to be able to successfully prosecute violent crime is cooperation from victims and survivors,” Colom said. “And if victims and survivors and witnesses have a negative impression of the criminal justice system, that decreases the chances that they’re going to cooperate, which decreases our chances of being able to prosecute crime.”
Restitution is the only other type of compensation available to crime victims. Their families can request that a judge order the offender to pay them for counseling and property damage, among other expenses. But restitution isn’t possible until a person has been successfully prosecuted – an obstacle for mothers of murdered sons in counties with low clearance rates.

Robinson was involved in his community, Wade-Robinson remembers. He used to love to ride his grandfather’s horse at his farm in Terry and hunt deer. Robinson was recruited to play the tuba in high school, where he also excelled on the football field. He won an academic honor in his senior year and graduated with honors from his automotive course. 
“It’s hard to forget someone who gave you so much to remember,” began a resolution honoring Robinson, issued by his high school a week after his death. “We recognize that this temporary loss is Heaven’s ultimate gain.”
The city of Jackson did finally settle a wrongful death suit with Wade-Robinson’s family for an undisclosed sum on Dec. 13, 2017.
But grieving and seeking justice for her son still keeps her up at night. 
“I just can’t understand how you treat victims like this,” she said.

But I also know the long, painful history of how systemic racism, redlining, and disinvestment have shaped their lives — and too often robbed them of the opportunities they deserve.
We are at a pivotal moment.
Under Mayor Brandon Scott’s leadership and through the significant investments of the Baltimore Children & Youth Fund (BCYF), we’re beginning to witness serious efforts to address some of these historical injustices. However, if we genuinely want to create a better future for our young people, we must dig deeper.
That means making real investments in grassroots, Black- and brown-led organizations that have been holding up our youth for decades. It also means our city must shift from gatekeeping to genuine partnership with community leaders and young people.
The disinvestment in Baltimore’s youth programs isn’t new. We’ve experienced it through shuttered rec centers, aging school buildings, and neighborhoods lacking safe places for kids to grow and thrive.
Despite the odds, Baltimore is lucky to have incredible grassroots organizations that have never stopped showing up for our young people.
Groups like Let’s Thrive Baltimore, in Sandtown, provide mentorship and violence interruption led by individuals who have lived the same struggles, while in Cherry Hill, the Restoring Inner-City Hope Program (RICH) offers job readiness training, mental health support and violence prevention workshops. Other programs have creative approaches, like For My Kidz, in West Baltimore, which creates spaces where young people can express themselves through the arts and build leadership skills, or Aziza Peace, a citywide program offering healing-centered programs that help youth process trauma and build resilience.

These are just some of the many groups helping Baltimore’s youth see a pathway forward. And yet, they’re underfunded while larger, often white-led organizations — sometimes with only loose ties to the communities they serve — receive the bulk of the resources.
Thankfully, that’s starting to change. BCYF’s recent $9.55 million investment in summer programming and the creation of the Youth Athletics Fund — a partnership between the Mayor’s Office, Baltimore City Public Schools, and BCYF — are giant steps forward. These investments are not just about money. They signal that Baltimore is serious about changing the game for our youth.
Mayor Scott’s administration has shown a real commitment to listening to communities and prioritizing equity. But we need to keep pushing. While large organizations have their place, the work that changes lives happens closest to the ground — by trusted, community-rooted groups. They deserve not just our thanks but sustained, meaningful investment.
This is where the City Council comes in. Our councilmembers can move away from top-down, politically driven decisions and instead build true partnerships with grassroots leaders. That means showing up in neighborhoods regularly, listening to young people and all community members and making decisions based on what they hear and know, not just what looks good on paper.
One young person who participated in the Nobody Asked Me Campaign’s Elevating Youth Voice study summed it up perfectly when asked about Baltimore’s politicians: “It’s like we’re invited to the party, but never asked to dance.” We have to do better than that.
We also need a long-term strategy to keep this work moving forward, and can look to other cities facing similar challenges for ideas.
In New Orleans, for example, young people and grassroots organizations collaborated with city leaders in 2020 to develop a Youth Masterplan, outlining long-term strategies that align services, funding and accountability across various agencies. It’s working — and we can do the same here.
In Baltimore, a longer-term strategy should prioritize funding for grassroots, Black- and brown-led organizations, while centering youth leadership and voice at every stage.
All of this will require coordinated efforts across city agencies, nonprofits, schools and businesses to maximize impact. To ensure transparency and accountability, regular public reporting can keep the community informed and involved.
A plan like this would provide Baltimore with a roadmap — a bold, shared vision that ensures every young person has access to opportunities, support, and joy, regardless of their ZIP code.

Donors and their contribution amounts were available July 2, 2024, when The Independent accessed the information and published a report three days later showing the largest donors to the program at the time were a Fortune 500 health care corporation, a cable company and the founding family of the Kansas City Chiefs.
When the article was released, the State Treasurer’s Office called The Independent to ask how the information was accessed. The office didn’t seem to be aware that the list was available on a state-run website detailing state spending.
According to Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, donor information was wiped by the end of the month.
Jackson Bailey, chief of staff to Missouri Treasurer Vivek Malek, chalked the situation up to a “clerical error,” saying the office never intended the information to be posted in the first place.
The office declined to answer further questions on the removal, including whether or not the information is available upon request. 
In 2022, Missouri lawmakers passed a law to shield nonprofits from being forced to disclose donor information. And it was quickly used to conceal public records, such as then-Gov. Mike Parson redacting the names of donors and attendees of his holiday gala.
A year later, lawmakers approved a fix to the law clarifying how it should be implemented.  
Missouri’s tax-credit scholarship program, called MOScholars, is set up using state-approved nonprofits. Donors apply for a tax credit through the State Treasurer’s Office and donate to the nonprofits, which are called educational assistance organizations. At tax time, they are able to deduct the donation amount from their state tax obligations, so long as it’s less than half of their total bill.

Because the program is set up using private nonprofit organizations as an intermediary, the state might be barred, or at least exempt, from disclosing the donation information, according to Dave Roland, director of litigation at the Freedom Center of Missouri.
Programs like MOScholars, Roland said, are “specifically designed to have the funding treated as private money rather than public money.”
“Due to the connection to a government-created program, the government might be able to require public disclosure of the persons donating to these programs (and thus receiving the tax credits), but they are not obligated to make this information public if they don’t want to,” he wrote in an email.
But for those wary about the MOScholars program, less transparency only makes frustrations worse.
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, has been a vocal critic of MOScholars and has sought clarity from program administrators, including Malek. In 2024, Beck asked for “all the data” the office had compiled on MOScholars and received a screenshot of a webpage with basic demographic information.
“We should have accountability and transparency,” he told The Independent. “We don’t know where the money is coming from. We don’t know how much money it is. How do we know it’s getting where it is supposed to go?”
He pointed to a report from the State Auditor’s Office released earlier this month which called out Malek’s office for depositing $35 million of general revenue into the wrong fund.
The audit also identified a lack of transparency in the administration of the MOScholars program. The treasurer’s office wasn’t hiring annual audits of the program as required and it missed inconsistencies in quarterly reports from educational assistance organizations.
Trent Blair, director of programs in the State Treasurer’s Office, told The Independent that the office has already rectified this mistake and recently hired an auditing company.
The demand for more oversight of MOScholars has accelerated in recent months, with state lawmakers passing a $51 million direct appropriation to the program. A lawsuit filed at the beginning of July is challenging the constitutionality of the funding windfall.
But Blair, when asked if Missourians should feel safe handing over $50 million in the wake of oversight issues, said taxpayers could trust the state.
“There are no fewer accountability issues with this program than any other,” he said in an email. “So Missourians should feel confident about the fiscal responsibility associated with this appropriation.”

Why should we let them undo the laws and policies we approve?
Left unaddressed, it gives tacit approval and sanctions a dangerous and destructive practice.
Ultimately, Missourians pay the price.
We run the risk of being rendered totally voiceless, having less or no say at all about many aspects of our daily lives.
When it comes to maintaining and exercising our inalienable individual rights. When it comes to how we provide for our families, educate our kids, where we live, the quality of housing, employment, on and on.
This is evident in the actions taken during the last legislative session, and legislative sessions in the recent past.
Some important measures the majority of Missourians voted for have been undone, or will be undone, and the impending results will not be in the best interest of many Missourians.
The most recent is that hard-working employees will be denied access to paid sick leave. More than 58% of voters, through an initiative petition, passed a measure last November that would allow Missouri workers to accrue paid sick leave, beginning this past May 1. On Aug. 28, those workers will lose what has been accrued and will not be able to accrue any time moving forward.
The governor signed a bill rescinding paid sick leave for workers, succumbing to powerful business lobbyists, under the guise of protecting job-creating businesses.
But the governor was not alone in ignoring the vote of the people.
The majority in the Missouri Senate invoked a rarely-used rule to force the bill to the governor’s desk. This was done even after the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the paid sick leave law following vigorous challenges by businesses and other interest groups.
Do Missouri workers not deserve to have earned paid time off to recover from an illness or to take care of a family member who has fallen ill?
Could businesses not have made or negotiated some level of accrued paid sick leave based upon what they could afford? Wouldn’t workers have understood and accepted such modified arrangements based on the nature or state of the business?
In addition to paid sick leave being taken away, the bill also repeals the required annual adjustment to the minimum wage based on inflation — a provision that had been in effect since 2006.
How does taking away paid sick leave and denying annual adjustments to the minimum wage help Missouri families?
Repealing paid sick leave was not the only overt disregard and dismissal after voters’ approval.
‘Kicked a hornet’s nest’: Missouri GOP repeal of voter-approved laws inspires backlash

Even though a majority of voters, 52%, approved a constitutional amendment that reinstated the right for women to access abortion, the legislature passed an amendment with disguised language to be put on the ballot in 2026 to once again ban abortion.
We all should be concerned about the pattern to undo or subvert the vote of the majority of people of Missouri. But ignoring and undermining the will of Missourians just didn’t begin with the last legislature.
In August 2020, voters approved an amendment for Medicaid expansion. In March of the following year, the legislature voted down funding for the expansion even though the state was sitting on a record budget surplus in the general fund.
After many challenges and court battles, Medicaid expansion was finally funded and enrollment of the thousands of eligible Missourians began in October of 2021.
Denial of paid sick leave, abortion care and Medicaid funding are areas that get the most attention. What about other less visible areas being impacted by elected officials undoing the wishes of the people?
There is a trend of undermining voters in less visible areas, too.
In 2010, a majority of voters approved a law to implement tougher rules on dog breeders. Months later the legislature passed a bill to weaken and reverse portion of that law.
In 2018, a constitutional amendment that would have required legislative districts to be drawn to ensure partisan fairness, known as the Clean Missouri initiative, passed with 62% of the vote. In 2021, state lawmakers put a measure on the ballot to repeal that amendment. It garnered 51% of the vote and the Clean Missouri initiative was never implemented.
During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers passed a bill that renders existing laws unenforceable that prevent landlords from discriminating against renters who receive public assistance.
Missouri public schools have dire needs. Yet $51 million of taxpayers’ dollars are designated for private school vouchers in the current budget.
A majority of voters oppose the state controlling police departments. But it does in St. Louis and Kansas City.
Some advocacy and coalition groups are beginning to organize and raise money to support counter-initiatives that aim to reinstate or stop the most recent actions of the legislature taken to undo the will of Missouri voters, and to make it more difficult for future legislators to continue this practice.
The overriding question: what are we willing to do about votes being nullified, our tax dollars misused, and our wishes ignored?
Are we contacting — through calls, letters, personal visits — our elected representatives to express our displeasure and demanding that the needs of the majority of voters should be their priority?
Are we doing research to determine who or what influences representatives decisions?
Are we organizing and educating voters to participate in upcoming elections?
We all can do something.
Other than waiting around, wondering what will be taken from the people of Missouri.
What will be next?

Mikie Sherrill will face off in November in the governor's race. (Photos by Reena Rose Sibayan/Amanda Brown)A new poll of the New Jersey governor’s race finds Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, leading Republican Jack Ciattarelli by eight points, with 16% of respondents still undecided.
The Fairleigh Dickinson University poll of likely voters has Sherrill ahead of Ciattarelli 45% to 37%. The two are squaring off in November to succeed two-term Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who can’t seek a third term in the fall.
“While Republicans have been narrowing the gap, there are still more Democrats than Republicans in the state, and Ciattarelli needs to start pulling in more independents and Democrats if he wants to win,” said Dan Cassino, a Fairleigh Dickinson professor and the poll’s director.
A Rutgers-Eagleton poll from earlier this month gave Sherrill a 20-point lead.
Republicans have viewed polls of the race with skepticism, noting that polls released in the weeks before the 2021 governor’s race — when Ciattarelli tried to unseat Murphy — showed Murphy with big leads, though his winning margin ended up being just three points.
Results from the new Fairleigh Dickinson poll reveal why Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, has been intent on shifting focus to local issues, despite Sherrill’s push to tie him to President Donald Trump.
After respondents were initially asked which candidate they preferred, they were randomly assigned questions about either local or national issues. Respondents were then asked again about their vote choice.
Those in the local framing group answered questions about NJ Transit, energy policy, farmland development, flood prevention infrastructure, the state’s response to extreme weather, and rising energy bills. The national framing group was asked about Trump, including his job approval, the federal budget bill, and immigration enforcement.
The results showed notable shifts among independents. Questions about local issues helped Ciattarelli by 7% by moving some voters who had been unsure into his corner (there was no significant change among Democrats or Republicans). 
National issues decreased Ciattarelli’s support among independents by 4%, with those voters shifting from supporting him to saying they were unsure, though reminding respondents about national issues strengthened his support among Republicans.
“The more nationalized this race is, the worse Ciattarelli does overall,” Cassino said.
Ciattarelli has mocked Sherrill for her frequent Trump-bashing on the campaign trail, but Cassino said this tactic has “no downside” for Sherrill. A Rutgers-Eagleton poll from earlier this month put Trump’s approval rating among New Jerseyans at 30%.
“Ciattarelli is walking a fine line with Trump: he needs to consolidate Trump supporters, but do so without making the race too national, or turning off voters who don’t like what’s happening in Washington,” Cassino said.
The poll surveyed 806 registered New Jersey voters and has a margin of error of +/- 3.9 percentage points.

Libby’s tremolite asbestos lurked in the shadows for decades until determined citizens brought the hidden killer to light. But too late for more than 400 people who died and many more left sickened with asbestosis, dying slowly and painfully from asbestos fibers lodged in their lungs. 
A similar disaster was narrowly avoided when actinolite, a mineral that belongs to the amphibole family became a topic of concern about the proposed Skalkaho vermiculite mine near Hamilton in 1999. The question of asbestos was not addressed by officials until the mine was almost permitted. Only after the Bitterroot National Forest had issued its Final Environmental Impact Statement did the agency decide to evaluate the potential for asbestos exposure. The mining company folded before testing. 
As “Roadside Geology of Montana” notes: “Several early attempts to mine vermiculite in the Skalkaho intrusion went poorly. While at one time that seemed unfortunate, now it’s clear that we narrowly escaped having another major environmental disaster.”
Yet, Montanans are facing this situation once again with the U.S. Critical Materials Sheep Creek mine project at the headwaters of the West Fork of the Bitterroot River. There could hardly be in a riskier place to mine given the location, the surrounding wilderness lands, and the threat of river contamination throughout the Bitterroot Valley. 
One of those areas of concern is actinolite, a close relative of Libby’s deadly tremolite — and both are asbestos in their fibrous form. 
As a recent study on the dangers of actinolite concluded: “The lack of widespread awareness regarding actinolite complicates efforts to mitigate its health risks. Unlike more commonly known asbestos types…actinolite often remains underestimated. Actinolite occurs in both fibrous and non-fibrous forms, but the fibrous type has garnered a reputation due to its links with asbestos. The health risks associated with this mineral cannot be overstated: Exposure to actinolite, particularly in environments where it is disturbed, poses significant respiratory health risks. The potential for mesothelioma, lung cancer, and other diseases expands with prolonged exposure.”
To be clear, nobody knows if there is asbestos at Sheep Creek. But there is good reason to suspect asbestos may be there. Geologists at Montana Tech report that actinolite is one of the most common minerals in the host rock and the veinlets containing ore are “actinolite-rich.” The Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology Crowley Bulletin reports actinolite at Sheep Creek “forms masses of radiating fibers surrounding other crystals.” The American Mineralogist, a prestigious industry journal, confirms: “actinolite forms clusters of fibers, usually in radiating groups.” 
There’s no question the actinolite is there. But although U.S. Critical Materials has sampled ore for several years and tested for a long list of analytes, I can find no mention of possible asbestos on US Critical Materials’ website. 
Asbestos exposure happens by breathing contaminated dust, which is very hard to contain and clean up. Mining is dusty business. Workers at Sheep Creek are already breathing dust. So why not test for asbestos to inform both the public and agency management? We’ve been down this lethal road before. Public health concerns are clear: test soon to avoid spreading asbestos around if it’s there.
Contact Bitterroot NF Supervisor Matt Anderson matthew.anderson3@usda.gov and Ranger Dan Pliley Plileydaniel.pliley@usda.gov about possible asbestos at Sheep Creek.

All public schools in the state are now subject to a new rule governing school counselors' work time. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A new Oklahoma rule places strict limitations on how much time public school counselors can spend on non-counseling tasks, but some have raised concerns of whether the regulation is too vague to have its desired effect.
The rule requires school counselors to spend at least 80% of their work time on direct and indirect counseling services that have “an impact on student growth in the areas of academic advisement, college and career, and life skills and wellness,” according to its text. The remainder of their time could be spent on “program planning and school support.” 
The Oklahoma State Board of Education and the state Legislature approved the rule this year. State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who proposed the rule, said the goal is to ensure school counselors aren’t saddled with administrative duties that distract from their primary responsibility of counseling students.
The Oklahoma School Counselor Association is supportive of the 80% concept, said Chelsea Hinkle, president of the association’s board. That work-time ratio is what the American School Counselor Association recommends as a national best practice.
But, the lack of specificity in Oklahoma’s rule has caused uncertainty among school counselors in the state, Hinkle said. The rule gives few examples of tasks that count as direct and indirect services, it doesn’t define “work time,” and it doesn’t explain how districts will be held accountable if they don’t uphold the 80% target.
Because of this vagueness, she said, Oklahoma counselors are wondering whether schools will classify non-counseling tasks, like administering state testing, as “direct services” if they involve face-to-face contact with students.
“I think I would say it leaves us curious,” Hinkle said. “It leaves us curious to how it’s going to play out. I think it leaves us curious to see how districts interpret and apply this, curious to see what guidance (the Oklahoma State Department of Education) has, what that looks like. We’re just kind of waiting. I personally am cautiously, very cautiously, optimistic.”
The Education Department, through its communications office, said academic advising, mental health and wellness support, and career planning are examples of counseling services that could make up 80% of a school counselor’s work time.

However, the agency did not answer questions asking how it will define that “work time,” whether it’s a specific number of hours in a day, the number of days each week, or total hours or days out of the school year.
Districts will have to submit a comprehensive school counseling plan to the state Education Department to ensure quality implementation, spokesperson Madison Cercy said.
The agency also referred to a link giving general information on school counseling programs, and noted it offers professional learning opportunities to district staff for further training.
Hinkle estimated she spends about 70% of her time on direct and indirect counseling services at the Oklahoma City public school where she works. 
Her direct services include one-on-one meetings with students, small-group counseling and classroom instruction. Counselors also teach life skills, address absenteeism issues and check if students’ basic needs are being met at home, Hinkle said.
Indirect services are part of her job, too, such as calling parents, making a referral for outside therapeutic services and meeting with a teacher about a student’s behavior.
Administering state tests, substitute teaching, running a gifted and talented program, and developing 504 plans for students with disabilities are common non-counseling duties many counselors are assigned to do, Hinkle said.
Several of these tasks, along with clerical work, are among the activities the American School Counselor Association deems “inappropriate” for counselors.
“One thing that school counselors believe to their core is each and every student deserves access to a school counseling program, and it’s really hard to make sure each and every single one of your students has access when you’re doing 700 other things,” Hinkle said.
Walters agreed that school counselors, rather than shouldering administrative work, should be allowed to focus on the central elements of their job, like helping students work through mental health issues or plan for a future career.
“I do believe if somebody wants to be a school counselor they want to help kids in these ways,” Walters said during a June 26 meeting of the Oklahoma State Board of Education. “That’s their background. That’s what they’re there to do. That’s why it’s a separate certification. They’re not a principal. They’re not a vice principal. They’re a school counselor. If we’re going to use these titles and this certification, we need to protect that role.”
Neighboring states have been far more specific when implementing similar work-time rules for school counselors. 
A Texas state law clarifies that administering tests cannot qualify as a direct or indirect counseling service. Like Oklahoma, the Lone Star State requires counselors to spend 80% of their work time on the counseling program at their school.
Arkansas goes above the nationally recommended ratio, requiring 90% of school counselors’ work time to focus on counseling services. The Arkansas rule gives definitions for direct and indirect services, and it outlines specific administrative activities that can make up no more than 10% of counselors’ work time.
As Oklahoma’s rule takes effect, Edmond Public Schools is looking at the potential impact, but it’s not rearranging staff at this time, spokesperson Jeff Bardach said. The district of 25,700 students is waiting for further guidance from the state Education Department before making any changes.
School counselors in Norman Public Schools already spend 80% of their time providing direct and indirect services to students, spokesperson Courtney Scott said.
“This new rule reinforces that their time should not be overcommitted to administrative tasks such as coordinating state testing, managing 504 plans, or taking on other duties that fall outside their professional role,” she said. “Counselors should be engaged in face-to-face instruction or communication with students, as well as with teachers and families who support those students.”
In northwest Oklahoma, Seiling Public Schools Superintendent Kyle Reynolds said he’s never had to quantify the percentage of his school counselors’ time spent on various tasks, but meeting the 80% rule in a small, rural district will be “a pretty significant challenge.”

Seiling, a district of 400 students, employs a counselor at its elementary school and another at the secondary school level. 
Small districts have fewer employees and therefore rely on counselors for a greater variety of tasks, Reynolds said. It’s also a position that, like teachers, has a workforce shortage, so hiring more counselors isn’t an easy solution, he said.
Without access to more funding or a larger pool of candidates, Reynolds said it’s difficult to be sure the new rule will benefit students.
“It just puts you more in a pinch with what you can do with your existing resources,” he said.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)In March 2023, Daphne Huang emailed her supervisor — repeating concerns she had shared a day earlier.
She was troubled with the ethics of the Idaho Attorney General’s Office new management — months after Raúl Labrador became Idaho’s attorney general.
“I don’t think (the executive office) is concerned with our ethical responsibilities under professional rules of conduct to which we are all bound,” Huang wrote. “They instead appear intent on dismantling government, and doing so without regard for the people who believe in public service who fall in their wake. They have drawn the (Attorney General’s) Office into adversity with its clients based on anti-government pursuits irrespective of how the law applies to the facts.”
Judge again rejects Idaho Attorney General Office’s attempt to stop Labrador’s deposition

Before firing her a couple hours later, Labrador didn’t look into her concerns, he recently said in a deposition.
“I had no concerns. It was clear that she was not acting in good faith. And it was clear that she was already preparing for litigation,” Labrador said, according to a partial transcript. 
Months before Huang’s whistleblower lawsuit against the Attorney General’s Office is set to go to a jury trial, the Attorney General’s Office has asked an Idaho judge to dismiss the case, arguing Huang was fired for misconduct — not whistleblowing. Huang was fired early in Labrador’s investigation into $72 million of child care grants distributed by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, the agency she represented as a deputy attorney general.
Huang’s email, Labrador’s deposition and hundreds of other pages of evidence were released in court documents related to the Attorney General’s Office request to dismiss the lawsuit.

 AG’s Office says lawyer was fired for misconduct

In its request, attorneys for the Attorney General’s Office said: “Even under the most charitable interpretation of the facts, (Huang) was fired for misconduct — not for refusing to carry out an unlawful directive or for whistleblowing.” 
Part of the case centers around Huang allegedly giving the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare the cell phone of her former supervisor, who was asked to resign days before Huang was fired. The phone had data that Health and Welfare allegedly claimed privilege over and was deleted from the phone before it was returned to the Attorney General’s Office, court documents show. That was despite a request from the Attorney General’s Office to return the phone with the data preserved, the records show.
The Attorney General’s Office argues that the timeline “is clear: she made alleged ethical complaints because she was being fired, and not the other way around.”
Huang’s attorneys responded with a timeline of the events leading up to her firing, arguing that Labrador started his leadership of the Attorney General’s Office with an unusual change.
“On the day he became AG, Labrador met with (deputy attorneys general) and staff and informed them everyone would be reappyling for their jobs and that he wanted employees who would be ‘Team Labrador,” Huang’s attorneys said. 
They allege Labrador told staff that the Attorney General’s Office “did not represent state agencies.” That confused Huang, who knew the office’s attorneys “are public attorneys for the people of the state,” her lawyers say.
On Monday, Idaho 4th District Court Judge Jonathan Medema heard oral arguments on the Attorney General Office’s request to dismiss the case, through a motion for summary judgment. He will issue a decision later. 
In court, Deputy Solicitor General Michael Zarian argued Huang didn’t refuse the office’s directive.
“A refusal would be to decline to accept the directive and to express that,” Zarian said. “And that is the definition of the word refusal. … But here, she expressed a willingness to agree and then did the opposite. And that’s just, honestly, dishonesty to your employer.”
An attorney for Huang, Guy Hallam, argued Huang did what she was supposed to do.
“The client requested the phone, and she gave it to the client. She has a duty to that client,” Hallam said. “… She did what she should do under the law, and under her duties under the rules of professional conduct. And it may have amounted to a refusal that they view as insubordination, but it’s appropriate under the law.”
The lawsuit is scheduled to go to a jury trial in October.
 Recent court ruling affirmed Labrador’s civil subpoena power

This month, another court ruling seemed to clear a hurdle for the investigation. The Idaho Supreme Court on July 10 unanimously ruled Labrador had the authority to issue civil investigative demands to organizations that received the grant funds from Health and Welfare. 
But the court wrote that “nothing in this opinion should be read as implying that we have concluded that any of the Grant Recipients have violated the law because we have not been asked to address that issue.”
In a statement after the ruling, Labrador said the office’s goal “is not to punish grant recipients but to ensure taxpayer funds were used according to state law.”
“We will continue to defend the investigative powers the Legislature has entrusted our office,” he said. 
But more than two years after the investigation began, its status is unclear. For more than a year, state officials have released no information about how it’s going.



 A timeline of Labrador’s investigation into Health and Welfare grants:

Launched months after the former congressman became Idaho’s top attorney in 2023, the grants investigation is one of several legal clashes Labrador has had with state government agencies that his office legally represents — including his now-dropped lawsuit against the State Board of Education related to University of Idaho’s attempted purchase of the University of Phoenix. 
Two state officials linked to the grants investigation — Huang, the fired attorney, and Dave Jeppesen, the former Department of Health and Welfare director — filed complaints against Labrador with the Idaho State Bar, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.

January 2023: Raúl Labrador becomes Idaho’s attorney general.
March 2023: Shortly after Legislature orders audit of Idaho Department of Health and Welfare grants, Labrador serves civil subpoenas, also known as civil investigative demands, to current and former state health officials, and organizations that received the grants. Officials and organizations soon sue over the subpoenas.
August 2023: A state audit finds issues in the grant distribution and spending, despite two legal memos Daphne Huang — who was fired from the Attorney General’s Office — wrote to Health and Welfare, saying the grant funds was legally sound. Labrador’s office later withdraws the legal advice. Labrador calls the advice a “cover your butt” letter, in a December 2023 interview with Idaho Reports.
December 2023: Labrador’s appointed special prosecutor, Christopher Boyd, claims in a legal filing that he found probable cause that the agency’s then-grant manager had committed a crime. But he publishes no specific evidence for the allegation, or says what crime may have been committed. The grant manager still has not faced public criminal charges, state court records show.
January 2024: Months after the critical audit’s release, Health and Welfare announces reform efforts. Initially, agency leadership refuted all of the audit’s findings.
March 2024: Two lawsuits by current and former state health officials that challenged the civil subpoenas conclude — months after Boyd told the officials he’d withdraw the civil subpoenas.




 New records show state officials received more subpoenas 

In late 2023, when Labrador’s special prosecutor, Christopher Boyd, told state health officials he’d withdraw the civil investigative demands that they sued to block, he said he’d look to appoint a special inquiry judge — a court process outlined in state law that allows secrecy. At the time, Boyd wouldn’t say whether such a judge had been appointed, the Sun previously reported. 
But government records obtained by the Idaho Capital Sun through a public records request show state employees were subpoenaed in early 2024 or earlier to testify to a special inquiry judge. The records don’t identify the judge. Government agencies linked to the investigation could not be immediately reached for comment.

In an email on Feb. 26, 2024, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Deputy Director Jennifer Palagi told the agency’s then interim director, Dean Cameron, that two state officials had been subpoenaed by special prosecutor Boyd to testify before a special inquiry judge on March 5, 2024. Those subpoenas were similar to ones she, other current and former state officials — including the agency’s previous director, Dave Jeppesen — had received, Palagi wrote.
The Idaho governor’s then-director of operations, Lori Wolff, also received a similar subpoena, Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s General Counsel Brady Hall wrote in a separate Jan. 30, 2024 email.
All the subpoenas were signed by Boyd, sought testimony on the grants program and came with an “Agreement to Testify with Immunity,” Hall wrote. 
The Idaho Capital Sun obtained the emails through a public records request to the Idaho governor’s office. An attorney for Huang first obtained the emails from the governor’s office after allegedly not receiving them in the legal discovery process from the Attorney General’s Office. Judge Medema in July denied Huang’s attorneys’ request for sanctions over the evidence dispute.
The emails also asked how to arrange legal representation for the subpoenaed officials. It’s not immediately clear whether the testimony sought by the subpoenas happened, or how legal representation for the officials was arranged.
The Idaho Attorney General’s Office declined to share information on the investigation’s status. Other agencies and officials involved in the emails or investigation — including the Idaho governor’s office, the Department of Health and Welfare, and Boyd, who is also Canyon County’s prosecuting attorney — could not be immediately reached for comment.
Boyd was also appointed as a special prosecutor in Ada County “to prosecute this case,” Chief Deputy Attorney General Phil Broadbent said in a reply email to the governor’s attorney in January 2024. Last week, the Ada County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office declined to comment on Boyd’s appointment, telling the Sun that the matter remains under investigation.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Commission on Indiana’s Legal Future, tasked with brainstorming attorney shortage fixes, has released a final report packed with new recommendations and updates on ongoing initiatives.
The Hoosier State’s rate of 2.26 lawyers per capita was 43rd worst in the nation last year, per the American Bar Association.
About 16,000 practice in-state, but the distribution is uneven.
Marion County alone hosts more than 6,000 lawyers, almost 40%. When combined with those in seven surrounding counties, they make up more than half the total. Other counties have as few as five.
Indiana’s attorney production pipeline — stunted, in particular, by the 2020 closure of Valparaiso Law School — has also contributed.
“The answer is not as simple as ‘more lawyers,'” Appeals Court Judge Nancy Vaidik and Supreme Court Chief Administrative Officer Justin Forkner wrote.
  Many active attorneys have clustered in urban areas. Lawyers in rural counties are generally older. The darkest blue counties have the most attorneys, and the darkest brown counties have the oldest. (Screenshot from Commission on Indiana’s Legal Future final report)
“Instead, this challenge needs a complete reevaluation of how legal services are provided in Indiana,” the pair, who co-chaired the commission, continued.
The Indiana Supreme Court created the commission in April 2024. The group, published an initial list of budgetary and legislative suggestions four months later, ahead of the Indiana General Assembly’s budget-writing session.
The final report — which was completed July 1 and released last week — is open for public comment until August 29 at noon.
Progress on interim recommendations
There’s already been movement on several earlier proposals.
The Indiana Supreme Court approved its Innovation Committee’s parameters for a new regulatory “sandbox” program in March. Inspired by a 2020 Utah agency, it would authorize and evaluate non-traditional legal service projects.
That pilot program incorporates another recommendation for grants to help launch nonprofit law firms that use lower-cost legal service providers like law students or allied legal professionals.
The court has also established uniform definitions of areas with high legal need, including maps of rural counties and legal deserts.
A subsidy program for legal practice startups in those needy areas is expected to go live this summer, according to the report. It’s for use on expenses that are most burdensome in the startup phase, like rent, utilities, insurance, legal research services, databases, case management software and billing software.
Attorney shortage commission makes budgetary, legislative recommendations

Also expected to go live this summer is a student loan repayment assistance program for law school graduates practices in areas of high legal need.
A scholarship program for law students who go into public roles was signed into law in May, but lawmakers allotted it no funding amid major spending cuts. The shortage is particularly acute among public prosecutors and defenders because the pay is often too low to pay off law school loans despite the heavy workload.
The commission suggested seeking private sector funding.
Other ideas also suffered in the cuts.
Funding for remote-appearance technologies in local jails was one.
“It is not clear yet if the Court will have sufficient funds to provide these grant opportunities in the current fiscal climate,” the commission wrote of proposal to upgrade technology in local courts.
It noted that a different potential funding source, the federal Digital Opportunity Grant, was recently suspended by President Donald Trump.
New recommendations
The commission added several suggestions in its final report.
Chief among them was designating someone with the “ongoing oversight, marketing, and coordination of the Commission’s recommendations so they do not ‘die on the vine.'”
It will also be “vital” to centralize information on initiatives and grants on one webpage, the commission added.
It also recommended piloting a public service pathway to licensure — not easier, and maybe even more demanding, than the current bar exam, but tailored.

“The initial parameters provide a tailored path to law licensure for qualified ABA-accredited Indiana-based law-school students who commit to and practice in Indiana for three years after graduation in either a high-needs public-sector field or in a legal desert,” the report said.
Other proposals are in progress, including some involving the use of artificial intelligence to ease the “unsustainable” workloads on judicial officers. By automating or simplifying some menial tasks, they’d have more time for duties that require deep thought and expertise.
Additional proposals focus on educational and career support: mentorship programs, curricular pathways, boot camps, a public service job board and more.
The commission acknowledged that its work was limited, and ended the report with suggestions of what comes next.
Would-be Indiana lawyers need more access to legal educational institutions, it asserted. Some possibilities include reopening Valparaiso Law School, launching Indiana University satellite law schools or widening access to online law school graduates.
But many graduates, especially those from Notre Dame and IU Maurer, practice law elsewhere.
“We must sell the idea of staying and practicing here—the notion that Indiana is a good place to live,” the commission wrote. “We must promote and market the value of not just being a lawyer, but also the unique importance of being a Hoosier lawyer.”
Student loan debt was identified as another major problem, because it often pushes graduates into higher-paying corporate careers in urban areas.

The Mississippi State Department of Health, like other state health departments, is concerned about the potential loss of federal funding. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

National survey of Wyoming voters shows Gordon’s popularity has remained steady throughout his tenure.
The post Gordon among nation’s most popular governors despite criticism from right flank, poll finds appeared first on WyoFile .","Despite ongoing attacks from the Republican Party’s right flank, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon remains one of the country’s most popular state leaders, a Morning Consult poll released earlier this month shows.
During a survey conducted between April and June, Wyoming voters gave Gordon a 65% approval rating, placing him as the fourth most popular among his peers. Twenty-four percent disapproved of Gordon’s job performance while 11% responded that they either didn’t know or had no opinion. 
Morning Consult, a political research firm, tracks approval ratings for all 50 state governors and releases the results quarterly. 
The poll results follow a steady drumbeat of criticism from the most hardline elements of Wyoming’s Republican Party, who’ve taken the governor to task for his stances on a number of issues including wind energy and for his vetoes of certain bills.
Throughout his tenure, Gordon’s job performance has remained steady according to the survey findings. His high-water mark — 74% approval — tied Gordon with Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott as the most popular governor in July 2022. In January 2020, a 69% approval rating also placed him at the top. 
“These poll results are indicative of the good things going on in Wyoming. They also show that Wyoming citizens recognize that the Governor continues to put this head down and work to move the state forward — including sticking to the issues that are truly important to most Wyoming folks,” Gordon’s spokesman Michael Pearlman wrote in a statement to WyoFile. 
Pearlman said those include the economy, education, addressing mental health and strengthening the state’s core energy industries. 
“Most people in Wyoming want less government in their lives, the opportunity to make a good living, enjoy recreational activities and have their children receive an excellent education. Governor Gordon wants the same, and that shows in this poll.
“Finally, while polls are nice, ultimately there’s only one poll that matters and that’s the election coming a little more than a year from now,” Pearlman added. 
Gordon has not announced what he plans to do following his second term. When the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled that term limits on the top elected positions in the state were unconstitutional, the high court did not address the qualifications for governor. Given the high court’s ruling against legislative term limits, a court challenge on the gubernatorial term limits would likely be successful, the Casper Star-Tribune reported in 2010, when then-Gov. Dave Freudenthal announced he would not seek a third term.
In 2022, Gordon coasted to a second-term win, first capturing 61.5% of the vote in the Republican primary election before sweeping the November election with a 74% victory. 
His 2018 gubernatorial victory, however, set off a tense relationship with the further right-wing of the party after his opponents insisted he only won due to the support of Democrats registering as Republican in order to support him. Despite being statistically unfounded, the claims endured, and the Legislature passed a crossover-voting ban in 2023 after many failed attempts. Laramie, Platte and Teton County voters are currently challenging the ban in court. 
The Wyoming Republican Party voted in 2024 to censure Gordon after he vetoed a property tax bill and legislation to repeal gun-free zones. 
Wyoming GOP Chairman Bryan Miller did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by the time this article published. 
Since forming in 2020, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus has also taken aim at Gordon, particularly for his energy policies. And earlier this year, one of the group’s leaders went so far as to accuse Gordon and former members of the Joint Appropriations Committee of violating a state spending law. The accusation caught headlines during the legislative session and not much else. 
More recently, Gordon has clashed with Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who has regularly taken to social media to criticize the governor, particularly when it comes to election security, mining and wind projects. 
Gray as well as U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman are among names being floated as potential gubernatorial candidates in 2026.

Sen. John Barrasso has not yet taken a stand on Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, but Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Harriet Hageman are all for HR 22, writes Marion Yoder. 
The post SAVE Act would silence American voters, mainly women appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming isn’t called the Equality State for nothing. In 1869, Wyoming women struggled for and secured the right to vote here, years before statehood. We are justly proud that Wyoming was the first American state or territory to extend suffrage to women, putting them on equal political footing with men.

Opinion

So why then are the two female members of Wyoming’s congressional delegation supporting a bill that would hurt women’s access to the polls?
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or so-called SAVE Act, already passed the U.S. House with an appalling “Aye” from Wyoming’s lone representative, Harriet Hageman. More correctly derided as the “Silencing Americans Act,” House Resolution 22 would suddenly require millions to produce passports or original birth certificates to prove citizenship when registering to vote or updating their registration. 
For no good reason. As the Brennan Center put it after meticulously studying many national elections, and finding incident rates between 0.0003% and 0.0025%, an American will more likely be struck by lightning than try to “impersonate another voter at the polls.” 
About 140 million Americans do not own passports and some 69 million married women’s surnames differ from those on their birth certificates, according to the Center for American Progress. More than 21 million Americans lack any readily available proof of citizenship. 
The nonpartisan League of Women Voters very much opposes SAVE. It would suppress votes from millions of eligible voters, especially women, seniors, students and people of color. Also, service members who move often and would have to provide strict documentary proof each time they re-register to vote. Military ID alone would not suffice. Nor would Tribal IDs cut it, as most don’t show birthplace. And disaster survivors; who knows where their papers are? Anyone with a name that has changed since birth: the 80% of women who change surnames upon marriage, trans people, others. Rural, working class, people of color or older voters are all less likely to hold a passport. The League is urging people to insist their senators oppose the SAVE Act. 
If SAVE passes, and you are among the 40% of Wyomingites who hold a passport, you might be in luck, if it’s current. Passports cost at least $165 to apply for and nearly that to renew. You have to get a professional picture, fill out papers and you may need an appointment. It takes weeks to get them. 
Sen. John Barrasso has not yet taken a stand on SAVE, but Sen. Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Hageman are all for HR 22. Why not? It doesn’t affect them. They kept their names upon marriage. 
So did I, but I don’t like SAVE and no one I know does, though not many have heard much about it. When SAVE does hit the radar screen, I foresee a lot of angry Wyomingites from any or no party. The Republicans pushing this anti-voter bill are theoretically big on family values and thus marriage. So how can they justify making it difficult for married women to vote? 
As if it isn’t already hard enough to vote. You must already (a) register with documentary proof, (b) educate yourself on the issues, (c) get a ballot by mail or go to the polls, (d) provide valid ID and (e) vote. Wyoming is one of only eight states that do not allow online voter registration. Reason: “election integrity.” 
The Heritage Foundation has found precisely four documented instances of voter fraud statewide over the last 25 years, during which time dozens of elections have occurred. All four were U.S. citizens! Two were convicted of false registration/fraudulent use of absentee ballots, one (a sitting state representative) used a phony address and pled guilty, and one was ineligible to vote since he was a convicted felon. 
Contrary to Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s assertions, Wyoming’s 23 elected county clerks competently keep voter rolls accurate and ensure that only eligible people vote. That’s still not good enough for Gray, whose sworn duty is to facilitate elections but instead delights in making voting unnecessarily difficult. Thanks to him and the Freedom Caucus, voting restrictions are having a heyday. A “crossover” voter must change their registration by mid-May, before candidates even declare. And now there’s a Wyoming version of SAVE, House Bill 156. Its challenge in federal court was recently dismissed without prejudice. That case can, and likely will, be refiled. For more changes, see “What’s New About Wyoming’s Elections,” put together by the Laramie County Clerk. You can, and should,  check the status of your registration by calling your county clerk. In Laramie County, the number is 307-633-4242. 
Wyomingites worried about SAVE are sending postcards to Barrasso and Lummis, saying the “Silencing Americans Act” is anti-democratic. They close with: “I stand with my fellow Wyomingites and Americans to demand that you pass national voting rights legislation such as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, the Freedom to Vote Act, the Native American Voting Rights Act and DC Statehood.” 
Senate Republicans, terrified of Trump and scared about 2026 midterms, are about as into Washington, D.C.’s Statehood as they are into addressing global warming. Nevertheless, Congress needs to realize it is blundering badly with this insulting SAVE Act. American women are not going to accept being told to go away when they go to vote in 2026. 
Senators nationwide are now being told this: “We will never stand quietly as politicians attempt to prevent citizens from exercising their fundamental right to vote. Voting rights belong to everyone.” For my part, I’ve called and written both Lummis and Barrasso, asking for their current positions on this bad bill. I’ve also asked Barrasso to urge Lummis, a junior senator, to withdraw her early support.
Even quipping misogynists don’t have the gall to tell their wives to behave like most women had to before 1920, when the 19th Amendment, granting women suffrage nationwide, was adopted after a century of hard fighting. It reads, “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” Damn straight.
No Wyoming voter would be assisted by the SAVE Act. Time to call it a day for this sexist, hyper-partisan bill. We cannot allow elected officials to “pick voters” rather than us picking the winners at the polls. Just as our Founders intended.

Since 2022, the Nebraska Democratic Party has outraised the Nebraska GOP each year, both in state-level donations logged on Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure (NADC)[...]","State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston and Fletcher Reel of Omaha discuss election results for Pennsylvania at the Nebraska GOP watch party in Bellevue on Nov. 5, 2024.  (Marissa Lindemann/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — While Nebraska remains a firmly red state in terms of its registered voters and elected leadership, that tilt hasn’t translated into donations to the state’s top political parties.
Since 2022, the Nebraska Democratic Party has outraised the Nebraska GOP each year, both in state-level donations logged on Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure (NADC) and in federal giving recorded by the Federal Elections Commission (FEC).
The turning point was the state GOP’s 2022 convention, which saw a mass exodus of party leadership and shifted away from the previous establishment Republicans to Trump-era populists and some old-guard conservatives.
Some viewed the party leadership change as an indictment of the way the party was run under a team loyal to former GOP governor-turned-U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, as many Republicans at the convention said he held too much control.
Ricketts was a major funder for the party at the time — one of the party’s dominant funders. A six-figure donation from him was not an uncommon occurrence. After the 2022 convention, those donations stopped.

In fact, none of Nebraska’s current congressional delegation has donated directly to the state GOP since 2022, according to NADC and FEC filings. Democrats last held a federal office in 2017 with the late-U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford.
Ricketts has remained an active political funder since then, instead donating directly to Republican candidates and organizations. Recent FEC filings show a donation from him of more than $750,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as just one example.
He’s also frequently provided donations to other state Republican parties and local GOP groups outside of Nebraska, usually in $10,000 sums, according to his FEC filings.
Jessica Flanagain, a spokesperson for the Ricketts campaign and the senator’s top political consultant, said he remains committed to helping the “most conservative candidates who can win” races win, regardless of how he donates.
“Senator Ricketts has been clear about his commitment to conservative candidates and causes,” Flanagain said. “He has championed protecting women and children by passing Initiative 434 (cementing Nebraska’s 12-week abortion ban), and he has helped secure our elections by passing Voter ID.”
The Nebraska GOP last outraised the Nebraska Democratic Party in 2022, according to NADC filings, primarily because of multiple six-figure donations from Ricketts prior to the convention.
That year, the party logged over $1 million in contributions, but only about $98,000 of that total came in after the July convention.
“This puts a spotlight on how Ricketts’ billionaire pocketbook has been propping up the Republican Party for so many years,” said Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb.
Since the GOP leadership change, the Nebraska Democratic Party has raised more money, both locally and nationally. For example, during the high-stakes elections of 2024, the Democrats logged over $1 million in donations on NADC, which correlates to dollars intended to be spent on state and local races. The same year, the Nebraska GOP recorded $196,000 in contributions.
On the FEC, which tracks donations intended to be used for federal races, financial records are tracked over a two-year period. For 2023-2024, Nebraska Democrats recorded over $6.6 million in contributions compared to $2.8 million for the Nebraska GOP.
This year is still up in the air, though Democrats are currently in the lead with $322,000 in contributions filed in the FEC versus about $252,000 filed for the Nebraska GOP.
State parties in federal races often act as pass-through entities, with campaigns using the money to access parties’ lower-cost postage rate for sending campaign mailers and for voter outreach and engagement.
State-level giving to the parties remains more of a mystery, according to NADC filings. The Nebraska Democratic Party has recorded over $336,000 in donations so far this year, but the Nebraska GOP has yet to file. Nebraska GOP Chair Mary Jane Truemper said this is because the party hasn’t directly contributed to any state campaigns this year, so it is only required to make one financial report for all of 2025.
This funding disparity may not be obvious to most, as Republicans hold most elected offices and have gained ground in the Nebraska Legislature since 2022. Retiring U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., has also maintained his seat in the Omaha area’s highly competitive 2nd Congressional District.
What does it all mean?
According to Dona-Gene Barton, associate professor of political science at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the explanation lies in Nebraska’s voter registrations, where Republicans remain dominant.
The latest voter registration statistics on Nebraska’s Secretary of State website show that there are over 623,000 registered Republicans in Nebraska, versus about 330,000 registered Democrats.
That large of a gap indicates that money doesn’t make much of a difference in most statewide races, Barton said. She noted the 2024 U.S. Senate race with independent candidate Dan Osborn challenging incumbent U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.
Though Osborn was well-funded and put Fischer in a “weakened” position, Barton said, Fischer still comfortably won because she had the advantage of a built-in voter base.
“Despite the amount of money that was sunk into that race, the Republican still wins in the end,” Barton said.
Kleeb says Nebraska Democrats have gained ground since she became party chair in 2016, more than doubling the amount of Democrats in elected offices statewide. She also noted signs of progress in 2024, namely that Nebraska, which splits its electoral votes and awards them by congressional district like Maine, was the only battleground nationally that sent an electoral vote to Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

While funding may not make a massive difference, Kleeb said it helps candidates in local races. The party having more resources means those candidates can focus more of their energy on their specific regions.
Truemper largely agreed with this mindset, though she still believes the Nebraska GOP is in good shape. She said political parties always have to work with what they have, but the amount of funding parties receive determines the scale of what they can accomplish.
“It’s like a campaign — I’ve been a campaign manager,” said Truemper, who managed Bacon’s campaign in 2018 and later his primary opponent’s in 2024. “You have a plan, and then depending on how much money you have, you scale up or down.”
Barton agreed that party funding in a state like Nebraska is most likely to have an influence on lower-level elections and ballot measures. It’s particularly helpful when there are other factors at play that will motivate partisan and independent voters to go to the polls, like a promising presidential candidate, she said.
Evidence of this could be seen in 2024, when four of Nebraska’s six ballot initiatives favored more progressive outcomes, such as legalizing medical cannabis and approving mandatory paid sick leave. The outlier was a pair of competing abortion initiatives, which resulted in the more restrictive measure — Initiative 434 — prevailing.

Lately, Truemper said the Nebraska GOP has been more focused on regional, state and federal races, and have relied on county parties to support down-ballot races.
Fallout from the 2022 convention meant the Nebraska GOP basically “started from scratch,” Truemper said. She said the party shifted to a more “grassroots” effort reminiscent of what it looked like under former Gov. Dave Heineman.

During Heineman’s administration, Truemper said the governor focused less on directly funding the Nebraska GOP and instead encouraged party participation at the county level. This brought it a broader base of financial support statewide, she said.
When Ricketts took office, he funded much of the party’s activities, Truemper said. During that time, she said, some of the Nebraska GOP’s local bases of support “dried up,” though she declined to say that Ricketts was the main cause of that.
Still, Truemper gave Democrats props for their skill at raising money and using their funds strategically. She acknowledged that the Nebraska GOP isn’t raising as much as she would like, and said she is focusing on rebuilding the party’s fundraising base.
What comes next?
Heading into the 2026 election season, Truemper said the Nebraska GOP intends to prioritize the 2nd Congressional District House race, as well as Ricketts’ re-election bid. Ricketts faces a returning challenger in Osborn.
Truemper said the party plans to support Ricketts’ campaign by emphasizing the values and successes of GOP candidates in office and focusing on the importance of maintaining Republicans’ majority in the Senate.
“Financially, he doesn’t need our support,” she said with a laugh.
Truemper said she also hopes to increase the GOP’s majority in the Nebraska Legislature, which currently holds just enough votes to overcome opposing filibusters, if Republicans stick together on controversial bills.
“We are confident that the voters will see the improvement in the economy and the Republican’s common sense approach to policy as a reason to vote Republican in 2026,” Truemper said.
Truemper didn’t offer many details as to how she hopes to improve donations to the party. She only said she will focus on building relationships and seek support from the Republican National Convention.
Nationally, Republicans are outpacing Democrats in fundraising. Recent reporting from The Hill shared that the Republican National Committee raised over $16 million during the month of June — nearly double the $8.6 million the Democratic National Committee raised in the same period.
The Republican National Committee has nearly $66 million more in cash on hand through the first half of 2025 compared to the Democratic National Committee, CBS News reported. Federal filings show the RNC with $80.7 million by late June and the DNC with $15.2 million.
Kleeb said she is focusing on building out the Nebraska Democratic Party’s state and county-level infrastructure to better support local candidates. She also said the party is increasing its investment in voter registration efforts.
“We take the ridicule that the Republicans want to throw at us, because we haven’t won the big-ticket items that people only look at, but we’ve been building,” Kleeb said. “And we’ve been building towards what we think are going to be big wins for our party in ‘26 and ‘28.”
As expected, the Nebraska Democratic Party also plans to prioritize the 2nd District House race in 2026. Kleeb said they’ve learned from past elections that they need to invest in the region earlier. And the state party is working with local Democrats to recruit and support legislative candidates.
Nebraska Democratic Party Executive Director Precious McKesson said the party is organizing community support efforts in the area, as well as other events meant to improve the party’s visibility. McKesson said this stems from feedback they received that the party isn’t as present outside of election seasons.
Unlike most races, Barton said the House race in NE-02 is one where party funding could affect the outcome. Past elections in the district ended with razor-thin margins, and Republicans will no longer have the incumbency advantage with Bacon.
The nonpartisan Center for Politics, the home of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, has shifted the Omaha-based House race to lean Democratic from toss-up. The Cook Political Report also shifted the race to lean Democrat.
“The fact that Don Bacon is not going to be seeking reelection is a very strong signal about the possibility of a Democrat winning that seat in the next election,” Barton said.

(Photo courtesy of Heather Murray)I have owned and operated a child care center for the past 19 years. Not only do I make sure staff and the bills are paid, I clean toilets, clean windows and change diapers.  I have devoted my life to educating and caring for young children. I didn’t go into this profession to line my pockets with money. But everyone in my field deserves a living wage and to know they are supported in their community. My goal is to create a safe and nurturing learning environment for the children who enter my center.  My belief is that their parents have decided to partner with us to make sure their children are getting the best possible environment to learn and grow.  
Creating  this high-quality environment for children has become increasingly hard over the years for child care providers in Wisconsin. Parents can’t pay more and providers need to keep qualified staff and pay them a liveable wage. For my center, wages for employees went up by $4 an hour recently  to keep up with the other businesses in my community.  
I started advocating and organizing around child care and early education right before the latest state  budget cycle. I found  there were some pretty big hurdles to jump over to get our legislators to listen to child care providers.
 I’ve heard legislators tell providers “all you want is money.” I’ve heard them say   “these women just need to learn how to run their business.”  My favorite observation is: “We don’t need child care.  Women should just stay home and take care of their children.”  It wasn’t easy to get anyone at the Capitol to take providers seriously. In the last state budget child care received no funding.  Wisconsin was  one of six states that did not put any state money into child care or early education. Gov. Evers did find a way to support providers with direct payments using federal money, which  helped keep many providers’ doors open throughout the state.  
Meanwhile, advocates and early educators kept coming to hearings,  talking about what we do on a daily basis and how that is important to our communities and the state.
Providers across Wisconsin held Community Conversations and Day Without Childcare events. Many elected officials from both sides of the aisle received tours of centers.  Providers also sent letters to the editor and talked with every type of news outlet that would listen. I am so proud of all the providers who stepped up and continued to push this message that what we do is important and we deserve support. As a result,  ideas at the Capitol started to shift.  
I spoke to legislators from both sides of the aisle. I heard legislators starting to talk about the “child care crisis” and realize that it wasn’t happening just because we didn’t know how to run our businesses. They started to say out loud that parents shouldn’t have to pay 25% of their income for  child care. Legislators who previously wouldn’t have said they supported child care investment said they would try and get something done.
In the end, the new state budget  wasn’t ideal but it did do two things: Direct payments will continue to go to providers for the next year and early education is finally funded with state dollars in the Wisconsin budget.
Does this budget solve everything? No. Does it provide the $330 million Evers sought in direct payments  to providers? No. Did Wisconsin for the first time  put state money into  early education? Yes — including $110 million in direct payments to providers Does it deregulate child care, increasing the number of  infants and toddlers one staff person can care for and allowing 16-year-olds to count as full-time assistants? Yes.

I absolutely do not think deregulation is the answer to the child care crisis. I believe it is harmful to children. I will not be participating in the deregulated infant/toddler program outlined in this budget.  I know I cannot get staff in my center to continue work when I ask them to take care of three more toddlers on their own. A single teacher in this proposed program would take care of seven toddlers ages 18 months and up. Right now that same teacher is expected to care for four toddlers that age. Even though some states have this ratio,  the National Association for the Education of Young Children clearly states best practice is 1:4 for this age group.
I would also not hire a 16-year-old as an assistant teacher to add to my staff. I don’t believe 16-year-olds are ready to handle large groups of small  children and provide the  quality time and interaction they need; 16-year-olds are still children themselves. And since they are in school themselves, they are not that much help with the labor  shortages centers experience all day long.
I’m grateful that Gov. Evers made child care a priority, and that our state finally joined the majority of other states in providing some support for this essential resource in the state budget.
Advocating for policy changes is a constant back and forth. Much of the time you don’t get  what you want. This means that we must go back in two years, to make Wisconsin’s child care support better and  more durable.  Child care advocates have created a strong network and we are not done advocating for the change needed for providers to keep their doors open and for educators to earn a living wage. I believe child care is infrastructure and a public good.  Together with other child care providers, I will continue to advocate and educate our leaders about how a well supported child care system is essential to  our community and our economy.

Bill Lee and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announce a plan for Elon Musk's Boring Company to build an underground tunnel from the airport to Downtown Nashville. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee leaders joined an Elon Musk company’s officials Monday in announcing plans to bore an underground tunnel dubbed the “Music City Loop” from downtown Nashville to burgeoning Nashville International Airport.
Musk’s Boring Company initially would dig a 10-mile tunnel from the Music City Center to the airport on the city’s southeast side using land beneath state-owned roads. All-electric vehicles, possibly Musk’s Teslas, would be used to carry riders on an eight-minute transit. 
In a press conference at the airport Hilton, Gov. Bill Lee said the estimated two-year project would be privately funded and not require any public money or tax breaks. A press release from the Governor’s Office said the company plans to start construction as soon as the approval process is complete and the first part of the loop could be operating by fall 2026, though the governor said environmental permits would not be expedited.
Lee declined to give an estimated cost for the tunnel but said it “will transform the way people travel from the airport” to downtown Nashville.
Officials predicted the loop will remove thousands of vehicles from Nashville roads, though neither state officials nor Boring Company President Steve Davis gave many details about ride estimates or costs.
Davis admitted digging a tunnel through Middle Tennessee’s limestone will be difficult but said the company makes safety a priority. Customers should be able to walk out of the airport and be less than 100 feet from the tunnel to downtown Nashville, he said.

Davis credited Nashville with being “so welcoming and kind” for the project’s quick takeoff and said the tunnel could branch out across Middle Tennessee with numerous stations eventually.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attended Monday’s announcement, calling the project “innovation at its finest.” He said the project will have federal support.
It also has the backing of the Tennessee and Metro Nashville Chambers of Commerce, the Metro Nashville Airport Authority, which is tied up in a lawsuit with state over board appointments, and the Greater Nashville Hospitality Association.
Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell did not attend Monday’s press conference. But Lee said the mayor is supporting the project.
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn in a video address to the event’s audience said Boring Company received a 99.57% safety and security rating from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Transportation Security Administration for its work on the Vegas Loop.
Nashville’s Democratic legislative delegation wasn’t invited to Monday’s press conference, and Rep. John Ray Clemmons criticized the proposal afterward, saying Musk found an “easy target in starry-eyed Bill Lee.”
“No responsible executive would give away unrestricted and unlimited underground property rights to an unhinged billionaire, who (President) Donald Trump doesn’t even trust anymore, and grant him and his company exclusive access rights beneath our city and a monopoly to profit in perpetuity,” Clemmons said in a statement.
Clemmons said problems have arisen from the Las Vegas project because of a lack of oversight and regulations, and he questioned potential consequences of the Nashville project’s environmental impact as well as threats posed by boring on the city’s aged stormwater and “fragile” wastewater system. 
The plan marks the second project Musk is undertaking in Tennessee’s two biggest cities. An artificial intelligence facility under way in Memphis is drawing opposition from Democratic state Rep. Justin Pearson, who says it will create more pollution that the city’s residents will be forced to breathe.

The Boring Company is in the midst of building the Vegas Loop, a 2.2-mile tunnel that uses Tesla vehicles to carry riders. Initially, it was to have 29 miles of underground tunnels connecting 51 stations around central Las Vegas but fell under criticism for focusing on tourism spots instead of helping workers commute from home to work, according to reports. The project involves the use of Tesla vehicles to transport riders.
A similar tunnel proposal was made in 2018 as part of former Mayor Megan Barry’s $5.4 billion plan to improve transportation. That idea, which was to be funded by a sales tax increase, failed by a 64-36 margin in a local referendum after Barry resigned amid scandal. The plan included 24 miles of light rail and 25 miles of bus rapid  transit.
Nashville Mayor O’Connell is pushing a new transportation plan, expected to cost $3.1 billion over 15 years, that would focus on increased bus routes, transit centers, park and ride facilities and new sidewalks and bike routes.
Monday’s proposal displays a shift in attitude for airport officials who recently responded to WSMV questions by saying, “Since late 2024, there have been numerous rumored and/or hypothetical discussions regarding connecting Nashville International Airport to downtown via tunnel, just like the theoretical discussions regarding the possibility of colonizing Mars in the future.”
At Monday’s event, Metro Nashville Airport President and CEO Doug Kreulen said, “this potential initiative is an important step toward easing roadway congestion and enhancing access to the airport.

They underwrite almost every aspect of life, from the ability to plan for retirement to visiting family over publicly funded roads. But since 1960, the people who fuel the state’s economic engine have been leaving in droves. 
In terms of population growth in the U.S., Michigan has consistently come in 49th over a 30-year period. Making matters worse, the state faces a severe demographic crisis with birth rates projected to decrease through at least 2050 — a crisis now compounded by threats to the immigrant communities helping to fill the gap.
  Birth projections from Michigan Statewide Population Projections through 2050 – screenshot
Immigrants, documented or undocumented, are essential to Michigan’s future, already representing roughly 60% of the state’s population growth over the last decade. 
But the current administration’s campaign of mass deportation represents a direct threat to Michigan’s immigrants, who are our neighbors, co-workers and business owners. The campaign not only threatens these people in our communities but is also a direct threat to Michigan’s fiscal sustainability, potentially removing a significant portion of the workforce and taxpayer base that the state’s economy depends on for continued growth and demographic stability.
The immigrant community brings unique strengths that particularly benefit Michigan’s economic future and are vital to Michigan’s key economic sectors. In U.S. agriculture, Michigan is the sixth largest recipient of H-2A agricultural worker visas, with 19,000 migrant and seasonal farmworkers supporting Michigan’s place as the 16th largest agricultural-exporting state by value. In auto manufacturing, immigrants comprise 14% of the workforce, which the state has identified as a priority industry. The technology sector especially benefits from immigrant innovation, with 30% of Michigan’s software developers being foreign-born — workers who nationally represent 16% of inventors but generate nearly one-quarter of America’s total innovative output when assessed by patent volume, citations received and market value. In health care, where immigrants represent 28% of Michigan’s physicians, they are filling essential roles in a sector under strain, with 32.7% of physicians nearing retirement and 65 of 83 counties designated as health professional shortage areas. 
Furthermore, immigrant tax contributions, which are long-term net positive regardless of legal status, are crucial for Michigan. Immigrants in the state are estimated to pay $5.5 billion and $2.6 billion in federal and state and local taxes, respectively. They are also 24% more likely to be of working age and therefore net fiscal contributors. Some 70,000 immigrant children currently comprise 15% of Michigan’s high school population, making them a significant portion of the future labor force and tax base. 
The state budget is sensitive to revenue changes that could create a mid-year deficit. Deporting immigrants threatens to destabilize the budget in the long run and further destabilize crucial programs like Medicare and Social Security, which undocumented immigrants pay into but cannot benefit from. But new laws and policies in 2025 aim to discourage immigration, encourage self-deportation and expel new Michiganders en masse. 
The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” imposes a new regime of immigration-related fines and fees while decreasing benefit access, rendering immigration unaffordable for many. Simultaneously, the law strips away crucial support systems by blocking lawfully present immigrants from Affordable Care Act premium tax credits and marketplace eligibility, cutting federal Medicaid funding for states and eliminating Child Tax Credit benefits for 22,300 Michigan children — U.S. citizens —  whose parents pay taxes with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) but lack Social Security numbers. 
These punitive measures transform the immigration system into a pay-to-play system that threatens to lock out would-be taxpaying community members from Michigan’s labor force. 
More fundamentally, the law launches an unprecedented campaign of mass deportation by quadrupling the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) detention capacity and flooding communities with immigration agents empowered to raid schools, churches and hospitals — once spaces of safety. 
The $13.5 billion allocated to expand 287(g) agreements that deputize local police to carry out immigration enforcement will further fracture the trust between immigrant families and the institutions meant to protect them. This creates a pervasive atmosphere of fear where parents avoid taking sick children to hospitals, students stop attending school and workers disappear from essential industries rather than risk detention and family separation.
Protecting and welcoming immigrants is not just a moral imperative but an economic necessity. As the state grapples with chronic population decline, an aging workforce and tight budget margins, it cannot afford to squander the demographic dividend that immigration provides. Michigan can embrace the entrepreneurs, innovators and workers that underwrite its future or watch them flee. 
While other states compete aggressively for international talent and investment, Michigan risks ceding its economic recovery by allowing fear to eclipse opportunity and growth. Michigan’s success will ultimately be measured not by how many people it expels, but by how many it inspires to call the Great Lakes State home.

Those areas had previously been 75 mph.  “The biggest change […]","Drivers in Fargo, North Dakota, on July 28, 2025, are warned about an $80 fine for speeding in a construction zone. Minimum fines for speeding in a construction zone increase to $150 on Aug. 1, 2025. Other speeding fines will increase, too. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) North Dakota’s interstate speed limit is going up to 80 mph on Friday, but in some areas, the speed limit will go down. 
The state is lowering the speed limit to 70 mph on interstate segments at Dickinson, Grand Forks, Jamestown, Valley City and Medora. Those areas had previously been 75 mph. 
“The biggest change for people will be slowing down in those areas, and so I think that will be more what we’ll hear about after Aug. 1 than even the 80 miles per hour change,” Lt. Jenna Clawson Huibregtse with the North Dakota Highway Patrol said. 
Bismarck and Fargo have already had slower interstate speeds and those areas are expanding. 
The 55 mph speed limit in West Fargo will stretch west to the Sheyenne Street exit. The lower speed limit area east of Bismarck will be lengthened by one more exit, to Exit 161. 
The higher speed limit, along with an increase in fines for speeding, was hammered out in a compromise in the waning days of this year’s legislative session. 
North Dakota speed limit going up Aug. 1 as governor signs bill 

Other changes approved by the Legislature affecting drivers include new rules on tinted windows and the availability of what are known as “blackout plates” — license plates with white letters and numbers on a plain black background. 
North Dakota’s rule has been that tinting of windshields and front windows must let at least 50% of the sunlight through. That will be reduced to 35% 
Those changes also take effect Friday. 
While the speed limit is going up, drivers won’t see the new signs right away. 
The contractor hired by the North Dakota Department of Transportation won’t be replacing the 75 mph signs with the 80 mph signs until Monday, and it will take at least two weeks for the new signs to go up. 
Drivers can still go 80 legally though. 
“It’s North Dakota law, so people are allowed to drive 80,” Clawson Huibregtse said. 
Many drivers already go 80. She said the average speed on North Dakota interstates is 81 mph. 
Clawson Huibregtse said the faster speeds mean drivers should increase their following distance. 
“You have to give yourself more time to stop if something occurs in front of you or somebody jams on their brake,” she said. 
The bill that increased the speed limit also increased speeding fines, but with a simpler calculation for those fines, which Clawson Huibregtse said is a benefit to state troopers. 
She said troopers previously had to consult about 10 different tables to calculate the speeding fine. 
“This simplified it down to two plus your special zones like construction zones and school zones, so significantly less cumbersome,” she said. “It did increase fine fines a little bit, but we are still the cheapest state in the nation to get a speeding ticket.” 
There also are increased fines for areas such as school zones and construction zones. The additional fine for speeding in a construction zone with workers present would increase from $80 to $150.
For highways with a speed limit of 65 mph or higher, the fine will be $20 or $5 for every mile per hour over the limit, whichever is greater. If the driver is going more than 16 mph over the limit., $20 is added to the fine. A driver ticketed for going 95 mph in a 80 zone would be fined $75; but if the ticket is for 96 mph, the fine jumps up to $100.

Adrian Smith proposes bigger tax breaks for mining rare earth elements,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/nebraska-u-s-rep-adrian-smith-proposes-bigger-tax-breaks-for-mining-rare-earth-elements/,Nebraska U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith is proposing additional tax relief aimed at increasing U.S production of minerals used in electronics,"U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., listens to a presenter on Monday, June 19, 2023, in Lincoln, Neb. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN – Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith is proposing additional tax relief aimed at increasing American production of minerals used in electronics, including microchips. 
The legislation aims to increase the “depletion allowance” for producers of rare earth materials and scandium from 14% to match the tax break enjoyed by producers of minerals deemed the “highest-priority,” which is 22%. 
The “depletion allowance” is a tax break that allows companies that mine the materials to “recover a percentage of gross income.” 
Smith, a senior member of the House’s tax-writing Weighs and Means Committee, represents Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd Congressional District. He introduced the measure along with California Democratic Rep. Jimmy Panetta and Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Guy Reschenthaler. 
“Embracing our nation’s full capacity to produce critical minerals at home is essential to growing our economy,” Smith said in a statement. 
Rare earth materials and scandium are used in a wide variety of technologies, from smartphones to electric vehicles, wind turbines and even jet fighters. The 17 types of metals known as “rare earth” minerals are actually quite common and mined globally, but China has cornered a near-monopoly on refining them. 
Nebraska has a rare-earth mine in the southeastern part of the state that is home to the second-largest deposit of rare earth elements in the U.S. The mining company, NioCorp, plans to ramp up pre-construction efforts. The other mine is in Montana. 
China, earlier this year, paused the export of several rare earth minerals and metals as a response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods. In April, Ukraine and the U.S. signed an agreement granting the U.S. a stake in its mineral reserves in exchange for tacit security guarantees against future Russian aggression.

(Allen Best/Big Pivots)This story is the first part of a four-part series about three groundwater basins in Colorado. It was originally published by Big Pivots. The story was commissioned by Water Education Colorado and a version of it appears in the summer 2025 issue of Headwaters magazine.
To understand the predicament in the Republican River Basin of eastern Colorado, you need to appreciate the volume of water being hoisted from the underlying High Plains Aquifer. The most important component is the Ogallala.
Farmers and the few small towns in the Republican River Basin average 720,000 acre-feet of withdrawals annually. In one hot and dry year, 2012, they pumped 940,000 acre-feet. As a point of reference, Blue Mesa Reservoir, the largest water body in the state, can hold 947,435 acre-feet.
Groundwater mining cannot be sustained far into the future in many areas of the Republican River Basin. Wells in some areas have not declined while wells in other areas have declined 13 feet during the last decade. Pumping at existing rates cannot be maintained. Within 25 years, about a third of land that’s now irrigated will have no water. In other places, pumps already sputter.

“Sustainable” and “pumping” do not belong in the same sentence in this basin. The water of the Republican River Basin in the High Plains Aquifer accumulated from 18 to 4 million years ago.
Far from the snowmelt of the Rocky Mountains, it is recharged by minimal surface water. Based on studies, the Republican River Compact of Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas assumes that 17% of the water on the surface trickles down through the ground to the aquifers. So, only very slowly is the aquifer recharged. It’s mostly an ancient bank account with now small, almost tiny deposits and fast-and-furious withdrawals.
The Republican River Basin and several other regions of the state rely largely on groundwater. In a 2024 decision, Colorado Supreme Court justices pointed out that it would be difficult to overstate the importance of groundwater given the state’s population and arid climate. The 285,000 wells poked into the earth across the state deliver 18% of Colorado’s water.
The Republican River Basin, the San Luis Valley, and the south metro area of the Denver Basin are all, to varying degrees, rethinking water — both its sources and uses. All three have historically relied heavily on groundwater, and all have made at least limited progress in shifting toward more sustainable groundwater use in the last 20 years. The cities have adopted policies that foster smaller, less water-intensive lawns. They have diversified their sources. Two south-metro water utilities that 20 years ago pulled nearly all their water from wells, today have lessened that dependency to 60% to 65%.
Farmers in the Republican River Basin and San Luis Valley have somewhat different challenges. They have taken action to use less water and to save their communities, but whether those actions match the scale of the challenges they face is another matter. Changes can best be achieved before emergency sirens wail. In the Republican River Basin, some already see a swirl of red lights warning of catastrophe ahead.
It’s going fast
The Republican River Basin consists of 7,000 square miles, an area slightly smaller than New Jersey. It is largely located within a triangle between Julesburg, Limon and Cheyenne Wells. A few businesses cater to travelers but agriculture constitutes nearly all of the basin’s economic foundation.
An average 17 inches of precipitation falls per year across the basin, less in some areas. High-dollar agriculture depends almost entirely upon water drawn from the Ogallala. A 2010 state report found that of the basin’s 600,000 acres then under irrigation, only 1,000 were supplied by surface water. Locals suggest the true number is far, far less.
Dryland farming prevailed until the arrival of high-capacity pumps and rural electrification in the late 1940s. Farmers in the 1950s began converting dryland areas to irrigation, dramatically expanding crop yields. Other farmers arrived to plow hitherto virgin turf. Twice in the 1970s, groundwater extraction exceeded a million acre-feet per year.
Drafting of groundwater via 5,000 wells today produces a bounty of herbaceous crops. Most end up in the bellies of livestock. Two feedlots near Yuma alone can each hold more than 150,000 cattle and several others can accommodate 75,000. The basin also has three hog farms, several dairies, and an ethanol plant.

In 1942, Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas allocated the waters of the Republican River and its tributaries in an interstate compact. The state engineer in 1973 ordered a moratorium on new wells. The most powerful limitation did not come until 1990. Rules were changed, reducing the allowed rate of depletion, effectively precluding new well permits.
Existing wells, however, were drawing down the aquifers in the Republican River Basin. Kansas in the 1990s complained that it was getting shorted by Nebraska. Nebraska in turn blamed Colorado. A 2002 settlement stipulation among the three states represented a new line in the sand. By whatever means, Colorado had to figure out how to deliver water to the downriver states.
Colorado responded by forming the Republican River Water Conservation District. In effect, the state gave farmers and others in the eight-county district responsibility for figuring out how to comply with the compact. To help achieve compliance, legislators gave the district authority to levy fees on irrigators. The fee, originally $5 per acre, has been boosted twice and is now $30 per acre annually.
This $15 million in annual revenue is used in several ways. An early project was a pipeline to boost the amount of water flowing into Nebraska. The pipeline carries water from eight wells previously used for irrigation. They had been drilled amid hills with sugar-like sand between Wray and Holyoke in the deepest part of the aquifer. The water from these wells flows 12.6 miles through the pipeline and into the North Fork near the Nebraska border. The wells are pumped from October to April, ensuring minimal loss to evaporation or riverine trees or grasses.
This pipeline, since its completion in 2012, has allowed Colorado to meet its compact delivery requirements. The cost of the wells, pipeline, and water rights was $72 million. Faced with declining production from these wells, the district in 2025 is planning four more wells and 9.5 miles of pipe at an estimated cost of $14 million to deliver what the compact pledges to Nebraska.
  With members and staff of the Republican River Water Conservation District looking on, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill in May 2023 that allocated $30 million to be used to retire irrigated acreage as necessary to meet a 2029 deadline. (Office of Gov. Jared Polis)
In another move toward compact compliance, Bonny Reservoir, a 165,238 acre-foot impoundment on the South Fork of the Republican, was drained. Prior to the 2011 draining, Bonny had delighted boaters and anglers but lost too much water to evaporation and seepage. Water now flows more efficiently downstream.
More actions were needed to ensure Nebraska and Kansas received their apportioned water. Beginning in 2006, Colorado removed 30,000 to 35,000 acres from irrigation. A multi-state agreement in 2016 specified that Colorado would remove an additional 25,000 acres in the South Fork drainage by 2029. Dick Wolfe, then Colorado’s state engineer, was asked at the time how this was to be done. He paused a moment, then likened it to getting a haircut: a snip here, a snip there.
This snipping of irrigated acreage has been encouraged with financial incentives assembled from pots of local, state and federal funds. The money is delivered via two federal programs: the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). The latter allows farmers to use the land for dryland farming or grazing.
By early 2025, the Republican River Water Conservation District had retired 17,120 of the 25,000 acres as required by the 2016 settlement. It was a milestone, a time for momentary celebration. The harder work lies ahead. Nearly 8,000 additional acres must be retired to meet the December 2029 deadline. If the goal is not met, the state engineer has authority to shut down wells. Nobody wants that, least of all the state engineer. To help sweeten the incentives in 2025, state legislators appropriated $6 million. This adds $750 to the $4,500 per acre paid to farmers participating in CREP and $750 to the $3,500 per acre in EQIP.
  By June 2025, Bonny Reservoir in Yuma County had a forest of trees, but the water that had drawn boaters and anglers was drained in 2011. (Allen Best/Big Pivots)
Using less water is the paramount challenge. This has been accomplished almost exclusively by taking land out of irrigation. There are other ways, too. Today, corn is king, responsible for about 85% of irrigated acres in the basin. It commonly receives 20 to 22 inches of supplemental water. A growing realization of late has been that less can be more. Planting fewer seeds — say 18,000 per acre instead of 30,000 — will save money and require less fertilizer. Fewer seeds will then require only 12 to 14 inches of supplemental water, meaning less pumping and shaving electricity bills. Lower crop yields can counterintuitively produce better profit margins.
Conversations are also underway about water-conserving crop alternatives: milo, millet and wheat, kidney and pinto beans, even black-eyed peas. It’s partly a matter of developing markets. Deb Daniel, the general manager of the district since 2011, has been toying with how to emphasize productivity strategies with the phrase “crop per drop.”
None of this adds up to the scale of the challenge, though.
  Most of the water in the Republican River comes from the aquifers, and by Wray there’s little in the river. (Allen Best/Big Pivots)
Kenny Helling, a fourth-generation farmer from the Idalia area of Yuma County, believes more is needed than financial incentives to take land out of production. “Continuing to throw money at the problem won’t fix the problem,” he says. Ways must be found to keep land in irrigation, because irrigated land pays more in property taxes. Those taxes are crucial for operating fire departments, schools and other community purposes. “It’s a very big concern to me.”
The answers? Helling sees value in permits specifying reduced volume of pumped water. He would like to see more crop rotation.
Helling was a member of the Republican River Water Conservation District Board of Directors for nine years. He says the district needs other tools. The true authority for limiting pumping belongs to the eight groundwater subdistricts within the basin. They do not use it. Why?
“Everybody on those groundwater management districts are generally irrigators,” says Helling. “Most of them are neighbors. A lot of them go to church together. A lot of them might have kids and grandkids in school together. Nobody wants to make anybody mad. And so, unfortunately, the groundwater management districts do not use all the authority they could to restrict the amount of water used.”
Colorado legislators, he says, need to give the Republican River Water Conservation District more authority. It needs sticks, not just carrots. “We need to use less water.”
Tim Pautler told members of the Colorado Groundwater Commission something similar in May 2025. A dryland farmer from the Stratton area, he has served on the Republican River Water Conservation District’s Board of Directors for 21 years. He says that the board has accomplished almost no basin-wide conservation. It hasn’t figured out how to substantially reduce water use.
Most landowners who have taken advantage of the incentives have been irrigators who have less groundwater available in their wells — nearly all in the southwestern portion of the basin, where many wells were already sputtering. He says if reduced water use is the goal, the fees charged to farmers must be based on acre-feet of water pumped and not just on irrigated acres.
There’s no pretense of sustainability in the Republican River Basin. The water deposited over millions of years is now being mined. The task is to maximize value of the remaining water, to prolong the availability of the High Plains Aquifer. Few have yet been willing to talk about the gravity of the challenge.
“I hope enough water remains in the hole to sustain society,” says Pautler. “I hope we don’t go completely dry.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana’s newest member of Congress accuses President Donald Trump of unconstitutional actions that he says are destroying democracy. 
U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat representing Louisiana’s new 6th Congressional District, delivered his remarks Monday to the Baton Rouge Press Club. 
“I think the president is really bringing this country closer and closer to a dictatorship, and I’ve said to my constituents the best way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him,” Fields said.
The White House did not provide a response when reached for comment Monday afternoon. 
Fields’ remarks were particularly pointed for the even-keeled congressman who has been a fixture of politics in Baton Rouge since the 1990s. Fields is known both for his progressive politics and his willingness to work with Republicans, having previously chaired a state Senate committee in a Republican super-majority thanks to his close relationship with Gov. Jeff Landry.

His speech focused primarily on Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which Fields called “one big ugly bill” because of the legislation’s steep cuts to the nation’s social safety net programs. The bill will reduce federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by roughly $186 billion and cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, which is estimated to take health coverage away from 10 million people, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
“Hospitals will close,” Fields said. “Grocery stores will close.”
The congressman also criticized Trump’s spending and tax law for its massive debt burden. The measure extends tax breaks and provisions that largely benefit wealthy earners and owners of large estates, businesses and trust funds. It is forecast to increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion from 2025 through 2034, according to the Tax Foundation. 
The one “silver lining” in the legislation, Fields said, is its provision that exempts taxes on tips. It was the only  part of the bill he supported, he said. Workers can deduct the first $25,000 in tips they earn from their taxable income, but any additional amount is subject to federal income taxes. The tax break is not available to anyone who earns more than $150,000 a year.
Fields also weighed in on the Trump administration’s immigration policy. He said he believes the U.S. should maintain secure borders but disapproves of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s aggressive tactics. Using masked agents to grab people off the street and imprison them in foreign lands without affording them a court hearing is “simply unconscionable” and a violation of due process rights in the Constitution, he said.
Fields said he still has faith in the U.S. Supreme Court to abide by the Constitution but criticized the GOP-majority Congress for abandoning its duty as a separate, equal branch of government that is supposed to limit presidential overreaches. 
“We’re destroying our democracy as we know it today,” Fields said. “It’s not about party; it’s about right and wrong, constitutional and unconstitutional.”
Although Fields took several jabs at Trump, his overall soft-spoken messaging contrasts with Democratic Party strategies to break through to voters constantly bombarded with digital distractions. His most pointed comments came in response to questions from reporters, which he fielded during most of the luncheon. His prepared speech was short and focused largely on issues affecting his constituents. 
“I think our discourse should always be civil no matter how much we disagree … but people need to go to the polls and vote,” he said. 
Asked if he feels Democrats need to embrace a more politically charged messaging style that focuses on Republican scandals such the Jeffrey Epstein files in order to turn out voters, Fields said he plans to stick to his old strategy.
“I think we should deal with the issues that affect people back home directly,” he said.

(Douglas Sacha | Getty Images)For those who have been following the state’s opioid epidemic over the years, it probably came as no surprise more than half of the money cities and counties spent last year from their first share of the settlement funds went to law enforcement.
West Virginia has a serious drug problem. For years, the Mountain State has been referred to as “ground zero” for the nation’s ongoing drug and overdose epidemic.
Research has proven that the most effective way to help people who use drugs intravenously is syringe service programs. These programs provide free needles for drug users to help stop the spread of diseases, like HIV and hepatitis C.
However, those programs are banned in West Virginia. 
And while harm reduction programs have proven to be effective, lawmakers continue to make it difficult to open or run them. 
The National Institute on Drug Abuse says that the best way to help people addicted to opioids is to treat them with medication, like methadone, which is more effective for people addicted to fentanyl. Researchers say more methadone centers are needed to help with the drug epidemic. 
West Virginia has nine methadone clinics, and state law prohibits any more from opening.
There’s also a shortage of treatment beds — specifically in the areas of the state that have been hardest hit by the drug epidemic.
Instead of passing any laws that are considered “best practices” to aid those in recovery and addiction, lawmakers have chosen to focus on criminalization of people who suffer from substance use disorder and harsher penalties for those drug dealers (which, oftentimes, are themselves suffering from substance use disorder).
So after West Virginia Watch reporter Caity Coyne spent hours and hours putting together data from a spending report from the West Virginia First Foundation, neither of us were shocked when the numbers showed the majority (52.76%) of the money went to law enforcement.
Rehabilitation, recovery and treatment programs received only 6.43% of the initial round of localities’ opioid funding. 
The state’s memorandum of understanding dictates how the opioid funds can be spent — which is basically on anything that can be used to help drug abatement efforts.
Caity reported that police across the state have so far received $3.64 million of the opioid settlement money, for things like 22 new police cruisers, officers’ salaries, drug K-9 teams, firearms, ammo and a new shooting range.
Sure, you can argue that police will keep drug dealers off the street and that helps with the drug epidemic. But new guns and ammo? A shooting range? Drones? It doesn’t inspire much confidence or hope that so many of the agencies responding to these issues seem to be entering the situation with the presumed need to fire their guns. 
Granville Police invested more than $7,000 in “more accurate” firearms. The Madison Police Department bought a moving shooting target system that can mimic the “unpredictable movement, variable speeds and irregular patterns” of people in a “mental health crisis” or who are suffering from “drug-induced psychosis or aggression.”
Or if they must have weapons, a better use of the money would be on less lethal items, like tasers or stun guns. Or training like Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD), which teaches officers to divert individuals struggling with drug addiction into intensive support programs instead of putting them in jail.
It’s also disappointing to see counties spend the money on their jails. I understand that running a jail is expensive, but this is one-time money. And, to be clear, if we’re putting such a large portion of money into law enforcement to increase arrests, these jail bills are only going to rise.
There are ways that counties can lessen those operating costs  — such as harm reduction programs and alternative sentencing instead of jailing people, and creating shelter beds for homeless people instead of arresting them for being homeless.
More than 65% of this first round of opioid settlement money has been used on things that are not at all proven to help with the state’s drug problem. This money was split between law enforcement, jail bills and local governments paying their bills. 
Meanwhile, just around 31% went to areas that actually provide direct services and, possibly, save some lives.
Quick response teams, which are often a mix of police officials, counselors, peer coaches and first responders, received 9.92%. Emergency medical services received 9.3%. Since they often respond to drug overdose calls, it makes more sense for them to receive funding for vehicles and equipment.
It sounds great that youth services received money, even if it was only 5.98%, until you look at where most of it went.
GameChanger is a drug prevention program established in 2018 that has set a goal to be in all West Virginia schools. The program has dozens of sponsors, and according to tax documents, received about $1 million in funding from businesses, the government and private companies, according to reporting from West Virginia University. 
A teacher participating in the GameChanger program said “There’s no real curriculum,” and they must plan lessons themselves. Prevention experts say the program lacks a research-backed curriculum and has no measurable outcomes to show.
Just like the state Legislature, cities and counties have — for the most part — chosen to ignore experts and use this funding in a way that won’t help reduce drug overdoses. 
Until lawmakers start listening to actual medical experts, things will never improve.

It looked for a while like the coal mining era was over in the Clearfork Valley of East Tennessee, a pocket of mountainous land on the Kentucky border. A permit for a new mine hasn’t been issued since 2020, and the last mine in the region shuttered two years ago. One company after another has filed for bankruptcy, with many of them simply walking away from the ecological damage they’d wrought without remediating the land as the law requires.
But there’s going to be a new mine in East Tennessee — one of a few slated across the country, their permits expedited by President Donald Trump’s declaration of an “energy emergency” and his designating coal a critical mineral.
Trump was only hours into his second term when he signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency that directed federal agencies to “identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them” to identify and exploit domestic energy resources. The administration also scrapped Biden-era rules that made it easier to bring mining-related complaints to the federal government.
The emergency designation compresses the typically yearslong environmental review required for a new mine to just weeks. These assessments are to be compiled within 14 days of receiving a permit application, limiting comment periods to 10 days. The process of compiling an environmental impact statement — a time-intensive procedure involving scientists from many disciplines and assessments of wildlife populations, water quality, and other factors — is reduced to less than a month. The government insists this eliminates burdensome red tape.
“We’re not just issuing permits — we’re supporting communities, securing supply chains for critical industries, and making sure the U.S. stays competitive in a changing global energy landscape,” Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for land and minerals management at the Interior Department, said in a statement. A representative of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement told Grist that community safety is top of mind, pointing to the administration’s $725 million investment in abandoned mineland reclamation.
The Department of Interior ruled that a new mine slated for Bryson Mountain in Claiborne County, Tennessee, would have “no significant impact” and approved it. It will provide about two dozen jobs. The strip mine will cover 635 acres of previously mined land that has reverted to forest. Hurricane Creek Mining plans to pry 1.8 million tons of coal from the earth over 10 years.
The Clearfork Valley, which straddles two rural counties and has long struggled economically, bears the scars of more than a century of underground and surface mining. Local residents and scientists regularly test the creeks for signs of bright-orange mine drainage and other toxins.
The land is part of a tract the Nature Conservancy bought in 2019 for conservation purposes, but because of ownership structures in the coalfields, it owns only the land, not the minerals within it. “We have concerns about the potential environmental impacts of the operation,” the organization said in a statement. “We seek assurance that there will be adequate bonding, consistent and transparent environmental monitoring, and good reclamation practices.”
Matt Hepler, an environmental scientist with the environmental advocacy group Appalachian Voices, has been following the mine’s public review process since the company applied for a permit in 2023. He remains skeptical that things will work out well for Hurricane Creek Mining. Despite Trump’s promise that he is “bringing back an industry that’s been abandoned,” coal has seen a steady decline, driven in no small part by the plummeting price of natural gas. The number of people working in the nation’s coal mines has steadily declined from 89,000 or so in 2012 to about 41,300 today. Production fell 31 percent during Trump’s first and has continued that slide.
“What is this company doing differently that’s going to allow them to profitably succeed while so many other mines have not been able to make that work?” he said. “All the time I’ve been working in Tennessee there’s only been a couple of mines permitted to begin with because production has been on the downswing there,” Hepler added.
Economists say opening more mines may not reverse the global downward trend. Plentiful, cheap natural gas, along with increasingly affordable wind and solar, are displacing coal as an energy source. The situation is so dire that one Stanford University study argued that gas would continue its climb even with the elimination of coal-related regulations. Metallurgical coal used to make steel — and which Hurricane Creek hopes  to excavate — fares no better. It has seen flat or declining demand amid innovation in steel production.
Expedited permits are leading to new mines in the West as well. The Department of the Interior just approved a land lease for Wyoming’s first new coal mine in 50 years. Ramaco Resources will extract and process the material to retrieve the rare earth and other critical minerals found alongside it. The Trump administration also is selling coal leases on previously protected federal land. Shiloh Hernandez, a senior attorney at the Northern Rockies office of the environmental nonprofit Earthjustice, thinks it is a fool’s errand.
“I don’t see them changing the fundamental dynamics of coal,” he said. “That’s not to say that the Trump administration won’t cause lots of harm in the process by both making the public pay more money for energy than they should and by keeping some of these coal plants and coal mines that really are zombies.”
Still, Hernandez said he isn’t seeing many new permits, just quicker approval of those already in the pipeline. That said, the Trump administration’s moves to streamline environmental review will reduce oversight and the time the public has to scrutinize coal projects.
“The result is there’s just going to be it’s going to be more difficult for the public to participate, and more harm is going to occur,” Hernandez said. “There’s going to be less attention to the harm that’s caused by these operations.”

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)A federal appeals court on Monday overturned a lower court ruling that had prevented enforcement of an Arkansas law limiting the number of voters someone can assist at the polls.
The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruling vacated a permanent injunction granted by a federal district judge that declared Act 658 of 2009 in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. Monday’s ruling also overturned the award of attorneys’ fees granted by U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks of Arkansas’ Eastern District.
Act 658 prohibits someone other than a poll worker from helping more than six voters mark and cast their ballots. Immigrant advocacy group Arkansas United sued in 2020 to block enforcement of the six-voter limit, saying it violated the Voting Rights Act. Arkansas United traditionally helps voters with limited English skills at the polls.
Brooks enjoined enforcement of the six-voter limit in 2022, and the circuit court stayed the injunction about two months before that year’s elections. The state filed an updated appeal challenging Brooks’ award of about $103,000 in attorneys fees to Arkansas United and its co-plaintiffs in 2023.
Monday’s circuit court ruling used the same reasoning the court used in an Arkansas redistricting case in which it declared that only the U.S. attorney general can enforce the Voting Rights Act’s provisions. The historic voting rights law does not grant individuals or private organizations the right to sue for enforcement, the appeals court decided in 2023, thereby upending years of precedent.
“In Arkansas State Conference NAACP v. Arkansas Board of Apportionment,” the appeals court said Monday, “… we held there is no private right of action under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Here, we are asked to decide whether there is a private right of action under § 208 of the VRA. Like the provision at issue in Arkansas State Conference, we conclude the text and structure of § 208 do not create a private right of action.”
The circuit court ruling says Section 208 “speaks only of the assistance that a voter ‘may be given’ … it is silent as to ‘who can enforce it.’”

In a statement Monday, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said the circuit judges “properly determined that the district court erred by denying the State’s motion for summary judgment and by ruling for the plaintiffs.” 
Monday’s decision means election officials can continue to enforce the law and voters have confidence in elections, he said. 
Act 658 of 2009, signed into law by then-Gov. Mike Beebe, a Democrat, “protects the right to vote free from undue influence or manipulation by limiting the number of voters that one person can assist in marking ballots to six,” Griffin said.
Griffin noted that this “commonsense approach to protecting our election process went unchallenged until 2020, when Arkansas United filed a lawsuit challenging the law shortly before midnight on the day before the general election.”
Arkansas United directed requests for comment to the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, whose attorneys are representing the nonprofit organization in the case. MALDEF did not return a request for comment by deadline.

It occurs when powerful politicians leave office and then later return to visit their old stomping grounds.
As regulars at the North Carolina General Assembly can attest, unless the politician in question has gone on to another position of prominence in which they wield significant influence, the response from the members currently serving is almost always the same: a moment of polite applause, a few handshakes and selfies and, well, that’s about it. By the time of their second visit, the once prominent pol is pretty much just another face in the crowd.
A similar process often impacts political leaders – most typically presidents and governors – who find themselves confronting term limits and the approach of lame duck status. Absent the possibility that they’ll stay in the game and remain a force with which to be reckoned after departing office, even powerful politicians can quickly find their influence leaking away like air from a deflating tire.
The expectation, since confirmed, that he would seek a U.S. Senate seat, combined with his steady overall popularity with voters, helped to insulate former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper somewhat from this phenomenon, but for two-term presidents, genuine political relevance and influence as the end approaches – much less in the years that follow — is almost always elusive.
Bill Clinton was part of an unprecedented effort by a former president to evade this age-old pattern by returning to the White House as First Gentleman, but that was a unique situation unlikely to be repeated anytime soon.
And this reality – the hard truth that political power is fleeting and generally not hereditary in the American system — is something that seems sure to soon impact Donald Trump and the cult of personality to which he has given rise.
It’s true of course, that we are just a little over six months into a second Trump term that’s scheduled to run through 2029. It’s also true that the first six months have featured a whirlwind of activity – including scores of norm-shattering executive orders, hundreds of federal lawsuits (many of which Trump has won), and the enactment of one of the largest and most radical pieces of legislation in U.S. history.
Indeed, when it comes to dominating the political and lawmaking scenes, Trump is arguably at the pinnacle of his career and power. Among most Republicans, his word is currently law and few presidents in U.S. history have ever claimed and sought to act as if they had such complete power.
But it’s also true that there are several factors already at work that are causing noteworthy cracks to form in the Trump edifice – cracks that are likely to grow and spread (perhaps rapidly).
Topping the immediate list in this realm is the metastasizing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. Though Trump has long skillfully manipulated and exploited the controversy surrounding his former pal and his sex crimes, there is growing evidence that his magic in this area may be running out.
Having helped convince millions of his followers that there was a nefarious conspiracy at work surrounding Epstein, Trump’s sudden “there’s nothing to see here” explanation is falling flat with many on the right. And if any sort of smoking gun emerges confirming Trump participation in Epstein’s sexcapades, it would be a presidency-altering development.
But even if the Epstein crisis somehow fizzles, the list of other looming Trump troubles remains long and daunting.
There are his ebbing poll numbers. The latest Gallup Poll finds his approval rating at 37% (29% among independents) — the lowest point of second term.
There’s the widespread unpopularity of the so-called “big, beautiful bill.” While it’s true that many provisions are not scheduled to take effect right away, it’s hard to see how the impending reality of lost health insurance and food assistance for millions (or the plan to ignore the global climate crisis) can possibly boost Trump’s popularity.
There are the upcoming 2026 elections in which the chance that Democrats will win back control of the U.S. House and maybe even the Senate continues to grow steadily. Talk about a presidency-altering development!
And then, of course, there is Trump’s mental and physical health. With his 80th birthday fast approaching, a recent diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency, obvious weight and memory challenges, and a well-known penchant for teenager’s diet, Trump’s chances for a relatively rapid decline would appear significantly less than zero.
Nothing is for certain, of course. Trump has confounded critics many times before and with six Supreme Court justices sitting ready to do his bidding, he remains formidable.
But given the challenges he faces, the lack of any plausible political heir apparent and the emptiness of the GOP bench right now, it’s easy to see how both Trump and the MAGA movement could be poised for a rapid political decline. And if that happens, experience shows that it won’t take long for both to quickly be seen and treated as yesterday’s news.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trumptariffs-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-29 05:56:12.951765

The Mississippi State Department of Health, like other state health departments, is concerned about the potential loss of federal funding. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.
Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, is pushing back against Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s recent claims that all 2,500 immigrants detained in statewide operations since March were violent offenders, saying Monday she doesn’t believe it — and won’t — until the administration provides proof.
‘They should be arrested’: Youngkin holds firm on support for ICE raids at Virginia courthouses

“Until you show me that all 2,500, all of their cases, what they were convicted of … you are innocent until proven guilty,” McClellan told The Mercury after meeting with courthouse staff, advocates and attorneys at the Chesterfield County Courthouse, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers have conducted ongoing raids. 
McClellan stopped short of directly accusing Youngkin of lying, but she made clear her doubts. 
“I would say officials in the Trump administration are not telling the truth in 100% of the cases,” she said. “I think the governor either is not doing his due diligence to ask the right questions and is just parroting what he has been told — at best.”
McClellan’s comments came as part of a broader rebuke of current immigration enforcement tactics in Virginia — including federal-only ICE operations like the courthouse raids and the parallel efforts of Youngkin’s Virginia Homeland Security Task Force. 
“I heard stories today about people who were detained when they came for their arraignment, so they haven’t been convicted and they haven’t had their trial,” she said. “I want details. And until the administration provides them, because … we know they have lied in certain instances, I won’t believe what the governor has to say.”
While the Chesterfield arrests are not part of the task force, McClellan linked them as symptoms of a state and federal immigration system that she said increasingly violates due process and fosters fear among communities of color.
Last week, the Richmond Democrat introduced legislation, H.R. 4703, that would require the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to track and publicly report every instance where U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are detained or deported for immigration enforcement purposes. While the bill’s full text is not yet available, McClellan said its goal is to create transparency and prevent wrongful removals.
“We know that citizens and people lawfully present have been detained and deported, primarily because of the great reporting from the press,” she said. “But we don’t know how many, we don’t know all the circumstances, so this is part of my oversight responsibilities.”
On Monday, McClellan visited the Chesterfield courthouse at the invitation of Circuit Court Clerk Amanda Pohl, who said she was alarmed by what the courthouse staff has witnessed over the last month.
“We are not getting any of the names, we’re not getting anything like that,” Pohl said of the individuals detained inside the courthouse. “What we’re seeing at the General District Court is that people are coming in for traffic violations, for minor offenses. They’re trying to have their day in court, and ICE is taking them.”
Pohl said that at least 16 people were detained by ICE agents during a single week in June, and that federal activity at the courthouse has continued since then — though more sporadically. 
“We saw somebody come in, who had a charge. His case was continued. He had no other prior convictions, and he was still taken by ICE. He didn’t even get to have his day in court, and he was still taken from his family,” she said. “From what I understand, that gentleman was deported very quickly.”
A spokesman for ICE on Monday did not respond to a request for comment about the agency’s ongoing operations in Chesterfield.










Being an undocumented immigrant is not a crime,” she said. “And the dehumanization that this administration is doing — trying to paint with a broad brush every undocumented immigrant, and U.S. citizens, that they are hardened criminals — is wrong and is un-American.


– U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond


Youngkin has repeatedly stood by the arrests carried out by ICE and those under the Homeland Security Task Force — a state initiative created earlier this year to work in coordination with federal partners, including ICE — and has insisted that all detainees are dangerous criminals.
“They should be arrested,” the governor said earlier this month, defending the task force’s mission. “These are folks that are here illegally and they’ve committed crimes.”
But McClellan said the absence of supporting data makes such blanket characterizations irresponsible and dangerous.
“Nobody knows the details around it,” she said. “That is creating fear that we have seen among communities of color, particularly in the Spanish-speaking community or anybody who’s brown.”
Virginia Attorney General Miyares, who has championed the task force and joined Youngkin in calling for tougher immigration enforcement, last week declined to provide evidence backing up the administration’s “violent offender” claims when asked by The Mercury.
Miyares offers no proof that 2,500 immigrants arrested by Va. task force were violent offenders

McClellan said what’s happening in Chesterfield and across the state goes far beyond any single program — and is undermining trust in law enforcement and the courts. 
“We’re seeing people who aren’t showing up to get marriage licenses, who aren’t showing up to report crimes, to press charges, to testify, because they’re afraid, ‘Am I going to be disappeared even though I’ve done nothing wrong?’” she said. “It is not making our communities safe. It’s having the opposite effect.”
McClellan said she’s heard from translators who are now afraid to appear in court, and domestic violence advocates who say victims are staying silent out of fear. 
“It’s hard enough to get someone to step forward who has been domestically or sexually abused,” she said. “I’m hearing instances of all of that in the Richmond region, and it is concerning.”
McClellan also raised alarm over ICE agents reportedly wearing face coverings and refusing to identify themselves. 
“All law enforcement agents, including immigration agents, need to be able to show their face and their badge or their identification,” she said. “If you can’t see their face, you don’t have their identification, you can’t hold them accountable, and that person cannot enforce their own civil rights. And that is dangerous.”
While the Chesterfield raids are not tied to Youngkin’s task force, McClellan said the impact is the same — a culture of fear driven by racial profiling and mass enforcement, not public safety.
“There are people who have been in this country, in some cases for decades, who may have been lawfully present when they first got here, or who may be on a path to citizenship,” she said. “There are refugees from Afghanistan who worked with the U.S. government. There are many reasons why someone may lack documentation today. That doesn’t make them criminals.”
McClellan emphasized that immigration violations are civil offenses — not crimes — and said conflating them with criminal law is misleading. 
“Being an undocumented immigrant is not a crime,” she said. “And the dehumanization that this administration is doing — trying to paint with a broad brush every undocumented immigrant, and U.S. citizens, that they are hardened criminals — is wrong and is un-American.”
Recent analysis by Stateline adds further context to McClellan’s concerns: Fewer than half of the nearly 112,000 ICE arrests made nationwide between Jan. 20 and late June were of convicted criminals — just 40 % — far lower than the 53% rate during the same period under the Biden administration. 
The share of those arrested with violent crime convictions shrank from 10% to 7%, while arrests tied to drug convictions fell from 9% to 5%. 
At the same time, the number of detainees without any criminal record nearly tripled, rising from roughly 47% to 60% of ICE arrests, most commonly for minor traffic or immigration violations. McClellan’s demands for data and due process protections align with these national trends, as critics argue the enforcement push increasingly sweeps up individuals who lack serious criminal histories.
‘Hallowed ground, desecrated’: ICE sweeps at Chesterfield court draw fierce backlash

Pohl said she invited several local officials, nonprofit leaders and attorneys to Monday’s meeting, including Sheriff Karl Leonard, who runs the Chesterfield County jail. “Unfortunately, we didn’t get a response,” she said. “But I’m sure he has other obligations.”
Pohl also emphasized that her office does not coordinate with ICE or the Sheriff’s department and is not participating in enforcement. “Sheriff Leonard and I do not collaborate around this issue … but we have made it very clear: We’re not assisting ICE,” she said.
Leonard also did not respond to requests for comment Monday. 
For McClellan, the current moment echoes dark chapters of American history. 
“This is very reminiscent, to me, of the backlash to Reconstruction, when Confederate iconography was placed at courthouses in an effort to intimidate certain communities,” she said. “That intimidation is happening here too, to brown people. It is wrong. It is very reminiscent of what we saw in Nazi Germany.”
As Virginia’s first Black congresswoman and a longtime civil rights attorney, McClellan said her concerns are rooted in protecting the constitutional rights of all residents.
“I think there are ways that we can invest in processing immigration cases in a much better way,” she said. “But I think the way not to do it is to dehumanize people. And what the Trump administration is doing is dehumanizing the immigrant community, whether they are citizens or not, including children. And that is wrong.”

Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.

Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.

Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

Several states have passed new laws regulating these machines, which officials say are increasingly being used to scam consumers. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.

 Three bills related to cryptocurrency failed in Virginia’s legislative session this year. SB 1170 would have required candidates to disclose digital assets to the the Virginia Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council. HB 2428 would have amended state code to add computer equipment and peripherals used in a data center, including systems used to engage in digital asset mining business activities, to the list of tangible personal property for taxation. HB 1796 would have created the Virginia Decentralized Autonomous Organization Act to govern the legal framework for blockchain-based business structures.  

While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)Pennsylvania is in a race against time: can we bring enough new energy onto the grid to meet our region’s growing power demand (primarily fueled by new data centers, both speculative and real) in time to avoid dramatic spikes in the cost of energy paralleling the destabilization of our energy grid?
While solar power has emerged as the cheapest new electricity source in history, thousands of new energy projects are trapped, waiting for approval to come online as part of grid manager PJM’s bottlenecked interconnection process. This costly administrative limbo can delay construction for over five years or even cause developers to abandon projects entirely after significant investment.
This delay in bringing new energy online is already making it more expensive for Pennsylvanians to keep the lights on, and it could get much worse: a new report by Evergreen Collaborative and Synapse Economics finds that “Mismanagement by PJM is set to spike electric bills by almost 60 percent over the next 10 to 15 years.” Unless something changes, the results for Pennsylvania families and businesses will be catastrophic. And while PJM has initiated limited reforms, their full impacts remain unclear.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The problem is immense, but there’s also a clear workaround: Local energy generation like community solar can bypass this bottleneck while democratizing our energy transition and providing concrete benefits to Pennsylvanians.
Community solar lets ratepayers subscribe to a local solar array and receive guaranteed energy bill savings. It’s a shovel-ready, distributed approach to bringing new energy online. If you haven’t heard of community solar, don’t feel bad: it’s probably because Pennsylvania is one of a rapidly dwindling number of states that has yet to authorize it.
Community solar projects are generally much larger than a residential solar array, but small enough to connect to the local energy distribution system, letting them sidestep the PJM interconnection queue that so often traps large-scale projects. By bringing more energy online quickly, community solar can ease the intensity of our energy crisis.
Community solar projects also deliver immediate benefits to local communities:


They allow renters, apartment dwellers, and homeowners with unsuitable roofs to access affordable, locally generated energy


They create jobs and tax revenue in local communities


They strengthen grid resilience by bringing energy generation closer to home


They provide savings on electricity bills, especially critical for low-income families struggling with rising rates


Neighboring states like New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and New York have already opened the door to community solar, but Pennsylvania has failed to act.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This could change very soon: a bill to authorize Community Energy (which includes community solar) recently passed through the PA House, and is now awaiting action in the Senate. This legislation would guarantee that everyone who subscribes to community solar would see savings on their energy bills, while expanding renewable energy access to communities that have historically been excluded (such as renters and low-income communities). It is supported by diverse stakeholders ranging from The Pennsylvania Land and Liberty Coalition to Our Solar PA, a statewide coalition of dozens of groups working for a community-centric renewable energy future.
We can’t afford to wait for the problems with our regional energy system to solve themselves, or for PJM to reform in response to pressure from the Governor’s office, State Public Utility Commissions, and ratepayers advocates.
Community solar gives us a way to make progress now. It puts regular people—not just utilities and large corporations—at the center of our energy transition. This isn’t just a way to sidestep the interconnection backlog—it’s an inclusive approach to building our energy future together.It’s past time to authorize community energy projects across the state, and to clear the path for energy solutions that work for our communities.

(Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)PITTSBURG, Kan. — Amid a summer swelter last week, more than 80 people crowded into a trendy gastropub in downtown Pittsburg, Kansas, for cold drinks and hot talk.
The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.










They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that … all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party.


– Justin Mcelwain, Pittsburg, Kan., resident


Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
‘Not a bumper sticker bill’
The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

Nevada House Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”

In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
Democrats ‘fight back’
This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.

In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy.)Last week’s energy auction by multistate power grid operator PJM will cause monthly electric bills to go up $2 to $5 next summer — but that’s on top of other costs, for transmission, fuel and more, that one advocate calls “death by a thousand cuts.”
It’s also the latest evidence, say ratepayer advocates and policymakers, that policies of PJM, the grid operator in a 13-state region that includes Kentucky, are out of whack.
The latest of the “thousand cuts” is mostly the result of energy-guzzling data centers, David Lapp, the Maryland People’s Counsel, who is charged with representing state ratepayers in that state. Predictions for their proliferation are largely behind inflated projections of energy demand in PJM states, pushing demand past supply in the auction process, sending the price skyward.
And ultimately, consumers pay the price.
“It’s fundamentally unfair,” Lapp said. “Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?”
At the same time, consumer advocates say PJM policies have restricted supply, with a backlogged queue for energy projects, many of them renewable energy proposals.
“Until there’s actual queue reform, there’s not going to be real relief,” said Emily Scarr, a senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, or Public Interest Research Group.
All eyes were on this year’s auction because last year’s was a blockbuster: The clearing price jumped 800% compared to the 2023 auction, setting a record for the most expensive such auction in PJM history.
This year’s auction surpassed that record, but it was offset by policies that consumer advocates — and some governors — pushed PJM to adopt.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) was behind a new cap on the auction’s clearing price. The auction hit the cap, saving consumers about $2.9 billion in total costs on their bills.
As various parts of energy bills increase, grid decision-makers don’t seem to be asking a key question, says Laurel Peltier, a low-income ratepayer advocate for the AARP: “Can people afford this?”
During a news conference Tuesday, Stu Bresler, a PJM executive vice president of market services and strategy, said that auction costs are a “small part of retail bills, and it also varies” how auction costs translate into rate changes for consumers.
But Peltier said that ignores key context.
“That’s like being in a bakery, and you know that the flour got more expensive, the butter got more expensive, the labor got more expensive, and you’re the egg maker, and your eggs are 800% more, and you’re like, ‘It’s OK. It’s just a little part,’” Peltier said.
Changes inside PJM?
In a July 16 letter to PJM, a bipartisan group of nine governors in PJM’s 13-state territory — including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear — said the moment presents an opportunity for change.
With the “abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” their replacements must “understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs,” and create “a more collaborative and more effective ethos” at PJM, the governors wrote.
“In the past, other regions looked to join PJM due to its many strengths; today, across the region, discussions of leaving PJM are becoming increasingly common,” read their letter.
In a July 18 response, PJM Board of Managers Chairman David Mills pushed back.
“Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” he wrote. “We also continue the necessary function of operating regional markets as well as planning for a grid that is seeing an explosion of demand growth at the same time that state and federal policies have pushed a meaningful amount of generation capacity into retirement.”
He listed a number of changes PJM has made to its auction “to address concerns raised by our states,” including the “temporary” cap.
In a statement announcing the auction results Tuesday, PJM wrote that it “continues to focus on enhancing its process for connecting new generation resources onto the system, which includes clearing all the projects in its transition queue over the next 18 months, opening its new cycle process in spring 2026, and leveraging artificial intelligence through our partnership with Google to reduce processing time.”
Regime change may help, but some advocates warn that more transformative change may be necessary to lower prices. That includes changing how the organization is governed, Lapp said.
“We and the 13 other state consumer advocate offices in PJM — we get one vote. There are transmission-owning utilities that have more votes than us together,” Lapp said. “It’s the transmission owners that wield the most influence at PJM.”
Those same companies generally lose out when more power generation comes online, Scarr said.
“The legacy power plants lose out when that happens — but they’re the ones managing the ship,” Scarr said.
A spokesman for PJM pointed to a fact sheet describing the grid operator’s governance structure, which highlights that PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers must not be financially tied to any PJM member. But on the member’s committee, which includes about 1,000 members, votes are divided between five industry sectors. State consumer advocates are the other voting members.
Data center projections
When he hears projection for data center demand Lapp said he worries they are overblown because technology could be advancing to increase power efficiency at the facilities, which are full of computer servers that require immense amounts of energy to run and to keep from overheating.
That’s a major reason why data centers themselves should be footing the bill for their own power demand, and the upgrades to the power system they may require, Lapp said.
“If the data centers aren’t responsible for paying for all the costs that they are driving, they have much less incentive to find more computer chips, to operate more efficiently, to reduce their own costs,” he said.
It’s PJM’s job to change the paradigm, wherein ratepayers pay for enhancing the electric system, he said.
“It’s an unprecedented period of time in the industry, when you have city-sized demand being built up in just a few years,” Lapp said. “You can’t treat that the same as load growth gradually occurring over time.”

Last year’s auction to ensure the grid operator serving Ohio could meet demand saw capacity prices shoot up more than 830%. In the most recent auction, prices rose even higher.
When the 830% increase came down last year after an auction held by electric grid operator PJM Interconnection, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro sued.
As part of the settlement, PJM agreed to cap the price for the auction that concluded last week. Regardless, the capacity auction price rose even higher, hitting the cap laid out ahead of time by regulators.
Power producers will get paid $329.17 per megawatt/day. That’s up from roughly $270 per megawatt/day in the previous auction.
“These prices are reflecting the fact that the resource adequacy crisis is real in PJM,” Jon Gordon, director of Advanced Energy United explained.

At bottom, the auction is meant to match supply and demand. Higher auction prices serve as a price signal to encourage more power generation, but PJM has a massive backlog of power plants waiting to connect to the grid. That interconnection queue has been closed to new projects since 2022.
“It’s pretty hard to bring new generation resources online when the process for doing so is closed for new generation,” Gordon explained.
Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

Last year’s auction price only began showing up on consumers’ energy bills this June. The latest auction prices take effect next year. That means Ohioans, and most energy consumers across PJM’s 13-state footprint, aren’t likely to see energy prices come down anytime soon.
Johns Hopkins University Research Scholar Abe Silverman explained, “We have less generation on the grid today than we need given all the load growth, and so whether the price impacts are affecting you today or tomorrow, they’re definitely coming, because we are just sort of entering this very, very tight market.”
PJM itself says the new capacity auction prices could push some consumers’ bills another 1.5% to 5% higher when they take effect next year. Although it also claims “it is possible that consumers in some areas could see a drop in retail rates.”
How does the capacity auction work? Or not work?
To make sure PJM has adequate power when demand peaks, it holds a regular auction where producers commit a given amount of power. PJM compares it to a mall parking lot — they’re doing the energy equivalent of making sure there’s enough space come Black Friday.
With the most recent auction landing at $329 per megawatt/day, a hypothetical 1-megawatt power plant would get a little more than $120,000 ($329 x 365 days). If the plant can’t meet its commitment, PJM imposes fines.
Importantly, the capacity pricing isn’t for the energy itself, it’s a kind of insurance policy to make sure the grid has plenty of power. Silverman said capacity costs make up about 20% of a typical consumer’s bill, and the overall price tag for the latest auction will come out to about $16 billion.
Like Gordon, Silverman said rising capacity prices are a product of delays in getting new plants up and running.
“It’s like the interconnection queue is the class of graduating seniors from college who are going to take the jobs as you know, some of us start to retire,” he explained.
For several years that wasn’t a problem as demand stayed flat.
“Then all of a sudden, the data center load growth started kicking in, and we found ourselves desperately needing that next generation of resources,” he said.
Ohioans’ electric bills could climb depending on regional grid auction

PJM acknowledged “electricity demand is growing rapidly,” and noted its forecast for the auction year put peak demand 5,400 megawatts higher, “driven largely by data center expansion, electrification and economic growth.”
Spokesman Jeff Shields added there are roughly 63,000 megawatts of additional power PJM expects to study and approve over the next year and a half.
At the same time, Shield contends a significant challenge in meeting demand falls outside PJM’s control.
Currently there are 46,000 megawatts-worth of PJM approved projects — the majority of them solar and wind — stymied by the nuts-and-bolts challenges of actually building power plants.
Many of those projects are waiting on permitting and siting decisions from federal, state or local governments.
Additionally, tariffs are raising the prices of raw materials, and surging demand has created bottlenecks for essential equipment like turbines.
What do we do?
To power companies, the next steps are obvious: build, build, build. For instance, Todd Snitchler, president and CEO for the Electric Power Supply Association has claimed in recent years that state and federal policy favoring renewable energy — or “political interference” — “led to the premature retirement of essential generation.”
“When allowed to function, competitive electricity markets are the most effective way to deliver affordable, reliable power,” he said. “But a reliable grid isn’t free. Resources must be fairly compensated to stay available when they’re needed most.”
Much of the power waiting to come online comes from renewable sources like wind and solar. Skeptics worry about shifting the balance toward sources that rely on inconsistent environmental factors.
Earlier this year, PJM got approval for a fast-track process, effectively allowing some gas, battery, and nuclear projects to jump to the front of the line.
Evergreen Action Deputy State Policy Director Julia Kortney said leaving clean energy in limbo is costing consumers.
“PJM has failed to incorporate clean energy into the grid while its fossil fuel, utility, and transmission members are making record profits off the lack of competition and customers pay more for less,” she said.
The Natural Resources Defense Council has said part of the explanation for rising capacity costs is PJM better accounting for the unreliability of gas-fired plants.
Defense council Senior Advocate for Climate and Energy Tom Rutigliano nodded to the state siting and permitting hurdles PJM referenced that are keeping previously approved projects sidelined.
“Bringing just a fraction of these projects into service will ensure more affordable and reliable electricity,” he said.
While much of the marketplace is focused on increasing supply, Environmental Law & Policy Center Managing Attorney Rob Kelter said states need to work harder on reducing demand.
“These results underscore the urgent need for Ohio to invest in energy efficiency and demand response — proven, cost-effective tools that can quickly reduce demand, ease pressure on the grid, and lower costs for all utility customers across the state,” he said.
Demand response programs allow large consumers to cut deals with power companies agreeing to power down if demand peaks in return for a lower energy bill.
“With these continued price increases,” Kelter added, “the (Public Utility Commission of Ohio) has to do more to help Ohioans use less.”

The Department of Public Safety houses emergency management, which leads the immediate response. Consumer Services flags price gouging scams. Agriculture officials survey damage to farms and crops, and Environmental Quality helps guide cleanup of debris and waterways.
A newly drafted bill puts forward a new system: an all-in-one disaster response agency, governed by bipartisan appointees.
That agency, outlined under a new version of House Bill 907 released Monday, would be called the North Carolina Commission for Preparedness and Recovery. Its exact proposed duties, and structure, could change as discussions about the bill continue.
  Rep. John Bell (R-Wayne) (Photo: NCGA video)
“This is a piece of legislation that will be worked on for many months to come,” said Rep. John Bell (R-Wayne).
As currently written, the commission would wide-ranging powers: coordinating disaster readiness, spearheading recovery and rebuilding, and handling the hundreds of millions of dollars in state and federal funds that flow into the state. In all, it would oversee homebuilding, flood resiliency and mitigation, landslide and floodplain mapping, flood insurance and more.
The commission would be governed by a group of 13 board members: seven appointed by the governor, and six total appointed by legislative leaders. The board would appoint an executive director, who could hire additional staff as needed.
Lawmakers’ proposed overhaul comes as North Carolina continues to rebuild from Hurricane Helene, the deadliest storm in state history — as well as finish building in the east years after Hurricanes Florence and Matthew.
And the plan could impact (and be impacted by) potential changes coming down from Washington, where President Trump has considered abolishing FEMA and handing responsibility for disaster response to the states.
Among the commission’s proposed first steps: adopting a “strategic plan” that addresses how the state will handle all stages of disaster response.
The bill would also create a new fund, overseen by State Treasurer Brad Briner’s office, for buyouts, gap funding, loans and grants and other disaster-related projects.
“It’s a way to look at and get input and work together,” Bell said of the bill, “as not just a House and Senate, but with the governor.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Chantal-flooding-SouthernPines-NCDOT.jpg,,,2025-07-29 05:56:12.951765

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderYou expect to see politicians working hard to earn donations, but some Republicans in Georgia are scrambling to give them back.

A growing list of politicians and groups who received money from the conservative lending firm First Liberty Building & Loan and its founder, Brant Frost IV, are sending donations back after Frost was implicated in a purported $140 million Ponzi scheme that feds say started around 2021 and scammed 300 investors.
A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint says Frost donated more than $570,000 of those investor funds to right-wing candidates and groups across multiple states, though the full number could end up being higher, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s office.
First Liberty targeted right-wing and Christian groups, and its now-defunct website touted efforts to fund food pantries, a crisis intervention program for middle school boys and other good works.
“At First Liberty Building & Loan, we believe that charitable giving is a fundamental part of our responsibility as authentic followers of Christ,” Frost said on First Liberty’s website. “By choosing us for your financial needs, you can rest assured that we prioritize giving back to our community. We support charities and organizations that align with our values, and we are committed to making a positive impact in the lives of those less fortunate among us.”
Instead, the SEC complaint alleges that Frost transferred more than $5 million of investor funds to himself and his family. The complaint alleges Frost took in investor money for short-term loans for worthy small businesses, but instead spent it on luxury items including a Maine vacation home, jewelry and a $20,000 watch.
“We call these affinity frauds, where you base it on a certain group, and this is very religious Christians and Republicans,” said Gregory Hays of Atlanta-based Hays Financial Consulting, who was appointed by a U.S. district court judge to receive the money from those returning the funds. “So most of all the victims are either in politics or very faith-based investors, and all of them that I talked to were influenced by the charitable giving and the feel-good side of the company.”
Frost allegedly painted a rosy picture of the loans’ performance to investors, but in reality the majority of the loans that were made went into default, and Frost was using money from new investors to make interest payments to previous investors.
Now, the investors are left holding the bag.
“It’s just devastating to them,” Hays said. “There’s a lot of retirement money. I talked to one gentleman this morning that put $300,000 in, and he said it was all his retirement money, the $300,000. So it’s having some devastating impact on a lot of people.”

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whose office is investigating First Liberty alongside the SEC, issued an earlier statement calling on recipients to return political contributions from the company or from members of the Frost family. Raffensperger told media outlets he personally returned about $8,400 after learning of the allegations.
As of Wednesday, Hays said recipients had returned about $60,000. By Monday afternoon, that number had increased to $130,000. The response has been intense enough for Hays to set up an automated response to emails warning that he may be slow to write back due to the heavy work load as he fields calls and emails from the investors and hundreds of politicians.
“There was a big hurry right after the secretary of state asked for all Georgia Republicans to return the money, and so we had calls from a lot of different politicians wanting to return the money, and that was before we even found a report of some of the donations,” he said. “We haven’t sent out demands to recover money yet from the politicians, it’s just people are searching their own records and returning money.”
Still, Hays said the process will take a long time to play out.
Frost issued a statement through his attorneys earlier this month taking “full responsibility” and asking that “everyone allow the receiver time to sort things out and do his best to repair the damage I created.”
Payback time
State and federal donation records for First Liberty, Frost and his immediate family members show donations to conservative candidates dating back to the early 2000s, with one in 1995, but stepping up around 2021, when the illegal activity is alleged to have begun.
Some of the recipients are well-known conservative firebrands on the national stage, like Colorado Congresswoman Lauren Boebert and former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, who each received $2,900 from First Liberty in the 2024 election cycle, according to campaign records.

One of the top beneficiaries of the First Liberty money was Alabama State Auditor Andrew Sorrell, who is running for Alabama Secretary of State. Frost gave Sorrell $71,000, and Sorrell’s PAC made a loan to First Liberty, according to reporting from the Alabama Reflector.
Members of the Frost family and First Liberty have donated more than $50,000 to the state Republican Party in Georgia since 2001 through numerous donations, some as small as $10. Georgia Republican Party Chair Josh McKoon said last week that the party had searched its records and returned $36,843.97, the amount they determined came in since the start of 2021.
“On behalf of our Party, I am profoundly saddened that members of our conservative movement, along with many others, were misled by false promises of safe investments. This has left countless Georgians facing uncertain futures and financial distress,” McKoon said.
Records show three donations from members of the Frost family to Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019, before the scheme was alleged to have begun, totaling $7,500. Kemp’s campaign said the governor sent $13,800 in donations to Hays’ office.
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, who is running for governor next year, received $1,000 from a Frost family member and is sending it to Hays, a campaign spokesperson said.
Several of Georgia’s sitting Republican members of Congress received donations, including Congressmen Brian Jack, Andrew Clyde and Rich McCormick, each of whom records show received thousands of dollars from First Liberty and the Frost family since 2021.
Congressman Barry Loudermilk’s most recent donation of $3,600 came in 2014, records show. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and Congressman Rick Allen received only $80 and $50 respectively from First Liberty in 2024.
A spokesperson for Jack’s office said in a statement he immediately returned two donations and emphasized that they made up a small portion of his support.
“Since announcing his campaign for Congress in March 2024, Congressman Jack has received 28,473 donations,” said spokeswoman Alex Stone. “Just 2 of those donations were from individuals who either identified First Liberty as their employer or are named in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s complaint charging First Liberty.”
Jack won his seat last year, replacing retired GOP Congressman Drew Ferguson in the west Georgia district, which includes Newnan where Frost resides.
First Liberty spent big in that race, also supporting at least two of the men who faced Jack in the GOP primary for that seat, records show, including more than $10,000 to former state Sen. Mike Crane and $7,500 in payments to businessman Jim Bennett.
McCormick’s office also confirmed he plans to return donations, which include $11,600 from First Liberty in 2024, according to FEC records.
Georgia Public Service Commission member Tim Echols, who is up for reelection this year, said he has returned two $1,000 donations to the receiver.
The Frosts also spent on lesser-known candidates, in some cases funding challenges to established incumbents.
State Rep. Jordan Ridley, a Woodstock Republican who is returning $3,000 he received in 2022, said the Frosts were fixtures at state Republican events.
“They were definitely big in fundraising for your more right leaning-candidates,” he said. “They were always a staple at the state party events, with tables and things like that. Definitely very active, very involved and very supportive financially.”
Ridley said he was referred to the Frost family by another member of the General Assembly as a potential fundraising source.
Campaign finance records show that other state lawmakers  who received First Liberty money include Woodstock Rep. Charlice Byrd, Buford Rep. David Clark, Locust Grove Rep. Noelle Kahaian, Columbus Rep. Carmen Rice, Trenton Sen. Colton Moore and Johns Creek Sen. Shawn Still.
Ridley said he’s talked with colleagues in the Legislature who received the donations and most will be ready to give back their donations without much persuasion.
“For anybody to run a Ponzi scheme or take somebody else’s money like that is just completely unacceptable, and I feel for the victims and I hope they get back as much as possible,” Ridley said.
Ridley said Frost may have been a prolific donator, but losing his money won’t hurt Republicans in 2026 or beyond.
“I don’t think they were that big of a donor statewide for that many people that it’s going to have that big of an impact,” he said. “For some candidates, sure, it may be a lot, but for me, I received a donation one time three years ago. For me, it’s not going to be an issue, and for a lot of my colleagues I know who have received money. They weren’t the only donor or a massive donor, they were just a piece of the pie.”

Their confusion deepens when he explains that he’s Indigenous and a member of the Aquinnah Wampanoag nation.
“Their surprise says as much about Martha’s Vineyard as it does about the way this country sees Indigenous people,” Lee writes in his new book, “Nothing More of This Land,” which was published last week. “Very few people ever say it, but I can always feel an unspoken ‘but I thought you were all dead’ in those moments.”
Throughout his book, Lee grapples with the question of what it means to be Indigenous. It’s a question intricately connected to climate change, Lee says, because it’s a question directly related to land. On Martha’s Vineyard, Lee’s community has long been saddled with the effects of colonization, which fuels both extreme gentrification and rising sea levels. Lee traces the history of his own tribal nation, reflects on being mixed race and living in diaspora, and envisions potential futures unencumbered by colonial constraints.
This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
Q. How would you describe the connection between Indigenous identity and climate change?
A. When you talk about Indigenous people, you have to talk about land. And right now, when you’re talking about land in any context, climate change is the looming backdrop. So many of the challenges Indigenous communities are facing may not be outwardly related to climate change, but they’re impacted by climate change. Fighting for water rights, which I would say is a sovereignty fight and a political fight, is made more difficult and the stakes are higher because of drought. Tensions around land ownership and what we do with our land are also made more complicated by climate impacts like rising sea levels and stronger storms that are eating away at our land. If you’re fighting over land and land you’re fighting over is shrinking because sea levels are rising, it makes that fight much more intense and much more urgent. You could look at salmon and the right to protect salmon and for subsistence lifestyles and all that’s becoming more complicated not just because of overfishing but because the way that salmon and other fish are impacted by warming waters and climate change. Any area of the story that you’re looking at, climate change is present.
Q. I also grew up on an island that is a tourism hub, and in so many communities that’s often perceived as the only viable economic driver. Can you talk about what it feels like to be Indigenous in a land that’s become a tourist destination, and how that affects our communities?
A. In this country, one part of the experience of being Indigenous is the experience of erasure and of being ignored. That’s throughout history, through culture, through politics, through all these spaces. But I think especially in a place like Martha’s Vineyard, it’s even more extreme because the reputation of the place is so big and so specific. Being Indigenous, people are really often not listening to you. The more your land becomes a tourist destination, the harder it is for Indigenous voices to be heard, the harder it is for Indigenous people to hold onto the land.
In a very concrete way, tourism typically drives property values up. It drives taxes up. And that makes it harder for folks to hold on to land that’s been in the family for generations. And that’s what’s happened in Martha’s Vineyard. Beyond that, I think tourism is just a really, really difficult and unfortunate choice that people have been kind of forced into. When so much opportunity has been taken away or denied from Indigenous communities in these places, tourism is often the only thing that’s left. So it can become like a choice between having nothing and contributing to tourism, which is probably ultimately harming the community and the land, but there’s no other way to make a living. So I think that’s just a really unfortunate reality.
Q. There’s a part in the book where you’re talking about how every time you say you’re from Martha’s Vineyard, people either assume you’re really rich or they think, “Oh, I didn’t realize that people live there.” What do you want people to know about your community and your tribe in particular, separate from the broader journey of this book? Is there anything that you wish people knew that this book could convey so that other tribal members don’t have to be on the receiving end of that question?
A. First, I hope that this will help to change the narrative of erasure that has existed about Wampanoag people for most of this country’s history. At the very least, I hope this helps people know that we exist — we’re here. And also, I like to think that it helps to show some of the complexity and diversity of my community: that we have disagreements, we have different perspectives, we have different talents, we live in different places.
Something else that your question made me think of was the question of audience. And I thought about that a lot. Even growing up within the tribe, there was so much just about my own community that I didn’t know. And so I try not to be judgmental of what people know, whether they’re Indigenous or not. And that’s how I really wanted to approach the book. I would hope that Indigenous and non-Indigenous readers can get something out of it, both in terms of learning things, but also hopefully seeing themselves in the pages and this exploration of figuring out who we are and where we want our community to go.
Q. Another part that really resonated with me and I think a lot of Indigenous readers will relate to is the struggle of what does it mean to be Indigenous if you aren’t living on your land. I was wondering what you hope Indigenous readers will take away from the book in terms of understanding what distance from their land can mean for their identity.
A. I hope that Indigenous readers will discover what I’ve discovered, which is that there are so many ways to engage with your homelands and your home community, even if you don’t live there. I used to think that I was only engaging if I was there with the tribe doing some cultural tribal event or something, and I realized that there are so many other ways of engaging. I don’t think any of us are less Indigenous because we live somewhere else.
For a long time I felt like if it wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t worth it. If it wasn’t the perfect ideal of me participating in the tribe, I thought I shouldn’t do it. Ultimately what that led to is I just wasn’t doing anything because I didn’t have as many opportunities to go to these tribal gatherings or participate in tribal politics. And so I just did nothing, and I felt the distance sort of growing over the years. What other people can do is realize that there are all these small ways to engage and to try to embrace those, and not let ideas of what it means to be Indigenous be defined by outsiders, or these big colonial structures like federal recognition, for example, or blood quantum.
Q. Why? What’s at stake? Why do you think it’s important for folks to embrace Indigenous identity and why is it important, particularly at this moment?
A. Circling back to what we talked about at the beginning, we’re not going to be able to address these huge existential crises like climate change if we can’t be at least in some way united as a community, as a people. If we’re always fighting over who belongs and what does it mean to be Indigenous and saying that people are less Indigenous because of XYZ, that takes away our ability to tackle those bigger challenges. Right now we’re facing these serious challenges and that’s what we should be dealing with, so figuring this out is the first step.

Kelly Ayotte said she had privately lobbied Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to lift the freeze. (Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)The Trump administration will release a series of grants to schools in New Hampshire and other states that it had abruptly withheld in June, ending weeks of uncertainty for schools across the country.
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Education announced it would release the final $5.5 billion of a $6.8 billion portion of funding designated for English language learner instruction, college and career counseling, STEM programs, and educator training. The department had held that $6.8 billion for weeks, pending a review. 
The administration had previously released $1.3 billion of the $6.8 billion, which will go to summer and after-school programs, on July 18.
Friday’s announcement means that $27 million in total assistance grants for New Hampshire schools is no longer in limbo.
The release came after pushback against the freeze from Democrats and some Republicans, which included a lawsuit filed by Democratic-led states. 
New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who did not publicly comment when the department instituted the freeze, hailed the reversal and claimed partial credit for it, saying she had privately lobbied Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to lift the freeze. 
“Today, Governor Kelly Ayotte secured the release of federal education funding for academic enrichment, English language learning, and other key programs for New Hampshire schools,” a statement from her office read Friday. 
“As I told Secretary McMahon in multiple meetings, this funding is critical to delivering a best-in-class education for every child in New Hampshire, and I thank her and the Trump Administration for responding to our concerns,” Ayotte said in a statement. “I will continue to advocate directly for the programs and services Granite Staters depend on.”
U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, a Democrat representing the state’s 2nd Congressional District, also claimed credit, pointing to her “weeks of advocacy” toward the Trump administration. 
The funding freeze began on June 30, when the Trump administration told state departments of education it would hold back money from multiple funding programs until federal officials could confirm that the funding was “spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”
Those programs included Title II-A, which helps pay for teacher professional development; Title III-A, which helps fund English language learning; Title IV-A, which pays for some STEM education and college and career counseling; and Title IV-B, which funds after-school and summer programs.
School administrators and Democrats blasted the freeze, which they said would deprive school districts of funds they had been relying on when they crafted and passed their budgets in spring. Superintendents in larger districts, such as Nashua, said the loss of funding could have required staff layoffs in the fall, especially in the English language learning program. 
On July 14, two weeks after the freeze, attorneys general in 24 states and the District of Columbia sued to require the Trump administration to release the funds. New Hampshire’s attorney general did not sign on to that lawsuit. 
In a statement Monday, the New Hampshire Department of Education welcomed the funds, but said the Trump administration’s review was necessary.
“This review ensures that the students of New Hampshire are supported in accordance with congressional objectives, which supports the goal of leading to bright futures for all children in the state,” the statement said. “Within the U.S. Department of Education’s notification to release the funding, it included important parameters to ensure the grants are distributed according to their intended purpose, and we look forward to working with the schools to maximize the grants for the students of New Hampshire.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ayottecolumn-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-29 05:56:12.951765

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
 Clawing back COVID-era grants

Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
 Smallpox, cholera and typhoid

Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
 A major cut in services

Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-29 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s solar industry clouded by Trump administration policies,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/29/ct-solar-big-beautiful-bill/,"By ending a tax credit, the bill could slam the brakes on renewable power. In CT, and all of New England, the brunt will be felt on solar.","On the sunny first day of the mid-July heatwave, Will Herchel and his team walked along the edge of a nearly 18-acre field in Glastonbury three-quarters filled with solar panels. Even though the day was already pushing 90 degrees by late morning, the panels couldn’t take advantage of all that sunshine – yet. 
That should happen in late September or early October when all 6,840 panels are in place and able to generate nearly four megawatts of power, estimated to be enough to run more than 775 average homes. The installation, being built by Verogy — the West Hartford-based company Herchel co-founded and now heads, will provide power to low- and moderate-income homes, as well as to small businesses and municipal buildings, through a concept known as a community solar or shared solar. Connecticut calls it shared clean energy facilities. 
Regardless of the name, the concept is designed to bring clean energy — almost always solar power — to anyone who cannot install a system on their own property. That generally mean renters, condo or apartment owners, and people whose homes simply aren’t suited to solar due to lack of sun or badly configured roof angles.

Community solar has had a balky rollout in Connecticut. It’s taken years for the state to find the right model with parameters and financial requirements that will have staying power.
But, just as it gains momentum here, that effort may be about to hit a major roadblock — the Trump administration.
The tax-and-spending reconciliation bill President Donald J. Trump signed into law on July 4 has the potential to slam the brakes on two of the biggest and fastest-growing sources of renewable power in the U.S. — solar and wind.
The legislation eliminates a valuable 30% federal tax credit for owners of and investors in solar and wind systems. For Connecticut and the rest of New England, the brunt of the pressure will be felt on solar.
“It’s difficult to understand why these technologies were singled out in that way, other than it’s just a more political driven decision,” Herchel said.
Up-front costs
Wind is still the top renewable power source in the U.S. — but solar’s increase the last few years has pushed combined wind and solar beyond 17% of U.S. electricity production, eclipsing coal. A recent U.S. Energy Information Administration report shows solar poised to surpass wind as the top renewable power source during the summer by next year.

Long term, both forms of power will remain much cheaper than conventional sources. For starters, the fuel for the power — wind or solar — is free. But there are fears many people — especially homeowners who want solar — will find themselves priced out because the removal of the tax credit means higher up-front costs and break-even times several years longer than they are now. 
The 30% tax credit for homeowners who purchase residential rooftop solar will disappear on December 31 of this year. There will be no gradual rollback, which is what Trump did his first term when he opted to scale back tax credits over several years. The rate was down to 26% when he left office. 
The Biden administration restored the rate to 30% retroactively with a 10-year lifespan, transitioning to a gradual rollback in 2033.
People who lease solar for their homes, and all forms of commercial solar and wind projects have a longer runway before tax credits expire. They must start construction by next July or be in service by the end of 2027 in order to get the tax credit. For large commercial projects that’s a tight time frame and on leased systems it is the company that owns the system that gets the tax credit, not the homeowner. But homeowners will still face the owner’s higher costs being passed on to them.
Since the budget bill became law, additional policies have been unveiled that have solar developers like Herchel even more worried.
Three days after he signed the measure, Trump issued an executive order that appears likely to further tighten the parameters of access to solar and wind even while the tax credit is still operative. 
The executive order seems designed to restore some provisions of earlier iterations of the bill. Those provisions were more restrictive and were jettisoned to ensure the bill would pass. One part of the order essentially asks the Treasury Department to re-evaluate what it means for a project to be in construction. The goal seems to be to redefine it in a way that would make it harder for projects to meet the timing to qualify for tax credits.
“I think the industry was in a position of relief that they understood what the path forward was,” Herchel said of the original legislation that removed the 30% tax credit. 
His company only does medium size commercial and industrial sector solar and has the slightly longer runway before the tax credit disappears.
“The executive order threw a wrench in that whole process,” he went on. The order gave the U.S. Department of the Treasury 45 days to take action, so companies are stuck waiting. “You don’t know how to start construction, and because of that, everyone is concerned and confused as to which projects are going to qualify and which projects are not going to qualify.”
The uncertainty of how, when or even if to start construction is keeping Herchel and his investors up at night.
“The tough part for us is that, in our industry, the longest part of our installation cycle is permitting and interconnection. We don’t control those aspects,” Herchel said. The Glastonbury project, for example, will take three years from concept to operation, with actual construction only accounting for about seven months.
The uncertainty around the meaning “in construction” could mean that contracted projects already in the production process could be thrown into tax credit limbo. “Those projects essentially become non-viable until you understand whether they’re going to qualify,” Herchel said.
“We don’t know exactly what the rules are, and so when you don’t know what the rules are, you can’t appropriately navigate your business and you can’t appropriately invest capital in those businesses,” he said. “We’re all working very hard and diligently with third party counsel and other advisors, accounting firms, to try to understand what’s actually going to happen. But most of their experience is no longer relevant because no individual executive administrative body has behaved in the way that we’re currently experiencing.”
Proactively, Verogy last week asked Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, PURA, to take emergency action help ensure as many solar projects as possible can beat the new tax credit clock.

Verogy’s community solar installation is scheduled to be operational early this fall and should receive a 30% federal tax credit. But beginning a year from now, projects like it will not and there is some uncertainty about whether similar projects could lose that tax credit advantage even sooner, causing them to become more expensive.

Jeff Macel, co-founder and managing director of Lodestar Energy, which focuses exclusively on community solar in about eight states, including Connecticut, said he isn’t sleeping terribly well either. He points out the executive order literally contradicts what’s now in statute.
“The legal advice we get is that that can’t happen, but the practical advice is, ‘how are you going to work through that? Is that going to get litigated?’” he said. “So it’s going to be a dog fight, I think, legally.”
He called Trump’s new clean energy policies “100% politically motivated.”
“It’s a difficult time to do business because norms have been thrown out the window and it’s hard to understand what is the status quo,” he said. “I think we take a conservative position and trust lawyers who tell us this is what it says, stick to your guns. And I think you have to.”
Other solar companies and their advocates take great pains to paint the situation in the best light they can, wanting to project that their industry is still valuable and affordable, even at a higher cost. And they note the many policy changes the solar industry has navigated over the years.
“They don’t call it the solar coaster for nothing in this industry,” said Mike Trahan, executive director of the Connecticut Solar and Storage Association, which represents the 50 to 75 solar companies actively operating in the state at any given time and their 2,500 employees. He characterized solar developers and installers as a resilient bunch, used to dealing with disruption.
“It’s an uncomfortable place to be,” he admitted, also referencing the recent policy controversies in the Connecticut legislature. “We’re going to have to do what we did the last time the Trump administration was pursuing changes with the tax credits. You have to find a place where you can be successful. If they’re just going to continue to raise the bar for us, we just have to jump higher.”
“Actively hostile”
Some fear Trump administration actions herald existential threats to clean energy more broadly by encouraging a greater reliance on the fossil fuels whose emissions have caused the climate change the planet is already experiencing.
And, on the most basic level, there’s widespread sentiment that the Trump policies will cause energy prices to go up, emissions to go up and air to be dirtier. States, including Connecticut, will be hard-pressed to meet their renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions targets as a result.
Trump has a long history as a notorious hater of wind power, with solar power not far behind. He reiterated that during his recent trip to Scotland. 
During the 2024 presidential campaign, he infamously told a group of fossil fuel industry executives gathered at Mar-a-Lago that if they donated $1 billion to his campaign he would cut their taxes and regulatory hurdles in return.  Though he did not get that much money from them, he has indeed introduced multiple policies and executive orders to increase fossil fuel extraction and use. even as most other nations look to switch away from such reliance to greater use of renewables.
Another part of the July 7 executive order would impose stricter rules on products from “foreign entities of concern.” While many components for solar have ties to China — something that has helped to dramatically reduce the cost of systems in recent years — solar panels made in the U.S. are more readily available than they had been, largely due to Biden administration policies that incentivized solar panel manufacturing here.
“At some point our industry does need to stand on its own two legs,” said Sam Schneider, co-founder and chief executive officer of Earthlight Solar and Energy Solutions, which is based in Ellington.
He traveled to Washington, D.C. twice to lobby for better terms in the original legislation. “I can’t say that I’m just jumping for joy, but I will say that it’s much better than where we were, and it gives us runway, and it gives us time.”
In some cases anyway.
Earthlight’s residential solar work is about half of their solar business. About 70% of that is purchased systems, which means the tax credit runs out in less than six months, though Schneider said he still has the capacity to complete projects by then. The rest of the residential solar, which is leased systems, as well as all his commercial work, do have the longer time frame.
“I believe that people are still going to pursue ownership of solar in residential; I one hundred percent believe that,” Schneider said. “It’s not ideal, but it is doable.”

Solar systems like this one on a condo project in Mystic by Earthlight Technologies will lose a federal tax credit that made them less expensive. The heat pumps also on the roof will lose their tax credit as well. Both actions were part of the tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4. Credit: Earthlight Technologies
But he faces other tax credit deadlines for related work his company does. The law also ends federal tax credits at the end of this year for a host of energy-saving functions, including the purchase of heat pumps, home and business energy efficiency upgrades, and energy audits. Tax credits for energy efficiency measures in new construction end in June 2026.
Those cutbacks essentially eliminate most other means home and business owners have to reduce their energy bills at a lower upfront cost. It may prove especially troublesome for the low- and moderate-income sector, which often turns to those solutions.
In Connecticut that sector also faces the solar tax credit deadlines in a program specifically designed for them. For 10 years, PosiGen has provided leased solar systems to qualifying low- and moderate-income Connecticut residents — more than 7,000 systems so far.
“This bill is going to have really dramatic consequences for the most vulnerable across Connecticut, generally,” said Kyle Wallace, PosiGen’s vice president of public policy and government affairs and leader of the company’s community impact team.
Leased systems do benefit from the longer deadline, but after that, the increased price likely will be passed along to consumers, Wallace said.
“I think even beyond this, we’re just continuing to see an administration that is just actively hostile to renewables, and we had hoped that they would be more indifferent and not actively hostile,” he said. “They’re going to try every way they can though to hurt renewables.”
Ten days after the July 7 executive order, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced solar and wind projects on federal property would now require personal approval from Secretary Doug Burgum across 69 categories of permitting.
The move is widely seen as a way to slow down approvals, possibly causing them to miss the new deadlines. Its most direct impact on Connecticut and New England would be on offshore wind projects, which are in federal lease areas. But it could have a bearing on federal approvals needed for projects that are not on federal property.
It all worries Harry Godfrey, a managing director at Advanced Energy United who heads up the advocacy group’s federal engagement efforts. He and others note that there is existing statutory language on what constitutes a project being in construction. The Treasury Department could come up with a conflicting standard. 
But the notion of predicating a tax credit on an in-service date for a project is new. Projects face unforeseen delays for all kinds of legitimate reasons. The fear is that such a regulation will open the door to governmental mischief designed to deliberately slow down projects to make them less economically worthwhile and therefore more likely to be killed.
“You kill projects in the present through uncertainty in the future and a ‘placed-in-service’ deadline, like that is the thing that cuts the knees out from under projects,” Godfrey said. “That’s made all the worse if those parties are operating in bad faith — intentionally working to kill a project through delay. Between the executive order and recent actions by the Interior Department, that possibility is coming into more acute focus.”
Stability
Trump and Republican operatives, especially those who developed the energy and climate chapters of Project 2025, have long decried solar and wind power as expensive and destabilizing for the electric grid because they cannot operate fully all the time. Solar, for instance, cannot provide power at night. Storage will eventually change that dynamic.
But even without storage, solar has actually become a key stabilizing factor for the six-state New England grid. Matt Kakley, a spokesman for grid operator ISO New England, said there’s thousands of megawatts of solar in New England equal to about twice the region’s nuclear fleet.
To meet consumer demand, he said, solar is playing an increasingly important role.
“We really count on it every day,” Kakley said. “When we are putting together our daily forecast in our schedule we’re looking at what we expect that solar to do, and we’re counting on it showing up.”

In winter, when heat and electricity compete for the same natural gas supply, solar during the day helps stretch daytime heating supplies. On hot summer days, solar has prevented power crunches when air conditioning use is high. 
The ISO recently reported that the kind of solar that might be on a residential roof —called behind-the-meter solar — reduced power consumption by 5% in 2024. 
During a recent heat wave when power use peaked on June 24 to its highest level in a dozen years and some power plants were unavailable, solar was one factor that helped stabilize the situation. The ISO noted at the time that without behind-the-meter solar, demand would have peaked three hours earlier and more than 2,000 megawatts higher than it did. It also noted that at that time, non-carbon-emitting resources including all solar, wind, nuclear, hydro and battery storage together provided a up to 40% of the energy consumed in the region.
The ISO is predicting demand on the grid will start to rise — 35% over the next 20 years — after years of staying relatively flat and even declining. Whether solar deployment will grow with demand and continue to take the edge off it in the face of the changes that are coming remains to be seen.

There are a few large New England offshore wind projects under construction that will provide large swaths of power in another few years as long as the administration doesn’t stop them. And a large project for transmission of onshore wind from Maine to the rest of the region is in an early planning stage.
But now it’s possible the end of tax credits for heat pumps and electric vehicles may dampen demand. Data center growth, a big energy eater that has caused concern in other parts of the country, has not been a factor in this region.
There’s also a question of whether the solar industry here will contract.
Ken Gillingham, an energy and environmental economist at Yale specializing in renewable energy and efficiency, thinks the residential, small-scale solar industry in Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts will shrink.
“I don’t think it’s going to disappear, but it’s likely that some of the smaller, weaker players are not going to be able to make it, and that means job losses,” he said. “We have this combination of losing the tax credits and higher costs, and you put those together, and suddenly solar is less affordable. A worst case scenario — it’s going to become a very, very small market, almost back down to a niche market like it was 20 years ago.”
Despite Trump’s contention to the contrary which he reiterated again in the July 7 executive order, solar power — grid-scale solar in particular — is one of the least expensive energy sources. A United Nations report unveiled by Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week showed onshore wind, solar and hydropower to be the three least expensive sources of power. Solar is 41% cheaper than fossil fuels and onshore wind is 59% cheaper. Both, the report said, are also the fastest to build.
In 2024, the report said, renewables made up 92.5% of all new electricity capacity additions. And it predicted that solar and wind power generation would surpass nuclear power next year and, “In 2029, solar PV electricity generation is expected to surpass hydropower to become the largest single renewable power source, and wind will surpass hydropower in 2030.”
Stepping up
The mantra has been that the states need to step up to fill the void left by Trump administration policies — something they did in the energy and environment sectors during Trump’s first term pullbacks. With so many voids to fill this time around, it’s unclear how that might play out.
In the meantime, the emergency filing Verogy’s Herchel made with PURA asks that the annual cap on community solar and non-residential solar projects be lifted to allow more projects to capture the tax credit before it expires.
“If PURA does not take this action, the likelihood that projects participating in the program will be eligible for the federal tax credits will significantly deteriorate,” Herchel said. “If participating projects cannot avail themselves of the federal tax credits, then the cost of energy required for these projects will dramatically increase. This premium would create a completely unnecessary cost for Connecticut ratepayers.”
PURA did not respond to a request for comment.
He and others have pointed to what Massachusetts put into motion even before the Trump plan had fully passed Congress. On June 20, that state updated its solar energy incentive program — SMART — via emergency regulation to expedite their process for approving projects.  Noting that the Clean Energy Buyers Association estimates household electricity costs will increase 6% as a result of the reconciliation package, Massachusetts Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper said: “President Trump and Congressional Republicans are taking us backward.”
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is opting for a more measured approach, with official outreach to developers and other energy stakeholders this month to review new state and federal laws and to gauge their specific challenges. The point, said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, is “so we can make sure that the steps that the state takes are targeted and effective, especially given the very short time that we’re working in.”
Dykes said DEEP is considering whether to initiate an expedited zero-carbon renewable solicitation for grid scale resources that could qualify for the tax credit if companies can move fast enough.
“We’re making sure that we’re engaging with the developers so that we’re not doing it in a vacuum, and that the steps that we are taking are aligned with what they need,” she said. To that end, DEEP issued a request for information last week to gauge developer interest with a speedy one-week turnaround.
Solar companies and advocates suggest that in the immediate term, the state find ways to speed up permitting and streamline other processes to get as much solar in the pipeline before timing restraints kick in. PURA is already looking at how to update the existing solar programs in Connecticut. A PURA spokesperson said that the federal changes could be part of what they consider.
Trahan, of the Solar and Storage Association, said the situation will require the legislature to step up, in addition to PURA, and reconsider both the restrictions the state has placed on solar over the years and the costs they’re willing to assume for things like labor and grid interconnections. 
“The question is going to be, how badly do we want to have a solar industry here?” he said. “If we want one, we’re going to have to make some significant changes in the cost to develop solar.”
Dykes agreed money will be an issue – just as the state is trying to lower energy costs. “There’s going to be some tough questions ahead about how much of the federal tax credit revenue could be offset or made up by higher levels of funding from complementary state programs. That’s a difficult trade off,” she said. “Those will be important things to try to balance.”
Wallace at PosiGen said it would be more important than ever for states and solar businesses to make changes, both short- and long-term, as they face pressures from tariffs, problematic supply chains and high interest rates, in addition to the blow of losing the tax credit so rapidly. Even before the tax credit for his lease customers ends, they might find they are saving only 10% or 15% with their system instead of the usual 20%. 
“We need to use the time we have now to find ways to lower costs, to be more efficient, to be able to better serve low-income communities,” he said. “We essentially need to increase the value that’s going to consumers now so that when the tax credit goes away and maybe prices have to increase, there’s enough of a buffer where it’s still a really compelling product.”
At Lodestar, Jeff Macel is already gaming out future plans through the lens of the company’s development pipeline, projects, and their drop-dead date of December 31, 2027.
“We’ve said, ‘okay, let’s work backwards from those dates. What projects can be built by then? We need to make sure we procure labor. We need to make sure we procure equipment. We need to make sure that we have utilities signed up to place them in service,’” he said. “So we’ve started that process internally to rank order our projects and say we can get these built by the date. And those are the sacred projects. Those are the ones we are focused on driving to the finish line.”
So far, companies that specialize in residential purchased systems, which face a much earlier loss of the tax credit, do not seem inclined to pivot to leased systems, which have the longer runway, though statewide data from PURA shows that shift has been happening on its own over the last few years.
“The amount of red tape involved with some of the stuff is cumbersome. So if I can do it without doing that, that would be my primary way to move forward,” said James LaPorta, owner of Litchfield Hills Solar, which only provides purchased systems and is booked through the end of the year. “My bigger concern is how it’s going to affect the whole industry.”
At Earthlight, Schneider said he doesn’t plan to shift the focus of his residential work, which has been mostly purchased systems. “I’m not looking for a doom and gloom here.

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

(Photo courtesy of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.)In the middle of a national firestorm, the top executive of a venerable Ohio hospital last Thursday told employees that “misinformation and lack of context can spread quickly, making it easy to jump to conclusions without all the facts.”
However, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital President and CEO Steve Davis didn’t provide any facts about the firings of two chaplains who spoke out in support of a former colleague whom the Trump administration is trying to deport. 
Instead, he urged employees “to trust that our leaders and your colleagues are making decisions with the best interests of our patients, families and each other in mind,” according to a note to the staff obtained by the Capital Journal. 
Children’s Hospital’s public affairs office was sent a copy of the note, which was posted late Thursday afternoon, but it didn’t respond to questions about it.
In addition to telling employees to trust him, Davis, the $2.5 million-a-year CEO, reminded his underlings of hospital policies regarding advocacy and media relations, according to the note. 
Davis was addressing the controversy around Ayman Soliman, a man who served as a Muslim chaplain at Children’s after fleeing his native Egypt in 2014 and receiving asylum in the United States in 2018. 
Soliman was arrested, beaten, and tortured in Egypt because of his work as a journalist during the Arab Spring.
ICE continues to hold Ohio cleric. His defenders say the government’s claims are bogus

Soliman’s asylum was revoked on June 3 and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him on July 9. He’s been in the Butler County Jail ever since. A federal judge issued an order preventing ICE from removing Soliman from Ohio at least through July 30.
Soliman’s lawyers say the administration has used a bogus, shifting set of claims to try to deport Soliman. Many have rallied to his support.
On July 17, there was a vigil for Soliman in Cincinnati. About 100 protesters left it to march in the travel lanes across the John A. Roebling Bridge to Covington, Ky., impeding traffic. Covington police arrested 15 — in some cases acting violently even though the protesters appeared to be peaceful.
Among those arrested were a reporter and photographer for CityBeat. Felony charges against them were later dropped, but misdemeanors remain pending.
In the aftermath, Cincinnati Children’s fired Adam Allen, one of its chaplains, merely for attending the vigil, Allen told WCPO TV. He said he tried to comply with what he thought was hospital policy.
“There was an HR meeting with our department to discuss media policies,” Allen told the station. “I understood from that meeting that I shouldn’t be a speaker. I could be misrepresented in the media as being a representative of the hospital. So I wore a shirt to the event that said, ‘I do not represent Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.'”
The hospital also fired chaplain Lizzy Diop, who had given media interviews in support of Soliman. 
Children with serious medical conditions — both chronic and acute — have long been treated at Children’s. And chaplains have played an important role comforting traumatized kids and their parents, a story published Wednesday in Rolling Stone said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Soliman was valuable to the hospital because of his generous demeanor, his ability to speak Arabic, and his training in Muslim theology, the story said.
Despite the seeming importance of chaplains to hospital care, Children’s is down three in a short span. The losses are all due to the same controversy — which stems from the priority President Donald Trump has placed on mass deportations.
In his note to the staff, Davis, the Children’s CEO, didn’t directly mention that controversy.
“As our country continues to experience changes and challenges, Cincinnati Children’s is not immune to the scrutiny that arises when polarizing topics and events occur,” the note said. “In fact, our reputation as a national leader in pediatric health brings a high level of attention and assumed expectations from our supporters, colleagues and the general public.”
Davis added, “Please know the absence of a public response should not be mistaken for a lack of caring or action.”
Children’s didn’t respond when asked whether the hospital feared retaliation from the Trump administration if employees speak out against Trump’s actions. Trump has engaged in high-profile battles in which he tried to defund elite universities over issues relating to free speech. 
In the note to employees, Davis referenced rules from the hospital for employees about their own speech.
“While there may be divisiveness outside of our walls, we expect all employees to live our values and follow our policies, every day and in every interaction,” he wrote. “I encourage you to review our Code of Conduct, as well as policies related to Advocacy, Media Relations, Social Media and Solicitation.”

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.
The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)  A major cut to funding to the Appalachian Regional Commission was stopped by a congressional committee after supporters of the commission’s work, which includes areas of Ohio, expressed their outrage at the potential reductions.
President Donald Trump’s discretionary budget proposal had included a 93% cut for the commission, which provides grant funding and program assistance to areas in the Appalachian region. That region includes 32 counties in Ohio, from Clermont County to Ashtabula County, with several counties considered by the commission to be economically distressed, and 15 others to be at risk of economic distress.
In Ohio, projects related to improving broadband, water quality and wastewater systems were part of $12.5 million in investments in fiscal year 2024, as part of a partnership between the commission and the Ohio Governor’s Office of Appalachia.
Trump requests 93% cut to Appalachian Regional Commission. Ohio would take a huge hit.

The original cut proposed by Trump would have taken the commission down from $200 million in funding to $14 million. A July 17 report by the House Appropriations Committee for energy and water development funding recommended $150 million for the Appalachian commission instead. After discussions, the final markup approved by the appropriations committee included the full $200 million restored to the commission budget.
“Despite significant and unprecedented new challenges from the downturn of the coal mining industry, the substance use crisis and numerous natural disasters, Appalachian is the home of tremendous energy for innovation and the deep community commitments to put new projects in motion,” said Dana Kuhnline, program director for advocacy group Reimagine Appalachia, in a statement after the vote.
The appropriations, among other discretionary funds, now move to the full U.S. House for a vote, and then the Senate for consideration, where Kuhnline said they will look to the chamber to “preserve programs like the ARC … so that the potential of the region isn’t flatlined at this critical moment.”

Twenty years ago, investigative reporter Barry Levine started covering a wealthy socialite named Jeffrey Epstein. Five years ago, after he was convicted of sex crimes and died in jail, Levine published an acclaimed book on Epstein.
And last week, as the controversy surrounding mountains of FBI data and evidence about Epstein slowly consumed the government and threatened the Trump presidency, Levine penned a powerful essay in the New York Times detailing the questions to which Americans deserve answers.
His central message – quote “With the exception of redactions required to protect the innocent and materials that must be withheld while under court seal, the complete F.B.I. files should be released.”
And amazingly in these divided times, most North Carolina Democrats and Republicans agree. As Senator Thom Tillis put it succinctly, “release the damn files.”
The bottom line: President Trump, as well as many other prominent people were close to Epstein and for the good of the country, Americans deserve to know the full truth about whether any of them were involved in his criminality.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Millions of individuals in America live with a chronic illness. Many can’t get the access to the health care they need just to live. Add to this housing insecurity, food insecurity and lack of family support, and people feel trapped and vulnerable.
I live with a chronic illness. I take daily medication for it, and every two weeks I drive my car to a nearby clinic to receive an injection in my arm. I must admit it sometimes hurts a bit, but my brain could not live without it. I have been living with this illness since I was 18 in 1993. I have been taking medication since 1993. I had just graduated from high school, and then I was diagnosed.
I have to admit, I take the good and the bad. Thankfully, my faith is important to me, and I pray a lot. I often feel alone in my battles. Prayer helps me feel less alone. Sometimes I take long drives in my little car and I listen to soft, encouraging music. I feel like the singers are singing right to me. Somehow, they understand my pain.
I have been hospitalized many times, but thankfully my last hospitalization was in February of 2007. I have fought valiantly since then to remain out of the hospital. Don’t get me wrong, going to the hospital when one is ill is not something to be ashamed of. If one needs help, I say go get it.
For one whole day years ago, my mom, dad, sister and I took a family educational workshop on my illness. The workshop was done by Valeo Behavioral Health Care in Topeka, and they even gave each of us a special notebook with all kinds of helpful information. My dad learned a lot, and the day really helped our relationship.
Living with a chronic illness is not for the faint of heart. Sometimes I still struggle with acute anxiety and paranoia, and I text my sister for reality checks. I want to live my life right. I want to say the right things to people. I struggle with anxiety in this dark world, but my faith and family and Shot Queen — as I call the nurse extraordinaire who administers my bimonthly injection — give me hope.
We all need hope these days. There is hope.
Each person is unique in the way they search for and find glimmers of hope. However, lack of health care or access to good health insurance can be a huge barrier in receiving nurturing, comforting care. A lot of folks don’t understand what a prior authorization is, but it’s when a health insurance company has to approve a medication or procedure. So many people have denials with their prior authorizations. It’s a real crisis. I have a friend who works at Valeo who works on prior authorizations, along with scheduling appointments. She works so hard to get people what they need medically.
Many people also lack of housing or transportation, which adds to the stress of their illness they battle each and every day. They may be homeless, and they may also experience a drug addiction or substance abuse disorder. This can be disabling as well. Places like Valeo, Breakthrough House and the Topeka Rescue Mission try to reach people where they are in their addiction journey and their co-occurring mental illness and offer support and care. People like Robert Sanders who works at the Topeka Rescue Mission truly help people who come there for hope and healing.
Family support is vital. However, too many individuals experiencing a chronic illness don’t have that support. My mom helps me in many, many ways. My younger sister, Laura, and her husband Don invite me to their beautiful home in Tucson, Arizona, and it’s a true blessing to be with family in a lovely setting. It takes my mind off my illness.
The bottom line is people need help with their journeys, their situations and their efforts to care for themselves. We need to reach out and help those in need. We need to offer hope. It may be all we have to give.

(Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)Ohioans whose livelihoods are inextricably linked to the automotive industry are in for a bumpy ride. 
The Big Three automakers, who employ 86,000 workers in vehicle and parts manufacturing in the state, along with Honda’s strong presence, are grappling with escalating costs and tumbling profits as Trump tariffs take effect. 
Cumulative tariff costs for U.S. automakers are pegged at nearly $4-5 billion this year, according to a recent study, roughly $5,000 per vehicle in parts. 
Last week, General Motors and Stellantis, formerly Chrysler, announced bad news about their bottom lines.
GM said Trump’s tariffs on its biggest trading partners cost the company more than $1 billion in the second quarter of 2025. Stellantis expects a $2.7 billion loss in the first half of the year, in part from tariffs. Ford Motor, and other import-heavy brands, face similar strains from tariffs. 
Analysts predict Ford’s Q2 earnings will show a double-digit earnings decline when the company releases its numbers Wednesday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But understand this: The financial tumult of tariffs eating into U.S. carmakers’ profit margins will reverberate in factory hubs throughout Ohio when import costs cannot be sustained without steep markups on cars people won’t buy. 
We’ve seen this movie before. If inventory isn’t moving, plants cut shifts. Layoffs mount as unsold vehicles pile up in dealership lots.
When that happens — and it sure appears to be the tariff-induced trajectory we’re on —  it won’t just be tens of thousands of Ohio manufacturing jobs that will be affected by declining car sales and plummeting company profits. 
Several times that many people in the state are employed by businesses that serve automakers and their families. The impact of the auto industry on Ohio’s economy cannot be overstated. 
The toll of Trump’s irrational trade war with Mexico and Canada, Ohio’s largest trading partner, will ultimately be paid by Jeep workers in Toledo, employees at the Ford assembly plant in Avon Lake, the Lima engine plant, the GM stamping and metal plant in Parma and others. 
These are Ohioans earning solid wages (average salary is $29.85 an hour or $62,097 a year, according to ZipRecruiter) with better benefits. 
Many are Trump supporters but he is directly jeopardizing their success stories by threatening to hike tariffs even higher on Mexico and Canada — 30% and 35%, respectively — on Friday.
Adding insult to injury, Trump further undercut U.S. car companies last week by lowering tariffs for Japanese imports to 15% while GM, Ford and Stellantis still pay 25% tariffs for cars they manufacture in Canada and Mexico. 
The American Automotive Policy Council, that represents the Detroit Big Three, said “any deal that charges a lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no U.S. content is a bad deal for the U.S. industry and U.S. autoworkers.” 
But despite the pressing concerns of American automakers that Trump’s plan could give Japanese automakers unfair advantage, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick brushed off the complaints with his trademark, tone-deaf drivel. 
“Oh my God, that’s just so silly,” Lutnick sputtered on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” American auto companies don’t mind the discrepancy in tariff costs that favor a foreign competitor, he brayed. They’re “cool with” paying higher tariff fees than Japan, Lutnick assured absolutely no one. 
Does the commerce secretary really believe domestic automakers and suppliers are “cool with” the cost of business rising astronomically? Or jacking up consumer prices on vehicles that inevitably reduce sales? Will the Big Three be “cool with” massive job losses at shuttered factories?
It is absurd blather from a billionaire carrying water for another billionaire lost in magical economic thinking. 
Trump promised a new “golden age” in U.S. manufacturing courtesy his nonsensical trade war with some of America’s closest allies. 
The “very stable genius” insisted his barrage of tariffs, with little discernible rationale, will generate a domestic manufacturing boom like no other — contravening every fundamental taught in ECON 101.  
“Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country,” declared the felon (with multiple bankruptcies) based on nothing.

But instead of roaring back, U.S. manufacturers are in a slump.
 In just the second quarter of this year they are reeling with oppressive import costs they are forced to offset with prices increases on products buyers can no longer afford. 
Tack on more tariff charges (taxes) for other imported material (steel and aluminum) on top of EV (electric vehicles) incentives, such as tax credits, going away and tell me again how the Big Three are “cool with” unsustainable losses caused by a seemingly addled 79-year-old with a nostalgic tick for the 1950s. 
Second quarter numbers scream for course correction but Trump is on a tariff power trip that defies reason. 
His economic policy (?) — driven by impulse and flattery — could set American competitiveness in manufacturing back decades and increase the prospects of more hollowed out communities like Youngstown, Ohio.
Trump promised an economic renaissance there, too. Remember? 
In 2017 he said all the lost auto jobs, that used to fill the GM Lordstown parking lot with 4,500 employees, would come roaring back. 
The exact opposite happened. GM cut the second shift at Lordstown in 2018. A year later the plant would close for good. 
Trump betrayed those who elected him and never looked back. Is he doing that again by risking auto-dependent livelihoods in the state with reckless trade wars to no end?

The Mississippi State Department of Health, like other state health departments, is concerned about the potential loss of federal funding. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
 Clawing back COVID-era grants

Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
 Smallpox, cholera and typhoid

Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
 A major cut in services

Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
States look at shoring up consumer protections as Trump hobbles federal watchdog

After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/07/29/state-board-determines-two-type-2-diabetes-drugs-may-be-unaffordable/,"After months of deliberation, information gathering and testimony, a state board agreed Monday that two common medications for type-2 diabetes and other conditions appear to pose an affordability challenge to the state and Marylanders.","Maryland Prescription Drug Affordability Chair Van T. Mitchell, shown here in a May 2024 meeting of the board in Annapolis. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).After months of deliberation, information gathering and public testimony, a state board unanimously agreed Monday that two common medications for type-2 diabetes and other conditions appear to pose an affordability challenge to the state and Marylanders.
The state Prescription Drug Affordability Board approved two resolutions saying that prescription drugs Jardiance and Farxiga likely pose an “an affordability challenge for the state health care system” and the state should look for ways to bring down those costs.
Health care advocates call the long-awaited resolution an “important first step” in the process in bringing down prescription costs for those on the state’s health plan.
Vincent DeMarco, a long-time supporter of the board’s effort and president of the Maryland Health Care for All Coalition, called the preliminary decision a “really big deal.”
In a written statement, the coalition commended board members for agreeing that the “critically-needed diabetes drugs” can cause an affordability challenge for the state, and expressed hope that the board will quickly make decisions to bring those costs down.
The preliminary determination allows the board to consider options for reducing spending on those drugs for the state, including the possible use of upper payment limits to cap how much the state is willing to pay for them.
But it may be a while before the state sees any savings on those medications.
“It’s an important milestone, but it is not a final step,” Andrew York, the board’s executive director, told board members during the public portion of Monday’s meeting.


Targeted drugs
Six drugs were selected for “cost review,” and address several conditions including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, eczema, Crohn’s disease and more.

Dupixent
Farxiga
Jardiance
Ozempic
Skyrizi
Trulicity



That milestone has been years in the making. Created in 2019 by the General Assembly, the Prescription Drug Affordability Board was slow to launch due in part to a veto from former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) amid pandemic-induced economic uncertainty in 2020 that delayed the board’s formation.
After Gov. Wes Moore (D) allocated funding for the board’s operation in 2023, the entity went through lengthy rule-making to create the “cost review” process for targeted drugs.
Farxiga, a brand name for the drug dapagliflozin, and Jardiance, a brand name for empagliflozin, are the first drugs to make it all the way through the cost review process, which involves collecting data, industry secrets and public testimony from different parts of the health care system to help the board determine if a drug is unaffordable. Four other drugs will undergo the process later.
Del. Bonnie Cullison (D-Montgomery), who has been involved in PDAB-related legislation for years, said that the work of the board is helping to shed a light on the “black hole” of information on drug costs.
“This board exists because we’re watching the cost of prescription drugs escalate,” she told the board, “and we had to get a handle on that pricing.”
“It’s always been a black hole in terms of how the process works through all of the different components,” she said. “And what this board has accomplished, and the staff of this board has accomplished, is to try to bring light to all of the possible data in this chain, to make a determination whether or not the residents of Maryland are getting the best benefit out of their prescription drugs and what they’re paying for.”
Cullison acknowledged that “it’s been an arduous process, but it was arduous simply because you gave every opportunity to every stakeholder to be engaged in this process.”
PDAB staff members reported that the Farxiga and Jardiance wholesale acquisition costs, which is the manufacturer’s price on a drug when selling to a wholesaler, has risen higher than the rate of inflation, indicating a potential affordability challenge.
The board also cited out-of-pocket costs for consumers and state and local spending on those drugs as indicators that there may be an affordability challenge.
The board will now look at options to address the potential affordability challenge, which could include setting an upper payment limit on those drugs. But it’s not clear when the state will see cost savings.
That said, some members of the health care system and the pharmaceutical industry say that policies such as upper payment limits could weaken access to life-saving drugs. Others say that the board has not engaged enough viewpoints from the health care industry.
PDAB weighs diabetes drug affordability, as Moore weighs bill to expand PDAB

“This is a pivotal moment,” Derek Flowers, president of the Value of Care Coalition, said in virtual public testimony. “As the board  makes today’s decisions and looks ahead, we urge you to engage clinicians more meaningfully, evaluate real-world consequences of UPLs [upper payment limits], and more importantly, consider non-UPL strategies that lower costs while improving health outcomes.”
Opponents to prescription drug affordability boards also argue that any cost-reduction efforts will likely not result in lower out-of-pocket costs for patients, but rather create savings for the state. But PDAB advocates counter that freeing up taxpayer dollars by reducing spending on prescription drugs could help support other state-led health programs.
Board members also argue that upper payment limits are just one tool among many to potentially bring costs down for the state, and that they are not required to set an upper limit if it would impede access to those drugs.
Maryland lawmakers this year also approved a law that will let the Prescription Drug Affordability Board expand its cost reduction efforts to the commercial, not just the state plan. That expansion only takes effect a year after the board has successfully placed upper payment limits on two drugs.

Angela Alsobrooks, Reps. Sarah Elfreth, Johnny Olszewski and Kweisi Mfume, Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Glenn Ivey wait outside ICE offices in Baltimore. (Photo courtesy Sen. Chris Van Hollen's office)Six members of Maryland’s congressional delegation were turned away Monday when they showed up to inspect a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore where they said people are being temporarily held for deportation or awaiting court hearings.
Democratic Sens. Angela Alsobrooks and Chris Van Hollen and Reps. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd), Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), Glenn Ivey (D-4th) and Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) entered the George H. Fallon Federal Building, where the ICE detention facility is located.
In a joint statement, the lawmakers said the visit was part of teheri oversight responsibility as members of Congress, and that they were “exercising our legal authority … to inspect the Baltimore federal holding facility, and, if necessary, speak directly with detainees.”
But they were denied entry by an ICE official who told the lawmakers that it was an office, not a detention facility, and that they were not authorized to to enter, even though they wrote the head of ICE and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last Monday to alert them to the visit.
Despite the claim that it’s just an office, Alsobrooks said previous visits by congressional staffers, and a court brief filed by Maryland Attorney General, indicate that immigrants are being held for several days at a time in “hold rooms” at the facility. Those rooms are designed to hold detainees for up to 12 hours while awaiting a court appearance, but are not meant for longer stays, lawmakers said.
“They are breaking the law in there,” Alsobrooks said. She said the official they encountered refused to say who gave the order to bar lawmawkers from the building.
Eastern Shore pastor detained by ICE transferred to Louisiana facility

A representative from ICE didn’t respond to requests for comment Monday. But Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, derided what he called the “‘sit-in’ stunts for cameras,” after several of the lawmakers saw down in front of the ICE office doors.
“Spare us the show. We stand with ICE and their mission to keep Maryland safe,” Harris said in a social media post.
Alsobrooks did not respond to Harris’ post directly, instead chiding him for not using his influence with the White House to secure federal disaster relie for Western Maryland flood victims, which was rejected last week by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“We share a responsibility to the people of Maryland,” she said. “It would be great to be able to get his assistance in getting the disaster relief that people need.”
The Baltimore office recently held Eastern Shore pastor Daniel Fuentes Espinal, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras with no criminal record, who was arrested last week and has since been transferred to the Winn Correctional Center outside New Orleans. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Beltsville resident arrested and erroneously deported to El Salvador before being brought back to in Tennessee, where is currently being held, also started his journey in the Baltimore office in March.
Lawmakers said Monday’s visit was a follow-up to a March visit by Alsobrooks and Van Hollen staffers that found overcrowding of up to 54 people in holding rooms, no infirmary or medical staff on-site, with ICE staff “making sandwiches themselves or buying McDonald’s” to feed detainees.
Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) filed an amicus brief in June outlining the conditions in Baltimore and limited “access to counsel” and “basic hygiene.”
Alsobrooks noted that some of the ICE agents were “walking around that building with masks on. The inhumanity and cruelty is an ongoing theme of the people who are treated inside that building.”
“They’re walking around that building with masks on,” she said. “The inhumanity and cruelty is an ongoing theme of the people who are treated inside that building.”
The lawmakers said that federal law gives members of Congress the “explicit right to conduct unannounced oversight visits to DHS [Department of Homeland Security] detention facilities. No prior notice is required, and no agency has the authority to obstruct that legal responsibility.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ivey, who traveled in El Salvador in May in an unsuccessful attempt to visit Abrego Garcia, said he wasn’t shocked when was refused a visit there, because officials in that country “don’t have the longest history of democracy there and arguably, don’t have it right now.”
“But this is unbelievable, that they [ICE officials] would turn us away from this building here in the United States … to see our constituents,” Ivey said Monday in a news conference in front of the building. “Not only that, the power of the purse under the Constitution gives us the authority and the obligation to conduct oversight, to make sure money’s being spent wisely.”
Crisaly De Los Santos, director of CASA’s Baltimore and Central Maryland office, called the ICE decision to prevent members fo Congress from touring the building “outrageous.”
“Although federal lawmakers are legally afforded jurisdictional oversight of all ICE facilities, Baltimore ICE unlawfully denied access underscoring that the Trump regime is escalating its denial of restraints and the proper oversight role of the legislative branch,” De Los Santos said. “Imagine, if members of Congress can be treated so poorly by ICE, what is happening in our streets to you and me?”

(File photo by Angela Breck/Maryland Matters)Two months ago, Ed Hale announced his candidacy for governor, with plans to challenge incumbent Wes Moore, a Democrat. Hale said he still plans to file, but he has to answer one big question first.
Will he remain a Democrat?
In a brief phone interview, Hale said he plans to conduct polling later this summer and “looking at what the best path is for me.”
When he announced his intentions in May, Hale, 78 and a lifelong Democrat, said the plan was to challenge Moore in the Democratic primary next year.
Moore is expected to pose a formidable challenge in 2026. He’s a prodigious fundraiser, a frequent guest on national and local TV and radio and is rumored to be a potential 2028 presidential candidate (speculation he repeatedly but so far unsuccessfully has attempted to quiet).
Hale’s entry into the race as a Republican could give him a bit of a leg up if he can parlay his business connections into a powerful fundraising machine. Currently, there are two Republicans in the gubernatorial primary: John Myrick, who previously ran an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate; and Carl A. Brunner Jr., a Carroll firearms instructor.
Another potential entrant is Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan. Hogan has been quiet about his intentions, but speculation persists that he might run for his old job.
Hale said he has no plans to talk to Hogan as part of his decision-making process as he considers a run as a Republican or independent candidate.

He has time. The deadline to file is in February, and the primary election is not until June.
Hale said he hoped to make a final decision about his path and party affiliation later this year before he files.
Hale, who is recovering from “back fusion surgery” said he does plan on attending the Maryland Association of Counties annual convention in Ocean City next month.
Gov., er, make that Vice Chair Moore
Gov. Wes Moore (D) got another title to add to his resume Saturday: vice chair.
More specifically, the governor was elected to serve in that position for the National Governors Association during its summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo. The post also make him the association’s 2026-27 chair-elect.
Part of Moore’s duties as vice chair will include leading the association’s work to identify innovative policy solutions through bipartisan collaboration and research. Moore replaces Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R), who was elevated to the NGA chairmanship for 2025-26.
Moore will also lead the association’s Center for Best Practices, which conducts hands-on research and development, offers pilot projects and workshops with a goal to create bipartisan policies and solutions for states in 10 areas, including health, infrastructure and education.
Earlier this month, the association and a national nonprofit group called Third Sector Capital Partners selected Maryland, Idaho, North Carolina and South Carolina to participate in a policy academy to strengthen SNAP E&T (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Employment and Training). The program, slated to run through February, will have cohorts from those states establish an action plan to meet goals to expanding access to SNAP and employment and training programs, provide coaching support and host webinars to engage in peer learning as plans are being developed.
Moore will also work alongside Stitt as part of initiative the Oklahoma governor announced Saturday called “Reigniting the American Dream.” Throughout the year, Stitt will lead a series of meetings with governors, private-sector leaders and “changemakers” with a focus on three policy priorities: unlocking economic opportunity, empowering every learner and energizing the future.
“We all want to create a brighter future for our states, and the nation. When we get together at the National Governors Association, we’re focused on whether an idea is good, not on where the idea came from,” Moore said in a statement. “I’m looking forward to collaborating with my fellow governors to build stronger on-ramps to opportunity so every person in our states has a shot at success – no matter how they define it.”

Besides Maryland, the other fellows are from Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina.
According to a summary of the collective, its goal will be to facilitate peer learning to help fellows grow their knowledge on gender justice issues such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ and child care.
“States are on the frontlines of the fight for gender justice, and they are already leading progress by protecting their communities from abortion bans and attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, advancing their own equal pay protections, and investing in child care and Black maternal health policies,” Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, said in a statement. “We are thrilled to be working with state policymakers and advocates to harness our collective power to restore our democracy in advancing gender justice.”
Schumitz works at the center that advocates annually for various statewide policies that includes health, worker protections and criminal justice. In addition, the center is a member of the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s annual Kids Count data book.
Shetty, who was elected in 2018, had several bills signed into law this year including House Bill 881, which begins a phase-in for 100% of monthly child support payments “pass through to the family” who seek assistance in a Family Investment Program. The bill was also sponsored in the opposite chamber by Sen. Cory McCray (D-Baltimore City).
Shetty, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a text message Friday on in the fellowship, “It’s wonderful and I’m so honored to have the opportunity to participate.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_0768-1.jpg,,,2025-07-29 02:56:46.069984

Moore asked the Legislative Policy Committee in June to approve the use of $30,000 with the current budget to help cover the salaries of two new part-time contractual employees to handle recruitment and hiring of federal employees, according to an analysis by the Department of Legislative Services.
Since making the request, Moore announced a hiring freeze in most state agencies. The governor is also looking to reduce state payroll through a voluntary buyout program.
House Minority Leader Del. Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) said the request is surprising.

	“How can we, at the same time, pursue the hiring of former federal employees, unless they are in those critical positions he’s outlined?” Buckel said in a statement. “That is unlikely. If his administration needs to essentially hire additional staff whose job it will be to hire additional staff, that contradicts any notion about government efficiency. It seems disingenuous to take from state employees with one hand while giving to former federal employees with the other.”
The relatively small amount comes from $2 million set aside by the legislature this year to fund a program to expedite the hiring of federal employees who are fired or laid off. Since February, the state has hired 251 people across all state agencies, according to legislative analysts. But just 7% of those — about 18 people — were hired through the program meant to help displaced federal workers, according to the Department of Legislative Services.
“We have a duty to be good stewards of the taxpayer dollar, particularly in these tight budget times,” Senate Minority Leader Sen. Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) said. “Our taxpayers cannot afford the unsustainable level of hiring the Moore Administration has pursued over the last three years, and they certainly cannot afford a phony hiring freeze.

However, I am increasingly concerned about communications I’m receiving about people in our nation.
To put it simply, it seems the First Amendment, providing us with the right to free speech and expression, is not being upheld with the protection it deserves, allowing foreign entities to abuse domestic residents.

Sen. Saud Anwar, M.D. D-South Windsor
Through my own personal communications, and with my fellow members of the Asian Pacific American Affairs Caucus, I have received troubling reports of United States citizens, including ones in Connecticut, facing foreign censorship after criticizing those countries for their policies. What’s worse, this censorship appears to be working.
In one instance, I am in conversation with a U.S. resident and journalist facing pressure from the Pakistani government for his YouTube videos. In those videos, he criticizes the government’s policies and actions; in return, it is seeking to have his account taken down. The worst elements of this story? YouTube, owned by Google, an American company, appears to be receptive to Pakistan’s demands and is willing to strip videos from the man’s account.
When there is already a significant campaign working against immigrants in the United States — seen clearly in the targeting of non-violent immigrants by ICE and of a number of U.S. residents by federal officials over their past speech — the foreign interference of other nations on American soil represents a further threat to the security of our residents.
In addition to Pakistan, other governments have targeted and harassed residents of the United States. Chinese authorities have targeted critics and activists protesting treatment of the Uyghur people. Vox reported last year that the Indian government has regularly retaliated against academics and critics, including those in foreign nations.
In many cases, foreign governments targeting U.S. residents, especially those focused on their former residents, are going after those who may have left their home countries for better opportunity or to flee oppression, imprisonment or worse. The increasing connectivity of the world through technology, primarily through digital communication, makes it possible for repressive regimes to reach residents directly with threats, harassment and unwanted contact.
Should these foreign entities achieve their goals of silencing dissidents globally, with little or no interference or defense mounted by U.S. officials, what would stop them from becoming emboldened and expanding their approach or actions?
Our nation’s First Amendment provides our residents with the power and right to free speech and expression. International intimidation and manipulation of our residents, especially immigrants who have come here to build careers, businesses, families and lives, is a direct threat to those freedoms. When social media misinformation proliferates but abuse silences those who are speaking truth, we are in a new paradigm – one only made worse by a lack of digital regulation and lack of defense for those most impacted.
When the federal government is failing to act, it is time for state governments to step in and create these protections. We should treat foreign interference and harassment of this type like we treat hate crimes – with serious consequences, not only to stop an abuser but to prevent others from acting in a similar manner.
This year, I introduced legislation to the General Assembly that would update our statutes to require the State Police Hate Crimes Investigative Unit to respond to and investigate reports of repression or targeting by foreign nations against Connecticut residents. This would serve as an important layer of protection preserving the safety and security of our residents, and while it did not pass the legislature in 2025, I plan to reintroduce it in 2026 in the name of those impacted.
There is a reason why immigrants come to the United States: it offers freedoms and opportunities for success unobtainable in other regions, and, for some, a new home safe from oppressive foreign governments. To restore and preserve that strength, I am adamant that we must work to improve our protections.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/protect-the-constitution-e1753227736484.jpeg,,,2025-07-29 00:04:56.766109

What happened to the much-simpler-to-take pills?
Part of the problem is the “pill penalty” that was written into the federal Inflation Reduction Act.
One of the IRA’s most counter-productive measures is its provision that the federal government begin to “negotiate” the price Medicare pays for medicines.
Adding insult to injury, the IRA provides that “negotiation” begins four years sooner for small molecule drugs (that take form as a pill) than for large molecule drugs (that need to be injected).
Truth be told, the IRA’s negotiation process is anything but. The government states what it will pay and biopharma companies can take it or leave it.
There’s no authentic, transparent back and forth and no competition among multiple potential buyers. The most egregious aspect of this brave new world of “negotiation” is that it allows the government to obtain a price that is lower than the cost of all the research and development innovation that goes into creating a new medicine.
Pill penalty disincentivizes R&D
At a superficial level this results in somewhat lower drug prices, but it disincentivizes companies from investing in more R&D.
New medicines save lives and save money. As expensive as a new medicine may seem, the hospitalizations, surgeries, etc., it replaces save the overall healthcare system billions of dollars.
The IRA’s “negotiation” undercuts the patent system that has served us so well. When a person or a company designs something new, novel, unique and innovative they can apply for a patent.
If granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the patent holder has a 20-year exclusivity period when no one else can use the recipe described in the patent without the holder’s permission.
This system works spectacularly well to incentivize innovation and allows inventors to recoup their R&D costs. After 20 years, anyone can take advantage of the innovation memorialized in the patent, free of charge.
As to drugs, the IRA reduced the time after which the government could set prices to 13 years for injectables and nine years for pills.
As common sense would predict, this dramatically disincentivized R&D into small molecule drugs. In 2023, injectables received nearly 50% more venture capital financing than small molecule drugs.
Both established large biopharma companies and smaller early stage biotechs have announced plans to cut small molecule R&D programs and divert resources to large molecule drugs.
Real consequences for patients
This distortion has real consequences for patients. Some of the most critical diseases needing better treatments and therefore more R&D are neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and brain cancer.
What makes creating treatments for them such a challenge is the blood-brain barrier—the complex layer of cells lining the blood vessels to the brain and spinal cord that act as a shield against substances that could potentially be toxic to the brain.
It’s a challenge to fashion a small molecule drug that can pass through the blood-brain barrier. It’s as close to impossible as it gets to create a large molecule injectable that can make its way across the blood brain barrier.
If we’re ever going to find effective treatments and cures for neurodegenerative diseases, they are likely to come in the form of small molecule drugs.
While the Trump administration announced earlier this year its intention to revise the exclusivity period to 13 years for both small and large molecule drugs, the administration has more recently focused on pushing dangerous ‘Most Favored Nation’ (MFN) drug price setting policies. If the administration’s goal is greater access and affordability, disincentivizing R&D and implementing price restrictions will not get us any closer to that objective. 
Congress should act at once to revise the pill penalty and reject other proposed drug ‘negotiation’ schemes.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-29 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Food security taken from children with celiac disease in a SNAP,Caroline Brauner MD,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/29/food-security-taken-from-children-with-celiac-disease-in-a-snap/,The federal budget reconciliation bill signed into law July 4 only reinforces and exacerbates the food insecurity that children with celiac disease face.,"The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advocates for food security in all households. They emphasize that “food insecurity manifests itself in…biopsychosocial outcomes, including health, education and economic prosperity.”  Children do not simply feel hungry when missing a meal. The United States Department of Agriculture reports that 13 million children in the United States (almost one in five, and one in six in Connecticut) live in food insecure households.
The health impacts of food insecurity become even more clear when medical conditions rely on a specific diet for its treatment. Celiac disease – an autoimmune gastrointestinal disorder where gluten incites inflammation in the gut- is a great example. 
As someone with celiac disease, I personally manage the strict elimination of all wheat, barley, and rye products from my diet. I am fortunate that I can afford the basic gluten-free bread, pasta and crackers, which can be marked up on average more than 200% compared to standard counterparts. Through working with the underserved pediatric population in New Haven, I am well aware of two things: 1) many families rely on government programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to afford basic goods 2) celiac disease does not discriminate based on socioeconomic status.
A recent study from 2022 reported that of families with at least one child with celiac disease, 19% experienced food insecurity and 21% experienced “gluten free food insecurity”- meaning they felt unable to consistently access enough gluten-free food. These families were also more likely to have their children intentionally consume gluten due to lack of availability, funds and access to appropriate gluten-free options.
It is well known that intestinal inflammation and resulting malabsorption causes iron deficiency anemia and vitamin D deficiency in patients with celiac disease. A 2022 Canadian study found that less than two thirds of adults who were FI with celiac disease consumed adequate amounts of vitamins A, B1, B6, C, D, K, and minerals like iron, calcium, magnesium or zinc. They also found that only 24.1% of celiac disease food insecurity patients followed a gluten free diet in contrast to 67.9% of celiac disease food secure patients.

Food insecurity on top of celiac disease will only make the outcomes of these deficiencies worse. If left untreated, celiac disease can lead to osteopenia/osteoporosis, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, intestinal adenocarcinoma and infertility. Effects in children can include short stature, failure to thrive, delayed puberty, and damage to teeth enamel.
It is a no-brainer that children with celiac disease– especially those that are food insecure– in Connecticut and across the United States should receive additional financial support to maintain a balanced gluten free diet. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The federal budget reconciliation bill signed into law July 4 only reinforces and exacerbates the food insecurity that children with celiac disease face. 
According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, this bill will eliminate food assistance to 2 million food insecure children (including those with celiac disease) and slash 30% of SNAP funding over the next decade. Children with celiac disease, one in five whose families already feel food insecure, will be further challenged to afford nutritious gluten free foods, adhere to a gluten free diet, and avoid the serious health complications of associated with celiac disease.
As pediatricians, it is our job to advocate for tax reimbursements, stipends, insurance coverage and additional federal and state financial support to ensure access nutritious gluten-free foods for our patients. Most importantly, we must recognize that the greatest assurance of medical wellbeing for children with celiac disease and FI and for stability of our country’s healthcare system, comes from the top-down policy action- namely governmental funding of healthy gluten-free food for those who need it most.

Mike Dunleavy delivers the annual State of the State address on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025, in the Alaska Capitol. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced his policy priorities for the Alaska State Legislature for when they reconvene for a special session scheduled to start on Saturday.
On Monday, the governor called for legislators to address what he called “Alaska’s chronic education outcome crisis” and to reconsider his executive order they had previously voted down, creating a new Department of Agriculture that he said would strengthen food security in Alaska. 
Separately, the Alaska State Legislature released a joint statement on Monday from leaders of the House and Senate majorities announcing their focus for the special session: two override votes. One would override Dunleavy’s budget veto of more than $50 million for Alaska schools, and the second vote would be on a bill to boost legislative oversight of oil and gas revenues. After the votes, they said they intend to adjourn. 
Dunleavy called the session last month, then asked the 19 Republican members of the House minority caucus to stay away from the session for the first five days to boycott the override votes. This drew outrage and criticism from some members of the House and Senate majorities as they rally support for the overrides, particularly to restore funding for K-12 schools. 
The Legislature is required to take up veto override votes within the first five days of the next session, and 45 votes of 60 members are needed to override the governor’s budget veto of school funding. A lower bar, of 40 votes, is needed to override non-budget bills.
Dunleavy’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday about whether he is still asking Republicans to stay away. In a statement posted on social media, Dunleavy said he would be in Juneau when the special session begins. “I invite all legislators to be there to focus on solutions that deliver real results for Alaskans,” he said.
Dunleavy released an agenda with eight items, including an executive order creating a Department of Agriculture to focus on food security for Alaska and growing the state’s agricultural sector.
The other seven items were focused on education policy:

tribal compacting between the state Department of Education and Early Development and select tribes to create better performing schools;
expand the corporate tax credit program for education;
authorize the Department of Education as a charter school authorizer in addition to local districts;
allow public school students to enroll in any public school that has room, including outside of a student’s resident district;
support grants for reading improvement and for a new after school reading tutoring program; 
pass recruitment retention payments to classroom teachers to reduce turnover, especially in areas of the state that suffer from chronic teacher turnover; and
establish long-term certainty in funding for K-12 schools if agreement is reached on policy.

“This is an opportunity to address Alaska’s performance issues and funding issues in K-12 education well into the future,” Dunleavy said in a statement released with the announcement. “By addressing this now, school districts, students, parents, teachers, and policymakers will have certainty and will not have to debate this issue during the regular session that begins in January.”
The Alaska House and Senate majorities have very different priorities for Saturday.
A statement from House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, and Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, on Monday said legislators will immediately go into a joint session at 10:15 a.m. on Saturday to take up two override votes: “restoring $51 million in public education funding and overriding the Governor’s veto of Senate Bill 183, which affirms the Legislature’s oversight of oil and gas tax revenues.”
“After which, the Legislature intends to adjourn later that day, having completed its work,” the statement said.
Stevens questioned the timing of the session, which is being held when legislators had previous commitments and plans. He emphasized both measures passed with broad bipartisan support. 
“This special session was called under circumstances that raise serious concerns, not only about its timing but also its clear aim to complicate legislative participation. Nevertheless, I urge every lawmaker not formally excused to be present in Juneau to fulfill our constitutional duty,” Stevens said. 
“These override votes are not just symbolic. They are about preparing Alaska’s students, restoring public trust in how we manage billions in state revenues, and maintaining the Legislature’s role as a co-equal branch of government. We owe it to our constituents and the future of this state to show up and do our jobs,” he said. 
Edgmon also called on every legislator to appear in Juneau to participate in the override votes. 
“Alaskans expect us to lead, not walk away from our responsibilities. Families, students, and teachers are counting on us to follow through on the commitments we made during the regular session,” Edgmon said. “This special session is not about partisanship, but about standing up for our students and preserving the checks and balances that keep government accountable. Every elected state lawmaker needs to uphold their constitutional duty, come to Juneau, and vote their conscience.”

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

(Photo provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Yukon Flats Tribes and the river system they call home gain nothing and stand to lose everything with the Alaska Division of Oil and Gas’s recent proposal to open state lands in the region to oil exploration. Once again we are seeing outside decision-makers trying to decide our future without our input or consent. The Tanana Chiefs Conference and 42 Interior Tribes have standing resolutions opposing oil and gas development in the area. The Gwich’in Nation and Tribes of the Yukon Flats will continue to demand a seat at the table for these decisions. We have the right to say no when there is so much at stake.
This new proposal comes as Yukon River salmon populations are collapsing. Tribes are in a crisis, banned from accessing the food and cultural sustenance they’ve depended on for millennia. No amount of money can possibly justify endangering the Yukon River watershed, or the Tribes’ health and traditions, all for corporate profits we will never see. The state should be doing absolutely everything it can to protect salmon and the Yukon River watershed, not creating yet another threat.
The ongoing salmon collapse is reshaping life along the Yukon River and is an emergency that cannot be ignored. Industry activity and the climate crisis are having a huge impact on our communities, and oil is a dire new threat—not only to traditional foods but the physical and cultural health they provide. A new generation is already missing out on learning and experiencing their own culture. 
The state hasn’t shared which company applied for a permit, or exactly where this development would take place—the lack of transparency in this process is deeply concerning. 
There is no place for oil development in the Yukon Flats. Not only does it hold life-giving salmon rivers, but it’s also home to intact wetlands and other waterways that sustain communities. Oil and gas exploration would be yet another assault on the health of these communities, lands, and waters, and a gateway to many more problems. An April spill of 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel close to the Yukon River, by a contractor that has supported Doyon-Hilcorp oil exploration near Birch Creek, shows that industry accidents and contamination  are not a question of if, but when. 
The state has an opportunity right now to do the right thing and deny this permit, to show the communities of the Yukon Flats that their rights matter more than corporate profits. The state can support communities’ access to clean water, healthy fish and wildlife populations, to plants and berries, and their right to say no to harmful development. This could open the door to disaster in the Yukon Flats. The state can deny this oil exploration application now, and any others in the future.
The public comment period for this proposal is open until July 30. Click here for more information.

(Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ attorney general on Monday certified a ballot title aimed at preserving voters’ right to direct democracy after previously rejecting the proposal twice for failing to meet a new reading-level law. 
Act 602 of 2025 prohibits the attorney general from certifying a proposed ballot title with a reading level above eighth grade as determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. The test uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what level of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
In Monday’s opinion, Attorney General Tim Griffin said the most recent submission from Protect AR Rights ranks at a 9.2 grade level. Griffin certified the ballot title after making “a few minor changes” to ensure it meets the reading-level requirement. He also made “several changes” to the ballot title so it “more clearly and accurately reflects the contents” of the proposed constitutional amendment.
Arkansas ballot measure again rejected for not meeting reading-level requirement

Griffin certified the measure’s popular name as submitted. 
“We were notified today that the Arkansas Attorney General amended and then approved the ballot title for the Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment,” Protect AR Rights said in a statement. “Our campaign partners and legal team are still assessing the AG’s opinion and its impact on our campaign to protect the fundamental right of every Arkansas citizen to have a say in the laws that impact us.”
With the attorney general’s certification, Protect AR Rights may begin collecting signatures to qualify its measure for the 2026 ballot. Although Griffin signed off on the measure’s popular name and substituted ballot title Monday, he cautioned that ambiguity in lengthy and complex constitutional amendments could lead to a successful court challenge. 
“Significant changes in law often have unintended consequences that, if known, would give voters serious ground for reflection,” Griffin said. “As several of my predecessors have noted when certifying certain lengthy and complex ballot titles, the Arkansas Supreme Court has repeatedly warned sponsors of statewide measures about their ballot titles’ length and complexity.”
Griffin also said he was including a copy of instructions to canvassers and signers that he said must be incorporated into Protect AR Rights’ petition before circulation. 
Canvassers and signers must meet a number of new requirements following passage of several direct democracy-related laws during the 2025 legislative session. 
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Protect AR Rights is challenging some of the new laws in court. A judge last week allowed the group to intervene in a lawsuit filed by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas in April. Protect AR Rights filed its own complaint and motion for a preliminary injunction in the case last week. 
The League is pursuing its own ballot measure to protect direct democracy in Arkansas. Griffin certified the group’s ballot title in May and volunteers having been collecting signatures in support of the measure.
Both groups argue the new requirements make it more difficult for Arkansans to propose laws and place them before voters. Supporters of the new laws have said the requirements will help protect the integrity of the state’s initiative and referendum process.
In its complaint, Protect AR Rights challenged laws not included in the original lawsuit, including the reading-level law and a 2023 law that requires signatures to be collected from 50 counties instead of 15. 
The latter law is part of a separate lawsuit that also involves the League of Women Voters of Arkansas. A judge will consider a motion for judgment in that case during a hearing on Sept. 3 in Pulaski County Circuit Court.

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Amid recent political rhetoric about rising crime and violence in American cities, a new analysis shows that violent crime has continued to decline this year.
Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a new crime trends report released Thursday by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Homicides fell 17% in the first half of 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, among the 30 cities that reported homicide data, according to the report.
During that same period, five cities saw increases in homicide — ranging from 6% in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to 39% in Little Rock, Arkansas.
While the report’s authors say the continued drop in violent crime — especially homicides — is encouraging, they note that much of the decline stems from a few major cities with historically high rates, such as Baltimore and St. Louis.
More than half of the cities studied have higher homicide rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, though, the analysis found that there were 14% fewer homicides during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2019.
The authors say more research is needed before crediting any specific policy or practice for the continued drop in violent crime.
The group’s findings come as President Donald Trump continues to amplify concerns about crime, at times citing misleading statistics and narratives.

In a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump claimed that cashless bail — a practice that allows people charged with a crime to be released pretrial without paying money, unless a judge deems them a threat to public safety — were fueling a national crime surge and endangering law enforcement.
He wrote: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”
Some research suggests that setting money bail isn’t effective in ensuring court appearances or improving public safety. Opponents of ending cash bail often raise concerns that released suspects might commit new, potentially more serious crimes. While that is possible in individual cases, studies show that eliminating cash bail does not lead to a widespread increase in crime.
The Truth Social post also marked a sharp shift from Trump’s remarks during a June roundtable with the Fraternal Order of Police, where he claimed the national murder rate had “plummeted by 28%” since he took office — a figure that overstates the decline and overlooks the fact that murder rates began falling well before he returned to office.
According to data consulting firm AH Datalytics, which manages the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 400 law enforcement agencies nationwide — the number of homicides between January and May 2025 was 20.3% lower than the same period in 2024.
Similarly, data released in May by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicides fell roughly 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first three months of the prior year. The group’s data is based on a survey of 68 major metropolitan police departments nationwide.
Researchers at the Council on Criminal Justice note in their report that it’s difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the drop in homicides, but they note that fewer people appear to be exposed to high-risk situations, such as robberies.
Most major crimes fell in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period last year, according to the council’s report.
Motor vehicle thefts dropped by 25%, while reported gun assaults fell 21%. Robberies, residential and non-residential burglaries, shoplifting, and aggravated and sexual assaults also saw double-digit declines
Drug offenses held steady, while domestic violence reports rose slightly — by about 3%. Carjackings declined 24% and larcenies were down 5%.
Compared with the first half of 2019, before the pandemic and nationwide reckoning over racial justice and policing, overall homicides are down 14%, robberies by 30%, and sexual assaults by 28%.
Still, more than 60% of the cities in the council’s study sample report homicide rates that remain above 2019 levels.
Motor vehicle theft remains the only crime tracked in the report that is still elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels — up 25% since 2019 — although it has declined sharply since 2023.
The council also released another analysis on the lethality of violent crime, showing that while violent incidents have decreased, the share of violence that ends in death has increased significantly. In 1994, there were 2 homicides per 1,000 assaults and about 16 per 1,000 robberies. By 2020, those figures rose to 7.2 and 55.8, respectively.

(Photo Oregon Capital Chronicle)As Montana courts data centers and leaders mull ways to encourage artificial intelligence developments, lawmakers are looking into the state’s power generation capacity as part of the Energy and Technology Interim Committee.
The committee met Monday to determine priorities and also heard concerns and comments about data centers and power load.
Power, especially energy used to help run new technology, was a major discussion point during the session, especially in relation to strain on the electrical grid and impacts to consumers. Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, a Billings Republican and committee chairman, called the issues “tied together.”
And some on Monday said the legislature is running out of time to put guardrails in place before it’s too late to make large, structural changes in how the state will approach the issue.
“I think this is our last chance as a legislative body, ahead of 2027, to kind of address this before it’s completely out of the barn,” Derek Goldman, representing the Northwest Energy Coalition, told the committee. “In other states that have seen large data center loads increase, customers have seen significant impacts in rates. And I really strongly encourage this committee to use its jurisdiction under statute or under one of the existing study bills it has for it to really dig in on the data center issue.”
NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest energy provider, has been under the microscope in recent years over the rates it charges. 
Since last fall, several new data centers have been planned statewide that are expected to require around 1,000 Megawatts of energy. This includes a 600 MW facility near Great Falls announced in June. 
“Adding this amount of electric demand in Montana will require massive changes to our energy supply and transmission system,” a letter from the Northwest Energy Coalition to the interim committee states. “We must consider all the implications for regulated utilities, customer-owned utilities, large commercial, industrial and residential electric customers in Montana.”
Federal changes around artificial intelligence were also discussed by some in attendance for public comment, including Jesse Luther, who said she was representing some data center companies. The legislature did work on AI this session, but federal changes could mean state changes too, and the technology is evolving rapidly.
“Consistent with the federal government’s implementation of the Build AI America plan, we would encourage Montana to explore regulatory reforms that embrace energy production,” Luther told the committee.
The interim committee has three different studies assigned during the session — one on energy transmission (Senate Joint Resolution 12), another into interstate power grid development (Senate Joint Resolution 21), and a study of artificial intelligence (House Joint Resolution 4).
Work on those studies has to be completed by September 2026.
SJ 21 directs the committee to determine what it would take, and if there are opportunities to better connect Montana’s energy grid to neighboring states. It looks to clarify the legal and economic issues surrounding any interstate compacts. 
The committee may combine efforts for that study, to some degree, with SJ 12, which touches on many of the same issues. SJ 12 is looking at Montana’s current electrical outlook and looks at more specific upgrades and “congestion,” as well as stress on transmission infrastructure.
The interim committee also heard updates from the Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency active in major changes regarding energy in the state. 
PSC President Brad Molnar and NorthWestern Lobbyist Alan Olson traded barbs over several topics. Most of those comments dealt with HB 490, a bill passed this session dealing with wildfire mitigation plans for power utilities. 
Members of the committee also started the process of determining topics for bills going into the next session. The committee is also looking to resurrect several vetoed bills, including one regarding genomics and another dealing with shared solar cooperation.
Cryptocurrency, electronic device privacy, transmission lines and railroad easements were also discussed as potential bill topics.
The committee mixes a number of legislators who have been active in energy and tech policy. It will be led by Sen. Zolnikov, R-Billings, who has spearheaded and crafted significant parts of the state’s tech laws for years. Rep. Becky Edwards, a Bozeman Democrat, will serve as vice chairperson.
Other members include Sen. Chris Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, who is active on energy policy, as well as Rep. Katie Zolnikov, a Republican from Billings who served as Speaker Pro Tem during the session and saw a variety of policy see passage. Sen. Gayle Lammers, a Hardin Republican who carried blockchain legislation, and Rep. Bob Carter, a Missoula Democrat who served on the House’s tech and energy committee last session, are both on the committee, which is eight legislators in total. 
During a brief comment on Monday morning, Sen. Zolnikov said he feels the state has a lot of, “good, well written” tech policy, but some bills — especially some that did not originate in the energy and tech committee — are “not always well written.” Montana legislators did pass a wide range of tech and privacy legislation during the 2025 Legislature.
“It’d be nice, as we start to mature a tech committee, where we try to funnel some of these things in, especially since energy and technology are now the same exact thing. We’re hearing about the massive new technology of AI, well, that uses a lot of energy, and it’s becoming very tied together,” Zolnikov said. “So there were some bills last session, again, some good policies, some good ideas, not always well written, that if they would have gone to our committee, there could have been the work put into them.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/QTS-Data-Center-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 20:56:26.520280

(Getty Images)Pennsylvania hunters will have 13 straight Sundays to go out in the woods and fields this fall.
The Pennsylvania Game Commission met on Monday to announce the dates for Sunday hunting in 2025. The move came a few weeks after Gov. Josh Shapiro signed legislation to repeal the state’s ban.
From September 14 through December 7, all Sundays will be open to hunting.
“I would just like to say to all of my fellow hunters out there, let’s make this a golden opportunity and do Sunday the way it needs to be done,” Game Commissioner Robert C. Schwalm said during Monday’s meeting. “We need to recruit. We need to reactivate and we need to retain.”
“We can turn this around,” he added. “We finally got this in our arsenal. Let’s make it happen.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Supporters of repealing Pennsylvania’s Sunday hunting prohibition argued that it was an outdated ban that limited opportunities to make it accessible for younger people and those who work on weekdays.
State Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny) and state Sen. Dan Laughlin (R-Erie) led the bipartisan effort to get House Bill 1431, which gave the commission authority to decide which Sundays should be open to hunting, over the finish line. They celebrated the additional Sundays open to hunting in social media posts.
“The Pennsylvania Game Commission has approved 10 additional Sunday hunting days this season!  This is just the beginning!!” Steele wrote.
“Sunday hunting dates are set. Mark your calendars. Good luck to all hunters!,” Laughlin said.

Migratory game bird seasons are the lone exception, according to the Game Commission, because those seasons are set through federal frameworks and “adding any Sundays at this time would result in a loss of hunting days in 2025-26.”
Prior to House Bill 1431 being signed, three Sundays each year — one during archery season, one during rifle season, and one Sunday selected by the Game Commission — were open for hunting in Pennsylvania, thanks to a law signed by Gov. Tom Wolf in 2019. However, hunting crows, foxes and coyotes had been legal on Sundays prior to 2019.
Game Commissioner Kristen Koppenhafer described the decision to expand hunting to 13 Sundays as a “big” and “calculated, very strategic step,” and an effort in “making sure that we do this the right way.”
“I think what’s important to me, as a commissioner and also as a hunter, is that those are 13 consecutive Sundays,” Koppenhafer said. “So, hopefully it minimizes confusion for when hunting is allowed on Sundays.”
Farming organizations backed the effort to repeal the ban, believing that it can help reduce crop damage by better managing deer population.
Groups and others who were opposed the effort included some hiking and environmental organizations who are concerned that the additional days for hunting will keep non-hunters out of the woods in Pennsylvania.
The Game Commission noted that firearms deer season will still end on Saturday, Dec. 13.
“Many established hunting seasons will continue to close as scheduled on a Saturday,” the Game Commission wrote in a press release. “Sundays must fall between the established opening and closing days of a season to be open to hunting.”

In January, the Game Commission Board will begin the process of setting the 2026-27 hunting seasons.
“Let’s do it in a way that’s meaningful and at the same time, let’s look ahead to next year and say, ‘is this the framework that we want to continue with? Is there opportunity to expand it, or do we need to throttle it back?,” Koppenhafer said.
“For the side of the aisle that says, ‘Let’s go 52 weeks a year, full throttle,’ just respectfully asking you to pump your brakes a little bit,” Koppenhafer added. “And for those that say, ‘Man, I don’t like Sunday hunting, and I don’t think there’s any room for it,’ for them to understand it, that we hear them too, and we’re taking a soft, calculated approach and making sure that we do this the right way.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Salt Lake City School Board member who prosecutors say tried to bribe his political opponent last year has agreed to resign as part of a plea agreement. 
Mohamed Baayd, 49, won his election as the incumbent candidate for the district’s Precinct 5 in November 2024 — but that following December, he was charged with bribery in elections, a third-degree felony, stemming from accusations that he tried to get his opponent, Russell Askren, to drop out of the race in exchange for favors. 
On July 22, Baayd agreed to a deal that included submitting his letter of resignation to the Salt Lake City School Board, effective no later than Aug. 5, according to a plea in abeyance agreement filed in 3rd District Court.

A plea in abeyance typically means an accused person will plead not guilty or no contest, and will be given conditions to adhere to in exchange for charges being dropped. Baayd’s agreement requires him to pay $1,000 within three months and remain “law-abiding” for six months — after that, the state will move to dismiss the charge. 
Although Baayd was initially charged with a felony, his charges were amended this month to a class B misdemeanor as part of his plea agreement. 
Baayd did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. In a text message in December after charges were filed, he declined to comment on the case but did tell Utah News Dispatch: “I’m an innocent man, and am entitled to the presumption of innocence under the constitution, and I look forward to my day in court and to continuing to serve the community to the best of my ability.”

According to court documents, Baayd met with Askren, his opponent, in March 2024. During the meeting, “Baayd told Mr. Askren that he knew a councilmember position was going to open in two years and that he was planning to run and had a very good chance of winning. Baayd stated that it was important for him to remain in his current position and asked Mr. Askren to withdraw from the election and allow Baayd to be re-elected,” the charging documents read. 
If Askren withdrew from the race, Baayd said for the next two years he would involve him “in the work of the board and make sure he got to know all of the members of the board and the district superintendent,” the court documents read. “Baayd explained that if he won the councilmember position, he would advocate for Mr. Askren and recommend to the board that they appoint him as a replacement. … Baayd further explained that Mr. Askren would complete the last two years of Baayd’s seat and then be able to run as incumbent in 2028.” 
Baayd told Askren that he wanted an answer by the end of the week, according to court documents, but Askren declined and ultimately ran against Baayd. The two men were the only candidates on the ballot, and Baayd won with 64.2% of the vote compared to Askren’s 35.78%.

Each July, our community observes Disability Pride Month. It’s a time to celebrate our experiences and show the world how people with disabilities move through and experience that world in a variety of different ways and that we live rich and rewarding lives that have value.
We also celebrate the many wins in the disability rights movement with a special emphasis on the Americans with Disabilities Act. Signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on July 26, 1990, the ADA was a major turning point for disability rights that propelled our movement forward.
As part of this year’s Disability Pride Celebration, we have partnered with select public libraries across Michigan to host special ADA pop-up displays. Library visitors can explore a powerful visual timeline of the disability rights movement, learn about influential leaders in the disability community, and discover the impact the ADA has had on the lives of millions. As we said, we have much to celebrate!

Unfortunately, today’s political machinations seem intent to not just stop our momentum, but to push us backwards: drastically cutting Medicaid and implementing arduous requirements, attacking DEI (which, of course, includes people with disabilities) as if diversity, equity, and inclusion are four-letter words, shuttering the Administration for Community Living, the uncertainty around the funding for students with disabilities, a Health and Human Services Department at odds with vaccinations. It is against this backdrop that we observe Disability Pride Month in 2025.
While this is a frustrating and painful time, it is important to remember that we are not in completely uncharted territory. Before its passage, the ADA had the support of voters across the country, but it was not without its detractors. Business groups opposed it, saying it cost too much and would harm businesses, especially small businesses. Greyhound Bus Lines claimed it would destroy public transportation. Evangelical Christian groups opposed it because they did not want people with HIV/AIDS protected by the ADA.  And yet, despite that opposition, we prevailed. And we will prevail again.
The ADA did not solve every issue of accessibility, discrimination, or stigma. There will always be work to do when it comes to protecting and expanding our rights. One of the ways we do that is by telling our stories and being clear about what we need, especially to people in positions of power. In fact, we have an easy way for members of the disability community and allies to communicate with elected leaders about crucial needs: affordable and accessible housing, accessible transportation, and access to mental health care. We must make ourselves heard.
We will not stop fighting for our right to live, our right to be fully included members of society, and our right to the accommodations we need to do so.
We will also not stop celebrating. In the face of adversity, celebration is an act of resistance. It’s a way for people with disabilities to show that we are not weak, we are not defeated, and we are not going away.

Act 624 of 2025 would have banned pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026. PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers.
Four PBMs, including the three largest in the nation, and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) filed four challenges to Act 624 between May and June. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas combined the four complaints into one case.
Both sides presented their arguments to U.S. District Judge Brian Miller on Wednesday. In Monday’s 17-page order, Miller granted the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, and the case is expected to go to trial.
Miller agreed with the plaintiffs’ attorneys that Act 624 violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because it “appears to overtly discriminate against plaintiffs as out of state companies and the state has failed to show that it has no other means to advance its interests,” he wrote.

Act 624 preliminary injunction 
“This is true because section one of Act 624 specifically states that its purpose is to eliminate plaintiffs’ ‘business tactics that have driven locally-operated pharmacies out of business,’” Miller wrote. “…Although the state argues that it is merely targeting a form of business structure, this appears to only be a half-truth because the statute discloses that the state is also attempting to protect “locally-operated pharmacies” as opposed to just consumers and non-PBM affiliated pharmacies, including out of state non-PBM affiliated pharmacies like Walgreens.”
Miller called Act 624 Arkansas’ “latest and most aggressive” attempt to regulate PBMs in recent years. Act 900 of 2015 required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs, and two 2018 laws prohibited PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their locally owned competitors. An additional statute prohibits PBMs from excluding a pharmacy from a health benefit plan if the pharmacy “is willing to accept the health benefit plan’s operating terms and conditions.”
Lawmakers, state insurance department officials, independent pharmacists and the Arkansas Pharmacists’ Association have repeatedly claimed that PBMs routinely violate Act 900 and the 2018 statutes, creating a struggle for independent pharmacies in rural areas to remain operational.
However, “based on the evidence in the record, it appears that these laws are sufficient for the state to achieve its stated purposes of curtailing plaintiffs’ business tactics and minimizing the conflicts of interest inherent in PBM-affiliated pharmacies,” Miller wrote.
He also agreed with plaintiff Express Scripts’ claim that Act 624 impedes its mail-order pharmacy’s requirement to provide prescription medication to members of the military, their families and veterans in Arkansas. ESI Mail Pharmacy Inc. is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.
Act 624 allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Daniel Volchok, Express Scripts’ attorney, said last week that this provision is insufficient because it covers only a “subset” of medications approved by the Department of Defense for Tricare participants.
The plaintiffs’ attorneys made several other arguments for an injunction that Miller said did not have merit. In one such argument, an attorney for OptumRx, one of the three largest PBMs along with Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, argued that Act 624 violates the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Portions of Iowa’s pharmacy benefit manager law blocked as lawsuit advances

The law, known as ERISA, sets certain standards for employee benefit plans, but Act 624 “does not regulate PBMs in their capacity as employee benefit plan administrators” and instead simply regulates pharmacy licensure, Miller wrote.
An Iowa law meant to regulate PBMs was partially blocked in federal court last week because its mandates of certain cost-sharing arrangements between pharmacies and PBMs potentially violated ERISA, according to the judge’s ruling. Similarly to Arkansas, supporters of the new Iowa law said it would help rural and small pharmacies remain in business.
Miller also rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that Act 624 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder, meaning it imposes a legislative punishment without due process. He said the law does not name specific plaintiffs even though it targets “a very narrow group.”
“While Act 624 is tainted by its protectionist rhetoric so much as to render it unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, it was not enacted in a wholly arbitrary manner,” Miller wrote.
CVS Health, which includes plaintiff CVS Caremark, expressed opposition to Act 624 during this year’s legislative session and said the law would force the company’s 23 Arkansas pharmacies to close.
In a statement Monday, CVS Health praised Miller’s ruling and said it is “actively looking to work together with the state to reduce drug prices and ensure access to pharmacies.”

Dr. King believed in a nation that could transform from the inside out. So the choice remains as urgent now as it was then.
The post The arc still has time to bend  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. did not arrive late to the anti-war movement. He was there before the headlines called him “divisive,” before his friends whispered that he’d gone too far, before even the movement he helped birth began to turn away.  
Long before all that, Dr. King stood before the nation and declared that the choice before us was not simply moral, it was existential: “It is either nonviolence or nonexistence.” This was not the language of political convenience. It was the language of a man who understood that the architecture of American power, its bombs, its bases, its brutal indifference, was not confined to foreign jungles. It echoed in the segregated streets of Birmingham, in the poverty-choked tenements of Chicago, in the deafening silence of a government more committed to empire than to equity. 
In recent weeks, almost six decades later, the country stared down the barrel of another global disaster of a war with the military strikes against Iran. Though a fragile ceasefire now holds, the world watched as violence again erupted, underscoring how unresolved conflict continues to reverberate across borders and within us. 
The names of the countries may be unrelated, the locations may be different, but the logic remains the same. America is once again entangled in a region already hemorrhaging from too much history and too little justice. Our drones hum where helicopters once thundered. Our sanctions choke where napalm once seared. And still, we claim the role of peacekeeper, broker, reluctant warrior. 
We must be honest about the moral duplicity here. This is a nation that lectures the world on freedom while banning books that teach its children about the actual cost of freedom. A nation that funds bombs abroad while defunding equity at home. A nation that speaks of democracy in foreign tongues but forgets how to pronounce it in places like Ferguson, Flint, or Florida. 
This is not merely a contradiction; it is a collapse. Because while America projects its might overseas, it wages a quieter war here at home. A war on memory. A war on truth. A war on justice itself.   
The recent passage of the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act deepens the moral fault lines Dr. King warned us about. 
Signed on July 4, the bill amounts to a sweeping rollback of civil rights protections masquerading as legislative reform—codifying indifference at the highest level. It slashes over $1 trillion from Medicaid, imposes strict work requirements on SNAP recipients up to age 64, and phases out clean energy credits, while simultaneously funneling historic levels of funding into ICE enforcement and military expansion.  
It also dismantles key equity safeguards, including the rescission of Executive Order 11246, which had long mandated affirmative action for federal contractors. These are not abstract policy shifts; they are material assaults on the health, agency, and future of marginalized communities. And make no mistake—when the rights and resources of the most vulnerable are eroded, the whole of society fractures. The assault on some of us destabilizes all of us, deepening distrust, weakening democracy, and shrinking the moral imagination of the nation.  
Just as Dr. King confronted a government that prioritized military aggression abroad over dignity at home, we now face a federal agenda that elevates cultural backlash over civil rights and silences the most vulnerable under the guise of national renewal. As King warned, “justice too long delayed is justice denied.” The challenge now is whether we will be a nation of memory and accountability—or one of erasure and retreat. 
Somewhere deep in the midst of this turmoil, America’s greatness might still be found.  
We can find the capacity to face ourselves and to confront our contradictions with determination. We are a nation that celebrates not one, but two Independence Days with July 4th and Juneteenth—one born in revolution, the other in reckoning. One declares freedom, the other proves it incomplete. 
These two celebrations aren’t contradictions. They’re a mirror. They show us the whole story of who we’ve been and point toward who we still can become. They remind us that the American promise was never finished work, but something we shape with every act of courage, every step toward justice. A nation capable of forgiving itself by not forgetting, but by remembering more honestly, telling the full story, and making whole what was broken. 
This is how we show the world what democracy looks like, not in our military might, but in our moral courage, not in our slogans, but in our willingness to build a country that keeps its promises. We can exercise our First Amendment right “to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances” — nonviolent resistance works if we look across time and the globe.  
On the eve of our country’s 250th birthday, we can show the world that equity is not an afterthought, but an engine proving that shared prosperity outperforms 246 years of chattel slavery. Boston certainly can do this, with the myriad stories told through the many initiatives established to mark the anniversary: Everyone250, Boston250, MA250, and Revolution250.  
Dr. King saw that possibility. He believed in a nation that could transform from the inside out. So the choice remains as urgent now as it was then. Not between nostalgia and progress, but between conscience and complicity. Between myth and memory. Between nonviolence and nonexistence. 
And between the country we are, and the country we still have time to become.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The outcome of a legislative ethics subcommittee hearing last week over allegations of harassment against a high-ranking senator remained secret Monday, and it’s anyone’s guess when that information will come to light.
A Legislative Council Service employee accused New Mexico Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) of calling her “stupid” and shouting at her following a dispute during the legislative session earlier this year. But because of a carveout in New Mexico’s transparency law, the accused, the alleged victim and the public are left in the dark about the committee’s findings after an hours-long hearing Friday, including any decision if Stewart’s behavior amounted to “harassment” under the Legislature’s anti-harassment policy.
Amanda Lavin, legal director at the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government, told Source NM on Monday that the Interim Ethics Committee’s Hearing Subcommittee is not legally required to make its decision in public. An exemption in the New Mexico Open Meetings Act (OMA) applies, in part, to “matters relating to personnel or matters adjudicatory in nature or to investigative or quasi-judicial proceedings relating to ethics.”
Lavin said while OMA requires committee work on public business to be conducted in the open, meetings about investigative proceedings related to ethics and conduct may be closed to the public.
“There is no requirement under OMA that a legislative committee make its final vote in public, unlike OMA’s requirements for any other public body,” Lavin said in a statement.
The matter stems from a complaint filed by legislative staffer Michelle Jaschke over an alleged incident involving Stewart on Feb. 27, according to a summary of the investigation given during the hearing. Jaschke did not respond to an email Monday seeking comment.
Former New Mexico Supreme Court Justice Richard Bosson, who chaired the subcommittee, said during the hearing Friday afternoon that the panel would issue a written, formal order “in the near future, which will be public, in due course.”
Ethics subcommittee considers harassment allegation against Sen. Mimi Stewart

The subcommittee went into closed session and deliberated for more than an hour-and-a-half. 
The purpose of Friday’s hearing was to make a recommendation to the Senate Ethics Committee, Bosson said. Since the complaint involves a member of the Senate, the Hearing Subcommittee’s recommendation goes next to “the appropriate standing committee,” according to the Legislature’s rules. In this case, that is the Senate Ethics Committee, Casebier said.
According to the Senate’s own rules, the president pro tempore is supposed to chair the Senate Ethics Committee. But since Stewart is the subject of the complaint, the rules require Senate Majority Floor Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) to appoint a substitute from Stewart’s political party.
Interim Ethics Committee Co-Chair Sen. Liz Stefanics (D-Cerillos) said the Legislature is handling the matter now because it took time for employment and labor lawyer Lorna Wiggins, who served as special counsel for the Ethics Committee’s investigative subcommittee, to interview the people involved.

Legislative Council Service Director Shawna Casebier told Source in an email that Wiggins’ investigative report “is confidential and has not been released to the public.” “The decision of the hearing subcommittee will be made public once finalized,” Casebier said.
Stewart told Source in a text message Monday morning she had not received the subcommittee’s recommendation.
Source on Monday filed a records request for the report. A records custodian wrote in an email that they would respond by Aug. 12.

(Photo by Izzy Wagener/Minnesota Reformer)One of the strongest data protection laws in the country will go in effect on July 31. 
The Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act creates new protections for the personal data of Minnesotans, which includes anything from a person’s name to their search history. 
Under the law, Minnesotans will have a right to know what data a business has collected and a list of any third parties that their data has been sold to. Consumers can edit inaccuracies in collected data, ask a business to delete information and opt-out of a business selling or using targeted advertising with the data. Parental permission is required for businesses to sell or use data for advertising to children under 16. 
“We cannot and should not just think that violations and invasions of our privacy are just the way it is in this modern time. We have a right to our privacy, and we have to protect it,” Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a press conference.  
The law is expected to crack down on data brokers that store and sell personal information. Small businesses are exempt.
Rep. Steve Elkins, DFL-Bloomington, authored the bill. He said he has been working on data privacy legislation since 2019, his first year in office. The bill received bipartisan support in committee and was signed into law in May 2024. As the 19th state to pass a data protection law, Minnesota took inspiration from many other states’ versions. 
The law protects against what’s called data profiling and automated decision making. Minnesotans can now opt-out of profiling — the use of personal data to evaluate or predict someone’s behavior — when it comes to significant issues like housing or employment. 
The Attorney General’s Office will be hiring attorneys and an investigator to enforce the law. A new website — privacymn.com — will provide information on the new protections to consumers and businesses. Consumers can file complaints with Ellison’s office to aid enforcement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0833-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-28 19:56:58.938781

Getty Images. Parents trying to overturn a Washington law protecting runaway transgender youth have hit another roadblock in federal court.
A three-judge appeals court panel on Friday unanimously dismissed a constitutional challenge to the controversial 2023 statute, which allows operators of emergency shelters to notify state authorities, rather than parents, when children seek refuge as they pursue gender-affirming care and support services.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld a lower court ruling that concluded those challenging the law lacked legal standing to sue because they could not prove they suffered actual or imminent harm from the statute. The plaintiffs who brought the case included several parents whose teenage children exhibited signs of gender dysphoria, but were not runaways, and two nonprofits that oppose gender-affirming care for children.
In a statement, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown’s office said, “We are pleased that the court saw through this politicized attempt to create a case where none existed.”
America First Legal Foundation, counsel for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The conservative legal organization was founded by Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for President Donald Trump.
State law calls for parents to be notified within 72 hours of their child’s arrival at an emergency shelter unless there are “compelling reasons” not to do so. If there are signs of abuse or neglect, for example, shelter staff are to inform the state Department of Children, Youth and Families, which would take the lead on reaching out to parents.
The court fight is over Senate Bill 5599, which expanded the list of compelling reasons to cover situations when a young person feels they could be subject to abuse or neglect because they are pursuing gender-affirming care or reproductive health services. The law’s passage incensed conservatives, who said it was an attack on parental rights.
America First Legal Foundation sued in August 2023, days after opponents of the law failed to gather enough signatures to get a referendum on the ballot.
The lawsuit argued the statute “deprives certain parents—but not all parents—of their fundamental right under the U.S. Constitution to direct the care and upbringing of their children, as well as their rights to the free exercise of religion, due process, free speech, and equal protection.” 
Miller, in a statement issued at the time the suit was filed, said his group was “leading the courtroom charge against radical transgenderism and the sexual exploitation of our children by militant gender activists.” He added: “No state action more frighteningly illustrates the threat to our children than this law.”
International Partners for Ethical Care, Inc. and Advocates Protecting Children joined the parents as plaintiffs.
After the state responded that the plaintiffs lacked standing, America First Legal amended its complaint to broaden the original challenge. That didn’t work.
In May 2024, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Bryan dismissed the suit, citing the plaintiffs’ lack of standing. 
The 9th Circuit Court panel of judges agreed. Judge Milan D. Smith, Jr., a 2006 appointee of President George W. Bush, authored Friday’s appellate decision. Circuit Judges Sidney R.

It was the word echoed by transit advocates and bus riders outside a Providence union hall and again inside a fourth-floor lecture hall at the Community College of Rhode Island’s Warwick campus, as they urged state leaders to find the money necessary to avoid sweeping service cuts being proposed by the state’s bus network.
But it’s unlikely those calls will be answered anytime soon by Gov. Dan McKee and legislative leaders, who still await final recommendations from a long-overdue efficiency study they asked of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority.
“Without reform, RIPTA will continue to face recurring budget shortfalls and remain on an unsustainable path,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current Monday afternoon.
That response came just a little over an hour after RIPTA finished the first of 12 public hearings on its plans to cut or reduce 58 of its 67 routes to make up a $10 million budget deficit — the largest service reduction in the agency’s 59-year history.
Altogether, RIPTA plans to eliminate 17 routes — a combination of 11 routes and zones where riders book trips in advance, along with half a dozen park and ride connections. Should the agency’s board of directors move forward with the recommendations, cuts would take effect Sept.13.
Outside the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 618 hall in Providence an hour before the public hearing, Liza Burkin of the Save RIPTA coalition said the agency’s plan would effectively shrink a statewide bus system into one focused on metro Providence — with some coverage in Newport.
“This proposal before us is not rightsizing RIPTA, it is decimating our public transportation system,” Burkin said. “Make no mistake, if these cuts go through, workers will lose their jobs, students will not get to class, older adults will not be able to get to the doctor or get groceries.”
That fear of job insecurity is certainly real for Jessica Jameson of Warwick, who told RIPTA administrators at the CCRI public hearing that she relies on the Route 29 bus to get to her job at the Warwick Mall — a route that would no longer run on weekends.
“The security of my employment depends on my availability to work on weekends,” she said. “If all weekend service on this route is suspended, I will likely lose my job.”
Rhode Island AFL-CIO Patrick Crowley, who sits on RIPTA’s board of directors, said at the union rally that the proposed cuts were effectively a “tax increase on working-class Rhode Islanders.”
But Crowley has yet to say that directly to McKee, he told reporters afterward. He said he anticipates a discussion with the governor will happen before the board holds a special meeting to approve the cuts on Aug. 8.
The agitation of transit riders has at least reached McKee’s office, his spokesperson confirmed Monday.
“Constituent Services has experienced an uptick in RIPTA-related calls,” DaRocha said in an email. “Approximately one dozen of them referenced changes to specific routes that would impact them; the majority of these changes were related to frequency of bus runs.”

A bumpy road ahead for transit riders 
Each of the nearly two dozen riders and advocates who attended Monday’s hearing at the community college lamented the incoming cuts, but did not place the blame on RIPTA.
“This is nothing against you,” Devin Guirales of Central Falls said from his wheelchair. “We know it’s all because of the budget deficit that our governor and state has handed the agency.”
In January, McKee’s recommended fiscal 2026 state budget left a $32.6 million crater in RIPTA’s budget. The General Assembly eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase on the state’s gas tax and by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account.
RIPTA administrators managed to reduce the shortfall to $10 million, thanks to what RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand called a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan. 
Durand told reporters after the Warwick hearing that the agency is still looking for additional ways to reduce service cuts, but said there are very few options.
“The gap is so big,” he said. “To get the kind of savings necessary to balance the budget, it’s cutting a lot of service.”
But Burkin and other advocates say it isn’t too late for state leaders to infuse RIPTA with  much-needed cash.
One idea is for the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) to shift part of the $35 million federal carbon reduction funds toward mass transit. Another would be to reroute state transportation funds from highway projects to bus service.
But RIDOT director Peter Alviti Jr., who heads RIPTA’s board of directors, does not intend to redirect any of the department’s funding.
“In accordance with the mission provided by the governor and legislature to make RITPA more efficient and right size the agency, RIPTA’s administration will be making an assessment of all options that are available to meet that mission,” Alviti said in a statement.

No immediate legislative fix
It also looks unlikely that the General Assembly will shore up RIPTA’s finances by reconvening in the fall for a special legislative session. 
In separate statements, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson both pointed to the spending solutions already in place in the fiscal 2026 budget. Any additional help could depend on the still-to-be-completed efficiency study.
Although portions of the study were made public in the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session, a final report has yet to be released.
A June 16 draft memo from the study suggested reallocating resources away from bus service in rural communities with low ridership to more populated low-income areas, along with more service for Providence residents who commute to jobs outside of the city. 
It also recommended the agency increase its $2-per-ride fare, which has been in place since 2010, but administrators have said they want to conduct a study to analyze impacts of a potential fare increase on “ridership, revenue, and equity.”
“It is not reasonable to commit additional funds until RIPTA completes this study and its current public hearing process in order to develop a plan for a better public transit model,” Shekarchi said in a statement.
 Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat who sponsored a failed resolution to fully fund the agency this year, argued at the union press conference that RIPTA is already run efficiently. He added that the state also finds ways to find financial solutions for local businesses, citing the quick tax code change in 2024 to keep Citizens Bank from moving out-of-state.
“If we come up with that, we ought to come up with funding here,” he said.

July 24, 2025 | Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe Republican sponsor behind the Michigan House of Representatives’ plan to ban cell phones in all K-12 schools said Monday that he is going back to the drawing board to rewrite the legislation – which died on the chamber’s floor last week.
Democratic lawmakers and some members of the GOP House caucus coalesced to defeat the bill July 24 after initial bipartisan support. The measure was even floated by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in her annual State of the State address earlier this year, showing a statewide appetite to ban phones in schools.
State Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester) sponsored House Bill 4141, which would have prohibited cell phone use in schools during instructional hours only. The 53-43 vote on the House floor last Thursday saw nearly every House Democrat voting against the measure.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXIn an interview with Michigan Advance on Monday, Tisdel said that he plans to rewrite the bill before reintroducing it – this time with a strict bell-to-bell prohibition on cellular or wireless devices in K-12 schools. 
The new bill will be based on New York state’s pending bell-to-bell cell phone ban, mandating that devices must not be used for the entire school day. All public school districts there are required to publish new distraction-free cell phone use policies by Aug. 1.
Whitmer in February floated the idea of bringing a school cell phone ban to Michigan, but Tisdel said he has been working on the House’s version since 2023. A lot of that work sought to incorporate input from both sides of the aisle in the House and Senate and other stakeholders.
 With the pending rewrite, Tisdel told the Advance that he was done with the “Mr. Nice Guy stuff.”
“We had it put together, incorporating the best language from all sides … and [House Democrats] played games,” Tisdel said. “If a Democratic legislature and a Democratic governor in New York, a very blue New York state, can see the value in a bell-to-bell prohibition in K-12, somehow that can’t work in Michigan? … If [Whitmer] wants a cell phone bill signed during her term, that’s what it’s going to be.”
Additional resources informing the rewrite include recommendations for the American Legislative Exchange Conference, the Manhattan Institute for Public Policy and Research and the Brookings Institution, Tisdel said.
The conservative, nonpartisan American Legislative Conference leans toward more conservative ideals like limited government, support for free markets and federalism.
The Manhattan Institute is generally perceived as a right-wing think tank, while the Brookings Institution is perceived to be more left-leaning.
Although he’s eying a strict bell-to-bell ban, Tisdel added that he would incorporate exemptions from federal law and would be open to allowances for “dumb” phone devices, like flip phones without broad and user-friendly access to the internet and social media applications.
“I don’t have a problem with that. That was in the last bill, and that was one of the concessions I put in,” Tisdel said. “When you’re using a flip phone, you make the phone call, you hang up, and you put the phone away, because there’s nothing else you can do with it. The problem with smartphones is you never put them away.”
Tisdel noted that he had good working relationships with two Democrats in crafting the original bill, including state Sen. Dayna Polehanki of Livonia and state Rep. Regina Weiss of Oak Park. 
Farhat ousted from key budget post amid GOP standoff and failed Michigan House votes

However, after the bill’s defeat, Tisdel blamed Democrats.
Tisdel said that some Democrats, like state Rep. Noah Arbit of West Bloomfield, publicly supported his legislation. Arbit told The Pulse on Fox 2 Detroit that he agreed with Tisdel that a ban was needed, that he supported the House legislation, championed it being passed by the Michigan Senate and then signed by Whitmer.
Arbit voted against the bill Thursday evening.
Tisdel said he received strong signals of support from Democrats in private conversations, and that he was working with some House Democrats on the legislation to make it a stronger bipartisan effort. He was also forging a deal with Polehanki to get it done in the Senate, even as the Senate was shopping its own school cell phone ban.
Tisdel was not alone in placing the blame on his Democratic colleagues: Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) echoed some of Tisdel’s talking points when speaking to the Michigan Capitol press corps following Thursday’s session.
A message seeking comment from a House Democratic caucus spokesperson regarding those criticisms, and the alleged broken deals, was not returned at the time of publication.
Several key Republicans who could have moved the measure over the finish line either voted against the bill or were absent from session.
Notably, Republican state Reps. Steve Carra of Three Rivers, James DeSana of Carleton, Jaime Greene of Richmond, David Martin of Davison and Pauline Wendzel of Watervliet were either absent or voted in opposition to House Bill 4141.
The Detroit News reported last week that DeSana was absent from Thursday’s session in protest of Hall not taking up his legislative priorities. Tisdel said he believed that DeSana would have been a likely yes vote.
Tisdel also noted that Martin had an executed absence last week.
Messages seeking comment from Carra, Greene and Wednezel were not returned at the time of publication.
When Tisdel was asked about those defections, he said the situation was unfortunate, but also represented just another day in Lansing with political games aplenty.
He was disappointed, however, in some of his more conservative colleagues who voted against the bill.
“It’s a 2-to-1 legislative layout, the governor and the [Democratic-controlled] Senate against us,” Tisdel said. “We don’t need any barrels inside the caucus pointing at us, as well. It’s just frustrating. I don’t know how this perception got to be that some of these individuals who vote no all the time are the most conservative members. They’re simply enablers.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0123-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 19:56:58.938781

Governor's Office)On a four-day tour of Germany, South Carolina officials met with industry leaders to tout the Palmetto State’s business-friendly reputation and celebrated 50 years of economic development operations in Europe, a feat that has roots in the state’s once massive textile industry.
Gov. Henry McMaster, joined by the heads of state agencies that oversee economic development, taxes, employment and the technical college system, toured the offices of foreign companies with operations in the Palmetto State.
Stops during their visit included manufacturing automation company Siemens, which operates in Spartanburg; vehicle parts makers Schaeffler (in Fort Mill), and Bosch (in Charleston); medical equipment manufacturer Arthrex (in Pendleton), and Mercedes Benz parent company Daimler, which builds vans in North Charleston.
Along the way, officials also held “confidential economic development meetings” with companies the state hopes to bring to South Carolina, according to Alex Clark, spokeswoman for the state Commerce Department. She declined to give any details.
The governor made similar business calls when he traveled to Germany in June 2024 for a different industry conference, according to Commerce. That trip netted wood paneling manufacturer Homanit, which in May this year announced it would invest $250 million and hire 300 people in Clarendon County.
Wood paneling manufacturer pledges $250M investment, 300 jobs in rural SC

But this year, the governor’s entourage was much larger, and the trip was about seven times more expensive, with an expected cost of $155,000. The estimate includes hotels, flights, and a banquet. (That compares to $22,000 last year.)
On the final day, the governor addressed some 300 industry and government leaders at the German Chamber of Commerce-German American Business Forum lunch, where he was joined by Senate President Thomas Alexander of Walhalla and House Speaker Murrell Smith of Sumter.
“What we have between you and us is like a marriage. We’ve been working together for so long, making accommodations here and there,” McMaster told attendees of Thursday’s lunch. “And a 50-year marriage, that’s a pretty good run.”
He hinted at turmoil over tariffs without ever saying the word.
“I know there’s uncertainty in a lot of things right now, but it’ll settle down,” McMaster said days before the Trump administration and leaders of the European Union announced an agreement on tariffs.
“I believe that our country is opening up for a burst of economic progress unlike any that we have ever seen,” McMaster added. “And I want you to remember, if you want to do business in South Carolina, the answer to every question is ‘yes.'”
The trip concluded hours later with an anniversary dinner celebrating South Carolina’s 50 years of manning an office in Europe. The delegation flew home Friday.
A history in Europe
South Carolina’s European office opened in 1975 in Belgium, marking the state’s first international presence as leaders sought to attract investment from European companies. The state later moved the office — first to Frankfurt in the 1980s and then Munich, where it is today, in 1999.
It’s an effort that at least one historian says has roots in the Upstate’s textile industry.
In the 1950s, textile giant Roger Milliken, having moved large parts of his operations to Spartanburg, experienced firsthand the American textile industry’s dependence on Swiss and German machinery. He set about convincing these companies to set up shops in the Upstate, according to historian Marko Maunula, who teaches at Clayton State University in Georgia and has written for the University of South Carolina’s Institute for Southern Studies.
How SC’s once-dominating textile industry has transformed to supply new employers

Within a decade, two companies — Rieter and Sulzer — opened American headquarters in Spartanburg. Karl Menzel Maschinenfabrik joined the pack in 1965.
The late Richard Tukey, Spartanburg’s Chamber of Commerce CEO at the time, witnessed these investments and sought to build on that momentum, rallying the business community to recruit German-headquartered Hoechst to build a polyester fiber facility that opened in 1967, Maunula said.
That same year, Tukey flew with Lt. Gov. John West to Basel, Switzerland, to invite the International Textile Machinery Association to hold its next annual convention in Greenville. On the flight home, West has drawn in by Tukey’s strategy, according to a letter he wrote in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal. Returning to Columbia, West sought to implement the strategy statewide.
West and Gov. Robert McNair led a 15-member delegation on a three-week, five-country European recruitment tour in September 1969. South Carolina’s sales pitch included low unionization rates, cheap land and tax breaks.
West went on to make international recruitment a part of his campaign during his successful bid for governor in 1970. A year later, West and Tukey touted the idea at the first Southern Governors’ Conference in 1971, according to the former governor’s letter. (It was under West’s administration — four years later — that South Carolina’s Europe office opened.)
Around the same time, former President Richard Nixon, facing looming inflation, ended the Gold Standard in the United States. This devalued the dollar. Coupled with a 10% surcharge on imports into the U.S., foreign companies began opening U.S. operations, according to Maunula.
Foreign investment in SC
By 1973, Spartanburg County alone was home to 24 foreign corporations employing 4,000 workers.
The strategy got the attention of Georgia, which under then-Gov. Jimmy Carter went on to open offices in Japan and Europe in 1973, two years before South Carolina’s entrance into Brussels.
The opening of South Carolina’s European office coincided with France-headquartered tire manufacturer Michelin beginning operations in the Palmetto State. In the years since, Michelin has expanded multiple times, with 15 facilities across the state, and moved its North American headquarters from New York to South Carolina.
Foreign investment continued with several more European firms, including Swiss electrical equipment manufacturer ABB opening a location in Florence in 1979 and Swiss food maker Nestle coming to Gaffney in 1980, according to the Commerce Department. In 1988, the state saw German companies including chemical maker BASF and clothing maker Adidas, as well as Swiss appliance maker Electrolux. All still operate in the state.
But it would take nearly two decades more before the arrival of BMW and South Carolina beginning its transition into the manufacturing powerhouse it is today.
Since 2011, European companies have invested $16.3 billion in South Carolina manufacturing plants with more than 35,400 jobs, according to the Commerce Department. On a global scale, foreign companies account for 10% of the state’s total private employment numbers.
Today, South Carolina has five international offices: Munich; London; Tokyo; Seoul, South Korea; and Taipei, Taiwan. The state closed offices in China and India in 2023, after 18 years and nine years, respectively. The state also closed several offices in Canada.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-28-at-5.31.42 PM.jpg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

The manufacturing industry in Montana hit a growth milestone in Lewistown this month but experienced a closure in Bonner that leaves an estimated 100 employees without a job.
Friday, a vacuum technology company based in Germany opened its new U.S. location in Lewistown.
VACOM drew praise from Montana politicians including Gov. Greg Gianforte, whose office said the new facility represents a $10 million investment in central Montana.
VACOM describes itself as one of the leading European suppliers of vacuum technology.
It also offers cleaning services for components for the semiconductor, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In those sectors, even tiny contaminants can compromise performance.
In a statement, Gianforte said VACOM, which employs 400 people, “saw something special in central Montana.”
“When companies choose Montana, they’re choosing more than just a place on a map, they’re choosing a state and a pro-business environment that supports job creators and the hardworking Montanans they employ,” said Gianforte, a Republican, in a news release.
Former state Sen. Dan Bartel said VACOM currently employs roughly 12 people in the cleaning sector alone in Lewistown and may hit 25 employees there by the end of the year.
The Governor’s Office said VACOM expects to create as many as 500 “good-paying” Montana jobs and up to 50 “high-tech” jobs by 2027.
The Governor’s Office did not respond to a question about salary ranges or a timeline for expanding the workforce, and representatives for VACOM could not be reached in time for this story.
VACOM has planned an estimated $90 million investment in the state by 2030, according to the news release from the Governor’s Office.
However, on Monday, UFP Industries announced to employees the closure of its UFP Edge facility in Bonner along with an estimated 100 layoffs.
“This is not an easy decision,” said spokesperson Abby Mitch in an email. “We wish this facility had worked out.
“Montanans’ grit and perseverance are among our core values at UFP Industries. We spent 5 years working together to make it work, but big-picture realities beyond our control made consolidation unavoidable.”
UFP Edge described itself as a leader in trim, siding and interior accents and one of the top building materials manufacturers in North America.
“We have committed to our Bonner employees that we will prioritize internal candidates for open positions across the UFP family of companies,” Mitch said in an email.
UFP operates in 215 locations in nine countries, according to its website.
It describes itself as North America’s largest buyer of softwood lumber and works in residential construction, retail building products and industrial packaging.
***
Bartel, who has been in communication with VACOM the last few years as it contemplated locations in the U.S., said VACOM cleans the chips in cellphones as part of its work.
He said Lewistown won the relocation debate for its people, environment and lifestyle.
The VACOM facility was expected to be 40,000 square feet and include a daycare for employees’ children and an education center for staff training.
“They believe that the workforce is here, and it’s the right type of people that they can educate to operate these new high-tech machines,” said Bartel, a Republican and retired Lewistown legislator.
He said the facility will join other small- and medium-sized manufacturing operations based in Lewistown.
“It’ll fit Lewistown really well, and we’re really tickled that they’re going to be here,” Bartel said.
In a news release about its opening, VACOM said it ventured across the Atlantic in 2020 when it opened its first U.S. location in Naples, Florida.
It said the Lewistown site “marks the next important milestone in meeting the growing demand from the U.S. semiconductor industry even better in the future.”
More than 100 people attended the official opening on Friday, VACOM said.
In a prepared statement, VACOM CEO Jens Bergner said the new location sends “a clear signal for long-term growth and transatlantic cooperation.”
“Our decision for Montana was an easy one: Not only have we found a business-friendly environment here, but above all, exceptional people with an impressive work ethic and a strong community.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Outlook-efs5am0p.png,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

(Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat, positioned himself as the champion of the underdog Monday when he announced his candidacy for governor before a crowd of supporters in Las Vegas. 
“I know what it’s like to feel like you’re pushing a rock up a hill in the fight for a better life. And families all across Nevada are feeling it, too,” he said. “It feels like the deck is stacked against them. And you know what? It is. I’m fighting for the kind of government that sees people like I was and says, ‘you matter.’” 
“I know what it’s like to struggle,” Ford said, adding that as children, he and his brother ate stale candy bars, scavenged by his father, a grocery store employee, from the discarded food where he worked. “We weren’t broken but we didn’t have much.”
Ford, a one-time public school teacher, attorney, and former state lawmaker, is serving his second term as attorney general. He has one primary challenger thus far in the gubernatorial contest – Washoe County Commission Chairwoman Alexis Hill, who has yet to formally announce her candidacy. 
Hill, in a statement to the Current, congratulated Ford “on being the Dem insiders’ choice. I look forward to engaging with Nevadans on concrete plans, real solutions and change when I formally announce for governor soon.” 
Ford has been endorsed thus far by U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez and Jacky Rosen, as well as U.S. Reps. Dina Titus and Steven Horsford, who both attended the announcement Monday, as well as fellow Democratic Rep. Susie Lee. 
The state Democratic Party does not endorse candidates in a primary election. 
“As the party chair, I’m happy when anyone gets in the race,” Assemblywoman Danielle Monroe-Moreno, who attended the event, told the Current. “If Alexis invites me, I’ll be there. I know Alexis. I love Alexis’ family.” 
The winner of the primary will likely face Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who is seeking a second term.
Monroe-Moreno identified the harm that will come to Nevadans as a result of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act as Lombardo’s greatest vulnerability.
Ford never mentioned his primary opponent and took aim directly at Lombardo, who he said “has been kowtowing” to Trump while Ford has been taking the administration to court. “I sued both Trump and the Biden administration. It doesn’t matter what side of the aisle you’re on. If someone hurts Nevada families, I’m not backing down.” 
Ford noted that Lombardo, when asked by a reporter about the impact of Trump’s tariffs, said Nevadans “‘may have to feel a little pain.’ Can you believe that our governor wants families to feel pain while he caters to the powerful? Well, thanks to Joe Lombardo and Donald Trump, there’s plenty of pain to go around.”
Ford criticized Lombardo for enlisting a Republican lawmaker to kill legislation that would have limited home buying by out-of-state corporations, whose purchases jack up the prices in Nevada neighborhoods. Under Lombardo’s watch, he added, Nevada has had the highest unemployment rate in the nation while job growth lags other states.   
“The governor said that we should be excited about Trump’s betrayal of a tax bill, excited that it’s going to blow a hole in our state budget; that it’s going to rip healthcare away from over 100,000 Nevadans; that two of our rural hospitals will have to close or to cut essential services,” Ford said. “Maybe we should be excited about slashing SNAP benefits for more than a half a million Nevadans to rely upon.” 
As the single father of an infant while in college, Ford says food stamps kept him and his young son “from going hungry.” 
Ford promised that if elected, he’ll bring prescription drug prices in line with Medicaid’s negotiated prices. He also vowed to hold corporations accountable for price fixing. Lombardo vetoed a bill this year championed by Ford that would have prohibited price-gouging for essential goods and services such as housing, pharmaceuticals, and energy. 
He also promised free school lunches for all Nevada students. 
Ford’s chances of defeating Lombardo could depend on whether Trump-weary voters galvanize during the midterm election next year to generate a blue wave in purple Nevada.
According to his campaign, in 2022, Ford won more votes than any candidate in Nevada midterm history, easily winning re-election in a race against Republican firebrand Sigal Chattah.
NBC News has labeled Lombardo as the most vulnerable Republican governor seeking reelection next year. The governor’s support for Trump’s deportation policies could erode his support among Latino voters, an essential voting bloc in the state.
“It’s breathtaking to see a candidate who speaks our language,” state Sen. Fabian Doñate said of Ford, who briefly addressed the crowd in Spanish.
Doñate, who has endorsed Ford, said he considered the wisdom of making a commitment at this early stage of the race, but says he likely would have heard from other interested candidates.
Ford, he said, “has always shown up for our community. He’s always had an open door for me.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/D00A70BE-9A10-4831-8006-43DCC56DF085-scaled-e1753742610596-1024x667.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

Steve Womack of Arkansas proposes more than $147 million in earmarks for transportation and water system improvements, along with other projects.
The bill, which proposes fiscal year 2026 spending appropriations for the U.S. Departments of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, has not yet been voted on by the full House of Representatives. The House is currently in recess and not set to return until after Labor Day.
A significant number of the proposed earmarks are for a variety of water system and infrastructure projects concentrated in Womack’s Northwest Arkansas district, with a handful of other projects in two of the state’s other congressional districts.
The city of Tontitown would receive $12.2 million to construct a gravity sanitary sewer system, according to a news release from Womack’s office.
Tontitown Mayor Angela Russell said in the release that the city was grateful to receive the funding. The new sewer system will enable the town to improve its infrastructure and support growth, she said.
“This project is a significant development for our community,” Russell said.
Northwest Arkansas has seen decades of rapid growth that has strained wastewater systems in the region, leading the Arkansas Department of Health to stop approving new residential development in some areas.
Mountainburg, a city in Crawford County, would receive $4.4 million for improvements to the North Central Crawford County water system — something Mayor Susan Wilson described as “a pipe dream” previously.
“Thanks to this funding, safe and clean drinking water will be available to more residents in our region than ever before,” Wilson said in the release.
The Arkansas Department of Transportation stands to be the biggest beneficiary of the earmarks, should they become law. The bill proposes $59 million for the Springdale Northern Bypass, plus several million for highways and planned future interstate projects.
ARDOT Director Jared Wiley said in a news release that Womack’s “tireless support” as the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies for the state’s road projects has been “instrumental in securing tens of millions in Community Project Funding” for projects in the state.
In total, at least $26 million will go toward various water and sewer projects in the state, should the appropriations bill pass. But such an amount would likely do little to dent a multibillion-dollar problem faced by Arkansas’ deteriorating water and wastewater systems. State legislators such as Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio, have warned that even the millions in funding appropriated to and by the state to address the problems facing systems thus far is a drop in the bucket compared to the vast need, which falls particularly hard on rural water systems that have fallen behind on upgrades and maintenance as population bases shrink and costs grow.
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2025 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure, Arkansas faces $7.7 billion in total needs for drinking water infrastructure, plus another $3.1 billion for wastewater infrastructure. Those numbers include anticipated investments and the projected funding gap.
Arkansas has made moves to address the problems, passing laws that require rate studies by water and wastewater systems and creating a new loan program for “shovel-ready” projects.
The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved $13.6 million in loans and grants at the end of May, with $7 million of that going to the city of Sherwood to rehabilitate parts of its wastewater system.
 The following projects to be funded in Arkansas’ Third District if the federal appropriations bill passes as-is 

Springdale Northern Bypass construction — $59 million
Future Interstate 49 construction — $3 million
Arkansas Highway 112 improvements — $3 million
Northeast Benton County Volunteer Fire Department fire station improvements — $1.25 million
Benton County Water District #1 PWA of Arkansas for water system improvements — $1.75 million
City of Elkins water system improvements — $3.75 million
City of Farmington bridge repairs — $6.5 million
City of Fort Smith water system improvements — $3 million
City of Huntsville water system improvements — $3 million
Mercy Hospital Berryville to establish an MRI unit — $1.376 million
City of Mountainburg water system improvements — $4.4 million
City of Mulberry to update the Mulberry Community Food Pantry — $500,000
City of Pea Ridge for a new fire station — $2.75 million
Springdale Water Utilities water system improvements — $3 million
City of Tontitown water system improvements — $12.2 million

After four months without a voucher, she may receive enough financial help to put her kids in a day care closer to home. She might be able to afford her own home for her family with the money saved.
After months of halted assistance and thousands of Mississippi parents losing their child care vouchers – and with it, their access to day care for their children — the state is issuing vouchers again.
Ford spent $11,000 on day care just over the last few months – and was forced to move in with in-laws.

“Giving up is not an option,” she said. “I would love the help. You have to be making money to survive in this economy.”
In April, Ford was denied a voucher renewal along with thousands of other families because she did not meet one of the six criteria the Mississippi Department of Human Service set. Those criteria were: being a recipient of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, being deployed in the military, being a guardian to a foster child, being homeless, being a parent of a special needs child and being a teen parent. 
For some families, these restrictions now no longer apply.
The pause to the pause, the result of the loss of coronavirus pandemic-era funding, was made possible by a direct legislative appropriation to the Child Care Payment Program administered by the department. The agency had asked for $40 million to continue serving the same number of families, but instead received $15 million.
This means, despite announcing that the agency is now taking applications from families on its waitlist, the program is not likely to be stabilized or capable of serving as many children as it did prior to the pause.
Carol Burnett, executive director of the Mississippi Low Income Child Care Initiative, speaks about a policy change by the Mississippi Department of Human Services, that removed a child support requirement for the Child Care Payment Program, at a news conference Monday, May 15, 2023, in Jackson, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)
“We’re going back to a time where I think we are going to see a waiting list reappear and the thing about the waitlist is if you’re on the waitlist, you don’t ever know how long you’re going to be there,” said Carol Burnett, director of the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, which has been advocating on behalf of child care supports for decades. “So it’s wonderful the pause is over and DHS has met whatever criteria they needed to eliminate the pause.”
The previous restrictions eliminated working parents that weren’t TANF recipients. For middle class parents forced to take on child care’s extra costs and fees this summer, leaving the wait list can mean financial security.
Vennesha Price’s biggest expense each month is child care, which includes the gas money needed to travel further for the care.
“For single, struggling parents or single parents that are considered middle class like myself, who do not meet certain low-income requirements, I’m just on my own whether I have the money or not,” she said.
Mississippi receives a little over $129 million through the federal block grant that primarily funds the program, the Child Care Development Fund, in 2024, an increase of about $31 million from 2020. Child care in Mississippi received a bump of more than $600 million during the pandemic, one way the state was able to increase the rolls in recent years.
The child care payment program has only ever served a fraction of eligible children – over 139,000 across the state, according to some estimates. 
In March before the pause began, more than 36,000 children received the voucher. The state currently serves just under 29,000 children, according to the agency.
In years past, the number of children on the rolls hovered around 20,000–in part because of a child support enforcement requirement that the agency rescinded in 2023. 
In 2017, during a notorious five-year period where the agency was approving no new vouchers, there were 21,000 children on the waitlist.
More children served
Through the mostly federally-funded voucher, the state pays up to 80% of a child’s tuition to a qualified provider, with the parent covering the rest. Every three years, the department is required to conduct a market rate survey to ensure its voucher reimbursement rate corresponds to the 75th percentile of the market rate for the different age groups.. 
Weekly rates increased from 2021 to 2024, with variations depending on whether the recipient is in a metro or nonmetro area and the age of the child, since infant care is more expensive. Infant care in the metro area increased from $152 to $185 per week while school- aged care increased from $130 to $135.
Considering these rates, the current annual value of the voucher for infants in a metro area is about $7,700 and $5,600 for school aged children. For nonmetro areas, the state spends about $5,800 and $5,000, respectively. 
The extra state support of $15 million, then, might support roughly 2,500 vouchers for the year, depending on the circumstances of the children who are approved, based on Mississippi Today’s calculations.
That’s only half of the roughly 5,000 children sitting on the waitlist for assistance, according to the agency.
“I’m hoping that it will provide more opportunity for parents,” said Kacheela Dixon, owner of Steppin Up Learning Center in Jackson, Mississippi. “If the parents do sign back up with the vouchers, it will help hire more teachers and pay for more food.”
Dixon might still have to shut her business down in the next couple months unless enrollment increases. The cost of running her business has increased, too. Many of the children rely on her day care for supper.
For day care operator Sherica Lewis, the halt to the freeze might come too late.
She serves less than half the children she did before the child care freeze. She’s had two families with at least three children move to Southaven and Louisiana from Greenville, where her business is based. 
“It’s not going to benefit me as much,” she said. “I already lost the kids and families.”
The families moved to be closer to their extended family that can provide free child care. 
The Department of Human Sservices is also currently accepting proposals for workforce support subgrants under the TANF program that could include child care services.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.














What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health. 


– – Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF





Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

Members of the Lapeer District Library Board agreed to move their regular meeting time at its most recent meeting, from 5:30 p.m. to 10 a.m. on the third Thursday of each month. 
The move has been viewed by some as a way to prevent community members from fighting against a rash of book challenges that began in 2023 and following the election of several members with conservative ideologies, who have come to hold a majority of seats on the nonpartisan board. Some of those members have ties to the book challenges in question.
The board first proposed the idea of changing its meeting location and time during its June meeting, with board member Carol Brown noting she is frequently late to a meeting she has scheduled after the library board meetings. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXVice Chair John DeAngelis raised issues with the board’s current meeting place, the Lapeer Center Building, saying the building had heating issues in the wintertime and leaked when it rained. He offered the American Legion Hall in Lapeer as an alternative, but noted that their current meeting time slot was unavailable due to a standing meeting at the hall every Thursday. 
With the board’s treasurer Perry Valle raising concerns about transparency and board chair Kari Kohlman proposing the board look into alternative locations, the matter was tabled.
However, at the board’s July meeting, no alternative locations were discussed, with DeAngelis bringing a motion to move the board meeting to 10 a.m. at the American Legion.
Despite protest from Valle and board member Bonnie Lawrence, DeAngelis’ motion – and the promise of no leaks, air conditioning and heat in the winter – prevailed.
“I think that if you change the meetings to 10 o’clock in the morning, you’re stabbing the general public in the back,” Valle said, “I think that’s what your purpose is.”
Karen Braschayko, a member of Fight For the First Lapeer, which advocates against censorship within the library district, said the board’s argument about facilities issues was a thinly veiled attempt to reduce the crowd size at meetings.
“It’s just my personal belief that they are trying to keep people like me from going,” Braschayko said. “I won’t be able to go unless they take a morning off of work or a day off of work, really.”
While Secretary Peggy Brotzke noted there’s nothing to say the board cannot change the meeting time if they see a drop in public participation, Braschayko said there’s no reason to take the board at its word. She also said that Fight For the First Lapeer would continue to have a presence at the 10 a.m. meetings. 
“We will find all of our retired friends or people with flexible schedules to show up at those meetings and speak, but it excludes people like me,” Braschayko said, noting that 84% of workers in the U.S. work a regular daytime schedule. 
Community activists have been on high alert, pointing to a memo from the board’s former attorney, Anne Seurynck, examining potential strategies to keep minors from accessing certain books, including placing books in an adult’s section, or putting certain books behind glass or a circulation desk.
Lapeer library board mulls age restrictions on materials despite shaky legal ground 

Though Seurynck advised against adopting any of the proposals warning they would place the library on “at best, shaky Constitutional ground” some members of the board have continued to look for ways to keep children from accessing books without running afoul of the law. 
During a March meeting of the Lapeer Tea Party, attendees asked the board’s DeAngelis and Brotzke about efforts to limit children’s access to some books. While unable to offer specifics on potential restrictions, DeAngelis said the board would be working with its attorney. When asked for a timeline for potential options, he offered six months, emphasizing that the board was not looking to get sued.
In an interview with Michigan Advance on Wednesday, DeAngelis said the decision was ultimately based on the availability of board members and their attorney, the time conflict with the Young Marines at the American Legion and the issues with the facilities. 
However, Lori Sawatzke, the building manager for the Lapeer Center Building, told the Michigan Advance she was never informed of any issues with the building. 
“Kara [Haight], the [library’s] assistant director, she would come over every Thursday, the day of their meetings, and get the key from me,” Sawatzke said. “She never once said, ‘Hey, it’s cold in that room,’ or ‘It’s hot in that room.’ Nothing.”
When asked if he had any concerns about the change in meeting time affecting transparency or attendance, DeAngelis said no.
On members’ push to protect children from books members feel are inappropriate, DeAngelis said the board would follow the law where it takes them, emphasizing that they do not want to be sued. 
“We’re not going to do anything like that unless it’s absolutely legal, above board,” DeAngelis said.
DeAngelis also expressed concerns that disputes with members of Fight For the First could lead to the board losing its millage.
Efforts to restrict or protect libraries both grew this year

Government transparency is important, especially when dealing with controversial matters, said Jay Kaplan, a longtime attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan’s LGBTQ+ project. 
While Kaplan said the decision to change a meeting from the evening to the morning wouldn’t violate the Open Meetings Act, which governs public  access to meetings, transparency and the ability for the public to respond to the board’s actions remains vital.
“The idea and the purpose of what some of these library board members are trying to do is to censor materials that they don’t like. That raises serious Constitutional concerns,” Kaplan said. “I would ask them if, indeed, they feel what they’re doing is above board. If there’s an effort to try to limit public input or public knowledge about what’s going on, what are they hiding from?”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ry5DR-0g-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

(Courtesy of the Sioux Falls School District)If South Dakota’s average teacher salary matched the state’s target teacher salary, the state would have ranked 38th in the nation this year for average teacher pay.
Instead, it ranked 46th at an average salary of $56,328, according to the 2025 National Education Association teacher salary report.
The target teacher salary isn’t actually the state’s goal for average teacher pay. In reality, it’s a basis for the state’s public education funding formula. Funding determined by the formula goes not just toward teacher salaries, but also toward overhead costs and salaries for other school workers. 
In recent years, the gap between the target teacher salary and the average teacher salary in South Dakota widened. The target teacher salary for the 2023-24 school year, which is what the latest rankings are based on, was $59,659.


In addition to climbing the ranks in teacher pay if the target salary was reached, South Dakota would have risen above neighboring states Montana and North Dakota.
Members of the state Teacher Compensation Review Board learned more about the rankings during their Monday meeting in Pierre. The group is required to meet each year by law to review teacher compensation compared to surrounding states and report the findings to the governor and Legislature.
Going forward, lawmakers hope to see progress in teacher pay due to a law passed by the 2024 Legislature that sets a minimum teacher salary and mandates increases in average teacher compensation in school districts nearly equal to increases in state education funding. About 95% of South Dakota school districts met the state’s mandated minimum $45,000 salary last school year.
Board member Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, said she wants to see the new legislation “play out” before the board recommends further changes to adjust or improve teacher compensation.
Board turns its attention toward teacher retention, student behavior
Howard and other board members called for ways to improve teacher job satisfaction and address one of the leading reasons teachers leave the profession: behavior problems among students.
South Dakota Department of Education data presented by Caitlin Scott of Marzano Research showed that the teacher turnover rate in South Dakota is higher than most surrounding states. About 16% of teachers in April 2024 reported that they no longer taught at the same school. North Dakota was the only surrounding state with higher numbers at 23% turnover.
Elementary and music teacher vacancies were higher than average at the beginning of the 2023-24 school year, according to the data. Ahead of the 2024-25 school year, math and science teachers were revealed as having high vacancy numbers. Overall vacancies as of June of this year stood at the second lowest number since 2019 at 144 vacancies throughout the state, according to the Associated School Boards of South Dakota.
US Education Department to unfreeze contested K-12 funds

Board members discussed student-teacher ratios, funding for schools and incentives for school districts and teachers to better address student proficiency and behavior problems.
Howard told board members she’d prefer to see a list of recommendations from local school districts, rather than “unfunded mandates” from the Legislature, especially as the state faces a $24.5 million shortfall in projected revenue.
“I would like us, if it’s a purview of this committee, to try and focus more on how we can make the teacher’s life better in the classroom and in the school,” Howard said. “Because we don’t necessarily have a lot of money to throw at this.”
Howard told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting that finding ways to address teacher retention and student behavior is a form of compensation.
“Does it always have to be a monetary form of compensation?” Howard said. “Or can we do other things to compensate them by making their life better in the classroom in general?”
South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joseph Graves said he plans to follow up with board members on their concerns and prepare recommendations for the board’s next meeting in August.

(Friends of Joanna Doven)As an industrial city and an incubator for artificial intelligence, Pittsburgh is uniquely positioned to lead the world, as AI-powered systems move out onto highways, factory floors and battlefields.
Joanna Doven, executive director of the city’s AI Strike Team, said the Steel City’s academic, manufacturing and health care, combined with its high quality of life and low cost of living put it in a unique position to catch the next wave of the AI revolution.
“Physical AI isn’t just the next tech buzzword. It’s an entirely new category of industry,” Doven said Monday at the Pennsylvania Press Club luncheon, where she was the featured speaker.
“These are intelligent systems that move, sense, adapt and act in real time in the physical world,” she said. “We’re talking about autonomous vehicles, submarines, defense systems, AI powered manufacturing, industrial robotics, and next generation energy systems.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The new industry is about to have a “hockey stick moment,” describing the shape of its growth curve, with value projected to increase nearly ten-fold by 2030, Doven said.
“This is not just market evolution, it’s market creation. And here’s the best part … no region or state has claimed ownership of this new industry. Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania must be first,” she said.
Next month, the city will host the AI Horizons Pittsburgh summit, Doven announced, where industry and government leaders will discuss how to help Pennsylvania capitalize on strengths that are attractive to the physical AI industry. 
Doven said the summit would focus on how the state can build a network to incentivize and support physical AI development and production in Pennsylvania with state and federal initiatives through Small Business Administration loans and public investment.
Speakers will include Martial Hebert, dean of the robotics department at Carnegie Mellon University, which Doven described as the world’s No. 1 AI school. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) are also slated to participate, she said.

The announcement came nearly two weeks after McCormick hosted an energy and innovation summit at CMU, attended by President Donald Trump and several of his cabinet secretaries. It also featured panels with heads of energy, tech and investment firms, who announced an aggregate $90 billion in investments to develop Pennsylvania’s energy supply and infrastructure to support data centers that power AI. 
Doven, who served as press secretary to former Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, said she saw the beginnings of the city’s AI hub following the redevelopment of a former Nabisco Baking Co. bakery in the East End neighborhood. 
AI companies that were spinning off of CMU’s robotics program began to lease space in the building, known as Bakery Square. In the office space glut of the post-COVID 19 pandemic era, Doven persuaded her clients to brand the building as an AI hub. That led to a working group of tech developers, city, county and state officials that became the AI Strike Team, she said. 
While AI companies lead the city in attracting venture capital, Doven said, investment in the field is still centered on the “tech bro network of Silicon Valley.” 
“The challenge we must face is this, too many of our best companies still migrate west for late stage capital. This is across Pennsylvania,” she said. “We birth the innovation here, and they, out west, capture the value.”
Unlike purely software companies, where employees can be based anywhere, physical AI companies and their workers need to be near where their products are made, tested and deployed, Doven said.
“They need to be near steel mills, near defense contractors and ship builders, near energy infrastructure and power plants. You can’t test a nuclear inspection robot from a We Work office in San Francisco,” she said.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)This story originally published in Idaho Education News on July 28.
Two transgender persons filed a federal lawsuit Friday, challenging a 2025 Idaho law restricting the use of gender-specific campus facilities.
The lawsuit centers on House Bill 264, which requires colleges and universities to designate restrooms, changing rooms and dormitories “for the exclusive use by either females or males.”
The plaintiffs are a transgender student at Boise State University who identifies as male, and a transgender person who spends significant time on the University of Idaho campus and identifies as female. Their lawsuit specifically challenges the restroom restrictions.
They say the two campuses have only a small number of restrooms that are open to all users, regardless of sex. They say they have used restrooms aligned to their gender identity, for years, and without incident. If they are forced to use restrooms consistent with their sex assigned at birth, the plaintiffs say they would be outed as transgender in their campus communities.
“HB 264, if it remains in effect at the beginning of the 2025-2026 school year, will prohibit BSU and U of I from allowing plaintiffs to continue using restrooms that align with their gender identities and how they are perceived on campus,” the lawsuit says.
The Boise State student plaintiff is not “out as transgender to most people on campus,” according to a statement filed with the federal court last week.
“It would be impossible for me to use the women’s restrooms, as I appear and sound male,” the student said. “I believe it would put me at risk for harassment and violence to enter a restroom designated for females.”
The second plaintiff — identified in court documents by the pseudonym Sophie Smith — is seeking to pursue the lawsuit anonymously. “Sophie frequently uses the women’s restrooms at U of I without incident,” according to the lawsuit. “She does so with the permission of administrators, to whom she previously came out as transgender.”
The lawsuit claims HB 264 violates the plaintiffs’ rights to equal protection and privacy under the 14th Amendment; violates federal workplace protections; and violates Title IX, which forbids discrimination in schools on the basis of sex.
The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order by Aug. 25, the first day of classes at Boise State and the U of I.
The lawsuit names a list of defendants: the State Board of Education and its members; state superintendent Debbie Critchfield; Boise State and interim President Jeremiah Shinn; and the U of I and President C. Scott Green.
HB 264’s legislative sponsor went onto social media Sunday to predict the lawsuit will fail.
Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, argues that the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed Idaho’s 2023 K-12 bathroom law to go into effect. This law prohibits transgender students from using bathrooms aligned with their gender identity.
The 2025 law, Ehardt said in a Facebook comment, “is EXACTLY LIKE THAT, just for higher ed!”
Ehardt’s House Bill 264 passed the Legislature along party lines. Gov. Brad Little signed it into law in April.

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Corn rated nearly 90% good to excellent during the reporting period from July 21 through July 27, while wet conditions limited farmers’ activities in the field, according to the latest crop progress and condition report. 
Iowa crops continue to progress slightly ahead of schedule while above-average temperatures and precipitation caused humid conditions and in some cases, caused excessive soil moisture. 
Across the state, topsoil moisture went from 21% surplus last week to 30% surplus this week. Subsoil moisture conditions also increased to 24% surplus, up from 17% last week. 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, the weekly average precipitation was 1.58 inches for the reporting period, which is 0.61 inches above the normal. Some regions of the state, however, received as much as 7.2 inches during the reporting period and southeastern Iowa had between 3 and 5 inches.  
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said with only a couple of days left in July, it “could rank among the top ten wettest Julys on record.”
“Last week was hot and muggy as a heat dome settled over the Midwest, producing some sweltering heat and humidity,” Naig said in a statement. 
The average temperature for the week, at 77.5, was more than 4 degrees above normal. Temperatures throughout the period were between 2 and 6 degrees above the 30-year average.

Tim Kaldenberg grows corn, soybeans and raises cattle north of Albia and said his farm has had good growing conditions and has not been hit by the “extreme rainfall” that other areas have had. 
“We even hate to say this out loud, but it has been very nice growing conditions,” Kaldenberg said. 
Kaldenberg said in an interview with Iowa Capital Dispatch July 22, the crops in his region “had the nicest looking grow.” 
“We’re so used to that not being the case,” Kaldenberg said. “So we’re just very thankful for that this year.” 
Kaldenberg and his family were awarded the Wergin Good Farm Neighbor Award from the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship in early July for their operation’s dedications to soil health, water quality and community engagement. 
Kaldenberg said the majority of his corn has been pollinated and his soybeans are flowering. He also said pasture conditions were good, and the main challenge he’s had is getting his hay to dry. 
This is in line with conditions across the state. Eighty-four percent of corn is silking and 34% of corn acres have reached the dough stage across the state, according to the report produced by U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. 
Soybeans also rated 82% good to excellent for the reporting period and 81% of soybean acres were blooming. Soybeans are five days ahead of last year and two days ahead of the five-year average in terms of setting pods, as 52% of the crop across the state has reached that stage. 
According to the report, nearly half of Iowa oat acres have been harvested, with higher percentages of harvest completed in southern regions of the state. 
Oats rated 83% good to excellent and hay rated 86% good to excellent. 
Across the state 87% of alfalfa hay acres have had a second cutting and 28% have undergone a third cutting. 
Pasture conditions also rated well at 82% good to excellent, though according to the report, some livestock stress was reported on account of the heat and humidity.

K.C. Dressing, a 31-year-old Colchester resident, spent Friday evening exhorting the loudest section of Vermont Green Football Club fans to greater heights by pounding on a limited-edition Pearl snare drum. He’s been attending Green games for several years and is a member of the Green Mountain Bhoys, a group of dedicated longtime supporters.
“It’s a little snapshot of what makes Vermont an incredible place and what makes me feel so lucky to live here,” Dressing said.
Burlington saw two ecstatic pitch invasions this weekend at the University of Vermont’s Virtue Field, after Vermont Green won two hard-fought playoff games to take the club to its first national finals in the United Soccer League’s second tier. On Sunday night, the league announced the Vermont side would retain its home advantage again in the final against Seattle-based Ballard FC on Saturday.
“We’re incredibly excited to be hosting a final,” club co-founder Patrick Infurna said. “Our soccer community in general has earned it.”
Chris Taylor, the club’s head coach, called the team’s playoff run “an amazing ride” on Sunday after the game. He praised his players and said that support from the sold-out crowds had made a profound impact. 
Owen O’Malley, the scorer of the Green’s winning penalty against Dothan United on Sunday, agreed. 
“I do it for the fans, man,” O’Malley said. “I just love these guys so much.”

The feeling from fans was mutual. The club estimated Sunday’s attendance at just over 4,000. When O’Malley ran to the stands to celebrate, he was immediately surrounded by a crowd of supporters — first young kids, then parents and adults. 
The boisterous home support had been quieted briefly on Friday when, deep into added time, Lionsbridge Football Club scored what would have been the winning goal. Then cheers resumed as home fans realized the official’s flag was up: the goal had been offside. Two overtime goals secured a Vermont win.
Near the front of Friday’s pitch invasion, Jacob Labowitz brandished an enormous Vermont flag. The Colchester-based lawyer went to Vermont Green’s first-ever game in 2022.
“Freedom and unity right here,” he said, nodding up at the state coat of arms.

Melissa Gara, who works at the University of Vermont Medical Center, said Sunday she was glad to have witnessed two such successful Vermont soccer teams in the same year. The University of Vermont’s men’s team that won the NCAA national championship in December — from which Vermont Green FC has recruited several top players — was still at the forefront of her mind.
“Now I’m a die-hard fan,” Gara said.
Some supporters had been all-in long before Sunday. Jack Beach and Isaac Parker, both 18, said they had waited in a virtual line for tickets in their workplace bathroom last week. Parker, who originally found the Green through Instagram, said he was invested not just in the club, but also in the success of its athletes.
“The player-fan connection is crazy,” Parker said.

Fans have also been drawn to Vermont Green’s off-the-field culture, which includes close relationships with local businesses and an emphasis on political advocacy. Several fans said they appreciate the club’s affiliation with climate and social justice movements.
The club itself has hosted fundraisers in the past for the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont. Fan groups have also organized support for organizations such as Migrant Justice Vermont. Infurna said the club considers environmental justice its “North Star.”
The club has also hosted three women’s exhibition matches and is looking to expand its women’s program in the coming years.
For people like Jessica Huber, who plays in a coed Sunday soccer league, a Vermont Green women’s team would make a difference. She went to one of the women’s matches, all of which sold out.
“I think the demand is there,” she said.
In general, Huber said, she loves the community that has formed around Vermont Green.
“Vibes are high,” she said. “Vibes are amazing.”

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Inshore shrimp season in Louisiana will open a couple weeks later than usual this year, and shrimpers are all for it. 
The Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission set Aug. 11 as the opening date for the inshore fall 2025 white shrimp season on Monday, pushed back from the typical Aug. 1 start date based on testimony from state biologists and the public. 
The date was moved to make sure shrimp get to a marketable size, which will fetch higher prices for shrimpers as well as ensuring the shrimp population remains stable. 
Louisiana Shrimp Association president Acy Cooper Jr. said that, for the majority of the shrimpers he represents, the wait is worth it. 
“We really need bigger shrimp in order to try to make money with it. Try with the smaller shrimp, and they just don’t pay us enough,” Cooper said. 
For 2025, shrimping waters from the Mississippi-Louisiana border to the eastern shore of the Mississippi River’s South Pass open at 6 a.m. Aug. 11. Waters east of South Pass to the Atchafalaya River Ship Channel at Eugene Island, marked with a red channel buoy line, open at 6 p.m. From the buoy line westward to the Louisiana-Texas border, shrimping opens at 6 a.m. 
A shrimp’s life cycle and how much it grows is heavily dependent on water conditions, such as salinity, temperature and oxygen content, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. 
Biologists work to measure these conditions and, with input from the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission and the state’s Shrimp Task Force, can determine where and when shrimp will be the right size to harvest. 
In order to gauge when white shrimp reach a marketable size of 100 shrimp per pound, biologists trawl the state’s estuarine and inland waters, sampling shrimp and testing the conditions. They then plug their measurements into mathematical models to predict when shrimp would reach a big enough size. 
Cooper said opening later in the season is the result of a balancing act between gaging where the shrimp will run and waiting for the chance to make the most money for the work put in. That balance can make the difference for shrimpers when it comes to financially surviving another season. 
“You are taking the chance of losing some, but that’s a chance they’re going to take,” he said. “We really need bigger shrimp in order to survive down here if we’re gonna make any money.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_5459-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A state commission found Monday in Pierre that two local government bodies violated the notification provisions of the state’s open meetings law. 
Written reprimands will be issued for the violations. The Open Meetings Commission is a five-member body appointed by the state attorney general to consider complaints about government bodies around the state. 
The commission concluded the Central City Board of Trustees did not comply with state law, which requires meeting agendas to be posted publicly with the date, time and location at least 24 hours in advance. The board held a budget meeting on Sept. 23, 2024, without posting an agenda, according to complainant Christle Beukens.
Beukens filed the complaint in late 2024. She testified that agendas had routinely been posted in the past but had stopped until she raised concerns in 2023. Although the board resumed posting agendas after that, she said the Sept. 23 meeting showed the problem lingered. The commission declined to find violations on other allegations from Beukens. 
The commission found that the Saddleback Road District Board in Custer County violated state open meetings laws when the board held a Sept. 7, 2024, meeting without notifying the public. The board did not post an agenda or the required 24-hour notice for the meeting. The commission declined to find violations on other allegations against the board in a complaint from Dachia Arritola.
The commission also praised the current road district board for taking steps to correct the problem.

JB Pritzker, firearm owners will soon be required to keep their weapons stored securely and out of the hands of minors while law enforcement agencies will be required to trace the ownership of all firearms they recover from crime scenes. (Capitol News Illinois photo by Andrew Campbell)
Article summary:

Senate Bill 8 requires gun owners to keep their weapons secured and inaccessible to minors, people at risk of harming themselves or others, and people prohibited from possessing firearms. Violations can result in civil fines.
House Bill 1327 requires law enforcement agencies to use a federal data system to trace the ownership of weapons they recover from crime scenes or take into custody because they are believed to have been used for illegal purposes.
While Illinois has been enacting stricter gun control measures, federal courts have taken a more restrictive view of gun control laws. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals is considering a challenge to Illinois’ 2023 assault weapons ban. Oral arguments in that case will be scheduled soon.


Gun owners in Illinois will soon be required to take additional measures to keep their weapons out of the hands of children under a new law signed Monday by Gov. JB Pritzker.
In addition, law enforcement officers in the state must now start tracing the ownership of any firearm that is recovered from a crime scene, used unlawfully or is believed to be associated with a crime.
Pritzker signed those bills into law at a time when federal courts are growing increasingly skeptical of state and local efforts to curb gun violence. A federal court of appeals is preparing to hear arguments in a challenge to Illinois’ most significant recent gun restriction — a ban on assault-style weapons and large capacity magazines.
“I’m tired, frankly, of treating something completely preventable as inevitable,” Pritzker said at a bill signing ceremony in Chicago. “I’m tired of forcing our children to duck and cover because too many politicians are ducking and covering for the gun industry’s money. I’m tired of hearing thoughts and prayers and then nothing gets done.”
Safe storage requirement
Senate Bill 8, known as the Safe Gun Storage Act, prohibits gun owners from storing their weapons in an unsecured manner at any location where they know, or reasonably should know, that the gun could be accessed by a minor, a person at risk of harming themselves or others, or by a person who is prohibited under state or federal law from possessing a firearm.
To secure the weapon, under the law, owners will be required to keep them in a locked container so that they are inaccessible or unusable by anyone other than the owner.
Gun owners who violate the law could be subject to civil fines of $500. But those fines could go up to $1,000 if a minor, at-risk person or prohibited person  obtains the firearm, and as high as $10,000 if such person uses it to kill or injure someone in the course of committing a crime.
In lieu of those fines, courts could instead order the gun owner to perform community service or pay restitution for violating the law. The new law also provides that gun owners could also be subject to civil liability in private lawsuits.
However, the law also provides that gun owners will not be found in violation of the law if a minor, at-risk person or prohibited person obtains their firearm by unlawfully entering the premises.
In addition to the new storage requirements, SB 8 also requires gun owners to report a lost or stolen firearm to law enforcement within 48 hours of discovery, as opposed to the previous 72-hour requirement.
Supporters of the bill pointed to recent statistics showing firearms are now the leading cause of death for children under 18, surpassing motor vehicles and cancer.
“For far too long, we have witnessed the tragic consequences of unsecured firearms in homes,” Sen. Laura Ellman, D-Naperville, the lead Senate sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. “Firearms, if left unaccounted for and unsecured, pose risks to those who shouldn’t have access to them. Firearm owners can help prevent gun-related incidents by ensuring their guns are securely stored and away from others.”
The bill passed 33-19 in the Senate and 69-40 in the House.
The law takes effect Jan. 1.
Firearm tracing
Pritzker also signed a bill Monday requiring law enforcement agencies to trace the ownership of every weapon recovered from a crime scene or that they seize because it was possessed unlawfully, used for an unlawful purpose or they reasonably believe to have been used in a crime.
House Bill 1373, an initiative of Attorney General Kwame Raoul, requires agencies to check those weapons through a web-based system known as eTrace, which is operated by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Prior to the new law, participation in the eTrace system was voluntary.
“We know now that approximately half of shootings nationwide never get solved. Only about a third do here in the city of Chicago,” said Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, the lead Senate sponsor of the bill. “We also know that the same gun can often be used again and again in multiple shootings, multiple killings. We need to do something about that. That’s what this bill does. It ensures that all law enforcement agencies report all information they have on a gun anytime they recover it at the scene of a crime.”
The bill passed 75-40 in the House and 43-11 in the Senate. It takes effect immediately.
Legal landscape
Since taking office in 2019, Pritzker has signed numerous bills into law that impose new restrictions on the sale, ownership and possession of firearms. The most significant of those was a 2023 ban on assault-style weapons and large capacity magazines, known as the Protect Illinois Communities Act.
During that same time, however, the U.S. Supreme Court has adopted a more expansive view of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and imposed new legal standards that make it more difficult for state and local gun control measures to pass constitutional muster.
Most recently, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, July 24, struck down as unconstitutional a California law requiring background checks for people to purchase ammunition. The court found the law was not consistent with the nation’s “historical tradition” of firearms regulation, a standard the Supreme Court established in 2022, less than a year before Illinois passed its assault weapons ban.
Gun rights organizations are using a similar argument in challenging the Illinois law.
In November, a federal judge in East St. Louis struck down the Illinois law using the same “historical tradition” analysis. But his ruling has been put on hold pending an appeal to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
In that case, the attorney general’s office has until Aug. 14 to file its final brief. A three-judge panel will then set a date for oral arguments. However the court rules,  observers expect the law will eventually be appealed to the Supreme Court.

Tim Walz took questions from reporters after a ceremonial bill signing at Apple Jack Orchards in Delano, Minnesota, on July 28, 2025. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Monday said his administration has halted payments to 50 of the largest providers in the state’s Housing Stabilization Services program, which federal investigators say is the source of a massive fraud scheme.
Earlier this month, the FBI raided five Minnesota businesses that have received millions in Medicaid money for services they didn’t provide, according to unsealed search warrants. The Housing Stabilization Services program is intended to help older adults and people with disabilities find and maintain housing.
Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson told KSTP that the “vast majority” of the Housing Stabilization Services program is fraudulent. He said that when his current investigations are finished, fraud in programs administered by Minnesota could exceed $1 billion, stemming from a pandemic-era food aid program known as Feeding Our Future, the state’s autism program and rapidly increasing sums allegedly pilfered from other Medicaid programs.
Walz, at a ceremonial bill signing in Delano, said that earlier in the day Monday — nearly two weeks after the FBI raids — his administration halted payments to “most of the people involved” in the Housing Stabilization Services program. The governor said he “fully expects” some providers could wind up suing to resume payments, as occurred in a now infamous Feeding Our Future lawsuit in 2021. He agreed with Thompson that fraud in Minnesota could exceed $1 billion.
Asked whether his administration should be held accountable, he gave a lengthy answer.
“Well, I think you’re always accountable for when things happen, but I think the accountability piece that we’re going to have to try and understand is — we’ve seen fraud, whether it’s in United Healthcare, we’ve seen it in other places,” Walz said, referring to a series of investigations of the Eden Prairie-based health insurance giant.
“The question is, in state government, our job is to carry out the programs to try and get the resources to the people who need them. We work with our partners in the counties and so forth, but I think on this one, the question I’m asking is, is the safeguards in place strong enough?”
Walz said fraudsters took advantage of the flow of money moving through government during the pandemic, when policymakers were more concerned with getting money out the door during an emergency rather than enforcing typical safeguards to prevent fraud.
“Anytime, especially during COVID and post-COVID, when you have that much money moving and the idea is to move it as quickly as possible, folks will take advantage of that.”
“So my goal is, and thanks to the Legislature we’ve got some pretty good tools right now, but I think in talking to the U.S. Attorney, one of the things we have to think more of is, these people are being arrested and they’re going to prison. Right now the folks who are involved in this, you will be going to prison.”
Walz said that as a result of the investigations, state government is bound to move slower as it seeks to create more barriers to fraud.
“All of us are going to have to candidly recognize there is going to be legitimate organizations and legitimate need for people in good programs that are just going to have to be a little bit slower and a little more barriers put in place because even right now, the folks can find the loopholes,” Walz said.
Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove and chair of the House fraud prevention committee, asked the feds to conduct an audit of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, which administers the House Stabilization Services program.
“This culture of corruption must end. It’s time for real accountability, and that starts with a full, independent federal audit,” Robbins said in a news release.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3114-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-28 18:56:33.874604

Konstantin Konev, a citizen of Balurus and a legal permanent resident of the United States for more than five years, is suing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Citizenship and Immigration Services, as well as the agency’s director, Joseph Edlow, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
According to the lawsuit, Konev is “a law-abiding individual” who became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in December 2017. On Sept. 20, 2022, Konev filed an application for naturalization. In the 34 months since then, he alleges, CIS has yet to begin the prosses of reviewing his application by scheduling an interview.
“Although U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has thus far prevented the plaintiff from becoming a U.S. citizen, the defendants have not notified the plaintiff of any problems with his case, nor have they afforded him an opportunity to address and correct any basis for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ concerns,” the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit states this “unlawful conduct” by CIS has deprived Konev of job opportunities as well as the right to vote, the right to serve on juries, the ability to travel abroad without fear of being denied reentry to the United States, and the right to apply for business and educational loans that are U.S. citizens are routinely granted.
The lawsuit seeks judicial adjudication of the naturalization application or a court order that would force CIS to make its own decision on the matter within 30 days.
CIS has yet to file a response to the lawsuit and has yet to respond to several requests for comment from the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
A similar case was filed recently by Mario Cesar Silva Pineda and his wife, Ana Carolina Silva of Perry.
The couple is suing CIS, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.
According to the lawsuit, Silva Pineda is a U.S. citizen who was naturalized in August 2022. His wife is a citizen of El Salvador. The two claim they were married in May 2023, after which Silva Pineda filed an I-130 application on his wife’s behalf – generally considered the first step in the immigration process for someone who wishes to stay in the United States permanently based on a close relative’s status.
The couple’s lawsuit claims no action has been taken in the matter since July 19, 2023, when CIS acknowledged receipt of their application. The current average processing time for such applications is 17 months, according to federal records.
The lawsuit claims the delay in acting on the application is unreasonable and illegal and seeks court intervention in the matter. CIS has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
Lawsuits follow cuts in immigration assistance
Recently, federal officials acknowledged they are moving to deport a central Iowa couple who is suing the government over what they claim is a five-year delay in processing their naturalization application.
The stated rationale for the attempted removal of Justin and Victoria Kokeh from the United States is that the couple lied in 2013 when they claimed to have no children. According to court filings in the case, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security took no action in the matter until recently, after the Kokehs, who have lived in Des Moines and Altoona, sued Noem to force a decision in their naturalization case.
In court filings, Homeland Security has alleged the Kokehs committed fraud in connection with their 2013 visa application by asserting they had no children at the time.
Under federal law, CIS is required to avoid “excessive” delays in making decisions on naturalization applications.  The statute requires the agency to render a decision within 120 days of the initial naturalization interview – although it may take months or years for such an interview to take place.
In cases where CIS doesn’t schedule an interview, applicants can still seek court intervention. In those cases, a federal judge cannot issue a decision on the application but can order CIS to make such a decision and do it in a timely fashion.
Earlier this year, Noem placed all of the staff from CIS’ Office of Ombudsman on 60 days’ administrative leave, essentially shutting down the office that was designed to assist potential immigrants resolve problems with their applications. At the time, Homeland Security said it was attempting to focus more on border security and immigration enforcement.
According to the CIS Ombudsman’s Annual Report for 2024, the office handled about 30,000 requests for assistance in 2023.
In late May, after being sued over the staff reductions, DHS said the ombudsman’s office would reopen but with a considerably smaller staff consisting of a head ombudsman, a deputy and an additional five to eight full-time employees.
The office previously had about 40 full-time employees.

But any Idaho ground water users who are not part of a groundwater district and are not participating in an approved plan need to immediately join a district to avoid having their water shut off, state officials said.
Late Friday afternoon, the Idaho Department of Water Resources announced that Director Mathew Weaver signed an updated curtailment order for groundwater users who pump off the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer and hold water rights issued more recently than – or junior to – Oct. 11 1900.
However, the 2024 water settlement agreement and mitigation plan that farmers reached agreement over protects members of groundwater districts from having their water shut off.
“The members of the groundwater districts are protected under a stipulated mitigation plan approved following completion of the 2024 Water Settlement Agreement,” Idaho Department of Water Resources officials said in a news release issued Friday. 
The latest updated curtailment order was issued after the Idaho Department of Water Resources signed an order earlier in July predicting a water shortfall for the Twin Falls Canal Co., the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
 How Idaho governs water issues

In Idaho, water issues are governed by something called the doctrine of prior appropriation. When there is not enough water to go around, water users who hold older water rights, called senior water rights, have priority over water users who hold more recently issued water rights, called junior water rights.

State officials use the saying “first in time, first in right,” to describe how the doctrine of prior appropriation governs water issues.
Water issues are extremely important to Idaho farmers who need water to irrigate their crops during the summer growing season.
Water issues came to a head in May 2024 when the Idaho Department of Water Resources issued a curtailment order that required 6,400 junior water rights holders to suddenly shut their water off during the growing season, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The 2024 curtailment order was ultimately in place for about three weeks until the two sides reached an agreement for the year. 
Then, Gov. Brad Little called on farmers to reach a long-term water agreement and mitigation plan, which resulted in the 2024 water settlement agreement and mitigation plan that state officials said is protecting water groundwater districts from curtailment following this year’s updated order.
 Groundwater districts who signed agreement are protected, attorney says

T.J. Budge, an attorney for the Idaho Ground Water Association, told the Idaho Capital Sun that groundwater districts that are part of the agreement are protected.
“Yes, things are the same as they were a few weeks ago,” Budge said Monday. “Those who are participating in an approved mitigation plan are protected from curtailment.” 
In addition to groundwater districts, Idaho Department of Water Resources officials also said the Southwest Irrigation District, the Coalition of Cities, A&B Irrigation District and the Water Mitigation Coalition are operating under approved mitigation plans and protected from curtailment.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)On Monday, Rhode Island education officials were still waiting to learn when they’d get federal education grant funding for the current fiscal year.
In total, the frozen funds span five buckets of federal money, Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) spokesperson Victor Morente said in an email Monday. He added that RIDE had still not received grant notifications as of Monday, but had been notified on Friday that the grants were being unfrozen beginning the week of July 28. 
“It’s my understanding that this is for remaining Title I, Title II, Title III, and Title IV-A funds,” Morente said. “These funds support teacher professional development, English language acquisition support, health and safety and Adult Basic Education.”
Morente could not yet provide specifics of how programs would be impacted at the local or district level yet.
“While final financial decisions would be made at the local level, RIDE has been in close communication with district leaders throughout the last few weeks offering support and guidance and will continue to do so,” Morente said.
The withholding of approximately $6.8 billion in federal education funding arrived in the inboxes of state education departments nationwide on the evening of June 30. 
Rhode Island would have lost nearly $30 million if the funds were not unfrozen. The majority of that money, about $23.5 million, is tied to the grant programs that RIDE was notified on Friday would begin to be released.
The feds’ June 30 announcement of the temporary fund freeze came the night before education departments and school districts nationwide expected to begin allocating money for the new fiscal year beginning July 1. According to the email, the U.S. education department was reviewing funds before they could be released.     
Two lawsuits, both filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, followed the news of the freeze.The first was filed by a coalition of Attorneys General on July 14. A second multistate lawsuit over the same disputed funds was filed on July 21 by a collection of 14 plaintiffs that comprised school districts and teachers’ unions, including Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals (RIFTHP). 
On July 18, the U.S. education department announced it had finished reviewing and would release about $1.3 billion of the frozen funds. These funds are distributed through Title IV-B grants, which includes the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program — the only federal funding source dedicated to afterschool programming, including summer programs. 
Morente said the 21st Century grants notifications, which comprised $6.5 million, have already been received by RIDE.
According to the July 21 lawsuit, educators rely on funds from grant programs that are still pending release. A memorandum filed with the suit notes that 11 union members “were recently informed that they were losing their jobs.”
A declaration from Federation President Maribeth Calabro was filed with the July 21 lawsuit. Calabro elaborated that positions funded by the frozen money — like instructional coaches, English language development staff, arts teachers, and school counselors — could be laid off or reassigned if the money is not restored in a timely fashion.
Calabro wrote that several union members have already missed out on planned professional development sessions this summer, which she wrote are important for the upkeep of teaching licenses as well as the improvement of teaching skills and curricula. 
The union also relies on dues revenue, Calabro wrote, which could lessen under the funds’ freezing. 
“This will diminish the organization’s ability to provide core representational services, including contract enforcement and member support,” Calabro wrote. “The reduction in bargaining unit size will weaken RIFTHP’s position in collective bargaining, limiting our ability to negotiate fair wages, working conditions, and staffing policies for our remaining members.”
The U.S. The Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

A lawyer says her appointment was illegal. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)An Irvington man facing drug distribution and gun charges asked a federal judge to dismiss the case against him, arguing that last week’s reappointment of Alina Habba as New Jersey’s acting U.S. Attorney violated federal law and his constitutional rights.
The motion is the latest twist in Habba’s tumultuous tenure as New Jersey’s chief federal law enforcement official and threatens to upend hundreds of criminal prosecutions pursued by her office — if her tenure is to continue at all. New Jersey’s federal judges last week named Habba’s deputy, Desiree Grace, as U.S. attorney, but the Trump administration removed Grace and renamed Habba instead.
Thomas Mirigliano, who is representing the Irvington man, Julien Giraud, said in a Sunday court filing that he wants a judge to bar Habba “from exercising further prosecutorial powers in this matter.”
“The Attorney General’s dismissal of Ms. Grace and reinstatement of Ms. Habba constitutes unlawful executive interference,” the filing reads.
President Donald Trump in March named Habba, then a personal lawyer, as acting U.S. attorney and formally nominated her in June for confirmation by the U.S. Senate. But her nomination never advanced (New Jersey’s two senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, oppose Habba’s confirmation).
Federal law allows unconfirmed U.S. attorney nominees to run their offices only for 120 days before their district’s federal judges appoint a successor. Habba’s 120-day term ended Friday.
Last week, after New Jersey District Court judges selected Grace to replace Habba, the Trump administration fired Grace, Habba’s nomination was withdrawn, and Habba was installed as the office’s top deputy, a maneuver that administration officials said makes her the office’s leader. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives first-assistants elevated to lead their department up to 210 days in the job.
It’s not clear who ordered Grace’s removal. Department of Justice officials lack the authority to overwrite court orders, and while the U.S. Constitution may grant Trump the ability to fire judicially appointed U.S. attorneys, the question is far from settled and will likely be answered in court.
In Mirigliano’s filing, which was first reported by the New Jersey Globe, he argued Habba’s reappointment violates two portions of federal law that bar interim appointments of presidential nominees.
Though the Federal Vacancies Reform Act allows for first assistant U.S. attorneys to take helm of their departments in case of vacancies, it also bars those who were not top deputies for at least 90 days in the preceding year from serving.
It also bars individuals from being elevated to positions for which they were nominated but failed to be confirmed. Separate federal law bars the attorney general from appointing as U.S. attorney individuals to whom the Senate “refused to give advice and consent.”
“Ms. Habba’s nomination submission triggered this statutory prohibition. Thus, Ms. Habba’s re-appointment is invalid,” Mirigliano wrote.
This isn’t the first time Trump officials have sought to replace a judicially appointed prosecutor.
In 2020, then-Attorney General William Barr announced that Geoffrey Berman, then the Southern District of New York’s chief prosecutor, had resigned. Berman said he had not resigned and did not intend to.
The following day, Barr claimed Trump had fired Berman, though Trump said he was “not involved” in the firing. Berman only resigned when his top deputy was named to succeed him. Barr had sought to install Craig Carpenito, then New Jersey’s U.S. attorney, as the Southern District’s chief federal prosecutor.
About two months after Berman’s departure, district prosecutors secured a money laundering and wire fraud indictment against top Trump booster Steve Bannon, who was convicted on the charges and later pardoned by Trump.
The swirl around Habba’s appointment is likely to draw more controversy. Since she was installed in March, a federal judge has rebuked her office for lodging then quickly dismissing criminal charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. The mayor has claimed the charges were politically motivated.
Habba has also filed criminal charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10), who likewise claims politics motivated Habba. Habba’s pledge to a podcast host that she would use her office to “turn New Jersey red” has spurred a complaint that she violated the Hatch Act, a law barring federal employees from engaging in political activities while they are working in an official capacity.

The Alabama Securities Commission has opened an 'inquiry' into the business, which federal prosecutors accuse of running a Ponzi scheme. (Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder)The Alabama Securities Commission (ASC) has opened an inquiry into an alleged Georgia-based Ponzi scheme involving First Liberty Building and Loan and its owner, Edwin Brant Frost IV.
Amanda Senn, director of the ASC, said in a phone interview Monday that the move is not an investigation. The agency is actively monitoring the situation and coordinating with authorities in both Alabama and Georgia “to be sure Alabama investors are protected,” and that the agency will elevate the case to an active investigation if Georgia takes further action.
“It’s on our radar,” Senn said. “We’ve got personnel dedicated to monitoring the situation in its entirety.”

A lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 10 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia alleged that Frost and his associated investment firms raised at least $140 million between 2014 and 2025 through fraudulent means. The lawsuit further alleges that Frost used $570,000 of the misappropriated money for political donations. 
According to campaign finance records, Frost, members of his family or his businesses made at least $132,000 in contributions to Alabama politicians and political action committees (PACs).
Former Rep. Andrew Sorrell, R-Muscle Shoals, now the Alabama state auditor and a candidate for Secretary of State; Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont; and Alabama State Board of Education member Allen Long were among the Alabama politicians who accepted contributions either from Frost or one of his various investment firms.
Senn said that if the situation warrants, the ASC could “elevate” their case to a full investigation, which could involve issuing subpoenas.
“Should something in (Georgia’s) case cause us to need to elevate, file or launch an active open investigation, then we’ll do that,” she stated.
Senn said that they are prepared to launch their own active investigation, if necessary, but “if our Alabama investors are protected with the Georgia investigation,” the agency would avoid duplicating efforts by not launching its own investigation. She added that the ASC is assisting and providing information that may be “pertinent to other active criminal investigations right now.”
Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen last week called for those who received political contributions from Frost or one of his investment firms to return the funds, saying he takes “allegations of financial fraud seriously, especially when that fraud bleeds into campaign finance.” The Alabama Secretary of State’s Office oversees campaign finance reporting but does not have the power to investigate or prosecute alleged violations of the law or compel the return of contributions.
Sorrell and his PAC, Alabama Christian Citizens, collectively received at least $71,000 in contributions from the Frost family and their investment entities. Harrison received over $21,000 in donations from Brant in 2022, and Long, a conservative member of the Alabama State Board of Education, received a $40,000 donation from First National Investments in December 2023. Sorrell and Harrison said in separate interviews earlier this month that they would return the contributions to the court-appointed receiver. Long has not returned requests for comment.
The number of Alabama investors affected by the scheme is still unclear, but Senn said “we know there are investors in Alabama.” A receiver has been appointed in Georgia to collect contributions made to politicians and gather more information about the investors.
Senn said that any decision to launch a public investigation by the ASC would be made public, as it is “something that people need to know.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/First-Liberty-Building-and-Loan-July-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-28 17:56:57.546004

The new owners say they hope to open the building to “not only the Bennington community, but just travelers from far and beyond who want to come see this historic landmark.”

Built in 1771 by prominent Bennington resident and Revolutionary War Capt. Elijah Dewey, the Walloomsac Inn is the oldest lodging establishment in Vermont. 
After over 30 years as a private residence, the Walloomsac Inn had fallen into disrepair, but now the ramshackle inn at the heart of Old Bennington is set to be restored and opened to the public. 
The inn was purchased June 25 by Rafe Churchill and Casey Sunderland through a new joint venture called Place in Mind, which aims to restore historically significant properties in the Northeast and across the country. The co-founders are also part of the leadership team for the architecture and interior design firm Hendricks Churchill, and Churchill is an alumni of Bennington College. 
“Our mission is really to resurrect these historic structures,” Sunderland said. “Hospitality happens to be a really great backbone to do that on, because you can generate revenue and open up the experience to so many more people than if it were just a private residence.” 
The restoration project will be a “significant undertaking,” so there is no set timeline yet for opening, Sunderland said. However, the duo plans to honor the existing property structure during renovations and bring the Walloomsac Inn back to its original glory shown in old postcards and photos from decades past, he said. 
Along with the Walloomsac Inn, Sunderland and Churchill acquired the Mount Anthony Seminary, a former school in Old Bennington. The co-founders plan to rebuild the historic bell tower on the property and open the building as a smaller, six-bedroom lodging near the Walloomsac Inn, Sunderland said.

Old Bennington is a “beautiful little hamlet of Vermont that is, quite frankly, undiscovered in many ways,” Sunderland said. The duo hopes the projects will help make the Walloomsac Inn, the Mount Anthony Seminary, and, by extension, Old Bennington, into a destination where people can experience the history the area has to offer, he said.
“We’re just hoping that the town, the neighbors, the community continues to feel excited about being able to open up this to not only the Bennington community, but just travelers from far and beyond who want to come see this historic landmark,” Sunderland said. 
Shannon Barsotti, community development director for Bennington, said the Walloomsac Inn will benefit the economy of the town and region by providing a space for people to stay when visiting local notable spots, such as the Old First Church, its historic cemetery and the nearby Bennington Battle Monument — the most visited landmark in the state. 
Bennington Museum Executive Director Martin Mahoney said the Walloomsac Inn is a “long-standing staple of community life” in Old Bennington, and the restoration coinciding with the country’s 250th anniversary celebrations is fortuitous and welcome news for residents.

With a storied history, the Walloomsac Inn, known at the time as Dewey’s Tavern, served as a meeting place for the Vermont Legislature during the state’s time as an independent republic from 1771 until statehood in 1791, Mahoney said. 
The inn also hosted members of the Continental Army before the pivotal victory at the Battle of Bennington, said Jonah Spivak, the town of Bennington’s communications coordinator and chair of the Bennington Regional 250th Anniversary Committee. A member of the Dewey family, Mary Tilden Dewey, baked 80 loaves of bread to feed soldiers in the inn’s kitchens ahead of the battle, he said.
The inn was also visited by Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Rutherford B. Hayes and Benjamin Harrison through the years. After the Deweys, the inn was acquired by James Hicks who added a third floor and ballroom to the second floor in 1893. After procuring the property in 1848, George Wadsworth Robinson changed the establishment’s name from Hicks Tavern to the Walloomsac House. Another former owner, Walter Berry, added a three-and-half-story extension to the building after acquiring it near the turn of the 20th century.
The 250th Anniversary Committee looked into acquiring the property for historic preservation through a community trust, Spivak said, but noted the project is a “heavy lift” that required people “with the resources and the knowledge to pull it off” — like Churchill and Sunderland.
Spivak said he is glad the restoration of the Walloomsac Inn will serve a “public purpose” going forward and be “an incredible enhancement to the historical experience in Bennington.”

(Photo by Ed Tibbetts)A legal organization focused on freedom of expression filed a new legal brief Monday asking the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to keep the injunction in place blocking Iowa’s ban on books that are not “age appropriate” from K-12 schools.
PEN America, a nonprofit focused on freedom of expression, filed the brief in support of the legal challenge mounted by publishers including Penguin Random House, the Iowa State Education Association and several authors, including Laurie Halse Anderson, John Green and Jodi Picoult. The plaintiffs are challenging Senate File 496, a 2023 Iowa law that  prohibits books depicting sex acts from being available in K-12 school libraries, as well as banning programs, materials and instruction related to gender identity and sexual orientation for K-6 students.
U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher has ruled to block enforcement of multiple portions of the law, including the prohibition on books involving sexual or LGBTQ+ content. But that injunction could be overturned by the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals, which had ruled in August 2024 that Locher’s “analysis” of the case was not correct and returned it to the district court.

PEN America argued in its brief for the appeals court to keep the latest injunction in place, saying the law “undermines public education systems in violation of the First Amendment by denying students’ rights to receive information, infringing on authors’ free speech rights, and misapplying the obscenity doctrine.”
“The law requires the removal of hundreds of books from public school libraries  regardless of the age of the student reader or the books’ value as a whole — both of which considerations are required by the First Amendment,” the brief states.
Iowa public schools had removed 3,400 books from school shelves by the end of 2024, according to the Des Moines Register, including classic literature like “1984” by George Orwell, “The Bluest Eye” by Toni Morrison and “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” by Maya Angelou. Many school districts have expressed uncertainty about what books can be available in schools under the law, as the Iowa Department of Education had declined to respond to advocates asking for more clarification about “age appropriate” materials as defined by SF 496.
Locher wrote the law “places the burden on local school districts and school officials to determine whether a book is permitted,” and that the measure was “facially unconstitutional” when looking at previous court precedents on First Amendment cases.
In the Monday court brief, PEN America staff attorney Elly Brinkley echoed these concerns, writing that laws that target any and all descriptions of sex in literature have been “squarely condemned” by the U.S. courts in previous decisions, as it abridges students’ First Amendment rights to receive information.
Elly Brinkley, PEN America staff attorney, said in a statement: “This sweeping Iowa law robs young people of literary classics that have offered sustenance and meaning to generations of readers. These restrictions deprive Iowa students of books that help them understand the world in which we live. We cannot allow a vocal minority of censorship proponents (to) have the final say over what tens of thousands of students can read in school.”
In addition to the lawsuit filed by Penguin Random House, ISEA and authors, there is another challenge filed by Lambda Legal and ACLU of Iowa on behalf of students, teachers and the organization Iowa Safe Schools. The action is based on the law’s ban on books and material available in school libraries and classrooms, in addition to challenging the ban on “any program, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating to gender identity or sexual orientation to students in kindergarten through grade six.”
Locher ruled in May that parts of the law challenged by Lambda Legal and the ACLU are also unconstitutional, issuing an injunction in May ruling that K-6 students must be allowed to join Gender Sexuality Alliances (GSA) and other student groups related to LGBTQ+ identities and that school districts and teachers must be allowed to provide instruction and materials that contain references to gender identity and sexual orientation, though they cannot be focused on these topics.

At least 135 people have been confirmed dead in the disaster, according to KXAN, while at least four others are still listed as missing.
Indiana Task Force One, composed mostly of firefighters, collectively has hundreds of hours of training in specialized rescue techniques for floods, structural collapses and more. It’s one of just 28 such squads across the country.

While Indiana Task Force One members were away, Gov. Mike Braun launched an Emergency Alert Task Force to evaluate Indiana’s emergency systems and warning capacity. A report with recommendations is due to him by November 1.
However, Task Force One hasn’t received any state funding since 1992, though it’s busier than ever before responding to the ever-increasing number of weather-related emergencies.

Phil Scott’s weekly press conference held at the Central Vermont Technical Center in Barre on Tuesday, June 11. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
The Trump administration on Friday announced the release of the remaining $18 million in federal education funding for the Vermont’s Agency of Education and the state’s local school districts.
Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders, in a press release issued on Friday, said the agency will begin their regular process for distributing the funds to school districts on Monday.
The U.S. Department of Education announcement comes less than a month after the agency first announced it was withholding more than $6 billion in funding for six federal grant programs nationwide. The federal government withheld roughly $26 million from Vermont school districts that help fund after-school and summer programs, and English language instruction.
A portion of those dollars also helps fund Vermont’s adult learning centers, institutions which offer residents a path to earn a high school diploma or GED certificate, as well as English language classes and workforce development programs.

In the statement, Saunders called the release of the dollars “a positive development for our most vulnerable students.”
“Vermont school districts will now be equipped to begin the school year knowing they have the resources to staff critical positions and provide the meaningful and tangible opportunities that these dollars represent,” Saunders said. “Vermont schools deserve to have confidence that they will be supported with resources that have been promised.”
The release of the funds ends weeks of uncertainty for the state’s school districts. School board officials set their fiscal year 2026 budgets assuming the federal funding would be in place. Then on June 30 — just hours before the start of the new fiscal year on July 1, when the funds have historically been made available to states — the Trump administration announced they were withholding the money pending a review.
The transfer of the money to the state also brings to an end a brief hiring freeze implemented in the state’s Agency of Education earlier this month. With the federal funding restored, the agency “now has the flexibility to begin hiring for vacant roles,” said agency spokesperson Toren Ballard. 
“Let’s be clear: Today the administration solved a problem of its own making by finally releasing funding for our public schools that it illegally and unconstitutionally withheld,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, said in a release on Friday after the Department of Education’s announcement.
Two weeks after the funding freeze was announced, Attorney General Charity Clark joined 24 other states in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for “unlawfully freezing” those federal funds.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education announced it was releasing some of the funding allocated for Vermont — roughly $6.5 million — specifically for afterschool programs.
But districts and adult learning centers were kept in limbo, with more than $18 million in funding still withheld. The Winooski School District, for example, relies on those federal funds as a high-poverty district.
Sarah Haven, the director of finance and operations for the Winooski School District, said the district was thankful the funding was being restored and was “once again supporting local budgets.”
“We’re relieved to move forward without disruption and hope that future decisions will protect the stability our educators, students, and families rely on,” Haven said. “We look forward to a wonderful school year.”

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers  from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
‘A scarlet letter’: States aim to end stigma of doctors seeking mental health care

“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture where officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, though most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health issues in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health issues.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would negatively affect an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers also disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that –– to provide those services,” Archbold said.

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces, and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing, and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Calls for action
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-28 20:42:36+00:00,CT Mirror,"Report: Gap between CEO and worker pay is widening in US, CT",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/28/ceo-pay-disparity-executive-paywatch-ct/,"The report shows that 14 Connecticut S&P 500 CEOs earned an average of $19,511,538, while the median wage for workers in CT was $58,400.","In 2024, CEOs at America’s leading companies saw pay increases that outpaced the wage growth of employees, widening pay disparities across the country and in Connecticut, according to a new report released by the nation’s largest collective of labor unions. 
In its annual Executive Paywatch report released last week, the AFL-CIO found that CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased 7% in 2024 to an average of $18.9 million in compensation, while median worker pay increased 3% over the same period. The report found that the average CEO pay was 285 times higher than national median worker pay of $49,500, up from the 268-1 ratio the report found last year. 
When it comes to executive compensation, the “average CEO pay is growing and fueling economic inequality,” the report notes. 
While the pay disparity between CEOs and workers differs by industry and region, disparities are seen nationwide, including in Connecticut, which has seen rising inequality as extreme wealth and poverty exist in close proximity, according to the report.  
The numbers in the report are not an apples-to-apples comparison, however. The report looks at average CEO compensation, which can include CEO salary, bonuses, stock options, and other incentives. For workers, the report uses data on median pay, not average pay, from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Average calculations can be highly swayed by extreme outliers, where median calculations are less susceptible to extremes.
A recent analysis by the Associated Press of 344 executives of companies in the S&P 500 and found a median CEO pay of $17.1 million.
Also, the worker data focuses on the annual median wage for workers across all occupations. This data does not include the cost of additional employee benefits like health insurance and retirement accounts, and it includes part-time workers. 
Still, the AFL-CIO argues that the report offers helpful insights into disparities between the country’s highest earners and people making far less. Other research into CEO and worker pay, including an annual study by the Associated Press, has also found evidence of a significant pay gap that has grown considerably wider since the 1980s. 
“These numbers only begin to scratch the surface of how runaway executive pay is fueling economic inequality,” Fred Redmond, the AFL-CIO’s secretary-treasurer, told reporters last Wednesday.
The federal budget reconciliation bill signed into law earlier this month could widen the gap even more, the report claims. Under the new law, tax cuts first enacted in 2017 will be made permanent. The law also cuts funding for social safety net programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
The report estimates that, with the tax cuts, the average S&P 500 CEO could save around $489,000 a year. A worker making between $53,300 and $92,000 a year, meanwhile, would save roughly $1,510 a year under the tax cuts. 
“In order to give massive tax cuts for the wealthy, this budget increases the deficit, will kill jobs, make health care more expensive and create a long wake of economic pain for the rest of us,” Redmond said. 
CEO-worker pay disparities in Connecticut
The AFL-CIO report provides a range of data on CEO and median worker pay, including breakdowns by industry and by state. 
The report shows that 14 Connecticut S&P 500 CEOs earned an average of $19.5 million and a median of $17.9 million, while the median worker in the state made $58,400, creating a 334-1 ratio between the two. The 66 chief executives of all Connecticut companies listed in the report had an average salary of about $9 million and a median salary of about $6 million.
When the AFL-CIO broadened the numbers to include CEOs outside the S&P 500, it found that Connecticut CEOs in its data set collected an average of $8,516,044. The disparity between CEOs and the median worker decreased to 146-to-1. 
The AFL-CIO report adds another point to a growing pool of data highlighting income and wealth inequality in Connecticut, which despite having a higher median household income and higher median wage than many states, has still seen significant disparities between its highest earners and everyone else. 
Last week, a report from the nonprofit CT Voices for Children examined how the state’s stagnant job growth, high number of unfilled job openings and labor force declines could be boosted by making wages fairer and reducing wage inequality. The organization argued that increasing wages, especially for lower and middle class earners, could help make the state more affordable for working families.
Another report released earlier this month by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which advocates for affordable housing across the county, offered insights into the growing gap between wages and rental housing costs in the state. 
In the 2025 edition of its annual “Out of Reach” report, the NLIHC found that many workers struggle to afford housing across the country, and that “resources for affordable housing remain insufficient to support the nation’s lowest-paid and lowest-income renters,” a group that is disproportionately likely to be female, Black, Native American or Latino.
This is also true in states with higher minimum wages like Connecticut, which raised its minimum wage to $16.35 earlier this year. 
Despite that being far higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25, it still isn’t enough to afford a one or two bedroom apartment in the state. The NLIHC notes that a Connecticut worker would need to make $28.68 per hour to afford a one-bedroom at the HUD fair market rent rate of $1,491. To afford a two bedroom at a fair market rent of $1,842, the same worker would need to make $35.42 per hour — over two times the state minimum wage. 
The report finds that the difference between wages and housing costs make Connecticut the 11th most expensive state for housing in the country. Without higher wages or more affordable housing, single minimum wage and lower-income workers must work more hours, in some cases more than 80 hours a week, to afford housing in the state.
Chris DiPentima, president and CEO of Connecticut’s Business and Industry Association, did not directly respond to a request for comment about the wage disparities highlighted by the recent reports. But DiPentima noted in a statement to The Connecticut Mirror that while the state’s higher median wage and its educated workforce are an asset, it also faces a labor force decline that must be addressed.
For DiPentima, addressing that issue will require a multifaceted approach, one that includes improving affordability in the state. 
“The high cost of living is a significant impediment for Connecticut’s workforce,” he said. “It’s critical that public and private sector leaders work closely and identify creative, sustainable solutions for making this a more affordable and attractive place to live, work, and do business.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_5427-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-28 16:56:44.570202

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

(Miles Maguire | courtesy of the photographer)Republican lawmakers are proposing a state law to  limit tuition increases after the University of Wisconsin system approved another tuition hike earlier this month. 
The Board of Regents voted earlier this month to increase tuition by 5% at most UW campuses. UW-Green Bay is the exception with a 4% tuition increase after opting out of an additional 1%. UW-River Falls received a 5.8% increase in tuition to help support student success initiatives. 
According to the UW system, the increase will be an average of about $382. 
The draft bill, coauthored by Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) and Rep. David Murphy (R-Greenville), would prohibit the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents from increasing undergraduate tuition by more than the consumer price index increase in a given year. The authors said the latest increases were “roughly double the increase in the Consumer Price Index over the past year.” 
“Now more than ever, the Legislature must implement a common sense law placing controls on these types of skyrocketing tuition increases,” the lawmakers wrote in a cosponsorship memo. “That’s why we are again introducing legislation to cap tuition and fee increases for in-state Wisconsin undergraduates at levels no higher than the rate of inflation.”
UW spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in a statement responding to the bill that the UW is “among the most affordable across the U.S.” 
“It is critical that we have the flexibility to maintain the quality that students deserve and parents expect,” Pitsch said. 
UW President Jay Rothman proposed the tuition increases earlier this month following the signing of the new state budget, which provided a little over $250 million to the UW system — an amount that fell below the requests the system had said would be necessary to avoid tuition increases. 
“After a decade of a tuition freeze and lagging state aid, we believe we have struck a balance for students and families with this proposal and the recent state investments in the UWs as part of the 2025-27 biennial budget,” Rothman said in a statement at the time.
This is the third consecutive tuition increase since the end of the 10-year tuition freeze — a trend that comes as state funding makes up a smaller portion of the UW system’s budget.
State funding currently makes up about a fifth of the UW’s total revenue. In contrast, state general purpose revenue made up 41.8% of the UW System’s budget in 1984-85. 
Regent Ashok Rai said that even with the state investment, there continues to be a gap between the funding and the UW system’s ability to keep up with inflation and compensation increases for faculty and staff. 
“The proposed tuition rates will ensure that UWs remain affordable compared to our neighboring peers,” Rai said.
According to the UW, its tuition increased just 7.7% from 2015 to 2025 — a rate below the tuition increases for its peers in other states, which had tuition increases ranging from 21.7% to 28.8% over the 10 years.

Larry Rhoden speaks to reporters on July 28, 2025, at the Public Safety Administration Building in Sioux Falls. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The state of South Dakota will spend more time and money in the coming months to police the streets of Sioux Falls, and to help federal agents deport immigrants who lack legal status.
The work will support the state’s fast-growing city, Gov. Larry Rhoden said, and help the state’s seven federal immigration agents add to their current arrest tally of 262 in the state since President Donald Trump took office.
Rhoden made the announcement Monday morning at the Sioux Falls Public Safety Administration Building.
The governor spoke from a podium that was adorned with a logo. The logo included a depiction of a buffalo, in sunglasses and a state trooper hat, and the words “Operation Prairie Thunder.”
Representatives of state, county, city and federal law enforcement agencies fanned out from either side of the governor in the center’s press room, alongside prosecutors, state Department of Corrections officials, Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken and Sioux Falls Republican state Rep. Greg Jamison.
“This is a comprehensive, targeted public safety initiative to protect South Dakotans,” Rhoden told reporters.
ICE support from prison system, National Guard
On the immigration side, Rhoden told the press he’d committed the prison system and state’s part-time military force to help federal agents deport people living in the country illegally.

Six members of the South Dakota National Guard will do paperwork on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a move Rhoden said would free up those agents to search streets and communities for people to detain and deport. Three will work in Sioux Falls, three in Rapid City.
The prison system, meanwhile, will move to sign what’s known as a 287(g) agreement with ICE for jail and detention, and offer transportation of detainees to and from the regional ICE headquarters in Minneapolis. Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko said the state could continue to both move all the inmates it needs to and offer courier services to ICE – state officers would first need to complete federal training, she said – without adding additional transport officers.
The state has identified 11 people in DOC custody for likely removal, Rhoden said. Most are nonviolent offenders nearing the end of their prison terms, he said, “so it doesn’t make sense for us to continue to hold them.”
Each will first have their case reviewed by the state Board of Pardons and Paroles. Inmates facing possible deportation typically serve out their sentences prior to the commencement of deportation proceedings, and would need to be paroled to be released to ICE. For those among the 11 in state prison custody who committed violent offenses and have time remaining on those sentences, Rhoden said he hopes ICE will work with their home counties to make sure they’re detained upon arrival.
Sam Olson, field office director for ICE, said the moves from Rhoden are a welcome counterweight to the efforts of uncooperative “sanctuary cities” and jurisdictions across the U.S.
The initiative will help ICE “extend the reach we have,” he said.
The Highway Patrol signed a 287(g) agreement with ICE earlier this year, as did the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation. The Minnehaha County and Hughes County sheriff’s offices have 287(g) agreements at the local level.
Highway Patrol: Saturation patrols, extra troopers
On the Sioux Falls policing side of the initiative, South Dakota state troopers will perform two saturation patrols per month in the city and surrounding areas. The patrol will use its helicopter as necessary to aid in drug law enforcement, and help the prison system’s parole absconder apprehension team to find and detain parolees who’ve stopped checking in. 
South Dakota Attorney General clarifies scope of immigration enforcement agreement

The 10-15 additional saturation patrol troopers come on top of the eight additional troopers Rhoden stationed permanently in Sioux Falls in February, at a one-time cost of $1 million and an ongoing cost of $1.4 million a year. 
Sioux Falls officials and lawmakers have raised concerns – and proposed bills in Pierre – to address illegal street racing in the city in recent years. On top of targeting drug dealers and gang activity, Rhoden said, “this should also help with those efforts.”
Mayor TenHaken said violent and property crime in the city are at a five-year low, but said he welcomes the help to stay ahead of the city’s population growth. 
“About a third of the state’s population is now in the Sioux Falls metro area, so in Sioux Falls, we really value our partnerships,” the mayor said.
Rhoden said the Highway Patrol would absorb the additional cost. The state hasn’t calculated a dollar amount, he said, adding “I don’t think that’s significant enough to where we identified where that would come from, but I assumed it would be general fund dollars.”

Last week, Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, announced that an investigation was underway and that he had tasked the Office of Management and Enterprise Services with looking into the “bizarre and troubling situation” where two state Board of Education members reported seeing naked women on the television screen in Walters’ office during a July 24 executive session  
The Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office has assigned an investigator to the case who will determine if anything illegal happened, Brilbeck said.
The probe is “very much in the preliminary stages,” he said.
An Office of Management and Enterprise Services spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Friday, The Oklahoman and NonDoc reported that State Board of Education members Ryan Deatherage and Becky Carson reported seeing the images. 
Board members have said Walters was confronted about the images during the closed door meeting and has not apologized.

Walters has been a vocal critic of pornographic materials and other sexualized content in public schools and sought to ban some books that he said contained it from school library shelves.
“Any suggestion that a device of mine was used to stream inappropriate content on the television set is categorically false,” Walters said in a statement released Sunday. “I have no knowledge of what was on the TV screen during the alleged incident, and there is absolutely no truth to any implication of wrongdoing.”
He has called the allegations “politically motivated attacks” by a broken establishment afraid of real change.
The board has questioned Walters’ actions in recent months, including his authority to require schools to provide free lunches to all students and about a controversial test he wants to require California and New York teachers to take.

Free.,European imports to see 15% tariffs after Trump strikes trade deal,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/european-imports-see-15-tariffs-after-trump-strikes-trade-deal,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and European Union leaders announced a trade framework over the weekend, just days ahead of Trump’s self-imposed Friday deadline to increase import taxes and his emergency tariffs come under scrutiny in federal appeals court Thursday.Under the agreement, a 15% tariff will be applied to all products, with some exceptions, coming into the U.S. from the 27 member nations that make up the EU.The 15% rate will also apply to automobiles, down from the 25% levy on foreign vehicles that Trump ordered in April. Trump’s 50% sectoral tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum will remain unchanged for the EU. The deal exempts certain products, including aircraft, from tariffs altogether.Tariffs are import taxes paid to the U.S. government by businesses and other buyers that import foreign goods.“Fifteen percent is not to be underestimated, but it was the best we could get,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters during a press conference Sunday.Similar to the deal Trump announced with Japan on July 23, the EU has agreed to invest $600 billion in the United States over Trump’s term. The bloc of nations has also agreed to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy, including liquid natural gas, over the next three years as a way to wean off of Russian fossil fuels.‘Fundamentally rebalancing’The White House touted the deal as “fundamentally rebalancing the economic relationship between the world’s two largest economies,” in a press release issued Monday.The U.S. imported more goods from the EU than it exported by about $235.8 billion in 2024, according to Census data.Trump had threatened to raise what he describes as “reciprocal” tariffs — tariffs on products outside sectoral categories of steel, aluminum and vehicles —  to 30% by Aug. 1 on products from Europe, Japan and numerous other trading partners.Trump set the date as the new deadline for his “Liberation Day” tariffs to take effect. The president announced the tariffs in early April and then promptly paused them after markets plummeted around the globe. The episode triggered a trade war with China, during which U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods peaked at 145% before the two parties agreed to negotiate.Appeals case looms

On what the president described as “Liberation Day” on April 2, Trump heralded a universal 10% tariff on all foreign products, plus staggering additional so-called reciprocal import taxes on countries across the globe that carry trade imbalances with the U.S.Trump justified the steep duties by declaring trade imbalances a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.In February, Trump became the first president to trigger tariffs under the 1977 emergency powers law when he increased import taxes on Canada, Mexico and China in response to illegal fentanyl smuggling.The emergency tariffs are at the center of a case that will go before the U.S. Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit Thursday.The case stems from two lawsuits, now consolidated, filed by a handful of businesses and a dozen Democratic state attorneys general who argued the president doesn’t have authority to impose tariffs under the emergency law.The U.S. Court of International Trade struck down Trump’s emergency tariffs as unconstitutional on May 28.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among the states that brought the suit.V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, led the business plaintiffs. Others included a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.Upon appeal from the White House, the Federal Circuit allowed Trump’s tariffs to remain in place while the case moved forward.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-07-28 16:56:44.570202

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)In June of 2024 during the 118th Congress, House Republicans failed to renew the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) despite two attempts by Senate Republicans, leaving victims of nuclear testing and uranium mining without compensation for related health conditions. As affected people in Utah and other Western states struggled to support themselves with their health conditions, communities rallied for RECA’s reinstatement, collecting hundreds of public comments and conducting meetings with Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, and Rep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, to discuss the importance and positive impacts of RECA.
RECA was initially passed in October of 1990 and provides compensation for victims of nuclear weapons testing, known as “downwinders,” and people employed in the uranium industry who developed certain eligible diseases as a result of that exposure. However, compensation was limited to only a handful of Western states and downwind counties, and only covered a few health conditions.
In mid-June of this year, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced that expansions to RECA would be included in the controversial Budget Reconciliation Bill — also known as “the Big Beautiful Bill” by members of the Republican Party. 
The Budget Reconciliation Bill focuses primarily on supplying  $4.5 trillion in tax cuts for the ultra-rich. It also takes aim at immigrants, providing billions for the U.S.-Mexico border wall, additional ICE agents and Border Patrol officers, and migrant detention facility beds. Notably, health care and other life-saving services are under attack by the bill, which will result in millions of Americans losing access to Medicaid and food stamps. The bill will also rapidly phase out Biden-era tax credits for wind and solar, driving up energy costs and making the energy grid less reliable. This bill will add $4.1 trillion to the national debt, something that directly clashes with the Trump administration’s stated goals. Overall the bill will harm everyday Utahns to pay for tax cuts for billionaires. The RECA expansion is a small but notable exception that will benefit Utahns and Americans across the West. 
The provision will expand areas eligible for compensation for nuclear downwind radiation to all of Utah, New Mexico, and Idaho, as well as to Arizona’s Mohave county; Nevada’s downwind coverage areas will remain the same. Exposure eligibility dates will be extended from 1958 through to November of 1962. Compensation for on-site participants and “downwinders” will also be increased to $100,000, from $75,000 and $50,000 respectively. Certain communities in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska impacted by radioactive waste will be provided coverage as well. For uranium miners, coverage is expanded to other mining roles and additional health impacts that were previously uncovered. It is also extended to workers affected between the years of 1971 and 1990 who were previously left without coverage under the prior parameters of RECA. 
These provisions will greatly benefit individuals affected by nuclear radiation and provide relief to many Utahns and others who have been left without compensation since RECA expired in June of 2024. The RECA expansions will particularly benefit residents of New Mexico, a primary location for nuclear weapons testing, which did not have downwinder coverage under RECA prior to the expansion. Native American residents of these areas have been disproportionately impacted by the effects of nuclear testing and have for long gone without proper reparations.
Though these provisions will be greatly beneficial, there is much that is left out of the RECA expansion that was desired by Utahns. Previous successful claimants are not eligible to receive the difference between their first claim and the updated $100,000 claim. As coverage is expanded to many impacted areas, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, and Guam are all left out of the downwind expansion. There is also no proposed study on the human and ecological health at the Amchitka nuclear test site in Alaska, where the U.S. government detonated nuclear weapons in the late 1960s and where the effects of nuclear radiation can still be seen.
The RECA expansion is a small positive in a very grim piece of legislation. It is ironic that this expansion, which Utahns and other communities have been fighting for so long to secure, is included in a harmful piece of legislation with the express aim of restricting health care from so many. It is one benefit for certain Americans while so many others suffer. This RECA expansion will benefit a handful of people who need the additional support that it would potentially provide; it is welcome that this RECA expansion has been passed, but it should not be forgotten that it arrives as so many Americans lose access to health care and other vital services.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tina-Cordova_082124-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 16:56:44.570202

This is California’s 35th suit against the Trump administration.,"In summary
The Trump administration told states to provide the data by July 30 or risk losing federal funding to administer the program. This is California’s 35th suit against the Trump administration.



California, 18 other Democrat-led states and Washington, D.C. are suing the Trump administration to halt the U.S. Department of Agriculture from collecting sensitive information about people who receive federal food vouchers, known as SNAP.
The Trump administration told states to provide the data by July 30 or risk losing federal funding to administer the program. California receives $1.3 billion annually to distribute about $12 billion a year to 5 million residents who rely on the food vouchers, called CalFresh in California. About 13% of the state’s population receives the aid.“The purpose of what the Trump administration is doing here is to target immigrant communities,” said Michigan’s Attorney General Dana Nessel, during a press conference today. She said Trump’s actions “send a chilling effect to American citizens, and to tell them that if they apply for programs that they are perfectly entitled to under law, their most personal and sensitive data is going to be shared with all kinds of people, and it’s going to have the impact, and I think it already is, of scaring people away from seeking these increased incredibly important programs.”
Residents without lawful legal status in the U.S. are not eligible for SNAP benefits. However, during Trump’s first term, he proposed eliminating benefits even for “mixed-status” families where at least one person in a household lacks legal status. 
In another example of policies that put California at odds with the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on immigrants living in the U.S., the state has tried to expand food benefits to some immigrants without legal status. In 2022, California became the first state in the nation to offer about $165 a month in food benefits to about 35,000 immigrants, mostly to recent green card holders. That expansion was part of the California Food Assistance Program, or CFAP, a state-funded version of food stamps.
Advocates for that effort argued many farmworkers toil in fields for decades at low wages, providing food to the rest of the nation, and then are unable to buy enough to eat, especially when they become senior citizens. 
Why states are suing
Attorneys general that are filing the suit argue that the Trump administration’s policy is “arbitrary and capricious,” violates the 10th Amendment that protects states’ rights as well as various privacy laws.“We’re seeing a number of different cases recently where there’s this Spending Clause violation, where new conditions that Congress never put on the funding are being added by the executive branch after the fact,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta. “They can’t do that.” 
The suit will be filed today in the federal Northern District of California. It is the 35th time in 27 weeks that California has sued the Trump administration. 
“SNAP applicants provide their private information on the understanding, backed by long-standing state and federal laws, that their information will not be used for unrelated purposes,” Bonta said.
The Trump administration has tried to tap several state databases to quickly amass troves of sensitive personal information about hundreds of millions of people. Using that information is part of Trump’s effort to fulfill his campaign promise of carrying out the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history. 
His administration says collecting the data is aimed at preventing waste and fraud. Trump issued an executive order in March that ordered his administration to have “unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding.” In May, NPR reported that the administration sought Social Security numbers, addresses and, for one state, citizenship data, for SNAP recipients. The orders came from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and DOGE, the previously Elon Musk-led White House office that sought to slash government spending and was met with numerous lawsuits.Bonta said the Department of Agriculture “has never once asked states to turn over private and sensitive data on such a massive scale.” Now, it seeks five years of data about recipients, according to the attorneys general.
California has already sued Trump for his administration’s efforts to collect personal data from people who rely on government services. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, obtained access to people’s data held by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Health and Human Services Agency, including private medical information and other personal details about Medicaid recipients.
Nessel added that California and New York, the states leading the suit, contribute more in taxes to the federal government than they receive in federal services. 
“That’s our money,” Nessel said. “We paid tax dollars to the federal government, then the federal government, you know, routes that money back to us in the form of these essential programs.”She added: “And so when you cut off programming like SNAP, it just goes into the pockets of Trump’s friends and billionaires, but we already paid for this stuff.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/071319-Cal-Fresh-Farmers-Market-AW-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-28 16:56:44.570202

OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s Republican governor was selected to become the chair of the National Governors Association for the next year.
Gov. Kevin Stitt was tapped by his peers during their summer meeting in Colorado Springs to lead the group, which represents the leaders of 55 states, territories and commonwealths. Stitt’s term will run from 2025 to 2026.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore was selected to serve as vice chair and as the 2026-2027 chair-elect.

In a statement, Stitt said he will focus on “Reigniting the American Dream,” by highlighting stories from across the country. He said he plans to work with governors, policy experts, business leaders and philanthropists to “discuss best practices and policies that promote the American Dream for all.”

“The beautiful thing about the American Dream is that there are as many dreams as there are people,” Stitt said. “In a time where all we hear is about how divided we are, let’s remind them that we agree on this: the American Dream doesn’t need to be reimagined, it needs to be reignited. Governors are in a unique position to lead this charge. I’m grateful for the trust of my fellow Governors as we start this journey together.”
Stitt said he’ll prioritize creating economic opportunities, on-the-job educational experiences for youth and will focus on artificial intelligence.
“We all want to create a brighter future for our states, and the nation,” Moore said in a statement. “When we get together at the National Governors Association, we’re focused on whether an idea is good, not on where the idea came from. I’m looking forward to collaborating with my fellow governors to build stronger on-ramps to opportunity so every person in our states has a shot at success — no matter how they define it.”
The following governors were selected to serve on the group’s executive committee: Jared Polis, Colorado; Josh Green, Hawaii; Mike Braun, Indiana; Jeff Landry, Louisiana; Maura Healey, Massachusetts; Michelle Lujan Grisham, New Mexico; and Bill Lee, Tennessee. Polis is the immediate previous NGA chair.

Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.

That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”

Clawing back COVID-era grants

Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.

Smallpox, cholera and typhoid

Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”

A major cut in services

Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-28 20:01:24+00:00,CT Mirror,Education Dept. says it will release billions in withheld school grant money,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/28/education-release-billions-school-grant-money-trump/,The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in grants it had withheld to schools for a wide array of programs.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in withheld grants for schools, the Education Department said Friday, ending weeks of uncertainty for educators around the country who rely on the money for English language instruction, adult literacy, and other programs.
President Donald Trump’s administration had suspended more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House’s priorities.
The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, Congress members from both parties and others called for the administration to release the money. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Trump.
Last week, the Education Department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.
The Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and will begin sending the money to states next week, the Education Department said.
Republican senators pressed the Trump administration to release the money
A group of 10 Republican senators on July 16 sent a letter imploring the administration to allow the frozen education money to be sent to states, saying the withheld money supported programs and services that are critical to local communities.
“The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,” U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said Friday. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills — contributing to local economies.
In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a “ radical leftwing agenda. ”
“We share your concern,” the GOP senators had written. “However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.”
School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money.
Grants supported camps and other programs for working families
In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district’s annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children’s play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.
The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.
On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.
Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects.
The uncertainty around the funding was an unnecessary distraction for schools, said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa.
“Instead of spending the last many weeks figuring out how to improve after-school options and get our kids’ reading and math scores up, because of President Trump, communities across the country have been forced to spend their time cutting back on tutoring options and sorting out how many teachers they will have to lay off,” Murray said.
The grants that were under review included $2 billion for teachers’ professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.
It added up to millions of dollars for the nation’s largest school districts. Data available from the Census for three of the grant programs — teacher development, academic enrichment, and bilingual education — shows the Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, received $62 million in the 2022-23 school year. Philadelphia’s school district got $28 million, while Miami’s got over $24 million.
Smaller districts got more modest amounts, but they still would have represented sizable gaps in their budgets. For example, schools in Burlington, Vermont; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; and Norristown, Pennsylvania, each got more than $300 per student from the same three grant programs.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EDUCATION-TRUMP-FREEZE-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 16:56:44.570202

Robert Cameron Grant was initially charged with 21 crimes, including 14 counts of sexual exploitation of a child, connected to photos and videos of his 16-year-old girlfriend, court records said. 
Grant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted sexual exploitation of a child. 
But in appeals, Grant said he wasn’t told about the Kansas statute, informally called the Romeo & Juliet law, that would have changed his plea. 
The law provides milder criminal penalties when two teenagers engage in voluntary sexual behaviors, provided the older teen is less than 19 years old and the age difference is less than four years, among other criteria, court records said. 
Grant appealed to the Sedgwick District Court, the Kansas Court of Appeals and finally the Supreme Court before winning the chance to argue that he didn’t receive proper representation.
The Court of Appeals in September 2024, with one dissenting voice from Judge Kim Schroeder, ruled that even if the Romeo & Juliet law had been applied to Grant’s case, it would not have affected the outcome. 
“If these defenses were not available to him, then his attorney could not have been incompetent for failing to advise him of them,” Judges Karen Arnold-Burger and David Bruns wrote. 
They added, “To correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea.”
However, they did not find that a manifest injustice had been committed. On the other hand, Schroeder said that if Grant did not receive notification about all options, he should receive an evidentiary hearing. 
“To be clear, I am not saying Grant received ineffective assistance of counsel; I am just saying he has sufficiently raised a fact question for the district court to resolve after an evidentiary hearing,” Schroeder said. “Thus, I would reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Grant’s counsel discussed these matters with Grant prior to entering his pleas.”
The Supreme Court agreed with Schroeder that the Romeo and Juliet statutes could apply and could have “potentially reduced or eliminated his felony liability.”
The case will return to district court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not Grant was told about the Romeo and Juliet law.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sup-ct-grant-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 15:56:43.455855

(Photo courtesy Reno Fire Department)Hundreds of goats will mow down dead vegetation across hilly terrain in Reno over the next month in an effort to reduce wildfires in an area prone to burning.
Buildup of dead vegetation in Evens Creek, a wetland area bordered by homes, has created a wildfire hazard the Reno Fire Department hopes to mitigate by introducing 250 goats that will eat away dry brush for the next 45 days.
“They’re working all day long,” said Reno Fire Chief Dave Cochran.
The move comes as wildfire season approaches its peak this month. Wildfire season in Nevada typically lasts from late summer to early fall, but in recent years the season has lengthened due to climate change.
Last year, nearly 860 wildfires burned about 104,000 acres of land across Nevada, according to the Nevada Division of Forestry.
In northwest Reno, where thousands of houses have been built in the urban wildland interface, the impact of the fires can be especially devastating.
Northern Nevada experienced one of the most economically destructive wildfires in recent memory last year. About 20 miles south of Reno, the wind-driven Davis Fire rapidly burned through nearly 6,000 acres of land. The fire drove the evacuation of about 20,000 people and ultimately destroyed two commercial buildings and 14 homes.
With less precipitation than normal across much of Northern Nevada this spring, a prolonged heat wave, and fields of flammable grasses, the region is at greater risk of widespread wildfires this year.
“We are seeing a very high threat of wildfire, and it’s increasing every day that goes by,” Cochran said.
The goats, from High Desert Graziers in nearby Smith Valley, are bred to consume a wide variety of non-native grasses and weeds that fuel wildfires including bitterbrush, manzanita, and cheatgrass.
Those non-native grasses and weeds typically die off in the summer, unlike native species, creating dangerous fuel for wildfire.
It’s the fourth time the city has used goats for fire mitigation. Like other years, the goats will be corralled to specific areas by a temporary solar-powered electric fence, and under the watch of guard dogs.
Cochran said the dogs are also there to protect the goats from being eaten by animal predators, or stolen by humans.
“People love goats, so that’s a concern as well,” he said.
The goat grazing operation will cost the city about $67,500. It’s funded in part by state legislation passed in 2022 that allocates funding to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources for wildfire prevention, restoration, and long-term planning.
“Targeted grazing is an environmentally friendly and sustainable option for managing noxious weeds and flammable vegetation,” said Reno City Ward 2 Councilmember Naomi Duerr. “We’re proud to continue this creative approach.”
Wildfire managers say it takes a suite of approaches to prevent wildfires, including manual brush clearing, herbicides, and prescribed burns.
Goats have proven to be a cost-effective way to clear dry vegetation in difficult to reach terrain like steep bluffs and cliffs near homes.
“It’s low tech, and it’s very cost-effective. They target exactly what we need,” Cochran said.
Studies looking at whether goats’ grazing can reduce the severity or impact of wildfires are scarce, but some research does suggest targeted grazing significantly reduces the grasses and weeds they goats were introduced to control.
In Arizona, some scientists have observed that land cleared of excess vegetation by goats acts as fire breaks and can stop wildfires in their tracks.
Anecdotally, Cochran said goats have had positive, long-lasting effects on previous areas they grazed.
“Goats are a great tool to do that. They work from dawn till dusk. They actually eat non-native and invasive species of plants. They just take it down to the dirt,” Cochran said.
Despite the positive impact of goats, Cochran emphasized the need for federal action when it comes to wildfire response and mitigation.
Ongoing cuts, funding freezes and hiring pauses brought on by President Donald Trump’s executive orders shrinking the federal workforce have weakened the nation’s already strained firefighting force by hitting support staff who play crucial roles in preventing and battling wildfires.
The Trump administration stated the U.S. Forest Service has reached 99% of its firefighting hiring goals, but documents obtained by ProPublica show a high vacancy rate, as well as internal concern among top officials responsible for wildfire response.
“There’s no department in the country that can handle these giant fires by themselves. You need local resources, state resources, but you also need a lot of federal resources, and if they’re not funded, that puts a dent in our ability to respond to these fires. We are keeping an eye on that. We’re very concerned,” Cochran said.

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced Monday that his office is opening an investigation against the “climate cartel” for alleged violations of the state’s consumer-protection or antitrust laws.
In a press release, Uthmeier said his office has issued subpoenas to CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) and the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), neither of which immediately responded to Florida Phoenix’s requests for comment.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in the release. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift.”
“ESG” is an acronym for  environmental, social, and corporate governance, criteria sometimes used in gauging whether to invest in a company. The theory is that social responsibility is good for business, but some conservatives consider the approach “woke.”
“We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers,” Uthmeier said.
CDP is an international nonprofit the operates an independent environmental disclosure system that allows companies, capital markets, cities, states, and regions “to manage their environmental impacts,” according to CDP’s website. The organization boasts that 1,000 cities, states, and regions have disclosed environmental information.
SBTi, an acronym for science-based target initiatives, is a company that develops standards, tools, and guidance for companies to set greenhouse gas  emission reduction targets in line with what is needed to  reach net-zero by 2050. SBTi was co-founded by CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, We Mean Business Coalition, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
According to the SBTi 2023 Monitoring Report “any profits generated by SBTi Services Limited will be gifted to the charity.”
The AG’s press release says Uthmeier’s investigation will examine “deceptive trade practices” and potential antitrust violations, including whether coordination between CDP, financial institutions, and investment services constitutes unlawful market manipulation; and whether CDP’s efforts to pressure or punish companies that don’t participate is anticompetitive.
“Florida will continue defending free enterprise and protecting consumers from fraudulent ESG schemes masquerading as science,” the release says.

(Photo by Perry Beeman/ Iowa Capital Dispatch)My family has called Davis County home for 185 years, all the way back to when William D. Evans and William Henson climbed down from their wagons in 1839 and 1840, a half-dozen years before Iowa became a state.
Evanses, Hensons and their neighbors were on the town square in Bloomfield in 1877 when the cornerstone was nudged into place in the new county courthouse. Construction of the grand stone building with its soaring clock tower was a testament by those pioneers that this part of rural America, and the new county seat town, needed a home for local government and a fitting gathering space for meetings, speeches, elections and other civic events.
Voters demonstrated their faith in their local leaders when they authorized the building’s construction. The price tag came to about $60,000 — the equivalent of about $2 million in today’s money.
That courthouse is 148 years old this autumn. Davis County residents still go there to pay their taxes, get marriage licenses, record real estate deals, and make their way to the second-floor courtroom for trials and court hearings.
It is a tribute to successive generations of government officials that the picturesque building still serves the role our ancestors first envisioned in the years immediately after the end of the Civil War.
This commitment and loyalty is not unique to Davis County. You see this in places like Dubuque, Iowa City and Sioux City, too. No one has proposed — at least not seriously, and at least not lately — bulldozing the ornate Dubuque County Courthouse for a more “efficient” building, tearing down the distinguished Pentacrest buildings at the University of Iowa, or turning the eye-catching Woodbury County Courthouse in Sioux City into rubble.
But this commitment to long-term investment in government buildings hit a snag this year when the Legislature voted to demolish the Henry A. Wallace Building northwest of the Iowa Capitol. You may not recognize the building by its name. But you surely recognize the building by its signature design feature, a massive bank of gold-tinted windows that reflect the Capitol on the other side of Grand Avenue.
The office building is only 47 years old. The reason the state plans to spend about $7 million to bulldoze the building is a reflection — a poor reflection — of an all-too-common practice in our nation these days. We have become a disposable society that places more stock in acquiring, rather than maintaining, and that includes buildings as well as consumer goods.
It is one thing if corporations opt for this newer-is-better-and-less-expensive thinking. But government officials, when they ignore upkeep and maintenance, risk alienating taxpayers who pay for the courthouses, schools and office buildings.
State leaders from both political parties are guilty of this. They let Iowa taxpayers down in the name of saving money.
They ignored the Wallace building’s mounting issues, instead of dealing with them swiftly. The issues included heating and ventilation problems, air quality concerns, a leaky roof and lead contamination left from when the Department of Public Safety’s indoor shooting range was there.
The Wallace building was completed in 1978 at a cost of $10.4 million. Factoring inflation, that is about $55 million in today’s dollars.
The nonpartisan Iowa Legislative Fiscal Agency estimated it would cost $85 million to deal with the Wallace building’s maintenance issues and needed renovations. You could almost see the bulldozers approaching the building before the Legislature’s demolition authorization earlier this year.
In 2023, the state used federal Covid pandemic relief  money to buy a vacant office building on the southwest side of Des Moines, about 5 miles from the Capitol. The Department of Natural Resources and Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing moved there from the Wallace building soon after the purchase. The Department of Public Safety moved out of the Wallace building in 2007. This summer, the Department of Agriculture, the last Wallace tenant, moved to the Herbert Hoover Building southeast of the Capitol.
State officials have not decided whether to sell the Wallace land and an adjacent parking ramp after the building is demolished or hang onto the site for its long-term strategic value because of its proximity to the Capitol.
By this time next year, all that will remain of the Wallace building will be memories and photographs of its window reflections.
Of course, there also will be questions lingering whether state officials have learned any lessons from government’s failure to be a good steward of the taxpayers investment in the building through the decades.

Voters have a right to know who’s trying to influence our elections, our laws, and ultimately, our lives.
Yet despite overwhelming public support for transparency, a growing number of states are pushing so-called “donor privacy” bills that do exactly the opposite. North Carolina’s Senate Bill 416 – approved by the General Assembly and vetoed by Gov. Josh Stein — is one of them.
Senate Bill 416 is part of a nationwide strategy—backed by the corporate-funded American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)—to make it harder for the public to track political money. ALEC is a powerful political group where corporations and conservative politicians work together to write laws—often behind closed doors. These cookie-cutter bills appear in statehouses across the country, often benefiting big business and harming everyday people.
Since at least 2018, ALEC and its network have quietly advanced “privacy” legislation that creates legal shields for dark money groups. These bills use the language of civil liberties to hide the real goal: protecting wealthy donors who want to influence elections from the shadows.
In North Carolina, this effort isn’t new. Governor Roy Cooper vetoed a similar bill, Senate Bill 636, in 2021, calling it a “solution in search of a problem.” Republican Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan said the same when he vetoed an ALEC-backed version in 2018. Now the same bad policy is back, rebranded but just as dangerous.
Senate Bill 416 would restrict public disclosure of donors not only to charitable organizations like 501(c)(3)s, but also to political nonprofits like 501(c)(4)s, labor organizations under 501(c)(5), and business leagues under 501(c)(6). These are the very groups most often involved in political advocacy and campaign-adjacent activities. Under this bill, wealthy special interests have more tools to keep their spending hidden from the public–even if they’re spending millions to sway elections.
Worse, the bill opens a major new loophole. Unlike its 2021 predecessor, Senate Bill 416 removes protections that require disclosure of donors to Legal Expense Funds—a serious red flag. Under current law, politicians must disclose who’s paying for their legal bills. But under SB 416, a candidate could set up a Legal Expense Fund as a 501(c)(4) and hide every single donor. That’s a gift to corruption and a threat to fair governance.
We’ve already seen how vital transparency can be. In the last election, Judge Jefferson Griffin attempted to throw out more than 65,000 votes in a Supreme Court race. Thanks to disclosure laws, the public learned that his legal fund received $5,000 from a sitting Court of Appeals judge. That raised real concerns about judicial bias and the need for recusal. Senate Bill 416 would’ve kept that donation secret—and kept voters in the dark.
Supporters of the bill argue it’s about protecting donor privacy and preventing harassment. But the legal system already accounts for that. The U.S. Supreme Court’s rulings in NAACP v. Alabama (1958) and Buckley v. Valeo (1976) guarantee protections for individuals at real risk of retaliation. Groups facing legitimate threats can—and do—receive exemptions. This bill goes far beyond those protections. It’s not about shielding vulnerable donors. It’s about shielding political influence.
This bill isn’t about mom-and-pop donors getting harassed. It’s about making it easier for deep-pocketed interests to anonymously fund elections, policy campaigns, and legal challenges without ever being held accountable. If lawmakers are truly concerned about protecting individuals from harassment, they should codify the legal standards already laid out in NAACP v. Alabama and Buckley v. Valeo. Instead, this bill creates a sweeping exemption that disables oversight, ties the hands of regulators, and protects the powerful.
And let’s not forget the stakes. Under Senate Bill 416, state contractors could anonymously fund the very lawmakers who award them contracts. That’s not privacy—it’s a recipe for pay-to-play politics. Voters deserve better than a system that invites bribery and blocks oversight.
This playbook isn’t new. After years of watchdogs exposing dark money networks, the backlash began. A front group with ALEC ties was formed in 2018 to push “donor privacy” laws, and they’ve since distributed toolkits to help legislators sell these bills to the public. It’s a carefully orchestrated campaign to keep political money hidden while pretending it’s about protecting everyday donors.
One night around a campfire during the pandemic, my teenage daughter asked her five-year-old sister, “Are we rich?” Without hesitation, our youngest shot back, “No—we have rules. Rich people don’t have rules.” That innocent observation cuts to the core of Senate Bill 416. Is our democracy designed to serve the wealthy—or to represent we the people?
North Carolina can and must do better. We need smart, targeted reforms that shine a light on dark money—not laws that deepen the shadows. Senate Bill 416 would take us in the wrong direction, putting voters last and secret donors first.
Let’s call this bill what it is: a shield for influence-peddlers and a setback for democracy. North Carolinians deserve a government that is accountable to the people—not one that bends to the will of hidden donors and special interests. Governor Stein was right to veto Senate Bill 416. Now, it’s up to the legislature sustain that veto. Lawmakers must stand with the overwhelming majority of voters who believe in transparency and reject efforts to hide political money in the dark. Our democracy depends on it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AdobeStock_pac-dark-money.jpg,,,2025-07-28 15:56:43.455855

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)State corrections officials wrongly relied on old medical records to deny release to an incarcerated man with brain cancer, the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously ruled Monday in a case that highlights problems in how officials vet requests from sick inmates hoping to get out of prison early.
The man, identified only as M.R. in court records, applied for compassionate release in February 2023, and two doctors consulted medical records that were 29 months old to conclude that he was neither terminally ill nor permanently incapacitated, according to the ruling. The man appealed, and an appellate panel ultimately upheld the denial.
The man died in custody in June 2024, a month after he asked the state’s top court to review his case. While his death technically made his case moot, the justices decided to consider it anyway, because “the issue raised is of substantial importance and capable of repetition yet evading review,” Justice John Jay Hoffman wrote.
Attorneys supporting M.R. had sought a decision declaring that compassionate release applicants must be examined in person for doctors to decide whether they are terminally ill or permanently incapacitated, conditions required for early medical release under the Compassionate Release Act. But the justices found that while the law requires “examinations,” it is silent on whether those evaluations must be in person, Hoffman wrote.
“If the Legislature intended that diagnoses be rendered solely through ‘physical’ examinations, it would have stated as much, as it has done on numerous other occasions,” Hoffman wrote, citing workers’ compensation and other laws that require “physical examination.”
Hoffman added that while reviewing medical records counts as “examinations” under the law’s verbiage, the law also requires such examinations to be timely. He pointed to a provision in the law that notes compassionate release requires a determination of “whether the inmate is eligible for compassionate release.”
“Due to the potential for dynamic and unpredictable changes in the condition of inmates suffering from rapidly declining physical or mental health … contemporaneity is essential, particularly for a statute written in the present tense,” Hoffman wrote.
Hoffman also knocked the doctors’ records, noting that their only explanation for deducing that M.R. wasn’t physically incapacitated was that he did not require 24-hour care.
The justices, consequently, decided the Department of Corrections’ denial of M.R.’s request was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable.

Hoffman quoted from a Murphy administration press release from 2020 to chastise the department for denying M.R.’s request.
“This Court cannot rubber-stamp agency decisions that rely upon conclusory findings that fail to comport with the contemporaneity required by the CRA. Nor can we ignore the basic underpinning of compassionate release: ‘Our treatment of those within our prisons is a reflection of our humanity,’” Hoffman wrote.
Daniel Sperrazza, a department spokesman, did not respond to a request for comment.
The state Office of the Public Defender represented M.R., and the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey filed a supporting brief and also argued M.R.’s cause before the court.
Monday’s decision was one of several the state Supreme Court has issued in recent years seeking to clarify the Compassionate Release Act. The act, which went into effect in early 2021, replaced a similar law, passed in 1997, that was so restrictive hardly anyone used it.
In 2023, the justices decreed that judges can deny compassionate release in ‘extraordinary’ cases, such as those involving defendants who were convicted of particularly heinous, cruel, or depraved offenses, those whose victims were vulnerable because of disability or age, and those whose crimes targeted government or law enforcement.
In 2022, they clarified what “permanent physical incapacity” means, ruling that gravely ill people seeking freedom under the law don’t have to prove they are wholly, permanently physically incapacitated to get out of prison.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich and a Republican colleague are seeking a clearer picture of how wildfires affect homeowners’ access to insurance, as insurers in New Mexico and across the country increasingly cancel or refuse to renew policies. 
Heinrich of New Mexico and U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-Montana) introduced the “Wildfire Insurance Coverage Study Act of 2025” last Thursday, a bill that would empower the Government Accountability Office to conduct a wide-ranging study of wildfires’ effect on private insurers’ behavior over the last decade. 
“I’m hearing from more and more New Mexicans who’ve seen their insurance premiums skyrocket, lost coverage entirely or been priced out of protecting their homes. That is completely unacceptable,” Heinrich said in a news release.
The bill would require the GAO to create a detailed picture of wildfire risk across the country, as well as examine where and whether insurers’ have raised rates, declined to provide coverage or pulled entirely out of certain markets. It will also examine what state interventions, if any, have worked, according to the legislation.
NM GOP and Democrats say state needs to fix home insurance, as disasters upend private market

“Families deserve fair, transparent coverage they can count on,” Heinrich said. “We need a clearer picture of how worsening wildfires and climate risks are impacting insurance companies’ decisions to raise insurance premiums.”
The bill has been referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
According to the state Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, which regulates and monitors insurance products offered across New Mexico, 13% of state properties are uninsured, which is the second-highest rate in the country, behind only Mississippi. An actuary at the OSI testified earlier this year that the state’s top 10 insurers increased premiums 60%, on average, since 2022.
The OSI has not reported any insurers pulling out of New Mexico entirely, but said in a news release earlier this month that the state’s top 10 insurers declined to renew more than 10,000 policies between Jan. 1, 2021 and July 1, 2024. The regulator observed a “significant jump” in non-renewals in 2023, a rate that remained high in 2024.
Fires making home insurance unaffordable, impossible, NM lawmakers say

Also, a recent, first-of-its-kind study from the Federal Insurance Office examined insurance data in about 200 of New Mexico’s roughly 260 ZIP codes. Among other findings, researchers discovered that in 2022 insurance companies chose not to renew insurance policies in the state at a higher rate than the national average in 152 of the 200 ZIP codes it analyzed.
In 2022, New Mexico suffered a historic wildfire season, with the two biggest-ever wildfires in state history, including the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon in northern New Mexico and the Black in southern New Mexico. Each burned more than 300,000 acres. 
Ruidoso-area lawmakers have also said homeowners have increasingly complained about premium hikes and cancellations since the South Fork and Salt fires last summer.
The federal study also found that, in 21 ZIP codes across the state, private insurers paid out more in claims and other expenses than they generated in premiums.
During the most recent legislative session, several proposals aimed at revamping the state’s so-called “insurer of last resort,” known as the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements plan, were considered to make it cover more people and provide more coverage. Additional proposals would have shaken up the board overseeing the FAIR plan, which is now composed of insurance industry leaders, to require it to include a climate scientist and a disaster expert, among other changes.
The legislation did not pass, but the FAIR plan board did vote to increase coverage limits from $350,000 to $750,000 for private homes and up to $1 million for commercial properties, which is in line the failed legislation. 
Why the state’s insurance regulator thinks SB81 will save New Mexicans’ homes from wildfire

Increasing the coverage cap to $750,000 is expected to increase the number of FAIR plan holders from about 7,000 to about 11,000, state insurance officials have said.
OSI Superintendent Alice Kane has said she is seeking additional changes to the FAIR plan, which is only offered to homeowners who have been denied coverage in the private market. Changes include increasing coverage limits for commercial property owners and also implementing requirements that FAIR plan recipients mitigate wildfire risk to their properties. 
Kane will provide additional updates to an interim legislative committee Wednesday in Los Alamos at 12:45 p.m. Kendra Zacharias, the chair of the FAIR plan board, is tentatively expected to join her, according to a meeting agenda.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0116-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-28 15:56:43.455855

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Josh Holstein, a 23-year-old state delegate representing Boone County, is the new leader of the state’s Republican Party. Holstein was elected chairman during the summer meeting of the state executive committee in Morgantown Saturday. 
“It was an honor. It was obviously an honor,” Holstein told West Virginia Watch Monday. “I’m still humbled, but we worked hard and we had a lot of great discussions. 
“Folks, I think they see past age,” he said. “And they see willingness, drive and somebody that’s actually eager to make positive change. I’m very grateful to the members of the state executive committee for placing their trust in me.”
Holstein said increasing communication is one of his first priorities as party chair. 
“I think as a party, that’s where we failed in recent years,” he said. “Realizing and recognizing that our audience is on several different social media platforms, and people obtain news in many different ways now. Meeting people where they are, essentially, is what we’ve got to do,” he said. 
Holstein, of Ashford, is a graduate of Sherman High School and Marshall University, according to his biography from the House of Delegates. He runs an advertising firm and has a license to substitute teach. He was first elected to the House in 2020.
He joins the Republican National Committee as the youngest of its 168 members across the country, the GOP said in the news release.
Holstein said the party will also reach out to independent voters to let them know about changes to the Republican primary election next year. 
Beginning in 2026, the GOP primary will be open only to voters who are registered Republicans and will be closed to unaffiliated voters. The executive committee voted last year to close the primary as a way of encouraging voters to register as Republicans. 
Holstein said the party would also focus on county and municipal races, something that hasn’t been a major focus in recent years. 
Republicans hold the majority in both bodies of the state Legislature, the governor’s office, the state’s congressional delegation and the presidency. 
“We’re fairly dominant on the state and legislative level, obviously, but we still lack in municipal level races and on the county level,” he said. “So we’ll be focusing on that and working with our respective county chairs and senatorial district folks to accomplish those goals over the next few months.”
Holstein takes the place of former GOP chairman Matt Herridge, who stepped down effective Saturday. Herridge was appointed state commerce secretary in January.

Minnesota is expected to lose $1.4 billion in federal funding over the first four years of the law’s implementation. 
The budget law puts its tax breaks into effect this year while delaying many of its health insurance cuts until 2026, after the midterm elections. John Connolly, Minnesota’s Medicaid director, said at a press conference that the cuts and new eligibility requirements will be “a dramatic change for Minnesota.” 
“The bill specifically targets low-income adults without children, saddling them with additional paperwork, forcing more frequent administrative hoops, and imposing medical bills,” according to a DHS fact sheet on the cuts to Medicaid, which in Minnesota is known as Medical Assistance. 
The bill mandates new work reporting requirements and eligibility checks for low-income adults, which DHS says will cause some formerly eligible recipients to lose coverage —  while increasing administrative costs. 
Despite Republicans’ stated goal, the new Medicaid work requirement won’t have much of an impact on the number of enrolled people working; according to Urban Institute, 91% of people ages 19 to 55 enrolled under Medicaid expansion already meet the work reporting requirements or exemptions. The added paperwork, however, could trip up enrollees and force them off Medicaid — as many as 80,000 Minnesotans, according to DHS. 
The bill also creates new cost-sharing requirements for some adults without children; decreases retroactive coverage; prohibits funding for some family planning and reproductive health providers for a year; and restricts people with lawful immigration statuses — such as refugees — from Medicaid coverage.
One in four Minnesotans receive health care coverage from Medicaid or MinnesotaCare, the state’s health insurance program for the working poor. Children make up the biggest proportion of Medicaid recipients at 42% but account for a low percentage of spending. Adults 65 or older and people with disabilities represent 15% of enrollment but 60% of spending. Overall, Medicaid covers a larger proportion of nonwhite and rural populations. 
The bill will limit provider taxes, which are taxes on health care providers that states use to help fund Medicaid, as well as state-directed payments, which hospitals use to gain larger federal Medicaid reimbursements. 
Rural hospitals — many of which depend on Medicaid patients — are expected to be significantly affected by the changes, particularly the limits on state-directed payments. Although the Trump law sets aside $10 billion annually for five years for rural health services, DHS says this is unlikely to offset the cuts and new costs for providers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Medicaid-1024x661.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 15:56:43.455855

“Last first day!” cheered Superintendent Errick L. Greene, prompting a smile from the senior striding past.
Across the city, students went back to school Monday for the start of the new year. For some, it was their first day in a classroom. For others, like Rakeem Burney, it would be the last time they celebrated the first day of grade school. 
“It’s my senior year, but it hasn’t really hit me yet,” he said, dressed sharply in sparkling white sneakers. “I’m just excited to meet all my teachers and embark on this journey and everything this year will bring. The fact that the superintendent came, too, means a lot to me.”
That was the goal, Greene said. By showing up on the first day, he wanted to show students his support and commitment to them.
“This is where the magic happens,” he said. “For all of the back of the office things I have to do, the most important thing is to be here, to observe what’s going on but also to be visible with scholars and team members. They need to know I’m part of this work on the ground. 
“This fills my cup.”

The energy was high at Callaway — volunteers and cheerleaders shook pompoms as students meandered through hallways, greeting one another and checking out their schedule for the year — but district changes were also apparent.
As some students entered the high school with cell phone imprints clearly visible in their jean pockets, administrators warned them to put their devices in their backpacks, out of reach. 
Phones were already banned at JPS schools, but the board approved a stricter policy over the summer in an effort to curb bullying, violence and miscommunication with parents. 
It’s part of Greene’s vision for the school year — a safer, more scholastically successful and well-staffed district. He said academic excellence remains a top focus for JPS, but there’s also work to be done around district culture. That includes supporting teachers and strengthening communication with families.
And the work starts from day one, he said.
Just down the block at North Jackson Elementary School, preschoolers were learning for the first time how to behave in a classroom. Greene joined them later that morning, stacking rainbow blocks on a brightly colored rug, while principal Jocelyn Smith circled the classroom, troubleshooting and smiling at the young students.
Despite her cheeriness, by 9 a.m. on Monday, Smith had been awake for hours. 
“The first day for me is just like for the children,” said Smith, who’s been working in education for three decades. “I couldn’t sleep last night. I was too excited to see the children.”
For the elementary students, the first day is essential to the rest of the year, she said.
“They get an introduction to the curriculum … they learn our procedures and how to be safe,” she said. “But most of all, they start learning our expectations for them, and they start to build a relationship with their teachers.”
In a different classroom up the hall, Rakesia Gray was figuring out what her third graders would be interested in reading this year. She passed out a worksheet, and asked her students to circle the topics they liked best. 
“On the first row, tell me which one you’d rather read out,” she said. “Polar bears or penguins?”
The room was silent. Students shyly glanced at each other.
“Come on now,” Gray said, laughing. “Y’all have gotta talk to me!”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/28110528/3X0A9602.jpg,,,2025-07-28 15:56:43.455855

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.

Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
States look at shoring up consumer protections as Trump hobbles federal watchdog

After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets. In Pennsylvania, six bills are pending in the legislature according the the NCSL.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.

At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

Deborah Ross (NC-02)We’re now six months into the second Trump administration and recent weeks, in particular, have been filled all kinds momentous and often disturbing news from Washington. Topping the list, of course, is the massive new budget reconciliation package – what supporters dubbed the “one, big, beautiful bill” that the president signed into law on July 4th.
Unfortunately, as recent reports and analyses from an array of nonpartisan experts have made clear, the impacts from the bill will be anything but beautiful. Among other things, the new law promises to end life sustaining health insurance coverage and food assistance for millions of people while bestowing huge new tax breaks on the nation’s wealthiest individuals. One of the most articulate critics of the legislation is North Carolina second district congresswoman Deborah Ross – and recently Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with Ross in her Washington office for a special two-part conversation on the mega-bill and several other recent developments.

In Part Two of our chat, we delved into some of the other issues roiling the nation’s capital at the six-month mark of the second Trump administration – including the political right’s war on public education, public broadcasting, and clean energy, and most recently, the deeply disturbing effort to hide law enforcement files regarding President Trump’s past longtime relationship with the late convicted sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein.

But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.










There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Bruce Van Note will retire on Aug. 15 from his position after more than 30 years of a professional transportation career in Maine, according to a news release from the governor’s office Monday. 
Gov. Janet Mills nominated Van Note in 2019 to lead the department after more than a dozen years as deputy commissioner followed by five years as director of policy and planning for the Maine Turnpike Authority. 
“There have been many challenges to overcome including the pandemic, significant increases in construction costs, workforce shortages, extreme storms, and more,” Van Note said. “They made this one of the toughest jobs you’ll ever love, but finding solutions is what we do, and throughout it all, I’m proud of the smart and steady progress we’ve made for the people of Maine.” 
During Van Note’s tenure, MaineDOT completed construction of the Madawaska-Edmunston International Bridge, connecting the U.S. and Canada, as well as the opening of the I-395/Route 9 Connector to move freight traffic from streets in Bangor and Brewer to a more efficient route from Canada to points south. 
Van Note also led the department’s response to the severe winter storms in December 2023 and January 2024 that caused more than $90 million in damage to public roadways and infrastructure. 
Through 2024, the department completed 350 bridge projects, 362 miles of major highway improvements, more than 6,000 miles of paving and $500 million in multimodal capital investments, the release said.
“Commissioner Van Note has been a steady hand at the helm of MaineDOT, guiding the agency through critical investments in our roads, bridges, and infrastructure,” said state Sen. Brad Farrin, lead Republican senator on the Legislature’s Transportation Committee. 
MaineDOT Deputy Commissioner Dale Doughty will serve as acting commissioner following Van Note’s retirement. Doughty previously served as director of the Bureau of Planning and director of the Bureau of Maintenance and Operations.
The department’s commissioner position is a cabinet-level appointment, subject to a hearing before the Transportation Committee and confirmation by the Maine Senate.

“The suggestion that Wyoming is somehow shortchanging or harming students through inadequate funding is a premise detached from reality,” appeal reads. 
The post Citing a lack of evidence, state asks Supreme Court to overturn school funding decision appeared first on WyoFile .","A February ruling that Wyoming has been unconstitutionally underfunding public education brought major implications for the public school landscape across the state. Educators hoped it would result in better teacher salaries and more money for mental health counselors, school resource officers, school nutrition programs and safer buildings.
But in an appeal filed last week, Wyoming attorneys argued that courts should only intervene to compel increased state funding when evidence “clearly demonstrates measurable harm to students, inability to deliver some required aspect of the education program or meet state standards, or declining education quality.” 
That evidence, the state argues, was not presented at trial. 
Citing that lack of “substantial, objective” evidence, the state is asking the Wyoming Supreme Court to overturn Laramie District Court Judge Peter Froelicher’s decision. 
“The suggestion that Wyoming is somehow shortchanging or harming students through inadequate funding is a premise detached from reality,” reads the appeal, filed Thursday. 
In the 106-page filing, Wyoming’s attorneys also argue the case offers an “opportunity to finally lead Wyoming out of the thicket of endless litigation” that has dogged the state’s school funding model. 
However, the facts still stand, plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit say. 
“We believe the Wyoming Constitution is clear, and the state has not followed the funding model required by the Constitution for 15 years,” Wyoming Education Association President Kim Amen said in a statement. “Contrary to their filing, it appears that the state officials are truly the ones detached from reality when it comes to their arguments about education funding.”
The state’s appeal comes as school-choice advocates are anticipating an appeal in another education lawsuit. Judge Froelicher this month issued a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against Wyoming’s new universal school voucher program, the Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act. That injunction essentially bars the state from releasing any program funds — up to $7,000 per student for private school costs — until the judge determines whether the program is constitutional.

The Wyoming attorney general’s office filed a notice of appeal on July 17, signaling the state will challenge the injunction.
Taken together, the cases are poised to shape the future of Wyoming’s public school system, which serves 92,000 public school students and has historically ranked high nationwide.
The appeal also comes as Wyoming lawmakers have embarked on the 2025 recalibration, an exhaustive and tedious assessment of public education funding mandated every five years. Froelicher’s February order has already influenced the process. 
Litigation thicket
The education funding lawsuit is the latest in a string of court cases going back decades that have delineated the state’s obligations.
The latest suit was filed in August 2022. The Wyoming Education Association, an educator advocacy group with 6,000 members, filed the lawsuit, and eight school districts joined as intervenors to challenge the state.
The suit claimed the state violated its constitution by failing to adequately fund public schools and has withheld appropriate funding at the expense of educational excellence, safety and security. That has left districts to fend for themselves and divert funds from other crucial educational activities, which causes further systemic erosion, the suit contended. 
Article 7 of the Wyoming Constitution states that the Legislature “shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.” Landmark court cases further delineated the state’s obligations in the ‘80s and ‘90s.
The more recent of those, the Campbell cases, set the stage for Wyoming’s current school funding obligations. Those cases culminated in 1995 when the Wyoming Supreme Court ordered the state to determine the cost of a high-quality education, fund public schools, adjust funding at least every two years for inflation and review the components of the school funding model every five years to ensure resources are keeping pace with needs and costs.
But Wyoming hasn’t held up its end of the bargain, the WEA suit alleged. 
A six-week bench trial took place in 2024 to deliberate the issue, with plaintiffs bringing a parade of school staffers and education experts who testified on topics ranging from major maintenance projects to school lunches, campus security and staffing.

Judge Froelicher issued his ruling more than six months later, finding the Legislature failed to properly fund the “basket of quality educational goods and services” that the Wyoming Supreme Court in 1995 ordered lawmakers to set, update and fund every two years. 
The judge also found the state failed to properly adjust funding for inflation; failed to provide funding for adequate salaries for teachers and staff; and failed to provide sufficient funding for mental health counselors, school safety resource officers, nutritional programs and computers for students. Lawmakers have failed as well to properly assess school buildings for “educational suitability,” and have allowed inadequate facilities to exist for too long without repair or replacement, he ruled. 
“The State’s failures have affected Wyoming children’s right to a proper education,” the judge wrote. He ordered the state to modify its funding model in a manner consistent with his order “to assure the school financing system for operations and for school facilities are constitutional.”
His ruling has loomed large over the state’s 2025 school recalibration and is expected to factor heavily into the process. 
The state’s argument 
In the appeal, Wyoming attorneys portray a frustrating cycle of litigation.
“The Wyoming legislature has adjusted the current model over the years to improve efficiency and more closely reflect cost estimates,” it reads. “Unhappy with these choices, school districts and their allies again resort to legal action, filing suit to force further adjustments and compel more spending.”
The notion that Wyoming is shortchanging students, it continues, couldn’t be further from the truth. 
“For decades, the legislature has provided funding more than sufficient to provide an equal and high-quality education for all students,” the filing states. “Operational spending for Wyoming schools consistently ranks among the best in the nation. Expenditures vastly outpace every peer state in the region – in some instances by nearly twice as much per student each year. The idea that districts cannot educate children at this level of funding defies reason.”
Despite this “abundance, the demands of the education establishment remain insatiable,” it continues.

The district court’s willingness to oblige educators’ demands raises serious concerns about the “basis on which courts may nullify the actions of a co-equal branch to declare a constitutional violation and effectively force more spending,” the appeal concludes. 
The state’s filing contends plaintiffs did not present sufficient evidence at trial to compel increased education funding. 
“Appellees did not retain a single outside expert to support their claims, and offered virtually no evidence of measurable harm or system-wide impacts from alleged underfunding,” the appeal states. “Their case consisted almost entirely of their own employees’ personal perspectives on recruiting challenges, tightening budgets, things they felt would be helpful to students, and policy preferences for increased school funding.”
The state, meanwhile, responded with verifiable data and expert analysis, it says — evidence that indicated ample funding. The appeal also walks through the tangled history and complicated process of school funding, diving into the minutiae of cost adjustments, labor markets, landmark cases, inflation and other factors. 
Contrary to underfunding public schools, the appeal argues that the state has “spent lavishly” to address school facility needs. 
But the court did not recognize “indicators of overall abundance,” instead relying on a “nearly impossible standard” in Judge Froelicher’s decision. Thus, the appeal asks the higher court to correct the record by aligning with the state’s interpretation.

Mike Collins speaks at a Trump rally in 2024. File photo. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderU.S. Rep. Mike Collins, a conservative firebrand who represents Georgia’s 10th Congressional District, has entered the GOP primary race for U.S. Senate, touting his MAGA credentials and taking shots at incumbent Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat.
First elected to Congress in 2022 to represent a conservative district that spans east and central Georgia, encompassing Athens and part of the Atlanta metro area, Collins is also the founder and CEO of a trucking company. He is the son of former U.S. Rep. Mac Collins, who was a member of Congress from 1993 until 2005.
The Jackson Republican is entering a rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive Republican primary. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is reportedly working behind the scenes to support former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, who is expected to launch his campaign for Senate soon. Days ago, Insurance Commissioner John King dropped out of the race after a conversation with Kemp, according to the Associated Press. U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, who represents a coastal Georgia district, is also seeking the Republican nomination, branding himself a “MAGA warrior.”
Collins and Carter may soon be battling for President Donald Trump’s endorsement in the Republican primary, as each seeks to cast himself as the more Trump-aligned pick for the job. (Collins defeated a Trump-backed candidate for his House seat in 2022.) Though Trump and Kemp had reportedly been working behind the scenes to try and find a consensus candidate to endorse, no candidate has publicly emerged from those talks. 
In his announcement video, Collins emphasized his efforts to implement Trump’s agenda on issues like the federal budget reconciliation bill and immigration policy. Collins was the lead sponsor of the federal Laken Riley Act, which requires the expansion of mass detention for immigrants charged or arrested for property crimes. 
Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at the University of Georgia, was a resident of Collins’ district when she was killed in 2024, sparking a wave of state-wide and federal immigration proposals. Jose Ibarra, a 26-year-old migrant from Venezuela who authorities said entered the country illegally in 2022, was convicted of her killing in November.
Collins also took aim at Ossoff in his announcement video, promising to advocate for more conservative policies at the federal level and “steamroll the radical left.”
“We need a senator who works for Georgia, not the California crazies or New York nut jobs,” Collins said in a campaign video announcing his bid for Senate. “I don’t know who Jon Ossoff really works for, but it sure as heck isn’t Georgia.”
Like Trump, Collins is known for his social media presence, particularly on X (formerly known as Twitter). He has previously had his account temporarily suspended after a post where he appeared to advocate for killing immigrants who commit crimes after entering the country illegally. Last May, he also came under fire for retweeting a video of a group of University of Mississippi students mocking Black antiwar protestors with monkey noises and gestures, adding the caption “Ole Miss taking care of business.” He later backtracked his statement in response to the backlash.
The Democratic Party of Georgia criticized Collins’ bid for office, citing his past history of inflammatory social media comments and support for Trump’s policies.
“This already messy primary will expose just how out of step Collins is with Georgia voters as Republicans duke it out to prove who is more in line with Trump’s toxic agenda, deep Medicaid cuts, and economic chaos,” party chair Charlie Bailey said in a statement.

July 26, 2025 | ScreenshotEnvironmental advocates gathered Saturday in Battle Creek for a day of remembrance 15 years after the rupture of Canadian energy company Enbridge’s Line 6B pipeline, which spilled hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River. 
Although the restoration effort that followed was largely considered a success, the situation caused one of the worst inland oil spills in U.S. history.
Attendees at Saturday’s gathering viewed the 2010 oil spill as a cautionary tale, demanding Enbridge shut down its Line 5 pipeline, which runs through the environmentally sensitive Straits of Mackinac where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“Without the tragedy and the sacrifice that happened here, I don’t know that we would be talking about Line 5 as much as we are today,” said Sean McBrearty, coordinator of the anti-Line 5 Oil and Water Don’t Mix coalition. “Line 6B became an unfortunate cautionary tale that birthed a movement, a movement that says, ‘Never again are we going to let major corporations like Enbridge spill oil into our rivers.’ A movement that says, ‘We’re going to protect our Great Lakes and make sure that the same company responsible for this oil spill does not strike again.’”
Between Michigan’s upper and lower peninsula, Line 5 diverges into a set of dual pipelines for 4.5 miles, with the pipelines transporting more than 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids daily through the Great Lakes.
While the pipeline has operated in the straits for more than 70 years, the Kalamazoo River spill has spurred concerns over the consequences of an oil spill in the Great Lakes, which have grown since the discovery of gaps in Line 5’s protective coating. The dual pipelines have also been dented in three segments due to an anchor strike in 2018.
In 2018, Enbridge forged an agreement with the state to replace the dual pipelines with a new segment, housed in a concrete-lined utility tunnel buried within the bedrock beneath the lakes. 
However, environmental advocates argue the pipeline poses too great a risk to keep operating in the Straits of Mackinac, and that constructing the tunnel project carries environmental risks of its own. 
“Enbridge has allowed Line 5 to spill at least 33 times since 1953, releasing another 1 million gallons of oil into the environment,” said Denise Keele, executive director of the Michigan Climate Action Network. “The Canadian fossil fuel giant has an abysmal safety record, refuses to be transparent about its operations and continues to operate Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac, despite being in violation of state orders.”

Speakers at Saturday’s event encouraged individuals to speak out against the tunnel project, calling on the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to perform a full review of Enbridge’s proposed drilling area as required by the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act.
“This is not just for the state of Michigan, anybody across the country, because the Great Lakes are held in public trust and are an international treasure, everybody can comment,” said Beth Wallace, director of climate and energy for the National Wildlife Federation. “And so we’re encouraging everybody from now until August 29 to require EGLE to do their job and fulfill their duty and take a full look at this project, because we know if they did, it would not move forward.”
If the state does not follow through with a full review, Wallace said the department will be facing legal action. 
A department spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.
Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy, in a statement, acknowledged the 2010 oil spill, noting that the company takes responsibility for the incident. The Talmadge Creek spill has also informed the company’s approach to safety and environmental protections, he said.
“Today, because of the hard work of many people, the Kalamazoo River watershed has been transformed,” Duffy said. “As with any turnaround story, we wish the events that created the story had never happened in the first place. And as we move forward, working with Michiganders, we remain committed to protect and preserve the state’s natural resources.”
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 revoked the company’s permission to operate the pipeline on the bottomlands of the Great Lakes, but Enbridge brought legal action arguing Whitmer did not have the authority to invalidate its easement agreement. The move also has the potential to violate an international treaty agreement with Canada. 
Enbridge needs permits from three agencies to move forward with construction on the tunnel project. The company has already received permitting from the Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates energy companies within the state. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also considering a permit for the tunnel, moving forward under emergency processing procedures following an executive order from President Donald Trump.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy issued permits for the company in 2021, but Enbridge is required to redo its water resources permit using new wetlands surveys as part of a 2024 agreement with the department and the Bay Mills Indian Community. 
The department opened public comment on the requests for Enbridge’s new wetlands protection and Great Lakes Submerged Lands permits on July 17. The comment period will remain open through Aug. 29. The department plans to host an information session on Aug. 12, and a formal public hearing on Aug. 19. Comments on the issue can also be submitted online.
As Enbridge seeks approval for the new permits, Duffy said the company remains committed to safeguarding the Great Lakes, natural resources, and communities, while welcoming public and stakeholder comment.
Wallace remained skeptical of the company’s motives.
“Who are the [permitting] decisions really serving? They’re not the people of Michigan,” Wallace said. “They’re not the tribes who have stewarded these waters for generations, and not the millions who rely on the Great Lakes. The only winner here is Enbridge, the company that has a cycle of abuse and deception for our communities. We cannot let them get away with this again, and we must demand accountability.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-28-at-1.01.53 PM-1024x552.png,,,2025-07-28 14:23:47.704194

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Gov. Ron DeSantis will roll out an approach for Florida to artificial intelligence “within the next few months,” he said Monday. 
The governor said he is not sure the matter will require legislation, “but we’ve got to be careful about how this all unwinds.”
DeSantis also likened the practice of technology companies hiring foreign workers legally to “indentured servitude” during a news conference Monday morning in Panama City Beach announcing the back-to-school sales tax holiday. 
“I’m not one to say that we should just turn over our humanity to artificial intelligence. I think it’s very dangerous, potentially. Obviously, technology is what it is, it’s not like you just put your head in the sand and hope it all disappears,” DeSantis said, predicting “major, major upheavals in jobs” as AI advances.
“I think this is, like, the biggest issue that’s facing our society. I think it’s the biggest issue that’s facing the economy,” DeSantis continued, predicting that advancements in technology will decrease the number of white-collar jobs “like processing claims or doing things in like a law firm.”
Trump’s AI Action Plan removes ‘red tape’ for AI developers and data centers, punishes states that act alone

Last week, President Donald Trump released an AI action plan designed to take a hands-off approach to safeguards. Trump’s plan calls for AI models to focus on “truth, rather than social engineering agendas.”
Trump has called for a “single federal standard” when it comes to regulating AI, States Newsroom reported.
DeSantis, though, seemed skeptical of freezing the states out of involvement.
“I don’t want our experience, our ability to live and pursue happiness, which is what the Founding Fathers intended, to be subordinated to the whims of these big tech guys who have maybe their different agenda,” he said. 
“If you wanted to manipulate and create false narratives, and you’re in control of one of these AI, you just put garbage in the data set — garbage in, garbage out,” DeSantis added. 
DeSantis pointed to Florida’s passage of Brooke’s Law this year, requiring social media platforms to delete AI-generated sexual depictions created without consent of the person depicted. 
DeSantis criticized the U.S. House for approving a version of the “Big Beautiful Bill” containing a provision preventing state-level artificial intelligence legislation. That language was removed before the bill became law.
Social media have proven a “net negative” for children, the governor said.
“How do we navigate this? How do we make sure that we’re protecting folks here so that they can live good, meaningful lives?” DeSantis said.
“Are students just going to have artificial intelligence write their term paper? You know, it’s like, do we even need to think? And at that point, when you’re taking that away, then it’s like, ‘Okay, you know, we’re not going to think, we’re going to rely on this,’” he said. 
Heavy reliance on AI paired with manipulated data fueling AI answers “can really change society in a lot of ways,” DeSantis said.

Immigration
On the topic of technology, DeSantis criticized tech companies that hire employees using H-1B visas.  
“I think that’s a total scam,” DeSantis said of the program, which allows companies to hire foreign workers for specialty jobs. “I don’t think that that’s good. Yes, it is legal the way they’re doing it. I acknowledge that they’re using something that’s on the books. But is that good policy for us as a country, to have Americans put out of work and then to bring in H-1B visa?”
H-1B visas are “almost like indentured servitude, because you can’t leave the company. And so these companies love it, because they save a lot of money off of it, but that’s not putting the American people first,” DeSantis said. 
The federal government allows that H-1B workers may work for a new employer after submitting a new application.
Back to school holiday
The primary purpose of the press conference was to announce the approaching August-long sales tax holiday on school supplies. Although its been occurring for years, the holiday was permanently enshrined into law this year. 
The holiday exempts certain products from sales tax, such as computers, tablets, computer accessories, backpacks, notebooks, clothing, and other school supplies.
The holiday has limits, providing the tax exemption to technology products like laptops and desktops priced at $1,500 or less, wallets and bags at $100 or less, school supplies such as binders and notebooks at $50 or less, and clothing, footwear, and accessories at $100 or less.
DeSantis said the law is written in a way that encourages retailers to drop prices, because if items are priced above the threshold, retailers must collect tax on the full amount, as opposed to just the amount that exceeds the threshold.
The governor’s family, he said, will take advantage of the holiday.

But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.
The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

The state’s annual Tax Free Weekend starts Friday and ends Sunday. The tax holiday waives the state’s 6%​​ sales tax as well as local sales taxes, according to the state Department of Revenue.
All but three of South Carolina’s 46 counties have their own sales taxes for local projects. At 9% total, sales taxes are highest in Charleston County and the city of Myrtle Beach.
Non-taxable items include musical instruments, calculators, headphones, printers, computers, computer software and all types of clothing, as well as certain bed and bath items, including bed spreads, sheets, pillows, towels and shower curtains​​, the department lists as examples on its website. Items that are still taxed as normal include cellphones, digital cameras and video game consoles.
Last year, shoppers bought more than $22.3 million in tax-free items and saved more than $1.3 million in taxes, according to the state tax agency.
Per the law passed in 2000, the 72 hours of savings start at 12:01 a.m. the first Friday in August and continue until midnight Sunday. Online sales of eligible items are included.
The tax break applies to all shoppers, but the law was intended to help parents buy back-to-school items ahead of each new school year.

(Courtesy of Ainsley Dye)Like many of my peers, while preparing to leave behind familiar routines after graduating high school and head to college, I’ve found myself reflecting on what experiences led me to where I am today.
My childhood was unique — though I grew up in Boulder, Colorado, I had a truly international experience. Over the course of 10 years, my family welcomed 12 au pairs to our home and they brought the world to our kitchen table by sharing cultures, perspectives and traditions. The cultural exchange I experienced through the au pair program has made me far more curious about the world and impacted my plans for the future, including what I hope to study as a freshman this fall.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The au pair program was established as part of the Fulbright-Hays Act in 1961 with the intention of improving international diplomacy and fostering cultural exchange. The program is regulated by the U.S. Department of State and facilitated by sponsor agencies that work to connect au pairs — 18-26-year-olds from other countries — with American families. As part of the program, au pairs come to live with host families for a year or two, providing limited child care support in exchange for room and board, a weekly stipend, and the opportunity to take classes an at American college.
Over the years, my family hosted a total of 12 au pairs. Many of them came from Germany and Switzerland, surrounding my siblings and I with new languages in a truly immersive environment. Some au pairs would label items in our kitchen in German, helping improve my family’s fluency over time. While in our home they had the opportunity to connect with my family in English — helping them brush up on their language skills while we shared stories and traditions. Today, I can comfortably speak German and Spanish, and recognize that those language skills have deepened my appreciation for my former au pairs’ cultures, as well as the cultures of others.
Our home often served as a meeting point for local au pairs and host families, through my mom’s work as a Local Childcare Consultant, where she provided support and guidance to families participating in the program. Our au pairs truly became part of our family, and I am still in touch with many of them today. In 2019, I travelled to Munich and had the opportunity to reconnect with some of my family’s past au pairs — those connections remain as strong as ever.
Through an internship with a sponsor of the au pair program, I heard perspectives from others who, like me, grew up getting to experience other cultures right in their home. One former host child shared that the au pair program was her first exposure to diverse cultures, ultimately leading her to choose a college and career where she felt at home learning and working alongside people from different walks of life.
These benefits aren’t only felt by host children and their families. I reviewed testimonials from hundreds of au pairs from all over the world, and more than half shared that they had evolved as a person during their time in the U.S., whether that was through a change in perspective, self-confidence and self-discovery, or stepping outside of their comfort zone.
Beyond this research, the value of international exchange is recognized widely. Studies show that many jobs today require skills that are strengthened through international exchange and studying abroad, such as communication, leadership and problem solving. In 2024, 87% of surveyed youth said they believe that travel experiences increase employability.
It is no coincidence that I want to study international relations in college and can’t wait to study abroad. Growing up with au pairs gave me a window to the world that I otherwise wouldn’t have found in my town, and I hope that helps me as I learn how different countries interact in the global arena. My experience growing up with au pairs has also taught me the importance of empathy, bridging gaps, and building relationships, values that I know I’ll carry with me – not only as I go off to college but throughout my life.
The au pair program helped shape my identity and influenced my future for the better. The countless host children and au pairs I’ve spoken with share my perspective and I can only hope that more families have the chance to experience these same incredible experiences and benefits that have shaped my worldview.

(Getty Images)The long and winding road to passing a new state operating budget concluded last month, marking the start of a new fiscal year.   
For many health care providers and stakeholders, including the community mental health system, the process brought a mix of progress and setbacks. As we look ahead, it’s clear that the landscape of funding and policy has shifted, and we are taking stock of where things stand.
As advocates, the New Hampshire Community Behavioral Health Association (CBHA) and the state’s 10 community mental health centers (CMHCs) remain committed to the principle that all Granite Staters deserve equitable access to quality mental health services regardless of geography or income. That commitment means advocating for a sustainable, community-based system, one that can weather inflation, workforce shortages, rising insurance premiums, and increasing technology costs. Most importantly, it means ensuring we can recruit and retain qualified mental health professionals who are fairly compensated, to deliver critical, safety-net mental health services to our communities. 
This year’s budget negotiations were difficult, but they brought some notable victories. Proposed cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates and to overall mental health funding were ultimately avoided. We are grateful for the leadership of Gov. Kelly Ayotte and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, who recognized the essential role of CMHCs’ in advancing Mission Zero, a statewide initiative that has significantly reduced the number of individuals waiting in hospital Emergency Departments for psychiatric care. After years of struggle, this progress is measurable and meaningful.
Another important step was the governor’s inclusion of funding to partially offset uncompensated care costs borne by CMHCs. This appropriation was preserved throughout the legislative process, reflecting a shared understanding that community mental health providers need relief in order to maintain essential services. While this funding represents only a partial solution, it is a step in the right direction, and we remain committed to working with state leaders to develop long-term, sustainable approaches.
Still, some policy changes included in the final budget raise concerns. The addition of Medicaid work requirements, co-pays, premiums, and more frequent eligibility reviews may create barriers to care for many vulnerable individuals. We join other health care providers in urging caution and careful monitoring, to ensure these changes do not lead to unintended consequences such as coverage losses or increased administrative burdens for providers and patients alike. 
Additionally, several legislative proposals aimed at strengthening the mental health system failed to advance, despite our best efforts. The most concerning among them was Senate Bill 114, a modest proposal to address supportive and transitional housing for those in our state with mental illness. Current state and Medicaid housing programs do not provide sufficient reimbursements to the community mental health system to support the need for more housing, and CMHCs with these programs report losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars each year, or more. The ripple effects of closures of these programs will extend far beyond individual providers, straining local communities and contributing to the challenges of homelessness.
As many have said, a state budget is more than a financial plan; it is a reflection of our values. 
Investing in mental health is not only fiscally responsible, but a statement about dignity, equity, and our collective well-being. While this year’s budget leaves important work unfinished, it also affirms the strength and perseverance of our mental health workforce, the dedication of our CMHC board members, and the courage of the individuals and families who speak out and advocate for change.  
We move forward with gratitude for that collective effort, and with the continued determination to build a more accessible, better-funded community mental health system for all.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/bipolar-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-07-28 13:56:37.773081

According to them, it will benefit agriculture, industry and municipal services in the coming years.
Governor Mike Kehoe signed new legislation into law on July 14 that limits large-scale water exports from Missouri. The law, which takes effect Aug. 28, requires a permit for water exports and restricts withdrawals for export to within 30 miles of the state border. It also mandates annual reporting of water usage to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
David Borrok, dean of the College of Engineering and Computing at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, said that a number of other states in the U.S have been taking similar measures as demand for water grows.
“Missouri is a water-rich state, and I’d say, arguably, water is our most valuable resource as a state,” Borrok said. “It’s the engine that sort of underpins all economic development and things in the state.”
Missouri is home to more than 110,000 miles of rivers and streams. Each year, rainfall creates more than 15 trillion gallons of runoff that flows into these rivers, lakes and streams. About 38 trillion gallons come into the state through the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. It is estimated that the state has about 500 trillion gallons of usable-quality groundwater.
Daniel Downing, a water quality specialist with the University of Missouri Extension, believes the motivation behind this legislation is the preservation of Missouri’s abundant water supplies.
“On the state borders, especially the western border, there may be parties harvesting or considering harvesting water from Missouri and pumping it into Oklahoma and/or Kansas, where they have restrictive water allotments,” Downing said in an email.
Missouri has very few, if any, restrictions on the quantity of water one can harvest in compliance with Missouri’s Riparian Rights water law, Downing said.
“Missouri water law allows the use of reasonable amounts of water as long as it does not deprive others of what they need,” Downing said. “In the Western states, water quantity and use are regulated under allotment and/or appropriation systems that tightly control how much water they can access.”
The Ogallala Aquifer is a very important underground water source for many states, like Kansas, Nebraska and others. However, it does not extend into Missouri. Increased populations, development and droughts have created more demand for water in these states, Downing said.
Research shows that, due to pumping water for irrigation, the aquifer is now dangerously close to running dry. To mitigate that, there was a plan proposed to move water from the Missouri River in eastern Kansas, near Kansas City, to help refill the Ogallala Aquifer in western Kansas.
“The use and apparent gradual depletion of the aquifer has been a topic of research and discussion for many years, resulting in limitations on the use of water from it,” Downing said. “These circumstances, as well as other influences and restrictions, make it inviting to look across the state line and covet the abundance of water we have.”
Kansas Governor Laura Kelly signed a bill in July establishing a water conservation task force to tackle the state’s water issues. The task force will identify water-related risks, determine what constitutes a sustainable water supply and explore funding options for future water projects. Additionally, a Water Planning Work Group will work to update and modernize the State Water Resources Planning Act.
According to the Missouri Water Resources Plan, updated in 2020, the state’s residents and businesses use an average of 3.2 billion total gallons of water each day. Of that total, 78% comes from groundwater sources, while the remaining 22% is supplied by surface water.
Borrok emphasized that water security is essential for the state’s long-term economic growth.
“All the manufacturing that we might want to attract to the state,” Borrok said. “All data centers, all these sorts of things use massive, massive amounts of water, and no major company will move to a state that doesn’t have the water resources necessary to expand.”
Agricultural irrigation accounts for the largest share of the state’s consumptive water withdrawals at 65%. Major water systems contribute another 25%, while all other sectors combined make up the remaining 10% of annual withdrawals.
Tom Waters is a seventh-generation farmer from Orrick, Missouri and also serves as a consultant at the Missouri Water Center. He and his family raise corn, soybeans and wheat.
Although Waters doesn’t do any irrigation on the land he farms, he said that in southeast Missouri, particularly in the Bootheel area, the practice is quite common.
“Keeping that water to irrigate Missouri crops is important versus sending it to other states,” Waters said. “The difference between an irrigated crop and a non-irrigated crop always depends on the weather and drought conditions and those sorts of things. But, traditionally, the irrigation more than pays for itself.”
David Waller, board president and national director at the Missouri Rural Water Association, said every drop Missouri exports outside the state is lost.
“So a municipality that might need water within the state, if it was being exported in large quantities outside the state, they might not have water for their usage,” Waller said. “I don’t know that is happening anywhere, but that is one possibility.”
Waller said the Department of Natural Resources didn’t previously have a way of tracking water that was being transported outside the state, nor a way of regulating it.
“This at least gives the department the authority to monitor and make those decisions so that they know what’s going on,” Waller said.
In northern Missouri, the groundwater is very salty, so a lot of their water comes from surface water. Borrok said those municipalities need to keep their water for drinking purposes.
“It’s the same way as agriculture, you just want it not to overdraft your bank of water,” Borrok said. “Recreation-wise, that’s a huge one too. There’s gotta be massive amounts of tourism dollars coming in from Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and the Scenic Riverways here and if you start taking water and pumping it somewhere else, you could potentially, over time, negatively impact some of those resources.”
Missouri’s statewide consumptive water demand is expected to rise by 18%, or by approximately 583 million gallons per day, by 2060, according to the Missouri Water Resources Plan.
While the law does restrict exports, Borrok said it doesn’t completely close the door to out-of-state water sharing. Now, exporting water would have to go through a permit process, evaluating potential financial benefits or losses.
“A small farmer could possibly export a little bit of water through a canal to another place, and maybe we don’t know about that,” Borrok said. “But the real impact that it’s trying to avoid is a massive export of water, like hundreds of millions of gallons a month, or three million gallons a day or some massive amount and that would be noticed in terms of the monitoring.”

The Michigan Library Association is behind the effort, which calls on officials to stand up for residents’ First Amendment rights and protect the freedom to read in libraries across the state.
Members of the association said in a news release that the Protect MI Right to Read petition is on track to be delivered to the Michigan Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in October.
“Michigan’s public libraries serve everyone, not just the loudest voices,” Dillon Geshel, interim executive director of the association, said in a statement. “The Petition to Protect MI Right to Read was created to send a clear message to our elected officials that public libraries exist to reflect all of us, and every resident deserves the freedom to see themselves on the shelves.”
The petition asks state lawmakers and Whitmer to publicly affirm their commitment to the freedom to read in libraries, free of censorship, book bans or the sequestration of certain materials. It also asks officials to encourage local governments and library boards to resist censorship, support diverse collections, and champion First Amendment legal precedents protecting them.
Additionally, the petition asks for the appropriation of state funding, increasing allocations to libraries in the pending state budget. That would include annual spending support for the Michigan eLibrary and statewide catalog and other at-risk statewide library programs.
In the state House of Representatives-passed spending plan for the 2025-26 fiscal year, the chamber is proposing the same $16.5 million in funding to school libraries as the current fiscal year. The funding was in line with what Whitmer proposed in her executive recommendations issued earlier this year. The Senate has proposed funding school libraries at $15 million in its version of the school education budget.

“We’re seeing more organized efforts to control what people can read, and it’s happening right here in Michigan,” said Jenny Marr, Michigan Library Association board president and executive director of Capital Area District Libraries, in a statement. “This petition reminds us that libraries are places of curiosity, growth, and empathy, and they’re worth defending.”
In data provided by the association, a new EPIC-MRA poll from June 2025 shows that 79% of voters approve of the work libraries are doing, 75% trust librarians’ discretion on the materials in their collections, and 82% agree that access to materials for young people should be protected.
Another 84% said they support current library policies on age-appropriate shelving.

It’s all part of the state’s move to a closed party primary system for its congressional seats and certain state-level elected offices.
According to data from the Secretary of State, 150,654 voters registered as “Independent” will have their status changed to “No Party,” a designation currently given to 657,966. Affected voters will receive notice in the mail, including an updated voter information card. 
The legislature approved the change in Act 84 earlier this year. Louisiana did not allow the existence of an official Independent Party until 2015, after legislators chose the year before to end that prohibition in state law. 
Starting with next year’s elections, only party members and voters with “No Party” on their registration can vote in primaries for the U.S. Senate, U.S. House, Louisiana Supreme Court, Public Service Commission and Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.
“Many Louisiana voters who are registered as Independents mistakenly believe they are unaffiliated with any political party, when in fact they are members of the Independent Party,” Secretary of State Nancy Landry said Monday in a news release. “This proactive change will allow voters formerly registered as Independents to participate in Closed Party Primaries next year, preventing voter confusion while maximizing participation.” 
Landry encourages voters to check their voter registration on the state’s GeauxVote online registration system or GeauxVote app.
In 2024, state lawmakers approved the switch to closed primaries from an open or “jungle” system, in which different party candidates faced one another. An open primary could result in two members of the same party meeting in a runoff if no candidate claimed 50% or more of the votes cast, while a closed primary all but guarantees each party will have a candidate in a runoff.

On Friday afternoon, UVA leaders announced the formation of a special committee to nominate the institution’s next president, which will be responsible for guiding the process of identifying and recommending candidates to the Board of Visitors to serve as UVA’s 10th president. This action follows a similar vetting process currently being used by the Virginia Military Institute, after the governing board opted not to renew the contract of Ret. Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, the school’s first Black leader whose term ended earlier this year. 


 Upcoming meetings

GMU – Aug. 1, 2025
UVA – Sept. 11-12, 2025
VMI – Sept. 22-24, 2025


Two days earlier before UVA’s announcement, House and Senate Democratic leaders urged UVA not to take any action, primarily because a gubernatorial appointee to the governing board—former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a former deputy secretary of Homeland Security with the first President Donald Trump administration — was rejected by Democratic lawmakers. 
The Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections, composed of some members of the full Senate body, rebuffed Cuccinelli and seven others on June 9. Leaders are seeking a court order to prevent the eight rejected appointees from remaining on the governing boards at UVA, VMI, and George Mason University.
“These boards just don’t seem very interested in following Virginia law or listening to anything that the entity that controls them says,” Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said on Friday outside a Fairfax County Courtroom after Circuit Court Judge Jonathan D. Frieden heard the Senate Democrats’ case against the rectors of the three institutions for allowing their rejected appointments to continue serving on the boards. Surrovell stated repeatedly that the board should refrain from finding a permanent president, considering the state of the board’s appointments.
 ‘Totally irresponsible’

UVA, in its announcement, said that the special committee would include students, faculty, staff, alumni, and former and sitting members of the Board of Visitors. 
Chief among the committee’s requirements is “inviting” and “incorporating a broad and inclusive range of perspectives from across UVA’s vibrant community.”
UVA created the committee following the departure of former President Jim Ryan, who stepped down after the U.S. Department of Justice, under the direction of the Trump administration, put pressure on the institution due to Title VI complaints and political scrutiny over its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts on campus.
Jennifer Davis, UVA’s chief administrative, business and operations officer, is serving as interim president.
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, cautioned UVA against making any decisions on its next president during a joint press conference with leaders from the House and Senate on July 24, advising them that lawmakers could make changes in January. He said any such action would be “totally irresponsible” and an act of disrespecting and ignoring the General Assembly.
“They probably should put a freeze on any hiring because we will not support whatever it is that they do,” Scott said last week. “This is an illegitimate board right now that has been appointed and been told that they will not be appointed permanently. So if they go about selecting a president when they know they will not be there in January, that’s wrong.”
 Lawsuit background

Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has supported all the rejected appointees serving on their respective governing boards until the entire General Assembly reconvenes, which is scheduled for January unless the governor calls a special session.
In the lawsuit, Democratic lawmakers are asking the court to bar the eight contested board members from continuing to serve and declare that any board member who permits them to remain is violating their legal duties. Among the rejected appointments were GOP stalwarts, including Cuccinelli and former state commerce and trade secretary Caren Merrick.
Representatives of the institutions argued that the case is “flawed,” is targeting the wrong plaintiffs and defendants, and that the nine senators failed to show irreparable harm.
Judge Frieden said he plans to have a decision by the end of the day on Tuesday. If a preliminary injunction is granted, a request is likely to be made to suspend any action with a judge’s decision by Friday morning.
 VMI, GMU also moving forward

VMI is continuing its search on Tuesday and Wednesday for a president after opting not to extend the contract of the institution’s first Black superintendent in February. 
George Mason’s board is scheduled to meet in closed session to “discuss the performance goals of the President” on Friday.
GMU President Gregory Washington has recently come under attack after the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) launched a federal civil rights investigation at the school. The investigation stems from a complaint filed by multiple professors who accuse GMU of giving unlawful preference in hiring and promotion to faculty from “underrepresented groups” in the name of anti-racism. 
OCR officials argue the university’s DEI practices, in place since 2020, constitute “pernicious and widespread discrimination” that runs afoul of federal law, a position the school vehemently denies.

Several states have passed new laws regulating these machines, which officials say are increasingly being used to scam consumers. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
State, federal governments are eyeing crypto legislation

After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.”
The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Only one of the six crypto bills introduced in South Carolina for 2025 gained any traction. With a 38-1 vote May 1, the Senate approved legislation sponsored by Sen. Danny Verdin, R-Laurens. It allows South Carolinians and businesses to pay for goods and services with cryptocurrency. It also bars state and local governments from adding taxes to digital sales. The House could take up the bill next year.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue.
The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

Vermont State Police are investigating a person’s death in Brandon over the weekend, which they are treating as suspicious.
State police have released few details regarding the person’s death, including any information about their identity or age. 
The person’s body was expected to be taken to the Vermont Chief’s Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington for an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of death, state police said in a press release Monday morning.
The name of the person who died was being withheld pending notification of relatives and additional investigation, according to the release.
The investigation began after police said they received a call at around 8:15 p.m. Sunday from a Carver Street resident, who said a person at the house had died. 
“First responders arrived and confirmed the individual was deceased,” the police press release stated. “Investigators are treating the death as suspicious.”
Police said Monday morning the investigation was in the early stages, nobody was in custody and that there was no known threat to the public.
Additional information was not immediately available Monday morning.

Josh Stein's veto of a bill repealing the state's 2030 carbon emissions goal. (Photo: Southeastern Wind Coalition)On July 4th, Governor Josh Stein put North Carolina’s economic future first when he vetoed Senate Bill 266 “The Power Bill Reduction Act.” Despite the bill supporters’ enticing contention that the bill will lower your monthly electric bill, multiple independent analyses show that key provisions in the bill would actually put North Carolina’s electricity sector and economic future at risk. But, behind the promise of short-term savings lie risks that energy experts say could hurt our state’s grid and economy in the long-term.
SB 266 would reverse the interim carbon emissions reduction target that was established in House Bill 951, delaying, and potentially diminishing the deployment of wind and solar energy. What many don’t realize is that HB 951 didn’t just catalyze the state’s adoption of more renewable energy; it created a pathway to utilize some of the cheapest and most readily available resources to meet the record energy demand that North Carolina will experience over the next decade. Without that interim goal, experts are projecting an energy capacity shortfall of 12 GW as a direct result of delayed renewable energy deployment.
SB 266 would send a very dangerous signal to investors and developers in North Carolina’s renewable energy sector. Since 2021, the interim carbon emission reduction target has created investment certainty for the best tools available to get electrons on the grid quickly and in an affordable manner. Investment certainty is a key factor here because the industry has already invested $15 billion dollars and created over 10,000 in North Carolina according to the American Clean Power Association. This industry is poised for further growth, but according to a study published by BW Research, removing the interim target is estimated to cause a loss of 50,000 future jobs and billions of dollars in investments in the 2030s.
Those numbers may feel intangible, but a wind farm in rural northeastern North Carolina is responsible for a handful of jobs and approximately $1 million in local county tax revenue every year. As the largest taxpayer in the county, a predictable 30-year tax revenue is a game changer for local governments, schools, infrastructure, and emergency services. SB 266 could stall new wind energy projects and put at risk millions in long-term tax revenue that rural, economically distressed communities rely on to fund schools, emergency services, and local infrastructure.
What does any of this have to do with your electricity bill? Because wind and solar are fuel-free resources, their prices are predictable and steady even when the global fuel markets experience volatile price fluctuations. Without wind and solar on the grid, North Carolina customers would be much more vulnerable to extreme fluctuations that we see in fossil fuel markets, especially during extreme weather or times of increased electricity demand.
Just four years ago a bipartisan law enshrined the need to lower carbon emissions in a least cost manner across the state. This law provides investment certainty to utilities and companies looking to meet our energy needs, prioritize environmental and human health, and keep our state on a path to sustainable economic development. Now, it is up to our state legislators to put North Carolina’s economic future first by sustaining the Governor’s veto.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Wind-farm-SE-Wind-Coaltion-1024x683.webp,,,2025-07-28 11:57:17.197993

Attorneys baffled by federal judge’s order that lists incorrect parties, wrong quotes",Taylor Vance and Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/28/attorneys-baffled-by-federal-court-order-with-factual-errors/,U.S. District Judge Henry .T. Wingate filed a corrected order after attorneys raised concerns about factual errors in the first one.,"A ruling from a federal judge in Mississippi contained factual errors — listing plaintiffs who weren’t parties to the suit, including incorrect quotes from a state law and referring to cases that don’t appear to exist — raising questions about whether artificial intelligence was involved in drafting the order.
U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate issued an error-laden temporary restraining order on July 20, pausing the enforcement of a state law that prohibits diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools and universities. 
Lawyers from the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office asked him to clarify the order on Tuesday, and attorneys for the plaintiffs did not oppose the state’s request. On Wednesday, Wingate replaced the order with a corrected version.His original order no longer appears on the court docket, so the public no longer has access to it. The corrected order is backdated to July 20, even though it was filed three days later.
“Our attorneys have never seen anything like this,” a Mississippi Attorney General’s Office official told Mississippi Today, speaking only on background because the litigation is pending.
Some attorneys who have reviewed the ruling questioned whether artificial intelligence was used to craft the order. Wingate did not respond to repeated questions about the order or whether he or his staff used AI to prepare it.
The original order lists plaintiffs such as the Mississippi Library Association and Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc., who have never been involved in the pending litigation and who do not even have cases pending before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. 
Wingate’s original order also appears to quote portions of the initial lawsuit and the legislation that established Mississippi’s DEI prohibition, making it seem as though the phrases were taken verbatim from the texts. But the quoted phrases don’t appear in either the complaint or the legislation. 
Wingate’s corrected order still cites a 1974 case from the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, Cousins v. School Board of City of Norfolk. However, when Mississippi Today attempted to search for that case, it appears that either it does not exist or the citation is incorrect. 
Christina Frohock, a University of Miami law school professor who studies the dangers artificial intelligence poses to the integrity of the legal system, said a common way attorneys are getting caught using AI is due to “hallucinations,” or instances where AI programs cite cases that don’t exist or use fabricated quotes. 
Frohock was hesitant to draw conclusions about the errors in the Mississippi ruling and attribute them to AI, but she was similarly perplexed by how basic facts from the case record were incorrect. 
“I actually don’t know how to explain the backstory here,” she said. “I feel like I’m Alice in Wonderland.”
Attorneys have an ethical obligation to make truthful representations in court, so when they are caught using artificial intelligence, judges have applied sanctions and demanded explanations. Just this month, a federal judge in Colorado ordered two attorneys to pay thousands in fines after they used AI to write a mistake-riddled court filing.
But there’s little recourse when the tables are turned. 
“If an attorney does this, a judge can demand explanations, but it’s not true in the other direction,” Frohock said. “We will probably never know what happened, unless an appellate court demands it.”
Parties in the case will meet again Aug. 5 to argue about a preliminary injunction in the case. 
Wingate, 78, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1985. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate that same year. He served as chief judge of the Southern District from 2003 to 2010.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07041116/judge-Henry-Wingate-e1514409305395.jpg,,,2025-07-28 11:57:17.197993

Nick Deml plans to step down next month as commissioner of the Vermont Department of Corrections.
A familiar face is set to take over as interim commissioner: former Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad.
Gov. Phil Scott announced the leadership change in a press release Monday. 
“Serving alongside our correctional staff has been the honor of a lifetime,” Deml said in the release. 
Since November 2021, Deml has led Vermont’s six prisons. He took over from interim Commissioner Jim Baker at a tumultuous moment, shepherding a department rocked by scandal and the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Announcing Deml’s successor, Scott called Murad a “proven leader with a strong background in both managing and improving organizations.”
Murad attracted the limelight while serving as Burlington’s top cop, sometimes coming into conflict with the city’s progressive council members. He led the department during summer 2020, which saw nationwide protests against policing in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. He remained in the role after the Burlington City Council voted to reduce the city’s police force through attrition — a decision he strongly opposed. 
Murad announced his intention to leave the Burlington Police Department in November and left in the spring.
“After more than two decades in municipal public service, I’m excited to move to the larger stage of serving the great state of Vermont,” he said in the press release. 
Overseeing Vermont’s prisons has historically drawn scrutiny, and Deml’s tenure was no different. A spate of deaths in 2022 and 2023 at Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield called into question the medical care provided by the prison’s health services contractor at the time. An investigation by Vermont’s Defender General’s Office later found that medical staff with VitalCore Health Strategies appeared to struggle to perform CPR and use a defibrillator. 
Wellpath took over the state’s prison health services contract in July 2023
Like facilities across the country, Vermont’s prisons have had acute staffing shortages since the pandemic, sometimes leading to mandatory 16-hour shifts. 
Under Deml’s leadership, the correction’s department focused on addressing substance use disorder among people in prison. The department prioritized providing medication for opioid use disorder and worked to expand peer recovery coaching and educational opportunities. 
Murad, who will serve as interim commissioner, requires the Vermont Senate’s vote to officially become commissioner. Deml’s last day is Aug. 15.

Gov. Kevin Stitt was tapped by his peers during their summer meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo., to lead the group, which represents the leaders of 55 states, territories and commonwealths. Stitt’s term will run from 2025 to 2026.
Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore was selected to serve as vice chair and as the 2026-2027 chair-elect.
In a statement, Stitt said he will focus on “Reigniting the American Dream,” by highlighting stories from across the country. He said he plans to work with governors, policy experts, business leaders and philanthropists to “discuss best practices and policies that promote the American Dream for all.”
“The beautiful thing about the American Dream is that there are as many dreams as there are people,” Stitt said. “In a time where all we hear is about how divided we are, let’s remind them that we agree on this: the American Dream doesn’t need to be reimagined, it needs to be reignited. Governors are in a unique position to lead this charge. I’m grateful for the trust of my fellow Governors as we start this journey together.”
Stitt said he’ll prioritize creating economic opportunities, on-the-job educational experiences for youth and will focus on artificial intelligence.   
“We all want to create a brighter future for our states, and the nation,” Moore said in a statement. “When we get together at the National Governors Association, we’re focused on whether an idea is good, not on where the idea came from. I’m looking forward to collaborating with my fellow governors to build stronger on-ramps to opportunity so every person in our states has a shot at success – no matter how they define it.”
The following governors were selected to serve on the group’s executive committee: Jared Polis, Colorado; Josh Green, Hawaii; Mike Braun, Indiana; Jeff Landry, Louisiana; Maura Healey, Massachusetts; Michelle Lujan Grisham, New Mexico; and Bill Lee, Tennessee.

“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

Josh Stein vetoed the measure earlier this month, but Senate Republicans are set to bring it back for an override vote on Tuesday.","It's expected that state Republican lawmakers will consider overriding Gov. Josh Stein's vetoes on July 29, 2025. (Photo of NC Legislative Building by Clayton Henkel) North Carolina lawmakers will return to Raleigh this week intending to override several — if not all — of Gov. Josh Stein’s vetoes on more than a dozen bills. When they do, it’ll be under the watchful eyes of numerous advocacy groups.
Among the overrides on tap: a controversial bill eliminating an emissions requirement for Duke Energy, another allowing permit-less carry of handguns for those over 18, and a wide-ranging bill defining gender in state law and restricting birth certificate changes.
Stein, a Democrat, has vetoed the bills over the past few weeks. Attempts to override them — in a Republican-dominated legislature — were all but inevitable. And in the weeks leading up to the anticipate override session, advocates on both sides of the aisle for multiple issues have pushed lawmakers to vote according to their preferences.
In order to override a veto, three-fifths of each chamber must approve. Senate Republicans will meet that threshold if all members are present and voting due to their 30-20 veto-proof supermajority.
Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said Stein’s vetoes indicate “he is out of touch with the people of North Carolina.”
“I look forward to leading Senate Republicans in overriding these harmful vetoes and putting North Carolina families first,” Berger said.
Over in the lower chamber, the GOP holds a 71-49 advantage. That’s one vote short of 60% by party lines.
Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has said the override votes could be added to the calendar any time the House is in session.
Wide-ranging gender identity bill
House Bill 805, which began as a bill focused on preventing exploitation of women and children, was transformed into a conservative vehicle for several sections focused on gender.
Among its provisions: defining “male,” “female” and “biological sex” in state law; allowing parents to name library books their student cannot check out; banning state dollars from being used on gender-affirming care in prisons; and requiring the state to retain the original birth certificate when a transgender person changes the identified sex on theirs.
In the House, one Democrat — Rep. Dante Pittman (D-Wilson) — joined Republicans in favor of the bill. If Pittman remains in favor, it will be enough to override Stein’s veto. On Saturday night at a Democratic Unit Dinner, Pittman appeared to signal he would stand with Stein’s veto. “When I was sitting at my chair and I saw our governor come up on the screen, my resolve was hardened,” Pittman said before delivering the Salute to the Flag of North Carolina. “When it comes to the veto overrides,” he added, “we’ve got your back.”
Transgender and civil rights advocacy groups have voiced passionate opposition to the bill.
Christine Pontes, a social worker and advocate, wrote in an op-ed this month that the bill “targets the rights of transgender people and, in effect, seek to deny their existence.”
And activists on the other side of the issue, too, have urged Republicans to push it forward.
In a letter published in the conservative Carolina Journal, Payton McNabb — a former high school volleyball player who has emerged as a vocal opponent of transgender student athletes in North Carolina — called on lawmakers to “stand for common sense.”
“Turning this bill away is a betrayal of the young women he’s supposed to protect,” McNabb wrote.
Duke Energy emissions repeal
In the midst of the a sweltering summer, lawmakers will aim to lift an interim carbon reduction target for Duke Energy.
Under Senate Bill 266, dubbed “The Power Bill Reduction Act,” the utility would no longer need to meet a 70% reduction of 2005 levels in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. The 2050 goal for carbon neutrality would remain in place. Both goals were set in state law as part of bipartisan legislation enacted in 2021.
Paul Newton, a former Duke Energy executive and state senator until he resigned in March, introduced related legislation that appeared to move through the chamber on a fast track.
“We remain focused on working with state leaders to power North Carolina’s continued success through smart investments and a reliable mix of energy resources while keeping costs as low as possible for our customers,” a Duke Energy spokesperson told NC Newsline.
With such quick movement, opponents say there wasn’t ample opportunity to provide input.
“It’s a great example of why an energy policy shouldn’t rush to make big policy decisions without having a much fuller opportunity for analysis and considerations of how there’s so many interrelated moving parts,” Southern Environmental Law Center senior attorney David Neal said.
Researchers at NC State University found that the bill could cost $23 billion in added fuel expenses through 2050 for ratepayers, according to a study released June 30.
Dan Crawford, North Carolina League of Conservation Voters’ governmental affairs director, said North Carolinians are working hard to keep food on the table and pay their bills.
“They’d be disappointed that lawmakers chose to put the profits of Duke Energy before them, and their short sighted decisions could lead to their power bills going up even more at a time when they can’t afford it,” he said.
Crawford noted there isn’t data at the moment on how many North Carolinians are aware of the legislation, but the group is working on its legislative scorecard to keep voters aware of which lawmakers voted to raise their electricity bills.
The NC Democratic Party, meanwhile, has urged supporters to email their lawmakers with a photo of their most recent power bill.
“Send it to your legislator with a clear message: ‘Do not raise our rates to line Duke Energy’s pockets,'” the party wrote in an emailed message to supporters. “Corporations should pay their fair share.”
In a statement explaining his veto on July 2, Stein made note of the rising temperatures and subsequent soaring utility bills that have plagued the summer months.
“This bill not only makes everyone’s utility bills more expensive, but it also shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people — families will pay more so that industry pays less,” he wrote. “This bill walks back on our state’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy.”
Concealed handguns
Senate Bill 50 would allow North Carolinians over 18 to carry concealed firearms without applying for a permit. The measure, branded “constitutional carry” by conservative backers, is law in 29 other states. Supporters say the bill merely codifies a constitutional right.
The Senate approved the bill on a partisan, 26-18 vote, with all Republicans voting ‘yes’ and all Democrats voting ‘no.’ Six members were absent. In the House, the vote was 59-48, with two Republicans — Reps. William Brisson (R-Bladen) and Ted Davis (R-New Hanover) — joining Democrats in opposition. If Brisson and Davis remain opposed, it could make it much harder for Republicans to must the necessary three-fifths vote to override the veto.
In announcing his veto, Stein said:


        “This bill makes North Carolinians less safe and undermines responsible gun ownership. Therefore, I am vetoing it. The bill eliminates training requirements associated with concealed carry permits and reduces the age to carry a concealed weapon from 21 to 18 years old. Authorizing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon with no training whatsoever is dangerous. The bill would also make the job of a law enforcement officer more difficult and less safe. We can and should protect the right to bear arms without recklessly endangering law enforcement officers and our people.”     

 
The veto announcement also noted that the action had the support Sheriffs Charles Blackwood of Orange County and Clarence Birkhead of Durham County. The nonprofit group Moms Rising North Carolina issued a statement thanking Stein for vetoing what it termed “reckless legislation that would put us all in danger.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Legislature_RedCarpet_PhotoClaytonHenkel-1024x569.jpg,,,2025-07-28 11:57:17.197993

He was there as the Affordable Care Act marketplace came online, and as Missouri slowly expanded its Medicaid program, known as MO HealthNet.

He’s witnessed Missouri struggling for years to process benefits applications in a timely manner.
Now, under President Donald Trump’s new budget plan, Americans aged 19 to 64 who are enrolled in Medicaid will be required to show proof of 80 hours of work, school, caregiving or volunteering a month to be eligible for coverage.
Wehner worries about what new Medicaid work requirements might mean for the people he assists on a day-to-day basis.
“It’s going to directly affect the Medicaid expansion (group),” said Wehner, a benefits enrollment counselor at Missouri Connections for Health in Columbia. “I think tangentially, it will affect the other populations, just because of the amount of resources that will be needed to see if these people are putting in 80 hours.”
For years, Missouri has struggled to process social services applications in a timely manner, drawing the ire of advocates and the courts. Federal regulations require states to process Medicaid applications based on income in 45 days, but Missouri has repeatedly violated the time frame requirements.
Wehner anticipates more confusion with the new rules, which are slated to begin in December 2026, after the midterm elections.
Missouri struggles to administer safety net programs. Congress is proposing more red tape

Research in states that have put work requirements in place confirms that suspicion. Enrollees found it difficult to fulfill the requirements and submit the proper documentation, leading to people losing coverage.
“I imagine I’m going to get a lot of people asking for help,” Wehner said. “You get your yellow letter in the mail. It’s several pages. Even when I’m working with people, I get a highlighter and I go through and find, ‘OK, here’s what we need to do.’ It’s not really obvious what you need to do.”
New estimates from KFF found that the Trump administration’s budget package would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $911 billion over the next 10 years and increase the number of uninsured Americans by 10 million. The largest portion of savings would come from work requirements on the Affordable Care Act expansion group – totaling about $326 billion saved over the next decade.
In Missouri, that would amount to an estimated 130,000 people losing access to Medicaid as their form of health insurance.
 How the state may shift to handle increased eligibility checks 

For years, Missouri has looked to update its technology to better handle the administrative burden as advocates demanded solutions to the delays across Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) applications.
“It really is going to be a new system to implement,” said Lucas Caldwell-McMillan, the chief of policy at Empower Missouri, an anti-poverty advocacy group. “Right now we’ve got a pretty outdated system that is struggling. I think the frontline agency staff are working their hardest to implement it now, but they’re falling short.”
Under the new framework for Medicaid, states will need to process proof of the 80 hours of work, school, caregiving or volunteering, and will need to check eligibility for enrollment twice a year, rather than the current standard of once annually.
“These are six-month eligibility checks, so essentially doubling the work there,” said Caldwell-McMillan. “Both on the participant, but also the agency. And instituting these work requirements in Medicaid will require a whole new system to verify information that’s never been verified by the Medicaid agency before.”
According to Timothy McBride, a health economist and professor at the Washington University School of Public Health, states and enrollees have struggled to keep track of the documentation required to track whether people are working.
“The recipient has to actually interact with the program and make sure they get the paperwork filled out and submitted and it doesn’t get lost,” McBride said. “And that’s where it has broken down in states like Missouri, and where this has caused problems in our past.”
The increased burden for the state could come at a high cost, with not much savings. Research shows that both in Missouri and at the national level, about 90% of adults on Medicaid already have a job or would be considered exempt from work requirements.
States like Arkansas and Georgia have looked to put work requirements in place for years, but both have struggled.
Arkansas briefly put 20-hour per week work requirements in place from 2018 to 2019 for childless adults aged 30 to 49. After a federal court blocked the requirements, Arkansas stopped the program.
But in the brief time those requirements were in place, about 18,000 enrollees in the state lost their coverage. The state spent more than $26 million in administrative costs on eligibility checks and to put the program in place.
A study found that half of those in Arkansas who had lost Medicaid as part of the requirements reported serious problems paying off medical debt, while 56% delayed some form of medical care due to the cost and 64% delayed medication due to the cost.
The study also found that the work requirements did little to increase the number of enrollees who were employed. More than 95% of those in the work requirement group were either already working or qualified for an exemption. There did not appear to be any significant upticks in employment as a result of the requirements.
In 2023, 44% of the adults 19-64 enrolled in Medicaid were working full time, while 20% were working part time. Another 12% didn’t work due to caregiving, while 10% didn’t work due to illness and 7% didn’t work because they were enrolled in school, leaving only 8% not working due to another reason.
In an interview with St. Louis Public Radio, Todd Richardson, the director of Missouri’s Medicaid program, said the state would look into using an online portal to streamline the process for enrollees.
“Our goal is to make sure that people who are eligible and entitled to be on the program have the easiest path to get access to those benefits, while at the same time ensuring that those who are not eligible for the program are not on the program,” he told the outlet.
“If they’re working and we can verify that they’re working through income data, then that’s a verification right there,” Richardson added. “Now, there are other exceptions to the work requirements that probably will require a participant to send some documentation or to involve a human. But I think there’s a lot of that income verification that can be done electronically.”
Reduction of federal support for the program and the ways that states can fund Medicaid will leave Missouri lawmakers with a tricky budget situation in the years to come. Because the state’s expansion came through a voter-approved constitutional amendment, lawmakers won’t be able to easily undo the expansion, and the state is on the hook to pay for the full cost of the program.
States may turn to other programs to find ways to recoup the costs.
Missouri offers benefits through Medicaid beyond what is required by the federal government. Things like dental coverage, some mental health coverage, long-term care or Missouri’s recent expansion of Medicaid for postpartum women could be targets for cuts.
“I imagine they’re pretty nervous about this,” McBride said. “Frankly, those of us who just want the state to function are nervous for them because we want them to be able to do this. It’s really potentially catastrophic for the state.”
Otherwise, McBride said, programs like education, roads or prison funding would be likely places for the state to turn.
“The other options are to cut spending elsewhere,” McBride said. “They would cut Medicaid in places where they can cut Medicaid, and I’m pretty sure the state would have to cut from all of the above.”
 How could work requirements look in rural Missouri? 

New work requirements pose hurdles in rural parts of the state that urban areas may not face. Completing the necessary paperwork with unreliable internet or technology access could add another layer of difficulty.
Things like access to transportation, or a job with enough hours, could set Missourians back from obtaining coverage, said Caldwell-McMillan.
“It’s finding a job, and finding a job that is going to give you enough hours all of the time when they’re checking eligibility requirements,” Caldwell-McMillan said. “Retail workers, cashiers, cooks, those shifts can change. All of those folks are very much at risk — although they’re working — of not exactly meeting the hourly requirements and at risk of losing coverage.”
Navigators like Wehner will have to consider ways to help people report their work or caregiving when they may not have much access to technology.
“A lot of people I work with live out in rural areas. They may not even have a smartphone and definitely not internet access,” Wehner said. “So just to report things online is going to be really burdensome.”
Other trickle-down impacts could also hit rural Missouri the hardest. Rural hospitals, for example, rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursements to keep their doors open. Most recent data show 44% of rural hospitals have negative margins.
The budget package includes $50 billion for a rural hospital fund, which is equal to about one-third of the estimated loss of federal Medicaid funding in rural communities. The budget provides $10 million a year for five years for the fund, but health economists and Medicaid experts say the federal spending will be finished before many of the losses to Medicaid funding are fully realized.
Coupled with cuts to SNAP, the potential loss of a hospital in a rural area could be damaging to local economies, Caldwell-McMillan said.
“Many of those counties are the folks who are facing perhaps a closure of a clinic or the closure of the closest hospital because of cuts to Medicaid,” Caldwell-McMillan said. “So it really is a perfect storm of folks — working families — who need the support, and then two big sources of support are going to be taken away.”
“There’s going to be really tough choices and really tough consequences.”

(Photo by Brent Stirton/Getty Images)Their cases were different. One faced a four-year prison sentence in a $675 million fraud case for marketing an electric truck that wasn’t drivable. Another tried to overthrow the government. A tax cheat avoided prison and $4.4 million in restitution after his mom donated $1 million to the president.
Their cases have two things in common. President Donald Trump pardoned them all in the early months of his second administration. And those pardons violated long-standing Department of Justice policies that reward people who show remorse, pay restitution and can contribute to society. Since returning to the White House, Trump has pardoned more than 1,600 people and at least two corporations in his first six months in office. Many of those pardons have violated standards designed to ensure fairness and to protect the public, attorneys and legal experts say.

This story is part of “Trump Two: Six Months In,” a Marshall Project series taking stock of the administration’s efforts to reshape immigration enforcement and criminal justice.

The changes began immediately. Hours after taking the oath of office, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. That included men who used bear spray, bats, batons and poles to assault police officers.
Past presidents have issued controversial pardons, usually in their last days in office: Bill Clinton pardoned financier Marc Rich, Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter despite promising not to, and George H.W. Bush pardoned six prominent officials for their roles in the Iran-Contra scandal.
But legal experts say no president has started a term with so many pardons that violate long-standing policies and norms.
Lee Kovarsky, a University of Texas law professor, describes Trump’s Jan. 6 action as “patronage pardoning” — highly publicized actions that send the message that Trump will protect allies who break the law to advance his agenda. “It’s mafia stuff,” Kovarsky said. “They won’t break your legs, but they’ll publicly pardon the person who does.”
Article II of the Constitution gives the president the power to pardon anyone for federal crimes. The Supreme Court’s 2024 decision about presidential immunity made it clear that the president has broad leeway when exercising core powers of the office.
“The Supreme Court decision makes it hard to even get a grasp on just how blatantly corrupt presidential conduct would have to be to overcome immunity,” said Brandon Garrett, a Duke University law professor.
In her dissent in the immunity case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor specifically cited pardons when listing crimes that future presidents could commit without consequences. “Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.”
The Justice Department has housed the Pardon Attorney since 1894. Over the years, the practice of processing applications for pardons and commutations has been codified in the Justice Manual, which lays out how clemency is supposed to be administered.
One of the two main purposes of the Justice Manual is to ensure that all applications are judged by the same set of rules regardless of who you are or who you know, said Liz Oyer, who served as Pardon Attorney for three years. The second is to “ensure that it is granted to people who are truly deserving of a second chance and who will not present a danger to the community in the future.”

In March, actor Mel Gibson, a friend of Trump, sought to have his criminal record cleaned up so he could own a gun again. Oyer declined to recommend a pardon due to Gibson’s history of violence against women. She was fired several hours later, with no reason given. She is suing to get her job back.
The Justice Department issued a statement saying that it follows the Justice Manual in reviewing pardon applications and making recommendations.
One of the pardon office’s first tasks is to seek input from the people with a stake in the conviction: prosecutors, sentencing judges and crime victims. The office can request an FBI background check. The Jan. 6 pardons were announced hours after inauguration, so no input was solicited in the 1,500 cases.
Among the people Trump pardoned for Jan. 6 was David Daniel of Mint Hill, North Carolina. Had the rules been followed, the pardon office would have learned that Daniel faces charges of child pornography and the sexual assault of a preadolescent girl.
In serious crimes — violence or expensive white collar crime, for example — the Justice Manual recommends that a suitable length of time should elapse before a pardon is even considered to avoid denigrating the seriousness of the offense.
That stipulation didn’t apply to Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers — a far-right anti-government militia — who was sentenced to 18 years for trying to overthrow the government. He served less than two years before Trump commuted his sentence to time served. Trump has also pardoned at least nine people before or shortly after they reported to prison, including one person before sentencing.
Another important policy in the Justice Manual on pardons is whether the person has accepted responsibility and is remorseful: “A petitioner should be genuinely desirous of forgiveness rather than vindication.”
Trump pardoned Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys and an architect of the attack on the Capitol, who had been sentenced to 22 years. Afterward, Tarrio and other Proud Boys sued the Justice Department for $100 million, claiming they were the victims of wrongful prosecution.
Another important condition for a pardon is restitution: Have the pardon seekers paid money to make their crime victims whole?
This brings up what Kovarsky, the Texas law professor, calls the “open for business pardon,” in which Trump grants pardons to people who have politically supported him or who may owe large sums in restitution.
A jury convicted Trevor Milton, the founder of electric truck startup Nikola, on fraud charges; a judge sentenced him to four years in prison. He notably had made a video in which a prototype truck that appeared to be driving down a highway was actually a nonfunctioning truck rolling down an incline.
In October, Milton and his wife each donated $900,000 to Trump political committees. In March, federal prosecutors urged the trial judge to order Milton to pay $675 million in restitution. Two weeks later, shortly before Milton was to report to federal prison, Trump granted him a pardon that eliminated his prison sentence and wiped away his restitution to the victims of his fraud.
Milton has maintained that he is innocent, that he was the victim of dishonest Biden administration prosecutors, and that his political contributions had nothing to do with the pardon. He said he donated to Trump out of opposition to Biden’s economic policy. “I just wanted some fiscal responsibility,” he told a Phoenix TV reporter.
In late 2024, Paul Walczak, a Florida nursing home executive, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to pay $4.4 million in restitution for stealing his employees’ tax payments. Just three weeks after Walczak’s mother attended a $1 million-a-head fundraiser for Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president pardoned Walczak, wiping out the prison term and restitution.
Trump’s pardons have proved costly for taxpayers and crime victims. Besides the group pardons of Jan. 6 defendants and anti-abortion protestors, the president has pardoned 46 individuals. Of those, more than half have been freed of fines and restitution.
Oyer, the former pardon attorney, has set up a “pardon tracker” on her website that tallies the price of Trump’s pardons of people and companies that owed restitution and fines. As of July 23, the cost to taxpayers and crime victims is more than $1.3 billion.
Oyer’s tracker also shows a growing backlog of pardon applications from ordinary Americans. The queue was just under 5,000 when Trump entered office. The count on July 15 had more than doubled, to 11,664.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Members of a task force aiming to reduce the property tax burden for South Dakota homeowners are considering proposals to reduce or replace property taxes by relying on sales or transaction taxes.
The task force dug into two proposals and heard a new idea from a former lawmaker at its latest meeting in Rapid City earlier this month. The Legislative Research Council also prepared other options to reduce or replace property taxes.
“It takes a lot of courage to try and digest all of this,” said task force member and state House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish. “For too long, because it’s such a beast, people have had trouble getting their hands around property taxes, what they fund, and increased spending, until people get forced out of their homes.”

The Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force aims to recommend ways to cut the average South Dakota homeowner’s property taxes by at least 50%. Lawmakers already adopted Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s proposal earlier this year to slow property tax increases with multifaceted reforms including a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments.
Property taxes go to schools, counties, cities and other local taxing entities, such as water and fire districts. Sales taxes go to cities and the state. The state does not receive any property tax revenue.
The total, statewide amount of property taxes paid on owner-occupied homes grew by 64% from 2017 to 2024, according to state Department of Revenue data. A public outcry about rising tax bills led legislators to appoint the summer task force, which aims to propose legislation for the annual winter lawmaking session.
The task force has heard public comment not only in Rapid City but also in Sioux Falls and plans to meet three more times, including in Aberdeen and Pierre.
“I think we’re at a point where we need to start coalescing ideas and presenting them,” said the chairman of the task force, state Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls.
Task force hears new proposal
The newest proposal pitched to the task force this month would add a flat $1.50 tax on transactions of $15 or greater, and add a tax of 10% on smaller transactions. The new tax, said former state Sen. Julie Frye-Mueller, R-Rapid City, would replace property taxes entirely by generating $1.75 billion in revenue.
“Our ultimate goal is to remove the threat of government or others from taking our properties with a tax lien,” Frye-Mueller said.
A tax lien is a legal claim that local governments can place on a home when property taxes are delinquent. It triggers a process that can ultimately lead to the seizure and sale of the property.

The transaction taxes would be added on top of the state’s current sales tax structure, which includes the state 4.2% sales tax, up to 2% city sales taxes, and up to 1% additional city taxes on alcohol, restaurants, event admissions and lodging. 
With all of those rates applied, the current tax on a $15 purchase would be $1.08. With the additional flat transaction tax, it would grow to $2.58.
Frye-Mueller said the transaction taxes would also be applied to purchases that are currently exempt from sales taxes. She and other speakers said it would not be regressive since property taxes would no longer exist or be figured into monthly rental amounts.
The proposal uses a calculation relying on visitor spending from 15 million people, which made some lawmakers skeptical. The state Department of Revenue would collect the tax and distribute it among local governments, based on their budgeting needs, according to the presentation. The proposal would allow the Legislature to increase the flat rate by up to a nickel each year.
The group backing the proposal, Abolish Property Taxes South Dakota, plans to ask legislators to put the plan on the ballot for voters to consider. If that fails, they plan to submit it as a citizen-initiated ballot measure for the November 2026 election.
More details on governor’s proposal
Gov. Rhoden has proposed an optional county-level sales tax of a half-percent to offset participating counties’ property taxes on owner-occupied homes. A “homeowner tax credit” would be applied to property taxes from the revenue generated from the half-percent sales tax, according to proposal documents. A homeowner’s tax bill would show the amount of tax credits applied to the property.
If funds from the optional sales tax fully offset owner-occupied property taxes in a county, remaining funds would be used to lower property taxes for agricultural and commercial properties. The tax relief option could be referred to a public vote if residents don’t agree with their local county commission’s decision to impose it.
Some lawmakers worried that the sales tax idea would shift the tax burden from property to sales and South Dakotans wouldn’t see an overall reduction in taxes they pay. Bureau of Finance and Management Commissioner Jim Terwilliger and Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, said homeowners would save money.
“I’d have to spend $50,000 before I matched my local county taxation with a 0.5% sales tax,” Deibert said. “That’s just in my district.”

Statewide, a half-percent sales tax would replace, on average, 94% of a county’s share of owner-occupied property taxes, according to estimates from the governor’s administration. The proposal would not affect the property taxes received by cities, schools and other local taxing entities.
In Minnehaha County, the half-percent sales tax would cover an estimated 98% of owner-occupied property taxes. The strategy would cover an estimated 76% in Pennington County.
Counties that share jurisdiction with tribal land would see the largest potential increase in funds to offset property taxes, largely because tribal land is not subject to property taxes. The counties that would see the lowest benefit, based on the estimates, would be Turner, Clay and Meade counties at 48%, 52% and 56% of owner-occupied taxes, respectively.
LRC studies other options
In a white paper prepared by the Legislative Research Council, eliminating the county portion of owner-occupied taxes would, on average, reduce homeowners’ property taxes by 20%.
South Dakota schools rely on three education levies collected through property taxes: general education, special education and capital outlay. Eliminating the special education and general education levies would reduce average owner-occupied property taxes by 25%.
Eliminating two education and the county levies would cost $430.8 million to counties and schools, unless the loss is replaced with different revenue sources.
The white sheet explored different ways to replace property taxes wholly or in part by increasing local governments’ other revenues or capturing more state funding for local use, including cutting state government across the board, raising sales tax rates, increasing the contractor’s excise tax rate, redirecting a portion of Future Fund economic development dollars toward property tax relief, increasing the state’s share of video lottery revenue, removing some sales tax and property tax exemptions, and placing a new tax on vaping. Each proposal would put some or all of the savings or gains toward local governments for property tax reductions.

The research also dug into a tax that state Senate Majority Leader Jim Mehlhaff proposed at a prior meeting. Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, proposed an additional 1% tax on all sales in the state including currently exempt sales, except for items intended for resale and items that, constitutionally, cannot be taxed. 
Originally, the proposal was thought to be able to replace education property taxes paid across all types of property, which was $928.6 million in 2023. Owner-occupied property taxes paid for $382.4 million that year. Based on the latest LRC estimate, the tax would generate about $698 million in revenue for education.
Odenbach, who chairs the task force’s school funding work group, said the revenue replacement would have to be “iron clad” and not allow local governments to increase budgets through property taxes later. He added that some exemptions in the state tax code could be repealed and cuts could be made across state government, among other things, to raise money that could be applied to reduce property taxes for South Dakotans.
“I think these things are all in the mix,” Odenbach said.
South Dakota homeowners paid about $792 million in owner-occupied property taxes in 2024. South Dakotans across all types of property paid nearly $1.8 billion in property taxes.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_2702-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

(Photo by Cressandra Thibodeaux, with the background artificially expanded by Source for publication purposes).On July 29, New Mexico legislators on the interim Science, Technology & Telecommunications Committee are slated to meet in Los Alamos and hear testimony on “responsible artificial intelligence” from several experts, including Santa Fe Institute Professor Cris Moore.
A computer scientist, Moore’s interest in AI dates to at least 2016, when he noted an uptick in discussion about its rising use. Computer scientists, civil rights advocates, legal scholars and others were concerned about using algorithms to make decisions in the criminal justice system, he says, but also about their rising use for myriad “consequential decisions, things that really affect people’s fundamental rights, their lives, their livelihoods, their opportunities: hiring, loans, leases, home-buying and so-on.”
Moore had initially thought he’d contribute to that discourse as an academic, but conversations with State Sen. Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) connected Moore to the late state Supreme Court Judge Charles Daniels, who in turn put him in touch with New Mexico’s Administrative Office of the Courts. From there, Moore worked with the University of New Mexico’s Institute for Social Research to evaluate an algorithmic criminal justice assessment tool used widely in the state. That led to data-driven work published in 2022 assessing the potential outcome of ongoing proposals to expand pretrial detention. That research found those proposals would lead to a very high percentage of defendants being unnecessarily and unfairly detained.
In an interview with Source, Moore said decision makers and society need to consider both sides when thinking about the use of algorithmic tools in criminal justice.
“We need to think about the false positives — where we think that someone is dangerous even though they’re not — and we detain them, and the false negatives, where we release somebody, and then they do something really serious.”
As he’s worked on these issues, Moore said, he’s learned “just how complicated the system is, and the stakes of the debate…This started out as a question about mathematics and statistics, and it’s turned much more into a question about human beings and human systems, including the judicial system. How should the systems be run, and what does it mean for those systems to be fair? What does it mean for those systems to be transparent?
This week’s AI legislative hearing comes amid ongoing government discussion of AI, near and far. In May, New Mexico’s Public Education Department published its AI guidance for K-12 education. Last week, the Trump administration released its AI “action plan.”
The following interview has been edited for concision and clarity.
 
You delivered a presentation to lawmakers five years ago and listed four questions to help evaluate the fairness and transparency of AI. Does that list still hold? [The list, summarized: How does the algorithm work? Can we validate its performance independently? When should humans be in that process? And what does the data really mean?]
Cristopher Moore: Often now, what I lead with is: ‘What data does the algorithm use?’ Because that already raises a lot of issues. Is it using my social media? Does it know I’ve applied for a job? For an apartment? That gets into lots of questions, including privacy. I think I would like to know something about what it does with this data, which, in some cases, gets into more technical questions about its inner workings. And yes, I would like to know, ‘Hey, does this thing actually work?’ Has any independent entity tested the vendors’ claims?’ There are a lot of AI systems out there being used to make important decisions, or to advise human decision-makers about important decisions, that have never been independently tested by anybody— we’re just relying on the vendors’ claims, and I think that’s a pretty dangerous situation.
The good thing about AI is we can measure it and observe it and get a clear sense of what mistakes it makes. But again, that’s something vendors are not incentivized to advertise.
What do you plan to tell state lawmakers?
There are things that state legislatures can do to try to ensure that AI is used properly, that it is accountable, and that it has some degree of transparency. I’m not against AI, but I am against opaque systems that their users and the people affected by them don’t understand; [whose] vendors are not willing to open up and tell you how they work; and where they haven’t even been independently tested by anybody. 
I think it’s appropriate for state legislatures — and a lot of them are doing this — to draw some guardrails and to say, ‘Well, you know, if you’re going to make these so called consequential decisions about people, then you should be open to having some independent studies done.’ Or at the very least: You should make people aware that they’re interacting with an AI. One of the things that it would make sense to ask for is just disclosure. If you’re going to apply for a job, and the company you’re applying to is going to use an AI to screen the job applicants — maybe you’re applying for a job with particular skills and maybe they will use an AI to read your resume to try to certify you have those skills — at least let the applicant know that’s happening. That’s the least, to me, that’s the floor: Don’t hide the fact that an AI is being used to make a decision about you.
President Trump’s new AI ‘action plan’ intimates that states with burdensome AI regulation could lose out on federal funding. Is it worth it for New Mexico to lose funding to create those guardrails?
Well, of course, I’m strongly against that policy. You probably know that in the Big Beautiful Bill, [Republican Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz] had proposed a 10-year moratorium on state AI laws and, after some back and forth with [Republican Tennessee U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn], that moratorium was removed by a 99-to-one vote. So I think the good news is: This is not a partisan issue, at least not yet. I’m worried that it’s becoming partisan, but it shouldn’t be partisan. In fact, some of the model laws we’re looking at come from Utah. Utah put together an AI policy office. A friend of mine works there, and one of the things that they were tasked to do is develop guidelines for mental health chat bots. So, it’s like: ‘We have a hideous shortage of mental health providers; Is this maybe a good kind of frontline thing to help people?’ Some people are like, ‘Yeah, that’s a great idea.’ And some people are like, ‘Oh, my god no.’ But it seems clear that if these things are going to be used, they should make it absolutely clear to the patient that they were talking to an AI and not to a human. And moreover, the AI should look out for things where [it will say]: ‘OK, this is above my pay grade. You really need to talk to a human about this.’
Trump’s AI Action Plan removes ‘red tape’ for AI developers and data centers, punishes states that act alone

Colorado’s law is considered one of the most comprehensive and requires developers to disclose information about their AI systems as well as its potential risks of discrimination. Would New Mexico benefit from a similar law?
Our House Bill 60 in the last session was inspired by the Colorado law, and the Colorado law is still on the books, although some people tried to get rid of it in their last legislative session. I think there are things we could do to make that kind of bill better. One of the objections to the Colorado law is that it puts some responsibility on the developers of these tools, but it also puts a lot of responsibility on the deployers — the users of these tools. I think there was some legitimate concern about, ‘What if I’m a small school district using some AI, or what if I’m a rural clinic using AI? Are you saying I need to do some big, complicated study that I don’t have the expertise to do?’ I think putting more of the responsibility on the developers is probably a good idea.
New Mexico’s Public Education Department recently published its K-12 AI guidance, which includes ethical awareness as one of its literacy points, but also notes the use of AI to help with building lesson plans and such. Is this potentially problematic given the degree to which some AI systems tend to fabricate information?
It’s vitally important for people to understand that these chat bots are not trying to tell the truth. They’re also not trying to lie. They’re not trying to be deceptive. They’re also not trying to say accurate things about the world. They are simply emitting strings of words that look statistically like the strings of words in their training data.
There are basic skills of writing a book report; or reading something and synthesizing it; or reading two opposing essays on a topic and synthesizing an understanding of the arguments. If humans lose those skills, I think we’re in real trouble. I don’t mind outsourcing long division to a calculator — I’m not quite so old fashioned as to think that everybody needs to know long division. But as we outsource more and more of what it means to learn, to explore, to distinguish truth from falsehood…that certainly makes me nervous.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CrisMooreSFIscientist-1024x512.jpg,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

Roy Cooper formally launched his campaign for U.S. Senate on Monday morning, making a long-rumored candidacy official and cementing himself as the all-but-certain Democratic nominee in 2026.
In a video announcement, Cooper says he “really never wanted to go to Washington.” But now, he’ll seek to head there as the successor to retiring U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican — hoping to flip the seat blue.
“Right now, our country is facing a moment as fragile as any I can remember,” Cooper said. “And the decisions we make in the next election will determine if we even have a middle class in America.”
Cooper served two terms in the governor’s mansion, with prior stints as attorney general and a state senator. He’s a Nash County native and attorney. His launch comes just days after he teased his run in front of state Democrats at the party’s annual fundraising dinner.
He is currently joined in the Democratic field by former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, who is reportedly set to suspend his campaign. And his Republican opponent will most likely be Michael Whatley — the Republican National Committee chairman and former head of the North Carolina GOP.
Early campaign messaging from Cooper and Democrats signal that he will lean on his reputation and accomplishments in elected office — including working with lawmakers to expand Medicaid and raise teacher pay.
North Carolin Democratic Party chair Anderson Clayton said in a statement she was “confident he will flip this seat in 2026.” And Senate Majority PAC, one of the main campaign fundraisers for Senate Democrats, said Cooper’s entry “confirms the state is a prime pick-up opportunity.”
Republicans, meanwhile, see him as a frequent target of criticism and controversy, which they’ll seek to capitalize on.
U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, who chairs congressional Republicans’ campaign operation, said Cooper “spent decades dragging North Carolina left, and now he wants to do the same to America.”
Senate Republicans’ campaign arm called him a “wreck” in a digital ad criticizing his record. And the Senate Leadership Fund, a PAC for the Senate GOP, blasted him for the state’s hurricane response and key vetoes on transgender rights and immigration.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_9728-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project, became interested in climate science and energy through working in community and economic development in rural areas. 


Reflector Podcast · Federal green energy u-turn, natural gas costs concern environmentalist

“I wanted to see how rural Kansas could really take advantage of the clean energy economy and how that could help the areas I had grown up in,” she said. “But as I learned more about climate change, about the environment, as I began to be a grandmother, much of the mission to equitably reduce greenhouse gas emissions resonated with me.”
Today, she’s watching with concern as federal policy encourages the country’s energy reliance on fossil fuels and reduces incentives to move toward green energy. 
“My primary concern about what’s happening is how the inaction we’re taking will impact climate change,” she said. “Every report that we read, every bit of scientific data, says this is the decade that we should be scaling up large-scale renewable energy projects and cutting greenhouse gas emissions if we’re going to stay within a reasonable amount of global warming.”
Barnett pointed to climate change effects, including recent flooding and heat waves. 
“I was reading an article yesterday that was talking about every degree it gets hotter is impacting crop yield, and that should concern every Kansan as the breadbasket of the world,” she said. “Climate change is an economic issue. It’s a health issue. It’s a resiliency issue.”
Along with those concerns, Barnett also highlights the pocketbook effect for most Kansans, who will be paying more for energy. The federal government changed or eliminated incentives to build large-scale wind and solar farms, which do a lot to help Kansans offset costs associated with gas and coal, she said. 
Barnett listed other changes that cut support for the federal weatherization program that helps people with low incomes make their homes more energy efficient and safe. 
Kansas Corporation Commission Chairman Andrew French at a hearing last week talked with Evergy officials about potential inequities in the energy system. 
“You’ve probably got a lot of higher-income folks that have newer housing stock, efficient appliances, their bills are on autopay, so they may be experiencing lower bills, even if they have a larger house,” French said. “And they’re not as price sensitive. Then you’ve got a pretty good segment of the population that’s lower income. They have less efficient housing stock, they have less efficient appliances and probably don’t have the means to upgrade those.”
French said that there’s an argument to be made that offering the same rates for such vastly different residential consumers could be seen as “not just and reasonable or unreasonably discriminatory.”
Such discussion isn’t a surprise to Barnett. 
“We’ve seen decades of disinvestment in marginalized communities,” she said. “Folks that are in those older homes oftentimes are dealing with really hard choices. Am I going to pay the electric bill so that I can maintain some sort of cooling in these high temperatures that we’re facing, or am I going to be able to buy some medicine and put some food on the table?”
 
Aging infrastructure
Keeping energy costs down is an important consideration for infrastructure expansions in the state. Evergy recently received KCC approval to build two natural gas plants and a solar plant. Barnett is concerned about the gas plants, which she refuses to call “natural.”. 
“That’s a fossil fuel talking point, so let’s call it what it is,” she said. “It’s fossil gas, and it may not be as bad from a greenhouse gas emission standpoint or from a carbon pollution standpoint as coal, but it does emit methane, which is a very strong greenhouse gas.” 
Climate + Energy Project intervened in the KCC docket about building the new plants, Barnett said. 
“We oppose them on two fronts,” she said. “Again, it’s completely against our mission to reduce greenhouse gas emissions equitably. From a more practical standpoint and going back to what I said about energy burden, we have some real concerns that fossil gas is a risky financial investment for Kansans.”
Barnett said the cost of gas has been “low-ish” for a decade, but according to predictions that won’t continue. Specifically, she said, the federal government is pushing for more gas use and is incentivizing exporting it to other countries, all of which are likely to drive up costs. 
She said she remembers talking with an executive in the utility industry early in her career who had begun investing in wind energy. 
“He was like, ‘We didn’t do this because we care about the environment, because we care about clean energy,’” she said, recalling his words. “‘We were really dependent on gas and our portfolio had a lot of gas and people couldn’t afford their bills. So we needed to diversify our fuel mix.’”
Energy future
Barnett said she hopes to see investment in battery energy storage systems and other innovative strategies to address utility needs. 
Battery technology and energy storage tax credits survived the federal government’s changes, she said. 
“What I’m hearing is we may begin to see a big investment in battery energy storage, while wind and solar are kind of on the back burner,” Barnett said. “Geothermal technology actually also fared well in the ‘big, beautiful bill.’”
Kansas has limited opportunities in geothermal, she said, because it uses so much water. 
“Kansas has such a robust wind resource that almost nothing can compare economically,” Barnett said. “For so many years, the mantra was, ‘Let’s let the market decide.’ Well, the market decided that wind and solar were the most cost-effective ways to generate electricity in the United States. And now, what market, right? It has been some of the most interesting times I’ve ever been a part of around wind and solar for the last almost 20 years.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dorothy-Barnett1-1024x576.png,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera, and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.










What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF


Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.




What we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF



Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

Several states have passed new laws regulating these machines, which officials say are increasingly being used to scam consumers. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)They may resemble other ATMs, but officials are increasingly warning about the potential for fraud with the expanding fleet of cryptocurrency ATMs popping up across the country.
The National Consumers League says the largely unregulated machines have become favored by scammers for their anonymity and irreversibility — once a user transfers or deposits funds, that money is essentially gone.
While officials say the machines can be used for legitimate purposes, red and blue states are increasingly imposing new regulations to protect consumers: AARP says 11 states have recently passed new laws or regulations of the machines.
“In state after state, AARP found lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and local law enforcement eager to work on commonsense rules that balance innovation and consumer safety,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president and chief advocacy and engagement officer, said in a news release.
Last year, the FBI reported nearly 11,000 complaints of cryptocurrency ATM fraud. Those cases disproportionately affected older Americans and cost victims $246.7 million.
Cryptocurrencies are digital assets, including bitcoin, that offer an alternative payment or method without control of a central bank or government like other currencies. Crypto ATMs, sometimes called crypto kiosks, allow users to insert cash or use debit cards to convert currencies such as U.S. dollars into cryptocurrencies.
The Federal Trade Commission says crypto ATM scams often start with a call or text message warning of a supposed problem, such as unauthorized bank charges or suspicious activity on an Amazon account.
The FTC says consumers should contact banks or other institutions directly about any account issues. And it warns consumers not to believe anyone who says they must use a crypto ATM to address a financial problem.
“Real businesses and government agencies will never do that — anyone who does is a scammer,” the agency said.
States look at shoring up consumer protections as Trump hobbles federal watchdog

After signing a bill with new regulations, Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen was clear that the state would continue to welcome cryptocurrency businesses as it aims to become a hub for the industry.
The Nebraska law requires ATM operators to acquire state licensure, warn customers of the potential for criminal exploitation and take “reasonable steps to detect and prevent fraud.” The law also limits transactions to $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 for existing customers, and requires operators to issue refunds for properly reported fraudulent transactions.
At least 40 states have introduced legislation regarding cryptocurrency, digital or virtual currencies and other digital assets in the 2025 legislative session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those measures include ATM regulations, prohibiting the use of digital currencies by governments and allowing state investment in digital assets.
Federal lawmakers are also taking action on the issue. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives declared the week of July 14 “Crypto Week,” when lawmakers considered several pieces of legislation.
At the end of that week, President Donald Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, the first major law governing digital currency. It establishes a regulatory framework for the industry.
Trump hopes the bill will instill confidence in the industry that spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might, The Associated Press reported.
“This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit,” the president told crypto executives.
In state legislatures, new bills regulating crypto ATMS have enjoyed bipartisan support. AARP tracking shows new bills have been approved in Arkansas, Iowa and Oklahoma, as well as in more liberal states such as Maryland and Vermont.
In May, Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed Republican-sponsored legislation that sets daily transaction limits and mandates crypto ATM operators provide customers certain disclosures and warnings.
The legislation followed local news coverage of at least two dozen crypto scams, including one that cost an Arizonan $28,000.

(Photo: Screenshot from video feed)North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs will talk about protecting the right to vote and her opponent’s attempt to overturn her 2024 election victory at an upcoming forum hosted by U.S. Senate Democrats.  
Republican Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin tried to overturn Riggs’ narrow win by challenging more than 60,000 votes in protests before the state Board of Elections and in lawsuits. 
He wanted to throw out votes cast by military and overseas voters, people he called “never residents,” and those he claimed did not provide identification numbers when they registered. 
A federal judge in May ruled Griffin’s attempt to throw out votes unconstitutional and represented an effort to change voting rules after the election. 
Riggs will talk Wednesday about the attempt to disenfranchise military voters, her experience as a judicial officer and as a former voting rights attorney, and protecting the right to vote, according to a news release. 
The forum will focus on voter suppression tactics nationwide and is the second in a series hosted by U.S. Senate Rules Committee Democrats on protecting the future of America’s elections, according to the release,
Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Loyola Marymount University Law School Professor Justin Levitt, and Janessa Goldbeck, CEO of the Vet Voice Foundation. 
U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), will host. 
Riggs’ appearance will be the second time in two weeks that a recounting of Griffin’s attempt to overturn election results will reach Congress.
Last week, a Raleigh voter testified at a House committee hearing about ending up on Griffin’s list of challenged voters even though she provided the required information when she registered.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-14-at-10.25.48-AM-1024x583.png,,,2025-07-28 10:56:20.335256

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients. The state’s legislature also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers. Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before.
And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.

One of the most disturbing hallmarks of the Trump administration has been its relentless effort to defund public education – an effort that hit a new low earlier this month when Trump’s Department of Education announced suddenly and without warning that it would be freezing billions of dollars in essential funds – funds that Congress already appropriated and for which school districts had already budgeted.
Recently, in order to learn even more about this troubling action, Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with a national expert on education funding, the Project Director of the Education Funding Equity Initiative at the national nonprofit, New America, Zahava Stadler. And while federal officials have since backed down on the funding freeze much uncertainty remains, and as Stadler told Newsline, the damage that could be done to our schools is enormous.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Last year, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in a 4-1 decision that Eric Hafner, an imprisoned felon in New York state, could remain on Alaska’s U.S. House ballot despite a lawsuit challenging his eligibility.
On Friday, the court issued a 22-page opinion explaining that its decision came down to the definition of the word “fifth.”
When Alaskans approved 2020’s Ballot Measure 2, they installed an open primary election and a ranked choice general election. The top four vote-getters in the primary election, regardless of party, advance to the general election.
If one of those top four candidates withdraws after the primary, a section of that ballot measure says that the Alaska Division of Elections should replace the withdrawn candidate “with the candidate who received the fifth most votes in the primary election.”
But in 2024, two Republican candidates withdrew after the primary, seeking to consolidate support behind fellow Republican Nick Begich III, the eventual winner.
That meant the sixth-place candidate, Democrat Eric Hafner, was promoted to the top-four general election. 
Hafner had never lived in Alaska at the time of his candidacy and, if elected, would have been ineligible to serve in office because he was not a resident of the state at the time of his election, something required by the U.S. Constitution.
Alaska Democrats, fearing a split vote between then-incumbent Rep. Mary Peltola and Hafner, sued, arguing that the ballot measure allowed the Division of Elections to promote the fifth finisher to the top four, but not anything beyond that. 
The Division of Elections and the Alaska Republican Party disputed that interpretation. An Anchorage Superior Court judge and the Supreme Court sided with the division, preserving Hafner’s candidacy.
In the end, it didn’t matter — Peltola lost to Begich by a margin that was wider than the number of votes Hafner received. Even if every Hafner voter had gone with Peltola, she still would have lost.
Writing after that result, four of the Supreme Court’s justices concluded that the plain language of the Ballot Measure 2 law “is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation” and is “ambiguous” about what happens if more than one winning candidate withdraws after the primary.
Given that, the justices relied on logic, prior case law and their view of voters’ intent when Alaskans approved Ballot Measure 2 in 2020.
Historically, the justices noted, they have issued orders that favor candidates’ access to the ballot.
Additionally, the language and context of Ballot Measure 2 support the idea that voters wanted to have four options in the general election.
“The language and purpose of Ballot Measure 2 favor the division’s interpretation: Allowing successive replacements aligns with the ballot measure’s goal of furnishing greater candidate choices for voters,” wrote Justice Jude Pate, an appointee of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, for the majority.
Under the Alaska Democratic Party’s interpretation of the law, the justices wrote, there could be a situation where three candidates withdraw after the primary election, leaving the remaining candidate unopposed in the general election, even if there were more candidates in the primary.
“We doubt that voters and the drafters would have intended such results,” Pate wrote of that hypothetical.
Writing in dissent was Justice Susan Carney, who said that the other four justices were wrong and that the plain language of the law is clear.
“It is hard for me to imagine plainer language than this statute uses to describe the candidate who will fill a vacancy on the general election ballot,” she wrote.
Carney wrote that “Ballot Measure 2 greatly increased Alaskans’ choices for representation” but that the plain meaning of “fifth” is clear and unambiguous.
Because of that fact, “the lengths to which the court has reached to conclude otherwise are unnecessary and unreasonable.”

One of California’s largest health care providers said it will stop providing gender-affirming surgeries for patients under 19 beginning Aug. 29 — a move that was criticized by members of the LGBTQ community and praised by parental rights groups.
Kaiser Permanente serves 12 million patients in eight states, including more than 9 million in California. In a statement, the health care giant cited actions by President Donald Trump’s administration to restrict gender-affirming care, including issuing subpoenas to doctors and clinics that provide care to transgender youth.

Kaiser: “After significant deliberation and consultation with internal and external experts including our physicians, we’ve made the difficult decision to pause surgical treatment for patients. … All other gender-affirming care treatment remains available.”

Kaiser’s move follows decisions by two other California hospitals to limit transgender health services: Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, which closed its health clinic for transgender youth last week; and Stanford Medicine, which paused services earlier this month.
Some members of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus expressed disappointment in Kaiser’s policy while slamming the federal administration.

Assemblymember Christopher Ward, a San Diego Democrat and chairperson of the caucus, in an email to CalMatters: “While we recognize the impossible position Trump’s threats have put Kaiser in, it’s devastating that yet another barrier now stands between families and the care they know their children need. … It’s simply cruel.”

Jonathan Zachreson, a Roseville school board member who led an unsuccessful campaign last year to require California schools to notify parents if their children identified as transgender, told CalMatters that Kaiser’s decision was “a win for California and the nation.”

Zachreson: “This is protecting kids from mutilation. … It’s been very positive and we’re grateful for the federal actions that have taken place.”

Trump withholds AmeriCorps funding

From CalMatters higher education and workforce reporter Adam Echelman:
AmeriCorps’ public service programs face yet another obstacle in California. Last week the state amended one of its lawsuits against the federal government, saying AmeriCorps is withholding millions of dollars in congressionally-appropriated funds for new projects that were scheduled to start this summer. 
It’s the latest development in a months-long saga. In April the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, pushed the federal volunteer service agency to slash programs, effectively laying off more than 5,600 California public service workers and leaving the schools that depend on AmeriCorps in a lurch. 
A few months later, a judge ordered AmeriCorps to temporarily reinstate California’s programs until the lawsuit is concluded. Despite the court order, only about half of those workers have actually returned to finish their jobs, CalMatters reported.
Now, many of the new AmeriCorps programs, which typically start in July or August, are unable to access their next round of funding. 

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, in a statement: “Last month, I secured a court order stopping the illegal dismantling of AmeriCorps. … But now, President Trump is trying a different, yet similarly, illegal tactic to withhold funding.”

The federal government has yet to respond to the amended lawsuit.



Janitorial services company settles

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
CleanNet USA sold janitorial franchises to Californians using unfair and deceptive practices, then misclassified janitors and denied them employment rights such as minimum wage and reimbursement for supplies, the state alleged last week after an investigation by the attorney general’s office. 
The national company and its four California operators in the Bay Area, Sacramento, Southern California and San Diego must pay $1.7 million in restitution to more than 200 workers and $150,000 in civil penalties under a settlement with the state. 
The company must change its franchising business model and will be prohibited from selling franchises to sole proprietors or entities with fewer than two employees. It will also be monitored by the state Justice Department for at least three years to prove it’s complying with the settlement, which is pending court approval. 
The settlement says CleanNet denies all allegations. Robert Erickson, national director for the company, said in an email that CleanNet was “pleased” that its talks with the state led to an agreement.

AS MASSACHUSETTS BRACES for September, and the rush of apartment turnover that comes with the start of the university term, renters and landlords alike will be navigating a new law that changes the way the state handles broker’s fees. Starting on August 1, renters cannot be forced to directly pay the fee for brokers working for landlords, though there is still the possibility that the cost gets passed on to the tenant through raised rents or so-called “junk fees.” 
Licensed brokers act as middlemen between landlords and tenants, handling tasks for the landlord that could include showing the apartment or performing a background check or credit check on the would-be tenant.  
But groups like Greater Boston Legal Services and other advocates for low-income Bay Staters have long argued that the practice of having tenants pay these fees, even when the broker works for the landlord, is creating an additional hurdle for renters in an already squeezed market. 
“It is completely an imbalanced market, where the tenants have no bargaining power,” said Todd Kaplan, senior attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services, on an episode of The Codcast. “That is it in a nutshell.” 
Tenants paying broker’s fees for the landlord has never been required by law, Kaplan told CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith. But it’s become common practice to demand that renters shell out first and last month’s rent, plus a security deposit, and broker’s fees that often amount to one month’s rent. This can mean that renters would have to be able to hand over as much as $12,000 to secure an average one-bedroom apartment in Boston. 
The new law isn’t as simple as an outright “ban” on the fees, Kaplan noted, though lawmakers have used the word as shorthand for the changes. 
“I think in the vast majority of cases, if a broker continues to be involved, they will be paid for by the landlord,” he said. “But this law does not prohibit a tenant from engaging a broker. And it’s just a few people – the biotech person coming from out of town, the Harvard professor who’s going to be here for a semester. They can always go and hire a broker, and they should, because they have very particular needs. The rest of us need to find housing, and if the broker is working for landlord, really the landlord should pay.” 
In the episode, Kaplan discusses how costs can still be passed on to renters through other fees (6:45), why eliminating broker’s fees was a GBLS priority (13:00), and how the one-size-fits-all law could impact different types of landlords (18:40).

The next superintendent will need to respond to President Donald Trump’s funding cuts and policy shifts, including the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education and increased immigration enforcement.




As California intensifies its fight with the Trump Administration, the race for the state’s top schools job is becoming ever more crowded.
Today, former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon formally entered the race to succeed Tony Thurmond as State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He joins a host of other state lawmakers and local school board members vying to replace Thurmond, who terms out in 2026 after eight years on the job.
The next state superintendent faces daunting challenges. The most urgent priority may be responding to President Donald Trump’s funding cuts and policy shifts, including the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education and increased immigration enforcement. Those policies will have a deep impact on thousands of California’s 5.8 million K-12 students, at least 20% of whom have at least one parent who lacks legal status, according to the Children’s Partnership, a policy and advocacy nonprofit.
“There’s no question the Trump administration is going to continue to weaponize K-12 education,” said Morgan Polikoff, an education professor at the University of Southern California. “The state superintendent can serve as a buffer, helping districts navigate funding cuts and policy changes while continuing to push against the Trump administration. It’s important that California keeps fighting.”
From the classroom to the Legislature
Rendon, a Democrat from Lakewood, spent 12 years in the Legislature, the last eight as speaker. While he was speaker, the state nearly doubled its K-12 funding and introduced a new grade, transitional kindergarten – a particular priority for Rendon, who started his career as an early education administrator.
A former UC regent, Rendon said he’d try to protect California schools from Trump’s policies, particularly those related to immigration, but also work at the state level to advocate for more funding and accountability.
“California has the best public universities in the world,” Rendon said. “We need to have the best K-12 schools in the world, too.”
Vague job duties
California has a murky hierarchy when it comes to schools. The governor, Legislature, State Board of Education and superintendent all share duties, but the superintendent has the least amount of power. The superintendent oversees the California Department of Education, but California also has a system of local control, which means local school boards have plenty of latitude over day-to-day operations. Superintendents often find themselves balancing the needs of at least a dozen stakeholders, with not much power themselves.
In 2023, a bill by former Assemblymember Kevin McCarty would have banned state superintendent elections altogether, turning the position into a governor-appointed role, like it is in 41 other states.  
Still, despite very limited authority, state superintendent can be an important job, said Julie Marsh, a professor at USC and executive faculty director for Policy Analysis for California Education, a research center. Despite the obstacles, the state superintendent oversees the largest, most complex school system in the U.S. and has a wide platform to “do something good.”
“They can’t create policy, but they can help set the agenda. They can use their bully pulpit to defend the policies and values that Californians overwhelmingly support,” Marsh said.
Muratsuchi jumps in
Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, chair of the Assembly education committee, is also running for superintendent. An adjunct professor at El Camino Community College and former school board president at Torrance Unified, Muratsuchi has a long history of advocating for schools.
He’s authored numerous school bills, including AB 49, which would make it harder for immigration agents to enter schools, and AB 477, which would increase state education funding and raise salaries for teachers and other school staff. He was also the lead author of Proposition 2, a $10 billion school facilities bond that passed last year.
As state superintendent, Muratsushi said he’d continue to push for more funding while standing up to the Trump administration.
“As California’s top elected education leader, the state superintendent should have a strong record of fighting Trump’s attacks on public education and our most vulnerable students,” said Muratsuchi, a Democrat from Torrance. “I believe I’m that person.”
Newman enters race
Muratuchi’s former counterpart in the state Senate is also running for superintendent. Josh Newman, a Democrat from Fullerton who served as chair of the Senate education committee from 2023-24, said that in addition to fighting Trump he’d focus on students’ physical and mental health, boosting civics education and revitalizing the Department of Education.
 Accountability and compliance should be a priority, he said.
“We’ve increased funding substantially in California for 20 years, yet we haven’t seen a corresponding increase in test scores or a narrowing of the achievement gap,” Newman said.
“That points to a systemic issue where the superintendent and Department of Education must play a bigger role.”
Shaw looks beyond Chino
Sonja Shaw, president of the Chino Valley school board, made national headlines for her attempts to require school staff to notify parents if a student identifies as transgender. Thurmond actually attended a Chino Valley board meeting to oppose the measure, and she had police escort him out.
Now, Shaw is running for Thurmond’s job, saying she wants to take her fight statewide.
“Parents want schools to focus on reading, writing and math, not social justice and LGBTQ ideology,” said Shaw, a Republican. “I feel like we can take this fight beyond Chino.”
Several other candidates have also filed initial paperwork with the Secretary of State, including two members of the Los Angeles Community College District: Nichelle Henderson and Andra Hoffman.

Diego Rendon
Diego Rendon is a student at California State University, San Bernardino, where he is student body president.



The Coachella Valley and Inland Empire region are home to one of the largest Latino populations in California, yet for many high schoolers here, college still feels like a foreign country that they don’t know how to navigate.
I’m a first-generation college student who grew up in Desert Hot Springs. In high school, I didn’t talk to my parents about SAT scores, internships, or what the next step of my life would look like during college or after. I still remember at the age of 17, feeling completely overwhelmed with college financial aid applications and applying to college during my senior year, while balancing a part-time job to help save money for college. 
I didn’t have a roadmap to follow, but I knew I wanted more for my future. That’s why I decided to stay local and attend CalState San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus, the Coachella Valley’s only four-year public university. That decision changed everything. 
I knew I wanted to help others who came from backgrounds like mine, hardworking and full of potential, but in need of guidance and mentorship. Overall, college has pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me how to uplift others while continuing to grow myself. 
Through it all, my family has always been my biggest motivator. Both my parents are from Sinaloa, Mexico, and my grandpa had farming roots in the Imperial Valley dating back to the 1960s. 
My dad grew up in a small town called Holtville, CA, and today works in pool construction. My mom was a stay-at-home mom and caregiver. They’ve instilled in me the value of education and taught me to chase after what I want. Growing up, my mom would always say, “La única herencia que te vamos a dar es la educación,” which translates to, “The only inheritance we’re going to give you is an education.” 
That stuck with me and still drives me today. 
After transitioning to the San Bernardino campus, I found a second home. I’ve grown more than I ever imagined. 
As student body president, I represent my peers at CSUSB and am their voice in various committees and decision-making spaces. For example, earlier this year, other students and I traveled to Sacramento to advocate on behalf of the entire California State University system. 
We shared with legislators stories about our journeys, our challenges, and how much we value our education. We reminded them that we are a true investment in the future of California and, with the right support, we’ll keep building a state we continue to call home.
That trip to Sacramento was just one part of the bigger picture. The rest is happening right here at CSUSB, where students continue to face real challenges, such as financial hardships, long commutes, demanding work hours, and food insecurity, all while giving it their absolute best. 
They’re not just trying to earn a degree; they’re trying to leave CSUSB as stronger versions of themselves and be ready to enter the workforce and build meaningful careers. These students are the true backbone of our region, but too often, they go unseen. 
I see myself in them. There was once a time in my college journey when I was juggling three different jobs, working in student government, at In-N-Out, and serving as an orientation leader. It wasn’t easy, but those experiences taught me resilience, time management, and a sense of gratitude. 
Across the Coachella Valley and Inland Empire, there are thousands of students with similar stories, students who are not just the future of California, but the ones currently shaping it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/042224-Inland-Empire-JAH-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

The U.S. Department of Education says adult students without legal status are now banned from certain courses. Teens at public K-12 districts could see changes too. 


As President Donald Trump ramps up immigration enforcement, targeting immigrants at workplaces and street corners across California, his administration is turning its attention to adult students. 
In a memo earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Education said adult students without legal status must be banned from federally funded career technical education classes, English-language programs and high school equivalency courses. Adult schools offer these courses to anyone over 18 years old, including immigrants, and many school leaders say the new policy could lead to enrollment declines. California’s K-12 districts may also need to adapt since they use federal funding to offer numerous career technical education classes that teach skills such as welding and farming.  
The new policy poses administrative challenges for these schools, which don’t require students to prove their legal status. Many students, including U.S. citizens, lack the proper verification documents.  
“It’s going to perpetuate this atmosphere of fear,” said Randy Tillery, the director of economic development for the nonprofit WestEd, which helps collect data on behalf of the state. 
Last week, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state is suing over the new policy. 
The U.S. Education Department refused to comment on the new policy. In a press release, the department said it will enforce it starting Aug. 9.  
Adult schools ask students to voluntarily share their Social Security numbers, which are only available for those with a legal right to work in the U.S. Of the more than 500,000 adult learners taking classes in California, about 10% voluntarily share their numbers with their schools, Tillery said.
Schools across the state say that they are waiting for more guidance from state and federal agencies before barring students from any classes. 
‘What if you don’t return?’
V., a student at Huntington Beach Adult School, has been taking a beginner-level English-language class for the past two years, in-person, Monday through Thursday, for two and a half hours a day. V. agreed to be interviewed on the condition that CalMatters not identify her because she doesn’t have legal status and fears deportation. 
Her three children, who are U.S. citizens, couldn’t stand the idea of their mom going to school this summer as the threat of immigration raids loomed. “When I grabbed my backpack to go to school, my kids said, ‘Don’t go, mom. What if you don’t return?’” she told CalMatters in Spanish, her voice shaky, on the verge of tears. 
Last month, she sent a note to her teacher, saying that, because of “uncontrollable anxiety” she needed to take the class online. “I was, I am and I continue to be terrified to leave (my house),” she said later.
Normally her class has about 40 students, but this summer, it’s down to 24, according to her teacher. The class is livestreamed, and an increasing number of students are opting to take the course online, the teacher said. CalMatters is withholding the teacher’s name to ensure V.’s anonymity.
It was harder to focus while taking online classes, V. said — her kids often interrupted the livestream or something on the computer distracted her. After about two weeks of online school, V. returned to class in person, despite her kids’ fears.
Steve Curiel, the principal, said the school is allowing students without legal status to attend, at least for now, until the education department provides more guidance about its new policy.
For a month now, adult schools have been managing uncertainty over federal policy and funding. Federal funding for adult schools typically comes through on a yearly basis, with the fiscal year beginning July 1, and it provides as much as 30% of a school’s budget. The education department withheld the money for a month, leading California Attorney General Rob Bonta to sue Education Secretary Linda McMahon. On Friday, the department said it would begin releasing the money this week, but the lawsuit is still ongoing, according to Elissa Perez, a spokesperson for Bonta’s office.
“We’re feeling optimistic but we’re still holding our breath a little bit because we want to see the actual release of the funds,” said Curiel. He was about to begin making cuts on Friday to contracts at Huntington Adult School but said he will now hold off.
“It’s going to perpetuate this atmosphere of fear.” Randy Tillery, director of economic development at WestEd
Many states rely entirely on the federal government to fund English-language learning and high school equivalency programs for adults, whereas California has a financial cushion: The state provides over $650 million each year specifically for adult education, representing the bulk of funding for California’s adult schools. 
Turning teens away from classes
The education department’s new policy on adults without legal status could also affect high school students. Although much of the federal funding in question supports adults taking English classes and high school equivalency courses, career technical education is part of a separate pot of money, known as Perkins funds, and includes hundreds of high schools across the state. The education department memo says that funding for those programs should be restricted to students who are legal residents or citizens. 
An estimated 150,000 children between the ages of 3 and 17 live in California but lack legal status, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The vast majority are enrolled in school.
The U.S. Supreme Court case Plyer v. Doe requires K-12 school districts to provide all students, regardless of their legal status, with “a basic public education,” but in the memo, the U.S. education department said that career technical classes are no longer considered part of a “basic” education. The memo also says that children without legal status are now prohibited from taking college-level courses in high school.
To implement the education department’s new policy, public K-12 schools would need to tell certain students that they can’t take specific classes because of their legal status. It would create “an enormous problem for schools,” said Tillery, since schools don’t ask students about their legal status. Public schools would need to gather data about who is a legal resident and who isn’t, he said, which could deter some students from attending school at all.
The U.S. Education Department did not respond to CalMatters’ questions asking how schools should respond or what enforcement might look like. The Los Angeles Unified School District said it was “awaiting further guidance” from the state’s education department, which also declined to comment. 
For V., the English classes are about her family more than anything, she said repeatedly. Her daughter is about to be 11 years old and prefers to speak English over Spanish, though she has a speech impediment and struggles to communicate in either language. V. said she wants to be able to speak more English with her daughter, hoping it might help, despite the risks of going to class. 
“We’re not living our own lives,” said V. “We’re living for our children.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/10062023_San-Diego-Community-College-Older-Students_AH_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

Gavin Newsom was just given his first handgun. A pending California bill would ban selling new Glocks like the ones Kamala Harris owns. Will he sign it?,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom was just given his first handgun. A pending California bill would ban selling new Glocks like the ones Kamala Harris owns. Will he sign it? 


The Democrats who control California’s Legislature are poised to ban the sale of one of the most popular types of handguns, like the one owned by arguably the state’s most recognizable Democrat, Kamala Harris.
Assembly Bill 1127 aims to prohibit gun shops from selling new Glock-brand handguns and various off-brand imitators, because the guns can become fully automatic if a criminal inserts a converter, commonly known as a “Glock switch,” into the weapon. The switches can be made illegally on a 3D printer.
Supporters say the bill targets only a narrow category of guns that are increasingly used in violent crimes. But critics argue the proposal opens the door to broader restrictions on all semi-automatic handguns. That, they say, potentially includes other popular models like the one Gov. Gavin Newsom recently got as a gift from a conservative podcaster. Newsom hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign the measure.
Semi-automatic handguns require a shooter to pull the trigger to fire each round. Fully automatic weapons, sometimes called machine guns, will keep firing as long as the trigger is depressed. Automatic weapons are already illegal under state and federal laws for everyone except special permit holders.
Illegally modified, fully-automatic Glock-style handguns have been used in several high-profile shootings, including a 2022 gang gunfight outside a Sacramento nightclub a few blocks from the Capitol. The shooting killed six people and wounded another 12.  
But Glocks also are among the most popular handguns sold in California. Gun rights advocates say there are already more than 1 million in circulation in California – and only a tiny fraction of them have been illegally modified. As an example of how popular Glocks are, Harris, while she was running for president, told “60 Minutes” last year that she owned a Glock and that she had shot it. A Harris spokesperson didn’t respond to interview requests or to a question about whether she still owns the gun.
The pending proposal would not prohibit Harris or others who already own Glocks from keeping theirs. They could also sell used ones to others in private-party transactions. Californians just couldn’t buy a new one. It’s unclear how many Glocks are sold in California each year since regulators and gun manufacturers don’t publicly report statewide sales numbers. 
Police widely carry Glocks in California, but they would be exempt from the restrictions.
What about Gavin Newsom’s new gun?
The measure’s lead author, Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat representing the Encino area, told the Senate Judiciary Committee this month that if gun manufacturers don’t like the ban, they can redesign their weapons to make them less easy to convert to machine guns.
“Most handgun designs don’t have this issue, and this legislation is narrowly focused on a limited number of designs that are exceptionally easy to modify,” he said. “Sadly, certain actors in the gun industry have known about this issue for decades and have refused to do anything meaningful to address it.”

Gun rights advocates say Glock has already redesigned new models to be incompatible with the switches, but the California Department of Justice hasn’t included those weapons on its list of handguns that can be purchased in the state. 
More than two dozen states, including California, have already banned Glock switches, but California would be the first state to ban the gun. A similar bill introduced in New York has stalled in the state’s Senate.
The California bill, which has 12 Democratic co-authors and co-sponsors, has already passed the Assembly with only Republicans voting against it. It’s poised to do the same in the Senate, putting it on a path next month to go to the desk of the state’s newest high-profile handgun owner, Newsom.
This month, conservative podcaster Shawn Ryan gave Newsom a Sig Sauer P365-Xmacro handgun while the two recorded an hourslong podcast in Tennessee. 
The handgun wouldn’t fall under the provisions of AB 1127. The weapon’s mechanisms are designed differently than a Glock’s and switches made for Glocks don’t work.But Sam Paredes, the executive director of Gun Owners of California, which opposes the bill, said it’s possible someone could design an illegal converter for Newsom’s gun some day. Plus, many semi-automatic handguns can be converted to fully automatic with the right tools and know-how, if someone wants to risk a felony charge.
He said it will be up to the office of Attorney General Rob Bonta to decide what handguns to ban for sale in California, should Newsom sign Gabriel’s bill into law. Bonta supports the proposal. Bonta’s office didn’t return a message, but in a letter in support of the bill he wrote that “California has one of the lowest rates of firearms deaths in the nation and that is due to our strong common sense gun safety laws.”“These laws are effective and save lives,” Bonta wrote. “Prohibiting this dangerous design flaw is an integral step in keeping automatic weapons off our streets.”
Gun advocates don’t like Newsom 
Asked if he will sign the ban on new Glocks, Newsom’s press office said that his office doesn’t usually comment on pending legislation. 
“The governor left the firearm in Tennessee in Shawn’s possession,” said Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon. “He is working to ensure it is properly transferred in accordance with California law and will take possession once that process is complete.”
It would be the first firearm registered under Newsom’s name, according to The San Francisco Standard. 
If Newsom wants to legally keep the Sig Sauer, he’d have to ship it from a Tennessee gun dealer to a registered firearms dealer in California.

Once the gun arrives, Newsom would have to pass a background check, provide his fingerprints, take a handgun safety test, sign affidavits, provide a driver’s license and documents that contain his name and address, such as a current utility bill. He’d need to undergo a 10-day waiting period. Paredes said Newsom would also have to pay around $300 in fees and taxes on the $700 gun.
He’d have to do everything himself, as gun owners need to appear in person to do the paperwork. 
Paredes said he doesn’t expect Newsom to get a warm welcome if he goes to any California gun shop to make the transfer. Newsom is one of the nation’s most ardent advocates of firearms ownership restrictions, and he’s backed some of the laws that make acquiring his gun – and any ammunition he’d want to shoot – so challenging and costly. 
“I’ll bet you there’ll be 10,000 people (protesting) at that gun store the day he comes in to do that,” Paredes said.
When Ryan gave Newsom the Sig Sauer, Newsom told the podcaster that though he continues to support gun regulations that he said have made the state safer, he’s “not anti-gun at all.”
“The last thing people would expect is that I respect this gift,” he said, according to The San Francisco Standard. 
At least one gun shop employee isn’t buying it. 
Cassidy Maznio, assistant manager at Sacramento Black Rifle, a firearms dealer, said Newsom is welcome to come to the shop to process his gun transaction.
“Obviously, we’d talk trash to him the whole time,” Maznio said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/041421-Handgun-Gun-Store-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

What happens when you take high interest rates, unpredictable tariffs, a shortage of homes, a 50-year-old property tax law and mix them together? A housing market stuck in molasses.


The national housing market is stuck in a post-pandemic rut.
Prices and interest rates have stalled out at unaffordable highs, keeping buyers at bay. Sellers, unable to fetch the still-higher prices they want, are backing out of the market in droves. The result is a housing market stuck in molasses, with a slow down in new listings, stagnant sales and an uptick in deals cancelled at the last minute.
If the county as a whole is in the middle of a housing market drought, conditions look especially parched in California. 
New homes listed for sale fell by more than 17% in San Francisco, compared to the same time last year, according to online real estate broker Redfin. There were double-digit year-over-year declines in listings in San Diego, Riverside, Anaheim too. Of the 10 metros where new listings fell fastest, five were in California. 
“The number of transactions have absolutely slowed down,” said Amy Kong, a real estate agent who works in and around San Francisco. “As everyone knows, it’s because of the higher interest rates and the affordability, which is just really, really low.”
Part of the market slow down can be blamed on a nationwide financial pathology that dates back half a decade, said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist. As mortgage borrowing costs have whipsawed from ultra-low to harrowingly high over the last five years, the gap between what most current homeowners pay for their mortgage and what they would pay if they were to borrow and buy again has reached historic highs. That makes this an inauspicious time for most homeowners to sell.
But as with so many of the nation’s housing woes, things are even worse in California thanks to the specific “dysfunctions” of our market and the particularities of our property tax system that date back to the 1970s, said Fairweather. 
Taken all together, California homeowners “have extra reasons to stay put,” she said. 
That means fewer opportunities for aspiring homeowners, more pressure on the rental market as discouraged would-be buyers find themselves shunted there and prices that are likely to remain persistently high, despite high interest rates meant to cool things off.
California’s housing market has been in a kind of holding pattern for years, said Oscar Wei, economist with the California Association of Realtors. “I thought by now we would see sales coming back up a little bit more,” he said. 
Unanswered questions about the future of the economy, tariffs and what they might mean for inflation, the stock market and how all of the above will influence interest rates are likely holding both buyers and sellers back, he explained. 
And then there’s the persistent borrowing cost gap, which economists dub the “lock-in effect.”
In an effort to jump-start an economy that had ground to a halt during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve brought borrowing rates down to near-zero. Homebuyers tapped those low rates to buy homes. Existing homeowners scrambled to refinance to lower their costs. 
Two and half years later and facing the new crisis of rapidly rising prices, the Fed jacked borrowing costs back up. For homeowners who took out fixed-rate mortgages (most do) when borrowing costs were low, the sudden rate bounce made selling a home with plans to buy a new one — and in the process losing the coveted low rate in exchange for a high one — a losing financial proposition. 
An analysis by economists at the Federal Housing Finance Agency found that the majority of borrowers in mid-2024 had a rate below 4%. A typical new mortgage, on the other hand, is likely to come with a rate of more than 6.5%.
That difference comes with a steep financial price tag. If the average mortgage payer were to swap out their existing loan for one at the new rate, they would pay another $398 per month, the agency researchers estimated. 
The effect is even more pronounced in California, where property values are particularly high. The median sales price on a single family home across the state is just shy of $900,000, according to the state association of Realtors. 
Even small changes in interest rates on such a massive purchase add up.
A typical California borrower would pay an extra $675 every month if they were to take on the same mortgage at current rates, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency report. In San Francisco, it’s an extra $915. That’s a compelling reason not to sell. 
California homeowners have even more reasons to hunker down.
Since 1979, when the prior year’s Proposition 13 went into effect, property taxes in California have been tied to the purchase price of a home and only allowed to increase at a modest rate. With real estate prices across the state trending upward ever since, that’s created yet another kind of “lock-in effect:” The longer that a person owns a home, the less they pay in property taxes compared to a new buyer. 
“When people are doing the math about how much money it would cost them to move and they look at the mortgage expense, and then on top of that, the property tax expense, it’s not worth it,” said Fairweather. 
Absent an influx of new listings, aspiring homeowners looking for the opportunity to buy will need to wait on new construction to deliver. But new supply has essentially flatlined over the last decade, despite a bevy of state legislation aimed at boosting more development. Fairweather said she isn’t optimistic that that’s likely to change soon — and the lock-in effect on property owners is one reason why. 
“I’m skeptical that owners of single-family homes are going to give up the land to actually build enough housing to make a difference,” she said. “It’s good that all those laws change, but I feel like they might be muted in their impact because of all the other forces that are pointing towards single-family neighborhoods staying exactly the same.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/0601322_Drought_LV_CM_002.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-28 17:56:57.546004

According to a statement from the Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office, dispatch began receiving calls at 4:43 p.m., Saturday, saying there was a man with a knife inside the Garfield Township Walmart stabbing people. 
Grand Traverse County Sheriff deputies arrived at 4:46 p.m. on Saturday and saw multiple citizens, including one armed with a pistol, confronting the suspect, and preventing him from leaving and harming other patrons.
Shea later identified the man as Bradford James Gille, a 42 year old from Afton, who was arrested and transported to the Grand Traverse County Jail where he would remain pending formal charges and an arraignment. 
The requested charges against Gille are one count of terrorism, and 11 counts of assault with intent to murder.
Grand Traverse County Prosecutor Noelle Moeggenberg said her office expects to authorize charges Monday, and that Gille will be arraigned either or Tuesday. 
The 11 individuals wounded in the stabbing were transported to Munson Medical Center for treatment. As of 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, Munson Healthcare said two patients remained in serious condition, eight patients were listed in fair condition and one patient had been treated and released, with all 11 individuals expected to survive their injuries.
Free mental health counseling for all individuals impacted will be available at Northwestern Michigan College Innovation Center Monday through Wednesday from 10 a.m. through 7 p.m. this week, with Moeggenberg noting those services may be extended depending on their use.
Twenty-four hour counseling is also available at the Grand Traverse Mental Health Crisis and Access Center at 410 Brook St. in Traverse City. Crisis services are also available by calling 1-833-295-0616.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel applauded the efforts of law enforcement, medical service providers and the individuals who intervened, in a statement released Sunday offering her thoughts and prayers to the victims, as well as the Grand Traverse Community. 
“Grand Traverse Prosecutor Noelle Moeggenberg is a dedicated, career criminal prosecutor, and I maintain full faith in her and her office in the handling of this matter,” Nessel said. “My department has been in touch and has offered our assistance wherever it may be valuable.”

(Photo by Stephen Ausmus/Agricultural Research Service, USDA)If it rains at your house, do the cereal boxes in your pantry get wet? Of course not – because they’re under cover, protected by roof and shingle.
And when it rains on a chicken farm, the chicken litter, or manure, on the farm stays dry, too. It is also kept dry under cover, whether that’s inside the well-protected chicken house or stored in a manure shed designed to Natural Resources Conservation Service standards.
Maryland chicken farms, in fact, must follow a “zero-discharge” permit which “does not authorize discharges of pollutants, including manure, litter, and process wastewater” in day-to-day operations. (Farmers don’t want their manure to go missing, anyway; as organic, slow-release plant food, chicken manure is too valuable in the crop production cycle to be treated as waste.)

These basic facts about how chicken farms have been built and operated for decades are well-known. But apparently, Food & Water Watch is oblivious to them.
The group’s July 21 commentary demanding new regulations and burdens be placed on Maryland farmers (insulting these family-owned operations as “insidious polluters”) asserts that farms “spew” chicken manure “directly into waterways.”
It’s frankly astonishing to see a claim so divorced from reality still being made in 2025, when the scientists who study our water quality have documented that nutrient contributions from agriculture to the Chesapeake Bay have declined by 45 million pounds since the 1980s.
That’s the result of conservation practices and technological advances chicken growers, crop farmers and others in agriculture have invested in: manure sheds, pollinator-friendly buffers, stormwater management systems, litter amendments, even tweaks to chicken feed.
It’s a shame Food & Water Watch is so determined to target Eastern Shore farmers, because they are the backbone of Maryland’s biggest industry – agriculture. Maybe that’s because they only see the Shore as a vacationland, its farms as nuisances glimpsed as they speed down Route 50, not as the cherished homes of its proud year-round residents.
Their op-ed trots out a tired, old “farmers versus tourism” trope, trying to imply that the Shore’s agricultural strength puts $19.4 billion a year in tourism spending at risk. Left unsaid: $4.7 billion of those tourism dollars are spent on food that draws tourists here, like seafood, craft beer – and chicken.
Don’t let anyone tell you farming and tourism can’t coexist. 100 years of chicken-growing history here say otherwise. Living on the Eastern Shore for 41 years, being a farmer’s daughter, and teaching my girls to fish on the Choptank River says otherwise.
And don’t let a group virulently opposed to a modern, conservation-minded chicken community – a group that believes it is “time to ban” our farms – deceive you about how farms today actually work.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chickens.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)A messaging war over President Donald Trump’s big tax and spending bill made its way to Las Vegas Friday – a metro area both sides of the political aisle described as the poster child for the measure’s impacts on working-class Americans.
House Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee gathered in Las Vegas to aggressively highlight tax cuts provided by the megabill, which has proven deeply unpopular in recent surveys. 
During the committee field hearing, Republicans focused on the bill’s more popular, if less consequential, aspects, namely a new tax deduction for seniors and provisions allowing workers to deduct their taxes on tips and overtime pay through 2028.
Democrats, including Ways and Means member and Nevada Rep. Steven Horsford, hammered the legislation’s cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, as well as a provision that increases taxes on professional gamblers. 
Trump first announced “no tax on tips” as a campaign promise in Las Vegas, making the city a prime location for Republicans to crow about its inclusion in the tax and spending bill as they head into a five-week summer recess. 
“This city leads the nation in the share of its workers who earn tips,” said Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, the Republican chairman of the committee. 
“But what will happen here in Vegas will not stay just in Vegas, because America’s 4 million tipped workers will also benefit from no tax on tips,” he continued.
Smith said the legislation’s tax breaks would help working-class Americans and generate economic growth. He also cast Democrats as opponents of cutting taxes after they unanimously opposed the legislation.
The largest tax cuts in the bill are by far the extension of tax cuts passed during Trump’s first term in 2017, which overwhelmingly benefit the higher income earners and corporations. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last week projected the measure’s tax cuts will add $3.4 trillion over a decade, mostly due to extending the 2017 tax cuts.
While Republicans hoped to use the Las Vegas hearing to kick off a victory lap for their legislation, Nevada Democrats used the hearing – held at an electric sign warehouse – to clobber the bill for hurting Nevada’s economy and Nevada households.
“Las Vegas is actually ground zero for the damage that Trump’s economy is doing to workers and families and small businesses,” Horsford said. 
One provision of the bill that has garnered bipartisan criticism limits how much professional and casual gamblers can deduct in losses, a tax increase that could hurt Nevada’s primary industry.
“Senate Republicans unilaterally thrust the gaming economy and its patrons into uncertainty with the unjust inclusion of the wagering loss penalty,” Horsford said.
Nevada Rep. Dina Titus joined Horsford at the hearing to push her Fair Accounting for Income Realized from Betting Earnings Taxation (FAIR BET) Act, a bill that would reverse the provision in the bill signed by Trump and restore the full gambling loss tax deduction.
Nevada’s hospitality industry is already facing challenges this year, as visitation numbers have fallen short of 2024 levels month after month.
“I hope that, since you care so much about Nevada families, y’all will spend some money while you’re here in some of our casinos. We would appreciate that,” Titus told committee members. 
Democratic Nevada state Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, speaking as an invited witness at the hearing, stressed the pain that will be inflicted on Nevadans by the legislation’s deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs to help finance extending the Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.
Cannizzaro questioned the tax benefits of the legislation, emphasizing that deductions for taxes on tips and overtime pay are temporary while tax cuts for high-income households and corporations are permanent. 
“This temporary benefit will only help Nevada’s tipped workers if we continue to have tourists to tip them. That’s no guarantee, especially amidst a year-over-year decline in visitation from both domestic and international tourists,” Cannizzaro said. 
The six other witnesses who spoke at the closed hearing were invited by Republicans and testified about the benefits of the legislation, including a server, a DoorDash driver, a paint foreman, and a small business owner from Henderson. 
Democrats held a press conference at the Culinary Workers Union headquarters ahead of the hearing as counter-programming where union members described the negative impacts of the bill.
Health care advocates noted the legislation will cut Medicaid by nearly $1 trillion over a decade, a move that could place a major burden on Nevada, which relies heavily on the low-income health program. 
Nevada became the first state led by a Republican governor to expand Medicaid in 2012, reducing the uninsured rate from 22% to 8%. 
Stricter Medicaid eligibility requirements under the Republican megabill could cut health coverage for nearly 100,000 Nevadans, according to analysis from Nevada Medicaid. 
Premiums through the Silver State Health Exchange – which covers another 100,000 Nevadans – are likely to increase by roughly 75% next year, Cannizzaro said, leading to more uninsured individuals and increased costs for state and local health systems.
Stricter eligibility requirements under the Supplemental Nutrition Program under the megabill will cost Nevada $20 million per year, while denying thousands of people access to food assistance, she added.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/field-hearing-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

Buildup of dead vegetation in Evens Creek, a wetland area bordered by homes, has created a wildfire hazard the Reno Fire Department hopes to mitigate by introducing 250 goats that will eat away dry brush for the next 45 days.
“They’re working all day long,” said Reno Fire Chief Dave Cochran.
The move comes as wildfire season approaches its peak this month. Wildfire season in Nevada typically lasts from late summer to early fall, but in recent years the season has lengthened due to climate change.
Last year, nearly 860 wildfires burned about 104,000 acres of land across Nevada, according to the Nevada Division of Forestry. 
In northwest Reno, where thousands of houses have been built in the urban wildland interface, the impact of the fires can be especially devastating. 
Northern Nevada experienced one of the most economically destructive wildfires in recent memory last year. About 20 miles south of Reno, the wind-driven Davis Fire rapidly burned through nearly 6,000 acres of land. The fire drove the evacuation of about 20,000 people and ultimately destroyed two commercial buildings and 14 homes.
With less precipitation than normal across much of Northern Nevada this spring, a prolonged heat wave, and fields of flammable grasses, the region is at greater risk of widespread wildfires this year.
“We are seeing a very high threat of wildfire, and it’s increasing every day that goes by,” Cochran said.
The goats, from High Desert Graziers in nearby Smith Valley, are bred to consume a wide variety of non-native grasses and weeds that fuel wildfires including bitterbrush, manzanita, and cheatgrass.
Those non-native grasses and weeds typically die off in the summer, unlike native species, creating dangerous fuel for wildfire. 
It’s the fourth time the city has used goats for fire mitigation. Like other years, the goats will be corralled to specific areas by a temporary solar-powered electric fence, and under the watch of guard dogs.
Cochran said the dogs are also there to protect the goats from being eaten by animal predators, or stolen by humans.
“People love goats, so that’s a concern as well,” he said. 
The goat grazing operation will cost the city about $67,500. It’s funded in part by state legislation passed in 2022 that allocates funding to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources for wildfire prevention, restoration, and long-term planning.
“Targeted grazing is an environmentally friendly and sustainable option for managing noxious weeds and flammable vegetation,” said Reno City Ward 2 Councilmember Naomi Duerr. “We’re proud to continue this creative approach.”
Wildfire managers say it takes a suite of approaches to prevent wildfires, including manual brush clearing, herbicides, and prescribed burns.
Goats have proven to be a cost-effective way to clear dry vegetation in difficult to reach terrain like steep bluffs and cliffs near homes. 
“It’s low tech, and it’s very cost-effective. They target exactly what we need,” Cochran said.
Studies looking at whether goats’ grazing can reduce the severity or impact of wildfires are scarce, but some research does suggest targeted grazing significantly reduces the grasses and weeds they goats were introduced to control. 
In Arizona, some scientists have observed that land cleared of excess vegetation by goats acts as fire breaks and can stop wildfires in their tracks.
Anecdotally, Cochran said goats have had positive, long-lasting effects on previous areas they grazed.
“Goats are a great tool to do that. They work from dawn till dusk. They actually eat non-native and invasive species of plants. They just take it down to the dirt,” Cochran said.
Despite the positive impact of goats, Cochran emphasized the need for federal action when it comes to wildfire response and mitigation. 
Ongoing cuts, funding freezes and hiring pauses brought on by President Donald Trump’s executive orders shrinking the federal workforce have weakened the nation’s already strained firefighting force by hitting support staff who play crucial roles in preventing and battling wildfires.
The Trump administration stated the U.S. Forest Service has reached 99% of its firefighting hiring goals, but documents obtained by ProPublica show a high vacancy rate, as well as internal concern among top officials responsible for wildfire response.
“There’s no department in the country that can handle these giant fires by themselves. You need local resources, state resources, but you also need a lot of federal resources, and if they’re not funded, that puts a dent in our ability to respond to these fires. We are keeping an eye on that. We’re very concerned,” Cochran said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250724_163319929_iOS-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
In Utah, the data shows ICE has made 1,579 arrests since Trump took office in January, compared to 493 arrests under Biden. Of this year’s arrests, 57% of immigrants who were detained carried violent convictions, while the percentage under Biden was 70%.
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.












The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi




Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

SELMA — Mason’s grandfather had recently taught him the family recipe for fried green tomatoes. And Mason wanted to show his classmates in the Better Basics program at Brantley Elementary School how to make them, using green tomatoes in the class’ garden.
“They did the batter, cut the tomatoes. We have safety kids’ knives, potato peelers, and they cut their tomatoes,” their teacher, Towanda Friday, said. “Mason showed them how to season it, and they season it all up. And so they watched us cook the tomatoes for them.”
Friday teaches fifth grade at Brantley Elementary in the Dallas County School system, and the Better Basics program in the summer. It was a grant program through a Birmingham organization that serves central Alabama to “advance children’s literacy” and also incorporates music.

Mason’s plans aligned with Friday’s, who along with reading and math teaches her students how to take care of a garden. She said in a recent school visit that they had tomatoes, squash, sunflowers, watermelon and red peppers. She teaches them how to make everyday lunches, and to stay away from the microwave.

“They’re not only going to do cooking and the garden. They’re bringing in instruments to play in a band,” she said. “They’re trying to help build Brantley up.”
Friday teaches in a system that is in the early stages of supervision by the state. Alabama State Superintendent Eric Mackey intervened in the system in March, his third intervention, saying that the system did not follow proper procurement processes in dealing with more than $12.1 million in federal funds. 
Alice Jackson, the system’s director of federal programs, said intervention is helping on the financial side. Part of why the system had so many federal dollars left, she said, was due to not having a streamlined system to process those funds.
“I’m very optimistic that with the transition of Mr. Sampson and the company of Dr. Boyd, that we’ll be able to get the system where it needs to be in a timely manner,” Jackson said of the system’s former superintendent, Anthony Sampson, and the state official in charge of the intervention, Daniel Boyd.

Why the state stepped in

Mackey intervened in Dallas County because of financial and board governance concerns, according to the show cause letter sent to the local board on Feb. 21. 
“This behavior erodes public trust in individual members and the Board as a whole. It also suggests that the Board is dysfunctional and ineffective in properly stewarding the funds awarded to the system for its students,” Mackey wrote in the letter. “Consequently, losing faith in the Board’s ability to govern could lead to a decline in engagement and support, making it more difficult for the DCSS to receive additional federal monies in the future.”
Mackey said in a June interview that the Dallas intervention is different from the Sumter County and Bessemer City interventions.

“It was not necessarily that the board couldn’t get together and get it done, but they just didn’t have it,” he said. “They literally don’t have the money and don’t have the capacity to handle the situation that was before them.”
One reason for that is a shrinking population base. Dallas County’s population shrunk 12% between 2010 and 2020. Public school enrollment has fallen even faster: Dallas County Schools had just over 3,300 students in the 2014-15 school year; it fell to 2,262 in the 2023-24 school year, a 32% decrease. Boyd said that the population decline is directly related to the intervention and the school closures.
“Our schools are a microcosm of the greater community,” Boyd said. “As our greater community gets smaller, the population of schools will decline.”
The district is already being reshaped by intervention. In an effort to get one month’s worth of expenses in reserve, two of the district’s 11 schools will close. Boyd, the state-appointed chief administrative officer for the Dallas and Bessemer interventions, said the system had 20% of a month’s expenses in reserve. He said in a phone interview Tuesday that a month’s expenses for the system is about $2.8 million.
“I feel that perhaps in 18 months or so, we’ll have that state minimum of one month reserve, maybe even before 18 months, which will be huge,” Boyd said. “It’s been years since the district had this one month reserve.”
The Dallas County Board of Education unanimously approved the closures of J.E. Terry Elementary School in Plantersville and Bruce K. Craig Elementary School in Selma on June 4. Like the district, Both schools had seen enrollment fall. J.E. Terry, which had 123 students in the 2014-15 school year, had 81 in the 2023-24 school year, according to the Alabama State Board of Education. Bruce K. Craig, which had 218 students enrolled in 2014-15, had 148 in 2023-24.
Boyd said the teachers at those schools were offered positions at other schools in the district and the students will consolidate to Valley Grande Elementary School, in Valley Grande. Both closed schools are about 12.5 miles from Valley Grande, in opposite directions.

“We don’t feel that it will make a lengthy trip for the students. Our transportation supervisor and transportation staff are working closely together to make sure that we’ve streamlined the routes as much as possible,” he said. 
Boyd did not rule out the possibility of further closures, but said he feels confident the two closures will help get the system’s finances back in line.
“Even though you have a plan in place, it’s not until school starts and you see how the routes run that you’re able to make additional modifications to improve efficiency,” Boyd said.

Academics

Academic achievement was not a reason for the state’s intervention, and former Dallas County Superintendent Anthony Sampson took pride in the kids’ achievements.
“I’m really proud that kids know where they stand academically on their own, not based on what somebody else is saying,” he said on June 30, his last day as superintendent. . 
 Sampson, who had served as superintendent since 2022, chose not to renew his contract in November so he could be closer to his family in Baldwin County.
“The last 100 days have been very busy, very fulfilling, and it just never ends. There’s always highs and there’s always lows,” Sampson said. 
Former DCS Superintendent Hattie Shelton has stepped in as an interim superintendent while Boyd searches for a permanent superintendent. She said in a phone interview Thursday that she will support the students and teachers to her best ability.
“I’m probably going to be praying very hard for things to turn around for us and turn around quickly,” Shelton said.

‘A lot of motivation’

Brantley Elementary Principal Adrienne Lee values transparency in academics, and making the usually stressful tests fun for her students.
“We do a lot of motivation here. We’re very unorthodox,” Lee said. “We’re doing a lot of music, we’re doing a lot of activities to push and motivate you.”
The school got a 56 on the 2022-2023 state report card, a result that surprised Lee. She started posting graphs depicting the school’s performance on recent state tests on Brantley Elementary’s colorful hallways.
“Instead of us taking that 56 and saying that’s who we are, we said, ‘That’s exactly who we started from,’” she said. “And we started to build ourselves.”
The school’s score increased to a 67 for the 2023-2024 report card.
“That motivation does a lot, and we motivate our kids a lot,” she said. “We’re playing music, we’re getting in the hallway, we’re dancing.”
Although recent test score data is not available at the school and district level, the fifth and sixth graders in Friday’s class knew how they did on the state test. Of the six students in her class on June 30, the average proficiency score was 2.6 out of 4 for math and 2.8 out of 4 for English Language Arts. Students are scored from level one to level four, where levels three and four are considered proficient. Statewide, 68% of fifth graders are proficient in ELA, and 40% of fifth graders are proficient in math.
“When I tell you they go hard, they work really hard, and they listen to everything that I taught them or told them to do. They implemented it no matter what, no matter how much homework I give them to do, they actually did it,” Friday said. “I’m really proud of them, because they put their best forward at all times.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ALR_Selma_063025-20-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2154932283.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)Our governor likes to say Alabama is “open for business.” Our leaders insist we are the most “pro-business” state in the nation.
This is, of course, situational. Private solar panel companies are effectively shut out of Alabama, thanks to a rooftop solar tax supported by Alabama Power and maintained by the Public Service Commission.
And the love of free markets and enterprise doesn’t extend to workers who take the initiative and try to get the best deal for their labor. That’s when celebrations of entrepreneurship turn into demands for obedience. (Nothing seems to enrage an Alabama politician more than the thought of an employee talking back.)

We also see this conditional support for business when we talk about the state’s workforce participation rate. Our leaders say they want to address it. But only up to a certain point.
Alabama has long struggled to get everyone who can work to do so. In June, about 58% of those who could work or look for a job in Alabama were in the workforce, compared with 62.5% of the country as a whole.
This lag goes back to 1976, if not earlier. Lack of access to affordable child care burdens workers. So do gaps in education and training. Transportation is another obstacle. The absence of mass transit in many parts of the state means those who can’t afford automobiles are stuck.
It’s a particular problem in rural areas, in part due to infrastructure challenges. In the most recent list of county workforce participation rates, only one of Alabama’s major urban areas (Mobile) fell below the state average.
But another significant factor is the aging of rural Alabama. The state as a whole is slightly older (median age 39.6 years) than the nation (39.2 years). But in Perry County, where the workforce participation rate was 35.4% in May, the median age is 42.5 years. In Tallapoosa County, where less than 49% of the population is in the workforce, it’s 45.4 years.
Getting younger people in the state will help boost workforce participation rates. And there’s a pretty obvious way to do that.
Immigration.
Among Hispanic Alabamians, one-third of whom were born outside the country, the median age is 24. Among Black Alabamians, with an immigrant population of 1.2%, the median age is 35. Among white Alabamians, of whom 1% are foreign-born, it’s almost 43. (The median age among the smaller Asian communities in the state is 37; over two-thirds of people in those groups were born outside the country.)
This doesn’t mean immigration on its own will solve our labor issues. Alabama will not attract the jobs that would bring people into struggling areas if infrastructure problems persist.
But bringing immigrants here would help. Not only are their participation rates higher than the country’s as a whole, the groups with the largest percentage of immigrants are having more children, who will eventually enter the workforce.
And yet, we are not doing that. We are persecuting the foreign-born.
It’s not enough that Gov. Kay Ivey can cut ads shamelessly mocking Hispanic immigrants. Now we have law enforcement agencies, apparently with no serious crimes to address, signing up to harass people for the high crime of not being a native-born Alabamian.
According to al.com, authorities arrested nearly 2,000 immigrants in the state through the end of June, more than had been arrested through all of 2024.
This is called a crackdown on people with criminal records. That’s facetious. In most of these cases, “criminal record” does not mean murder, assault or robbery. Just 3% of ICE arrests in Alabama involve violent criminals. it means being in the country without authorization, even if you’ve abided by every other law and paid taxes.
These are not people causing chaos. They are men and women seeking opportunities and trapped in a system that makes it very difficult to come to the United States legally.
One would hope the horrific treatment of people detained under this regime would cause some reflection. Our leaders, though, have no problem with terrorizing and traumatizing people they dislike, particularly women and transgender youth seeking health care.
So let’s go back to business. Every state official from Ivey on down claims to want to improve the workforce participation rate. Immigration would be a useful way to do that.
But instead, we have a state government all but cheering attacks on immigrants and discouraging them from coming here.
It’s hateful and wasteful and destructive. We once again look like the unquestioning toadies of whatever conservative figure holds the throne at the moment. And we give young people, whatever their national origin, even more reason to leave our state.
Which only adds to our workforce participation problems. But that doesn’t matter to our state leaders. The only “pro-business” attitude they have is ensuring workers obey their employers. And they’ll happily terrorize large swathes of our population to do so.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ALR_022225_Selects-40-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

Katie Britt of Alabama is asking the White House to speed up the release of appropriated funds for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a major source of funding for the University of Alabama Birmingham (UAB).
In a July 24 letter to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Britt and 13 of her Senate Republican colleagues asked the administration to fully implement the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump earlier this year and allocates funding for NIH initiatives at the previous year’s funding level.
“Senator Britt has been a strong advocate for ensuring the NIH remains the gold-standard of research and innovation across the nation and the world. She has continued to express the need for taxpayer dollars to be spent efficiently, judiciously, and accountably, which includes funding life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama,” Grace Evans, communications director for Britt’s office, said in an email Friday.

Senators raised concerns in the letter about the slow pace of NIH funding disbursement for fiscal year 2025, which ends on September 30. The letter said withholding or delaying these funds could undermine critical research; risk jobs supported by scientific research and delay Americans’ access to life-saving treatments.
“Suspension of these appropriated funds — whether formally withheld or functionally delayed – could threaten Americans’ ability to access better treatments and limit our nation’s leadership in biomedical science,” the letter stated.
Alabama received $380 million in NIH funding in fiscal year 2024, with 88% of those funds, or $334.4 million, allocated to UAB. As of July 21, Alabama has received $190.9 million in NIH grants during fiscal year 2025, with approximately $166 million allocated to UAB, which is about the same share as the previous fiscal year.
UAB relies significantly on federal funding. According to a 2023 press release, UAB was in the top 1% of all NIH-funded institutions, including private, public and international organizations, with $413.7 million out of $774.5 million in research grants coming from NIH.
Hannah Echols, a spokesperson for UAB, said in a statement Friday that UAB appreciated Britt’s “continued efforts to support critical NIH funding that improves and saves lives.”
“We continue to monitor, assess and address the developments regarding recent federal activity. Our government affairs professionals are actively engaged on the matter,” Echols said.
In a Senate Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee hearing in June with NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, Britt discussed her personal legislative priorities aimed at addressing the nation’s high maternal mortality rates, particularly in states like Alabama, which faces significant challenges with maternal care deserts, pointing to legislation she sponsored to providing funding a NIH initiative to research causes of maternal mortality.
“When you look at rural areas in Alabama, we have one third of our state’s 67 counties are actually maternal care deserts, meaning they don’t have access to birthing facilities or maternal care providers. It’s 2025. These numbers should be moving in the opposite direction,” Britt said in her line of questioning.
In a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing in April, she introduced Dr. Barry Sleckman, director of UAB’s O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center to the committee, where she asked Sleckman to describe the Cancer Center’s work and how it’s “investing in that will ultimately change lives in the future.”
Britt also asked Sleckman to tell the committee “why federal funding is unique in cancer prevention research.”
“Federal funding is unique in cancer prevention research, in part, because there are not a lot of other revenue streams for cancer prevention. This is not really a high priority, for example, for industry and pharma, and so federal funding, to understand how to develop cancer prevention approaches, is critical,” Sleckman said in the April hearing.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSC00579-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 08:56:55.938548

Where they’re located and why they’re unsafe,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/28/ct-lead-service-lines-what-to-know/,"There could be as many as 8,000 lead service lines connecting CT homes to the large water mains that run under the streets. What to know.","Lead plumbing was banned in the United States in 1986, but new data assembled by Connecticut’s water utilities show there may still be thousands of lead pipes carrying water into homes, apartments and some schools.
The Connecticut Mirror obtained hundreds of reports from the state Department of Public Health that show there could be as many as 8,000 lead service lines connecting people’s homes to the large water mains that run under the streets.
The state’s community water systems, which supply more than three-quarters of the state’s population with drinking water, began sending out notices late last year warning homeowners and renters that their service line could contain the toxic metal.
Every public water system across the country is now required to identify and replace all of the remaining lead service lines within the next 10 years. In the meantime, however, many utility customers are questioning how to protect themselves and their families from potential lead exposure. 
Here’s what you need to know.
What is a lead service line and what’s the concern? 
Service lines are the pipes that connect buildings to the larger water mains that run below many sidewalks and roads in Connecticut. Those lines can be made of all types of material, including plastic, copper, galvanized steel and lead. 
Between the late 1800s and the 1930s, it was not uncommon for homebuilders and water utilities to use lead to make those plumbing connections. And in many parts of the country, lead was considered a viable option until the federal ban in 1986. 
The issue with lead plumbing is that the metal can leach into the water that is running through the pipes. And that is a problem because no level of lead in the human body is considered safe. 
In adults, elevated levels of lead can affect kidney function and can contribute to cardiovascular problems, and in children it can cause developmental delays, learning difficulties and behavioral problems. 
How many lead service lines remain in Connecticut and where are they located? 
According to the data compiled by Connecticut’s community water systems, there could be nearly 8,000 lead service lines still in the ground — though that number is likely to change as officials continue to inspect homes and dig up old water lines.
Those lead lines are not distributed equally throughout the state, however. Some utilities are finding very little lead in their systems, while others are predicting that hundreds or thousands of homes, apartments and other buildings could be affected. 
The initial data provided to the Connecticut Department of Public Health shows that places like Bridgeport, Waterbury, Willimantic, New London, Middletown and Greenwich contain significant numbers of lead service lines. Some utilities, however, are just beginning to assess how many lead lines might remain in their systems. 
The number of lead service lines in a water system is largely dependent on what years the public water system was built and what materials the utilities used over their history to make service connections. 
How do I know if I have a lead service line?
Many utilities have created maps that allow water customers to search their address to learn whether they have a lead service line or not. Aquarion Water, Connecticut Water Company and many of the state’s larger municipal water systems, have links to those maps online. 
CT Mirror created a search tool for the 60 largest water systems in the state.

The new federal regulations required utilities to send out notices to customers if they suspected that the service line contained lead or if they were unsure what material the service line is made of.
Some utilities are also soliciting help from their customers in identifying lead service lines. Many utility companies have asked customers to take photos of their water lines where they enter the basement or crawl space.
And they’ve provided step by step guides, like this one, for how to investigate what material was used for their service line.
Why are officials investigating these lines now and what are they going to do about them?
While lead plumbing was banned in the mid 1980s, the push to remove older lead service lines did not gain traction until after the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, in 2014.
That crisis was created when officials in Flint changed the source of the city’s drinking water, and it resulted in service lines and other plumbing leaching significant amounts of lead into people’s tap water.
To try to prevent similar public health emergencies, federal officials adopted new federal regulations last year requiring every utility serving more than 25 people to identify how many lead lines they have and to replace all of those lines in the next 10 years.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates there could be between 6 million to 10 million still in use throughout the United States. 
Replacing all of those service lines is likely to be an expensive and time-consuming process. In the meantime, most utilities will continue to treat their water with corrosion inhibitors — compounds that help prevent plumbing from leaching large amounts of lead into people’s tap water.
What precautions can I take if my home has a lead service line? 
The Connecticut Department of Public Health and many of the state’s water utilities are advising customers with suspected or confirmed lead service lines to take several precautionary steps to limit their potential exposure.
They are advising people to clean out the aerators on their sinks. Those are the small screens that are on the tips of most kitchen and bathroom faucets. 
They are also encouraging people to run the water for several minutes before using the water for cooking or drinking. 
The best way to protect against lead exposure, however, is a water filter that is certified to remove lead from drinking water. You can learn more about that filter certification here.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LEAD-SERVICE-LINES-SR-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

If this week’s funding drives offer any insight, that answer is a resounding yes.
WABE, Atlanta’s local NPR affiliate, raised half a million dollars in its first week of fundraising since Congress voted to claw back $1.1 billion in federal funding that had already been approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, according to president and CEO Jennifer Dorian. 

 



How to support Georgia’s public media organizations
WABE: Visit wabe.org/strong
GPB: Visit gpb.org/federal-funding
 




The CPB provides federal funds to organizations like National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service, and local public media stations across the country. During the most recent fiscal year, Georgia received nearly $6.6 million in CPB grants. That money went to five different stations across the state: WABE, Georgia Public Broadcasting, WCLK, WJSP and WUGA.
The bill, which in addition to slashing public media funding also eliminates $8 billion in foreign aid, cleared the House last Friday by a 216-213 margin. All nine Republican members of the Georgia delegation voted in favor of the bill, and the state’s five Democratic House members voted against it. Georgia’s two senators, both Democrats, also voted against the legislation, which passed in a 51-48 vote in the Senate. President Donald Trump signed the bill into law Thursday.
But critics have warned about the devastating impact the funding cuts could have on rural Americans, particularly those who live in news deserts. Holes in local broadcast coverage could also become more glaring during severe weather events such as hurricanes, when prolonged power outages could restrict access to other types of news.
“Radio is one of the most effective and affordable means of communication that humans have,” Dorian said. “In a case of an extreme weather event or in any kind of emergency, people are super reliant on radio broadcasting.”
WABE, which serves 258,000 listeners per week, is now expecting a $1.9 million shortfall this year, which constitutes 13% of its budget. 
For GPB, which operates nine public television stations across the state and was slated to receive $4.2 million from CPB this year, federal funding accounts for 10% of their revenue. They also receive funding from Georgia’s state budget, as well as from donors.
“GPB leadership anticipated a rapidly changing federal funding environment and in response, has conducted careful scenario planning in preparation for multiple outcomes,” GPB said in a statement this week. “We are grateful to the Georgia General Assembly for providing level funding for this year and thankful for our many loyal donors across the state and beyond.”
Both outlets have launched emergency fundraising drives in response to the new law, hoping that Georgia residents will be able to help make up the remainder of the funds. GPB has not publicly disclosed how much their fundraising drive has raised.
Though the money raised by WABE is not yet enough to fill the organization’s $1.9 million funding gap, Dorian said it’s a strong start.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy.)Last week’s energy auction by multistate power grid operator PJM will cause most Marylanders’ monthly electric bills to go up $2 to $5 next summer — but that’s on top of other costs, for transmission, fuel and more, that one advocate calls “death by a thousand cuts.”
It’s also the latest evidence, say ratepayer advocates and policymakers, that policies of PJM, the grid operator in a 13-state region that includes Maryland, are out of whack.
The latest of the “thousand cuts” is mostly the result of energy-guzzling data centers, David Lapp, the Maryland People’s Counsel, who is charged with representing state ratepayers. Predictions for their proliferation are largely behind inflated projections of energy demand in PJM states, pushing demand past supply in the auction process, sending the price skyward.
And ultimately, consumers pay the price.
“It’s fundamentally unfair,” Lapp said. “Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?”
At the same time, consumer advocates say PJM policies have restricted supply, with a backlogged queue for energy projects, many of them renewable energy proposals.
“Until there’s actual queue reform, there’s not going to be real relief,” said Emily Scarr, a senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, or Public Interest Research Group.
All eyes were on this year’s auction because last year’s was a blockbuster: The clearing price jumped 800% compared to the 2023 auction, setting a record for the most expensive such auction in PJM history.
This year’s auction surpassed that record, but it was offset by policies that consumer advocates — and some governors — pushed PJM to adopt.
Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) was behind a new cap on the auction’s clearing price. The auction hit the cap, saving consumers about $2.9 billion in total costs on their bills. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) supported Shapiro’s appeal.
As various parts of energy bills increase, grid decision-makers don’t seem to be asking a key question, says Laurel Peltier, a low-income ratepayer advocate for the AARP: “Can people afford this?”
During a news conference Tuesday, Stu Bresler, a PJM executive vice president of market services and strategy, said that auction costs are a “small part of retail bills, and it also varies” how auction costs translate into rate changes for consumers.
But Peltier said that ignores key context.
“That’s like being in a bakery, and you know that the flour got more expensive, the butter got more expensive, the labor got more expensive, and you’re the egg maker, and your eggs are 800% more, and you’re like, ‘It’s OK. It’s just a little part,’” Peltier said.
When it comes to bill increases from the capacity auction, BGE customers are the exception. The segment of their bills tied to the auction will actually go down an estimated $3.36 per month, according to Office of People’s Counsel calculations.
But that’s really only because their rates soared so high after last year’s capacity auction at PJM.
PJM forced a Baltimore-area coal-fired plant, Brandon Shores, and oil-burning plant, H.A. Wagner, to keep running beyond their announced closure dates. But PJM’s rules kept that power out of the 2024 auction, suppressing expected supply at a time of surging demand.
This time, after urging from Lapp’s office and others, the rules were changed so that power from the two older plants was counted. And BGE customers will actually receive a credit for any revenue that the plants’ owner, Talen Energy, receives from the auction, Lapp said, lowering their bills, contrary to initial predictions from PJM.
But their monthly electric bills will still be up $16 from two auctions ago.
Changes inside PJM?
In a July 16 letter to PJM, a bipartisan group of nine governors in PJM’s 13-state territory — including Moore and Shapiro — said the moment presents an opportunity for change.
With the “abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” their replacements must “understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs,” and create “a more collaborative and more effective ethos” at PJM, the governors wrote.










It’s fundamentally unfair. Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?


– David Lapp, Maryland Office of People's Counsel


“In the past, other regions looked to join PJM due to its many strengths; today, across the region, discussions of leaving PJM are becoming increasingly common,” read their letter.
In a July 18 response, PJM Board of Managers Chairman David Mills pushed back.
“Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” he wrote. “We also continue the necessary function of operating regional markets as well as planning for a grid that is seeing an explosion of demand growth at the same time that state and federal policies have pushed a meaningful amount of generation capacity into retirement.”
He listed a number of changes PJM has made to its auction “to address concerns raised by our states,” including the “temporary” cap.
In a statement announcing the auction results Tuesday, PJM wrote that it “continues to focus on enhancing its process for connecting new generation resources onto the system, which includes clearing all the projects in its transition queue over the next 18 months, opening its new cycle process in spring 2026, and leveraging artificial intelligence through our partnership with Google to reduce processing time.”
Regime change may help, but some advocates warn that more transformative change may be necessary to lower prices. That includes changing how the organization is governed, Lapp said.
“We and the 13 other state consumer advocate offices in PJM — we get one vote. There are transmission-owning utilities that have more votes than us together,” Lapp said. “It’s the transmission owners that wield the most influence at PJM.”
Those same companies generally lose out when more power generation comes online, Scarr said.

“The legacy power plants lose out when that happens — but they’re the ones managing the ship,” Scarr said.
In a statement Thursday, Moore spokesman Carter Elliott IV wrote that Moore is “demanding reform and a meaningful voice for states in PJM governance, which is why a bipartisan group of governors’ staff met with PJM members” on Wednesday, including Moore’s staff.
A spokesman for PJM pointed to a fact sheet describing the grid operator’s governance structure, which highlights that PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers must not be financially tied to any PJM member. But on the member’s committee, which includes about 1,000 members, votes are divided between five industry sectors. State consumer advocates are the other voting members.
Data center debacle
When she hears ominous predictions for data center demand on the PJM grid, Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) is skeptical.
The massive computing facilities have a sprawling footprint in Northern Virginia that has quickly inflated power demand in that region. But it remains an open question how widespread they will become, she said.
“You have the data centers that are sort of playing the field. There’s a real question right now about: Are we overcounting data center load? If the same data center is checking out five different locations, how are we sure?” said Charkoudian, who closely studies energy issues and is frequently behind energy legislation in the General Assembly.
It’s part of the reason she was dismayed to see Moore veto two bills that would have studied energy issues, citing their cost. One bill created a Strategic Energy Planning Office in Maryland, focused on predicting future energy issues without relying on PJM and utility companies; the second studied data centers specifically.
“Right now we’re continually caught flat-footed,” said Charkoudian, who added that she supports veto overrides for those bills.
Lapp said he also worries that data center projections are overblown because technology could be advancing to increase power efficiency at the facilities, which are full of computer servers that require immense amounts of energy to run and to keep from overheating.
That’s a major reason why data centers themselves should be footing the bill for their own power demand, and the upgrades to the power system they may require, Lapp said.
“If the data centers aren’t responsible for paying for all the costs that they are driving, they have much less incentive to find more computer chips, to operate more efficiently, to reduce their own costs,” he said.
It’s PJM’s job to change the paradigm, wherein ratepayers pay for enhancing the electric system, he said.
“It’s an unprecedented period of time in the industry, when you have city-sized demand being built up in just a few years,” Lapp said. “You can’t treat that the same as load growth gradually occurring over time.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)By Matt Dragon
While a lot of the focus has been on the chaos in Washington, DC over the tax bill that would represent the largest transfer of wealth to the ultra-wealthy in our history, New Jersey’s legislators and Gov. Phil Murphy are responsible for an equally unjust budget, written largely out of the public eye.
It’s easy to see why so many voters sit out elections, or say they don’t see the difference in their lives regardless of election outcome, when we see parallel stories playing out in Democratic-controlled New Jersey and in Republican-controlled D.C. The budget process in Trenton has long been criticized as “three white dudes in a room,” which needs to be addressed head-on. But it also doesn’t seem to yield very good results, with rushed votes right before the deadline, and multiple recent instances of “clean-up bills” needed to fix up mistakes no one had a chance to notice before the fast-tracked passage to meet the deadline.
In the few days before the vote, as the actual shape of the state’s new budget became apparent, there were several red flags. The affordable housing trust fund is being raided to plug holes elsewhere in the budget, continuing a long line of one-off budget “fixes” at the expense of much-needed programs. What could have been a moment of real celebration with the passage of a mansion tax to create a more equitable tax system has instead been undermined, potentially leaving affordable housing in New Jersey worse off than it started.
It’s not just the public that’s kept in the dark. Even Attorney General Matt Platkin, with whom I have my own disagreements, was shocked to find out that $45 million from the state’s share of the national opioid settlement was being diverted to four major hospital chains in the state. One of those hospital chains, RWJBarnabas Health, will receive $15 million, which definitely has nothing to do with the fact that longtime Murphy chief of staff, limited-time-only U.S. senator from New Jersey George Helmy fell into a high paying role at the health care giant when he departed the Murphy administration in 2023. A very Jersey career arc, but this simply isn’t how functional governments govern.
Unfortunately, New Jersey’s new budget and its process, cloaked in secrecy, intentionally devoid of meaningful public input, and inarguably rushed, is nothing new, nor limited to budget bills. In 2020, a bill to allow Horizon to convert to a for-profit entity was introduced in the last few days of the lame duck session before the end-of-year Legislative holiday. Horizon is the largest health insurer in New Jersey and the health insurance provider for the State Health Benefits Plan offered to state employees (also an option for municipal and county workforces). That bill was moved through committee with amendments that the public had never seen — and let’s be honest, the legislators probably never read them either.
Surprising no one, after the restructuring was approved, Horizon jacked up state plan premiums more than 20%, despite its new, “more competitive” for-profit form. In the three years after the misguided bill was rushed through the Legislature without transparency, Horizon paid out $35 million in bonuses, with just under $13 million going to the new CEO.
Flash forward to this year, and the governor and legislators have a plan to take $100 million from public employees. We could cover 10% of the $100 million in desired savings just from one Horizon executive’s bonus. Are our teachers, firefighters, and snow-plow operators getting bonuses like that?
To add insult to injury, the Horizon board has been a rotating clown car of former state legislators, which seems to have done nothing to protect the state’s or their former constituents’ interests.
The system is clearly broken, but the challenge is getting those who broke it — and benefit from its brokenness — to fix it. While voters are effectively locked out of the process, every state Assembly member and senator has the power to force change. It’s not about party, it’s about whether you were elected to represent — or to rule over.
So our legislators need to learn:

If you’re representing us, you can’t vote bills out of committee that we’ve never seen.
If you’re representing our best interests, you can’t vote bills out of committee that exist only as a few bullets on a napkin.
If you’re representing the people, you actually have to engage with and listen to those people, and you have to do that before you decide how to vote.

They need to slow things down and:

Hold actual public hearings, where you don’t give priority to retired lawmakers, and instead prioritize testimony from the actual public, not professional lobbyists.
Make those public hearings accessible, as most people can’t drive to Trenton and spend six hours sitting around waiting to testify during working hours.
Refuse to vote on things that weren’t on public committee agendas for at least a week before the hearing.
Refuse to vote on amendments that haven’t been released publicly for at least 72 hours.
Work with the legislative and technology offices to ensure that full bill text and amendment text are actually public on the New Jersey Legislature site before bills come before committees. 

Your chamber leaders will hate you, your committee chairs will despise you, but voters will support you. You have to reestablish trust, or election turnouts will continue to dwindle and more and more residents will, rightfully, feel like they’re on the outside, and that you’re not interested in representing them. Your chamber and committee leadership are not your bosses; your constituents are.

There has never been a case where restricting speech on a political matter to such a degree has gone well. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Habib Meiloud: Do not support bill H.310.","This commentary is by Habib Meiloud of central Vermont.


I recently learned about bill H.310 and find it troubling on multiple levels. Mainly, it’s a seemingly purposeful attempt to conflate anti-Zionism and critique of the State of Israel with antisemitism. 
Not only is this comparison false, but it is also extremely concerning when considered in the context of education. 
To be clear, I fully support mandating that the Holocaust be taught in every single Vermont school. I take issue with the attempt to infringe on students’ rights to critique a state. 
There is no other country in the world where the critique of its policies is so easily twisted into hate speech against its people. 
If I critique the state of Ethiopia for its slaughter of the Tigray people, am I considered to be racist? Of course not — because there is a difference between critiquing those in power and discrimination against people. 
Every Vermont student should be able to discuss openly their thoughts and opinions on Israel or any other country. Stifling warranted conversation is not the solution to the rise in antisemitism that we have seen. The way we fight that antisemitism and all hate is by education and discussion. 
There has never been a case where restricting speech on a political matter to such a degree has gone well. 
I recognize, however, that a discussion without a solid educational foundation can easily become hateful. So I would hope that supporters of this bill would also support having students have a full education of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and not starting on Oct. 7, 2023, but rather in 1917, the year of the Balfour Declaration. That way, students can understand the nuances of the conversation. 
However, H.310 does not accomplish that goal. All it does is start to set up Vermont’s students to become complacent in the face of national acts, out of fear of retribution. 
Is this the lesson we want to signal to our kids? Can that adversity only be solved by forceful legislation? If that is not what you want, then do not support H.310.

As anti-immigration rhetoric surges across Europe and the United States, it is vital that we look beyond the fearmongering and analyse what is really going on. While human mobility is often presented as a burden, the truth is quite the opposite. It is an essential driver of economic growth, demographic resilience and cultural cohesion.
Ignoring this fact is not just a miscalculation – it flies in the face of both empirical evidence and the democratic principles that modern societies claim to defend.
Migration is also not a 21st century anomaly. From the Mediterranean diasporas of antiquity to the mass migrations of the 20th century, human history has been defined by movement. City-states, colonial empires and modern nation-states have been built – and rebuilt – through the movement of people, languages, knowledge and goods. Presenting human mobility as a threat ignores this historical pattern, and tries to turn the exception – isolation – into the rule.
Any political discourse that presents migrants as intruders, rather than as potential citizens or economic agents, is a dangerous distortion, not only in moral but also in strategic terms.
 Migration drives economies

In 2016, an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute drew some compelling conclusions. While migrants accounted for only 3.3% of the global population in 2015, they generated 9.4% of global GDP that year – about $6.7 trillion. In the United States alone, their contribution amounted to about $2 trillion.
More recent studies confirm this. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated in 2024 that net migration flows to the eurozone between 2020 and 2023 – including millions of Ukrainian refugees – may raise the region’s potential GDP by an additional 0.5% by 2030. This is not a marginal amount, as it represents roughly half of all expected potential growth. Without migration, Europe’s economic horizon would be considerably more limited.
 Workers, innovation, growth

In the US, more than 31 million immigrants were part of the labour market in 2023 – 19% of the total, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Their participation rate (meaning the percentage of the working-age population that is active in the labour market) was 67%, compared to 62% of native-born workers. This difference signals a disproportionate contribution to tax revenue, domestic consumption and economic dynamism in general.

  Labour force participation rate in the US: immigrants have been more active participants in the labour market than their native-born counterparts for nearly two decades. (Council on Foreign Relations)
Statistics also show that immigrants do not compete on a level playing field: they tend to work in physically demanding jobs, or in those that are not covered by locals. This reinforces the idea that they complement, rather than substitute, native-born workers. This role becomes even more significant in contexts of full employment or population ageing.

 Migration and innovation

Migration brings not only workers, but also new ideas. According to the World Economic Forum, immigrants to the US are 80% more likely to start new businesses than native-born people, and more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by migrants or their descendants.
This pattern is repeated in academia and technology: a significant proportion of patents filed in the United States have at least one foreign inventor. The country’s leading universities also depend on international students to sustain their science, technology, engineering and mathematics programmes. In other words, closing borders means closing the door to innovation.
In the European Union, their impact is no less significant. According to the 2024 IMF report, between 2019 and 2023, two thirds of new jobs were filled by non-EU migrants. These statistics refute the idea that migrants “steal jobs”. On the contrary, they fill structural vacancies that neither automation nor the internal market has been able to fill.
Moreover, the OECD warned in 2025 that if more women, older people and immigrants are not brought into the labour market, GDP per capita growth in member countries could fall from 1% per year (2000-2020) to a meagre 0.6% by 2060. Conversely, a more inclusive migration policy could add at least 0.1 percentage point to annual growth.
 Sending money home

The 2024 World Migration Report confirmed that global remittances – immigrants sending money to family members in their country of origin – reached $831 billion in 2022, a growth of more than 650% from 2000.
This far exceeds official development assistance and even, in many cases, foreign direct investment. However, they perform a similar function – remittances are mainly invested in health, education and housing.
They are, in effect, a global redistribution of wealth that does not pass through any multilateral system. For the people who receive them, their impact is stabilising, and profoundly humane.
 Looking forwards

This is not just a question of economics. When political and social rhetoric starts to exclude those perceived as outsiders, it undermines their capacity to adapt and change. Ignoring the evidence comes at a great cost, which can be summarised in three areas:

Economic losses: reduced immigration means giving up a structural source of growth, innovation and fiscal sustainability.
Social instability: anti-immigration discourse feeds the stigmas that fracture coexistence and weaken social cohesion.
Geopolitical weakness: less immigration means losing influence in a world increasingly defined by intense competition for talent and human capital.

The good news is that there are tried and tested solutions. From streamlining professional accreditation processes to regional migration coordination systems, there are already tools available to governments. The challenge is a political and, above all, narrative one. Public opinion – which is shaped by political rhetoric – needs to recognise and embrace the value of human mobility as part of our contemporary social contract.
As the World Economic Forum rightly points out, migration is not a problem to be solved, but a strategic asset to be managed intelligently and humanely. To underestimate it is to undermine the foundations of global development in the 21st century.

(Getty Images)The last Indiana biennial budget faced significant challenges, which seem certain to worsen. Still, it is not short-term fluctuations that challenge us, but rather the long-term changes to how we spend our state tax dollars. 
The economic forecast for 2025-6 turned sour because of the emerging trade war. That cut $2 billion from the state budget forecast over the next two fiscal years, and was followed by further belt-tightening steps in preparation for what is almost certain to be more bad economic news through 2026-7.
Hoosier lawmakers are obligated to balance our budget, and keep roughly $2.4 billion, a bit more than 5% of a biennium budget in reserve. That’s a healthy, but not excessive reserve. We saw nearly a 5% decline in Indiana’s gross domestic product in 2008, which combined with what is charitably described as a stochastic federal budgeting approach should worry state lawmakers.  
There are always issues to complain about in a state budget, but the bigger focus of interest should be on long-term budgeting issues. The question should be how much are we taxing and spending, and where are we allocating those dollars.  
Analysis: Latest Indiana budget drops spending 7% — with cuts ‘telling’

This is not as easy as it seems. The state government took over the last 15% of school operational funding in 2010, so comparisons in earlier years require some adjustment. At the same time, our local spending as a share of GDP and local government employment are both below where they sat two decades ago. 
Recent local tax cuts, primarily to businesses, are likely to push local spending back to 1990s levels by 2026. I note this, because lower local spending places more pressure on state services.  
State spending as a share of GDP dropped from 10.9% in 2004 to 9.6% in 2024, despite the 2010 takeover of school operational funding. But, the year-to-year variation has been significant. In 2014, the state spent only 8.3% of GDP, and in 2022-3 spent 10.7% of GDP.  
It is fair to say that without dipping into the reserves, state spending in the 2026-7 budget as a share of our economy is likely to be among the lowest of the past two decades. But the far bigger issue is how we are spending those dollars. 
The state budget fits nicely into some big categories – K-12 and higher education, food assistance, Medicaid, corrections, transportation and housing. The ‘other’ spending categories of environmental, economic development and a slew of miscellaneous funds has been fairly stable, with one exception – a rapid burst in economic development spending, primarily on the LEAP district.










if we spent the same share of GDP on education today as we did in 2010, K-12 and higher education institutions in the state would receive $3.2 billion more each year in spending.


I think it is helpful to place the ‘people focused’ budget items into two broad categories – those that help prevent poverty, and those that mitigate the effects of poverty. Transportation is best left by itself in this analysis. 
As of last year, Indiana spending on all transportation items – road maintenance and capital investment, along with safety and bridges was 0.31% of our GDP. That is well below the 21st century average of 0.50% of GDP, and near inflation adjusted lows.  
Even with the changes in gasoline taxes, our highway and road spending are deeply stressed. That is why the governor is pushing for more local spending via a wheel tax while also pursuing tolls on federal highways. He is right to pursue both of these.  
Helping Hoosiers
The bigger changes we’ve seen come in the allocation of funding between state government activities that help ensure prosperity, and those that treat poverty. 
The two big “pro-prosperity” programs at the state level are quite obviously, education. The programs that treat poverty are food assistance, Medicaid, corrections and housing.  
Our spending on pursuing prosperity is lower than in 2010, by every relevant measure. In 2010, we spent 2.77% of our GDP on education, today that figure is 2.16%. The biggest cuts have been in higher education, but in K-12 we are spending $100 less per student each year today than in 2010. Furthermore, if we spent the same share of GDP on education today as we did in 2010, K-12 and higher education institutions in the state would receive $3.2 billion more each year in spending.  
As a side note, all my data are in inflation adjusted dollars – the approach used by anyone who is honestly comparing spending across time. 
On programs that attempt to remediate the effects of poverty, our spending has grown substantially. Altogether, the share of our state’s economy we spend on these four big programs has risen by 0.34%.  This extra spending since 2010 translates into an additional $1.8 billion spent each year to mitigate poverty.   
The sole culprit here is Medicaid. In 2010 we spent 0.57% of our GDP on Medicaid. That rose to 1.12% in 2023-24.  
Today, Indiana has worse educational outcomes, and higher poverty spending than we did in 2010.  The challenge of the next decade is to reverse these trends.  That just won’t happen without more fiscal capacity aimed at education.

Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Skamania County, who is bracing for a pitched fight to keep her seat representing southwest Washington, raised $904,000 in the most recent reporting period. 
Meanwhile, Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, arguably the state’s most at-risk Republican House member, is stockpiling cash ahead of another tussle with MAGA Republican Jerrod Sessler in central Washington.
Here is a round-up of money raised by Washington’s incumbent House members and opponents between April 1 and June 30 as reported to the Federal Election Commission. 
Washington’s battleground district
Gluesenkamp Perez was first elected in 2022, capturing the 3rd Congressional District seat that Republicans had held for a dozen years. She spent nearly $12 million to win reelection in 2024.
It is not going to be easier in 2026. The National Republican Congressional Committee is already criticizing her with a drumbeat of press releases and ads, as at least two recognized Republicans have looked at entering the race. 
Two people have stepped up to challenge her – Republican Antony Barran and Democrat Brent William Hennrich. Barran raised $9,300 and Hennrich brought in  $7,400, according to their campaign disclosures.
With her haul of a little over $900,000, Gluesenkamp Perez had $1.1 million on hand June 30, according to her FEC filings.
Tim Gowen, campaign manager for Gluesenkamp Perez, said in an email last week the congresswoman “is ready to put her record of fighting our fentanyl crisis and leveling the playing field for everyday people up against anyone.”
A third round
In November, Newhouse secured a sixth term representing the 4th District by defeating Jerrod Sessler, a candidate backed by Donald Trump.
Newhouse has been scorned by MAGA Republicans since he voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But the congressman has defended his seat twice since that vote.
He raised $261,000 this last cycle and, after expenses, had $339,000 on hand.
Sessler, who also ran in 2022, is the lone challenger so far for 2026. The Prosser resident raised nearly $60,000 in the quarter and close to $184,000 for the election cycle. However, he’s spent most of it and had a little under $8,300 on hand June 30.
In a statement, Sessler expressed confidence, saying, “I’ve got President Trump’s support and all those who want to see Washington state return to sanity.”
A campaign spokesman for Newhouse said the congressman is delivering “positive results” and that if Sessler runs again, “the result won’t be any different than the last two times.”
Packed House
Rep. Adam Smith, who is getting challenged from the political left and right in the 9th District, collected $226,000 and had $659,000 banked at the close of the filing period.
Kshama Sawant, the socialist who served a decade on the Seattle City Council, may be his best-known opponent. Sawant formally kicked off her campaign in early June and raised $87,000 by the end of the month.
Melissa Chaudhry, a Democrat who lost to Smith in November, looks to be running again. She reported $107,000 in her campaign account, nearly all of it carried over from her 2024 campaign. 
Republicans Mark Greene, who ran unsuccessfully last year, and Janis Clark filed campaign committee paperwork this month. 
A rematch?
Republican Rep. Michael Baumgartner received 60.6% of the vote when he beat Democrat Carmela Conroy in November in the 5th District. The two Spokane residents could duel again next year.
The first-term congressman got $228,000 in contributions and ended with $435,000 on June 30, based on federal reports. Conroy had a little more than $73,000 on hand after a quarter in which she raised $68,000.
Ann Marie Danimus, a Spokane Democrat who ran in 2024, looks to be eyeing another bid for the seat as well as she registered her campaign committee in mid-June. 
The rest of the pack
Six Democratic House members, most without announced opponents, boosted their totals.
Rep. Suzan DelBene of Medina raised $581,000 and had $1.2 million on hand as she eyes another term in the 1st Congressional District. She also chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, making her a point person in the party’s effort to recapture the House majority in next year’s midterms.
Rep. Rick Larsen of Everett, who first won his 2nd Congressional District in 2000, brought in $331,000 and ended with nearly $415,000 in his campaign account.
Rep. Emily Randall of Bremerton, in her first term serving the 6th Congressional District, collected $203,000 and closed with $128,000 banked as she eyes a reelection run.
In the 7th District, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Seattle hauled in an impressive $609,000 and, after expenses, finished this cycle with $2.2 million on hand. The former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus has been an unyielding opposition voice to the Trump administration.
In the neighboring 8th District, Rep. Kim Schrier of Sammamish reported nearly $466,000 raised and $2.5 million in her coffers. Earlier this month, Republican Bob Hagglund of Granite Falls filed as a candidate with the Federal Election Commission. Hagglund ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2024.
Rep. Marilyn Strickland of Tacoma, looking to retain her seat in the 10th District, reported $295,000 in contributions and had banked $685,000 through June 30. No opponents had signed up a campaign committee as of Friday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/money-rake-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

(Courtesy of Cooperative Energy Futures)More than 180 local households will see significantly lower energy bills after the solar array atop Abbott Northwestern Hospital’s new parking ramp powers up later this year. 
Abbot Northwestern — Twin Cities’ largest private hospital — will enjoy similar savings while hosting Minneapolis nonprofit Cooperative Energy Futures’ newest community solar garden for at least the next 25 years. 
It’s CEF’s second ramp-top solar garden — after the 3,760-panel installation at Ramp A in downtown Minneapolis — and one of its largest yet. Community solar garden subscribers typically save 20% to 30% on their monthly electricity bills, CEF says. Fifty-five percent of subscribers in the Abbott Northwestern garden qualify as low- or moderate-income. Canopy-style arrays like this one provide shade for people and cars in summer and reduce snow removal crews’ workloads come winter.
Perks like these helped CEF find long-term hosts for and draw nearly 1,000 subscribers to its 10 existing community solar gardens, a mix of rooftop and canopy arrays in the Twin Cities and ground-mounted installations farther out. CEF plans to energize at least three more gardens this year and has five projects in earlier stages of development, according to its 2025 annual report.
The future of projects like these are in doubt since the election of President Donald Trump, which has ushered in a federal government bent on making it harder for Americans to access affordable, non-polluting electricity.
Trump signed a partisan budget law on July 4 that sunsets federal solar tax credits years ahead of schedule while boosting already-generous fossil fuel subsidies, sending solar developers scrambling to grandfather as many projects as possible under the current rules. Days later, Trump made good on an apparent side deal with congressional conservatives and ordered the U.S. Treasury Department to take a hard line on those rules, possibly by increasing the amount of early investment projects need before they can qualify. Developers expect final guidance sometime next month, soon after Trump’s latest tariffs take effect (or not).
“Our lawyers are really trying to define our deadlines and we’re going to push as much as we can before we have to reorient,” CEF’s Dan Grantier told The Reformer at the Abbot Northwestern ribbon-cutting event.

The Abbot Northwestern project illustrates the potential for creative uses of a solar garden in an urban environment. Hospital owner Allina Health approached CEF in 2019 as part of a campaign to endear its Midtown Minneapolis neighbors to the new parking ramp it needed for a major campus expansion, Allina Vice President of Facilities Tony LaCroix-Dalluhn recently told The Reformer. 
“A parking structure is not exactly a welcome addition to the neighborhood, so we came up with a community solar garden to make it more appealing,” along with less conspicuous nods to sustainability, like a “maxed out” 200-stall bike parking area with showers and a pollinator garden along the Midtown Greenway, LaCroix-Dalluhn said. 
“There’s not much benefit for us, but it’s great for the community,” he said.
Minnesota helped kickstart the American community solar movement thanks in large part to legislation championed by the late State Rep. Melissa Hortman and the doggedness of homegrown developers like CEF, which began weatherizing older Minneapolis homes in the late aughts.  With more installed community solar capacity than all but three other states — more than 900 times the maximum output of the Abbott Northwestern system — Minnesota continues to punch well above its weight. 
Despite Trump’s war on decarbonization, states and municipalities that care about climate change and energy access will continue to support solar development. Minnesota needs to add a lot more solar panels — as well as wind turbines and other carbon-free sources and batteries to provide grid stability — to meet its mandate for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, giving developers like CEF and dozens of smaller rooftop solar installation businesses clarity on long-term demand. House Democrats gave the industry another boost in the June special legislative session when they killed a budget provision that would have ended Minnesota’s community solar program in three years. 
And despite tightening municipal budgets, some Minnesota cities offer generous incentives for residential and commercial solar projects. Businesses qualify for up to $50,000 and residential buyers’ groups up to $175,000 from the Minneapolis Green Cost Share program, for example.
“If you’re looking to build a parking ramp in Minneapolis, we want to talk to you,” Grantier said.
Even without federal subsidies, solar and backup batteries increasingly make financial sense for utility customers, said Michael Allen, cofounder and CEO of All Energy Solar. 
But the slow, cumbersome process of getting new systems approved and connected to the grid — typically a 40-to-60-day wait for Xcel Energy customers “if everything goes smoothly,” he said — scares some prospects off and raises costs for the rest. Larger arrays can take many months or years to get utility approval, though Grantier said urban neighborhoods like Midtown tend to have more slack in the grid.
“Where legislators and regulators can really make a difference is by holding (utilities’) feet to the fire and taking a stand to improve things for Minnesotans,” Allen said.
Otherwise, he warned, more utility customers may take matters into their own hands and look for ways to reduce their reliance on the grid.
 “The more we fight each other, the greater the desire there is to do something different,” he said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solar-garden-2-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.



The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.


The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.

Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

Santiago/Getty Images)Federal immigration authorities have arrested increasing numbers of people suspected of being in Indiana illegally — but have yet to deputize officer nominees from at least two Hoosier counties in President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign.
And Indiana’s state police agency has no plans to seek such U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement duties for its officers, despite a directive from Gov. Mike Braun promoting participation.
Nearly 1,400 people in Indiana have been subject to ICE administrative arrest since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, as of June 26. That’s almost an 80% increase over the same period last year, according to ICE records obtained by the Deportation Data Project and published July 15.

About a quarter of those apprehended in June had no criminal convictions or charges, prompting Braun to remark, “If that data is correct, I’d say that should raise eyebrows. Because I’ve been clearly on record: the worst, first. And there are many of them out there.”
The tally comes as the Hoosier State is tapped to bulk up the nation’s deportation infrastructure.
Amid a capacity crisis in federal immigration facilities, Camp Atterbury will be used to hold immigrant detainees. The federally owned military installation is licensed to and operated by the Indiana National Guard.
Meanwhile, the crusade has revealed cracks among Trump’s Hoosier backers and forced immigrant advocates to adjust.
Enforcement-boosting agreements idle
More than 866 state and local law enforcement agencies have entered formal partnerships with ICE to help identify and remove people in the U.S. illegally, particularly those with criminal histories — but only four are Indiana agencies.
The program, authorized in Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, lets ICE delegate certain immigration enforcement powers to state or local officers. There are three active program models: jail enforcement, task force and warrant service officer.
Although available since 1996, the first memorandum of agreement wasn’t signed until 2002, according to a 2021 Congressional Research Service report. The total increased to 72 in 2011, declined to 35 by the end of former President Barack Obama’s administration, and shot back up to 150 in late 2020, near the end of Trump’s first term in office.
As of Friday, ICE’s records of 287(g) participants listed four Hoosier law enforcement agencies.
All signed up this year, after Braun issued an executive order in January directing Hoosier law enforcement agencies to “fully cooperate with ICE, and, to the maximum extent permitted, enter into (287(g)) agreements.”


They include sheriff’s offices in Hamilton, Jasper and Noble counties, as well as the town of Greens Fork’s police department.
But officers nominated by at least two of them haven’t yet been activated.
The Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office turned in a jail enforcement agreement dated Feb. 24. ICE signed it March 3.
Under that model, select officers would be able to serve and execute administrative arrest warrants for immigration violations; interrogate and process suspected arrestees; serve warrants of removal; prepare charging documents; transport arrestees to ICE-approved detention facilities; issue immigration detainer requests and more.
But before officers are conferred those powers, they must complete delegation of immigration authority training and score at least 70% on related exams. 
Five members were identified for training, which has been scheduled, Hamilton County Sgt. Bryan Melton said Thursday; they’re “waiting to attend.” ICE has also granted access to its systems and software.
“We have a good working relationship with ICE,” Melton added. His office has held 74 people for transfer to ICE custody so far this year, after holding just 77 across the entirety of 2024.
ICE signed the Jasper County Sheriff’s Office’s warrant service officer deal on March 17.
“To date, that training has not yet occurred,” Chief Deputy Jason Wallace said Wednesday. “As such, we currently have zero deputies/jail officers participating in the program, and it is my understanding that we are not considered active participants until the required training is completed.”
“I am unsure why the training has not yet taken place,” he added. “All necessary paperwork was submitted; however, we have not received any follow-up or communication from ICE regarding next steps.”
His agency has recorded 14 transfers to ICE custody so far this year.
The Noble County Sheriff’s Office and Greens Fork Police Department didn’t return requests for comment on their participation in the 287(g) program. They have memorandums of agreement effective March 25 and April 10, respectively.
ICE also maintains a log of pending partnerships. As of Friday, it listed no Hoosier agencies.
The Indiana State Police indicated that it won’t be among those seeking ICE powers.
“ISP has no plan to enter into a 287(g) agreement of its own,” Capt. Ron Galaviz said.
He directed the Capital Chronicle to Braun’s order, adding, “The Indiana State Police works very closely with all its law enforcement partners at the local, county, state, and federal levels.”
Conservative dissent
As the Trump administration pushes for a daily arrest quota of 3,000, splinters have emerged among the president’s supporters.
“I have people they call me. They’re like, ‘I’m not sure if my crew is going to show up for work Monday morning, because if there’s a raid, or something like that, right?” U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana said last week, the Wall Street Journal reported.

“If you try to deport all of them, you’re gonna crash the economy,” Stutzman, a rancher, continued. He represents the Third District in northeast Indiana.
The House Freedom Caucus member later wrote on X that he’d “never support giving someone who crossed our border illegally citizenship, amnesty, or the right to vote.” Then, he quoted Trump: “If a farmer is willing to vouch for these people, in some way, we’re going to have to say that’s going to be good.”
Stutzman’s office didn’t return interview requests. But his remarks — and cosponsorship of a bipartisan immigration reform bill — prompted hundreds of critiques from conservative commenters and others.
Micah Clark, the executive director of the American Family Association’s Indiana chapter, called on Stutzman to “remove his name” from the bill while the “national security risks, criminals, traffickers, and other problems facing us from 4 years of an open border are addressed first.”
“This congressional majority should govern with the mandate voters gave them on this issue and set aside what some special interests seem to want — cheap labor,” Clark wrote in a Wednesday newsletter.
When asked about any impacts of the deportation push on Indiana Farm Bureau members, National Affairs Director Brantley Seifers emphasized the value of a temporary agricultural worker visa program, particularly to specialty crop growers.
“The workers our members employ via the H-2A program are essential to that goal, and INFB will continue to advocate against the overregulation that continues to burden farmers who participate in the program,” he continued.
The Indiana Farm Bureau “ha(s)n’t heard of any of our members being impacted by raids, but that’s not to say it hasn’t happened,” spokeswoman Heidi Gant added.
The Indiana Chamber of Commerce declined to provide an interview or comment.
State-level officials have largely applauded stepped-up immigration enforcement.
“For too long, Hoosier communities have borne the burden of open-border policies, facing increased crime, human trafficking, and strain on our schools, hospitals, and other taxpayer-funded resources,” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said in a statement last week. “Using Camp Atterbury to securely detain illegal aliens pending immigration proceedings or deportation sends a clear message: Indiana will not tolerate lawlessness.”
Rokita said his office “stands ready” to back up federal efforts.
Advocates mobilize
The Indiana Latino Democratic Caucus began as a way to encourage political participation but has pivoted to “coordinat(ing) a statewide response to the emergency needs of the Latinos,” according to organization President Karla Lopez-Owens.
“Everybody feels it: this is different,” she said. “It’s unforgiving. It’s cruel.”
The group published a bilingual “Find an ICE detainee” guide, she said, and in the weeks since, they’ve been printed out and distributed to churches, coffee shops and other community spaces.

Lopez-Owens is also a cofounder of the Indiana Undocumented Youth Alliance, which recently launched a rapid response team. About 250-300 volunteers have been trained on best practices when encountering or spotting ICE officers, she said.
The alliance also plans to publish a list of reputable immigration attorneys to combat scams. And it maintains a legal defense fund, which Lopez-Owens dubbed a “very small lifeline.”
“The need far exceeds what’s available, and it wasn’t like this before,” she said. “… It’s not even about preparation, because we’re way past that point. It’s about mitigation and supporting the needs on a day-by-day basis.”
The alliance isn’t the only group struggling to meet need.
Immigrant Welcome Center Executive Director Gurinder Kaur said some clients who are self-deporting have requested travel aid, but there is no funding to support them.

They also placed a question on the 2026 ballot rolling back abortion rights that voters enshrined in the state constitution in November. 
It’s not the first time the GOP-dominated legislature overturned voter-approved laws in recent years. But this time, the backlash could have long-lasting consequences.  
In the short term, proponents of the paid sick leave law are eyeing a new initiative petition to reinstate the benefit in the state constitution, while abortion-rights supporters expect to raise millions to fend off a new ban. 
But another coalition hopes to go even further. 
Respect Missouri Voters, a bipartisan constellation of organizations, this month submitted 38 versions of a new initiative petition seeking to undermine the legislature’s ability to overturn voter-approved measures. 
Most would require 80% of the legislature to agree before a law or constitutional amendment enacted by initiative petition could be revised or repealed. They also would prohibit the legislature from making the initiative and referendum process more difficult. 
The group’s PAC reported $200,000 cash on hand on July 1, with another $170,000 in large donations since then. That includes $10,000 from former Republican U.S. Sen. John Danforth. 
“This is our one shot,” said Benjamin Singer, CEO of one of the coalition’s members, Show Me Integrity. “If we don’t act now, they’ll succeed in silencing us forever.”
Missouri Gov. Kehoe signs bill repealing paid sick leave 

Republicans have taken notice, with some pondering a preemptive strike to change the initiative petition process before any campaign gets off the ground. But others worry it may already be too late and wonder if the GOP overplayed its hand with its recent moves.
“The legislature doesn’t really seem to understand, they’ve kicked the hornet’s nest,” said James Harris, a veteran Republican consultant in Missouri. “We may be about to cross the rubicon… where the legislature loses a lot of its power.”
The showdown is decades in the making. 
After Missourians approved a constitutional amendment to limit taxes in the 1980s, the Democratic-led legislature tried to make changes to the initiative petition process that were criticized at the time by GOP Gov. John Ashcroft as an attempt to silence voters. He ultimately vetoed the bill. 
In 1999, Missouri voters rejected a ballot measure that would have allowed concealed carry of firearms. Despite the defeat, the legislature revisited the issue after Republicans took the majority and ultimately passed a concealed carry bill in 2003.
Voters passed a ballot measure in 2010 called the “Puppy Mill Cruelty and Prevention Act” that specified appropriate living conditions for breeding operations with at least 10 female breeding dogs. It also capped the number of animals that a business could use for breeding at 50.
Soon after, lawmakers passed a bill that peeled back key parts of the new law, including the cap on the number of breeding dogs.
The puppy mill vote inspired advocates to forgo changes to state law and instead put their focus on putting policy changes in the state constitution — making it much harder for lawmakers to make changes because it would require another statewide vote. 
In subsequent years, voters approved constitutional amendments legalizing marijuana, expanding Medicaid eligibility,  creating a nonpartisan redistricting plan and repealing a ban on abortion. 
But the GOP supermajority wasn’t ready to quit without a fight. 
Lawmakers refused to fund Medicaid expansion until the Missouri Supreme Court said they had no choice. They pushed through a ballot measure of their own, approved by voters, that repealed the nonpartisan redistricting plan. 
Next year, voters will weigh in on an amendment passed by the legislature putting the state’s abortion ban back in place. The paid sick leave expansion was not a constitutional amendment, allowing lawmakers to repeal it without a new statewide vote. 
“I don’t understand the legislature’s strategy at all,” said Sean Nicholson, a progressive strategist who has worked on numerous initiative petition campaigns in Missouri. “A very pro-Trump electorate spoke very clearly on abortion rights and paid sick leave in November. And now we head into a midterm, and we’ve seen in Missouri and other states that shenanigans from politicians become part of the story. The legislature has given voters plenty of motivation to double down on what they’ve already said.”
Missouri Republicans shut down Senate debate to pass abortion ban, repeal sick leave law

Republicans, who held legislative super majorities as these progressive ballot measures have been approved by voters, have long complained that out-of-state money from anonymous sources have largely fueled these initiative petition campaigns. 
They’ve vowed for years to make it harder to change the constitution through the initiative petition process, but the push always fizzled amidst GOP infighting or other legislative priorities. 
The threat of an initiative petition that would weaken the legislature’s hand in the process has reignited calls for Republicans to take action quickly. The Missouri Freedom Caucus, a group of right-wing legislators who regularly quarrel with GOP leadership, is calling on Gov. Mike Kehoe to convene a special legislative session to change the initiative petition process. 
“Missouri’s Constitution should not be up for sale to the highest left-wing bidder,” the group said in a statement last week. “Without immediate reform, left-wing activists will continue to use this loophole to force their unpopular agenda on Missouri citizens with a mere 51% of the vote.”
Whether Missourians will get another chance to vote on paid sick leave is still up in the air. 
Missouri’s law allowed employees to earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, starting May 1. By the time it’s officially repealed, 17 weeks will have elapsed. That means someone working 40 hours a week could have earned 22 hours of paid sick leave.
If workers don’t use their paid sick leave before Aug. 28, there’s no legal guarantee they can do so afterward.
The sick leave expansion was a “job killer,” said Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, adding that “one-size-fits-all mandates threaten growth.”
Richard Von Glahn, policy director of Missouri Jobs with Justice, which advocated for the paid sick leave ballot measure, noted 58% of voters approved the proposal. It was also upheld unanimously by the Missouri Supreme Court. 
“Now workers may again face the reality of having no paid sick time to take care of their families without losing out on a check,” Von Glahn said shortly after the governor signed the paid sick leave repeal earlier this month. “This move by the Missouri legislature sets a dangerous precedent for democratic processes in our state.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-618211822-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 07:57:23.627213

But there’s a catch,Feleecia Guillen,,,,,https://missouriindependent.com/2025/07/28/more-americans-can-get-compensated-for-nuclear-poisoning-but-theres-a-catch/,"This July marked 80 years since the U.S. government detonated the first atomic bomb in the desert of southern New Mexico, marking the start of the nuclear age — and an ongoing nightmare for the people who call the area home. That test, known as Trinity, blanketed rural communities in radioactive fallout. No one was […]","A sign warns of radioactive material at the West Lake Landfill. Thousands of tons of nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project were dumped there in the 1970s (Theo Welling/Riverfront Times).This July marked 80 years since the U.S. government detonated the first atomic bomb in the desert of southern New Mexico, marking the start of the nuclear age — and an ongoing nightmare for the people who call the area home.
That test, known as Trinity, blanketed rural communities in radioactive fallout. No one was warned. No one was evacuated. Families drank radioactive rainwater, breathed in ash, and were left to carry the burden in silence.
Now, for the first time in history, those communities will finally be acknowledged.
Earlier versions of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), originally passed in 1990, offered compensation to “downwinders” impacted by nuclear testing in Nevada and to others who’d worked as uranium miners before 1971. But New Mexicans and other long suffering communities were left out.
But now that law, which expired last year, has been renewed and expanded to include New Mexico’s Trinity downwinders, post-1971 uranium mine workers, and other affected communities in Missouri, Tennessee, Alaska, Kentucky, and beyond.
But this long-overdue justice comes with a gut punch: the RECA expansion is buried inside Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” the GOP budget that slashes Medicaid, SNAP, and rural health care — lifelines for the very people this bill claims to protect — to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.
This is not justice.
I come from generations of Nuevomexicanos who’ve lived and worked on these lands for decades. Both of my grandparents have battled cancer. And while we may never get a clear answer, we can’t help but wonder if it was because of exposure to the radioactive legacy that’s haunted New Mexico for generations.
These aren’t isolated stories. They’re echoed across our pueblos, acequias, and towns. From the Navajo Nation, where uranium miners were sent underground without protection, to the 1979 Church Rock disaster — the worst nuclear spill in U.S. history — our communities have borne the brunt of nuclear colonialism while being erased from the story.
When RECA was passed in 1990, it excluded us. Even as cancers and birth defects multiplied, even as we buried our elders and our children, we were told our suffering didn’t count. When the program expired in 2024, it slammed the door shut on new claims.
Now, with a revival of RECA on the table, it’s a historic moment. But the same bill that expands RECA also threatens to strip millions of people of their basic health care.
I crunched the numbers in a new fact sheet for the Institute for Policy Studies.
In the 16 RECA-eligible states alone, I found that this bill will rip health insurance away from over 3.9 million people — including 103,719 in New Mexico, the very state whose residents were sacrificed to build the U.S. nuclear empire.
The total figure includes over 1.4 million people losing Medicaid coverage and another 2.5 million losing Affordable Care Act coverage. On top of that, a total of 240 rural hospitals in these states are considered at risk of closing.
These are not just numbers — they are lives. Aging uranium miners. Downwinders living in remote, medically underserved areas. Elders in rural towns who have no alternative when their hospital closes.
This bill gives with one hand and takes away with the other. That’s not justice — it’s policy murder.
I welcome the long-overdue recognition of downwinders from New Mexico and other impacted communities in RECA. But what does that mean if those same people are losing access to health care? Many rely on Medicaid and rural hospitals. If those lifelines vanish, how will they get diagnosed, let alone treated?
Even this “win” is short-lived: RECA would only be extended until the end of 2028, far too little time to reach, enroll, and support impacted communities.
Justice must come with real care. We shouldn’t have to trade one harm for another. We deserve compensation without compromise. RECA should be expanded for longer — without compromising Medicaid or rural health care.
We demand justice without sacrifice.

Shelia Stubbs for her efforts calling attention to the violence Black women and girls face. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)For the third session in a row, State Rep. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison) is calling on Wisconsin lawmakers to create a task force to examine the violence African American women and girls face and develop policy solutions to prevent others from going missing and being murdered.
The bill would establish a 17-member task force to produce a report on the issue. Members would include two Senators, two Assembly representatives and other stakeholders, along with law enforcement representatives and representatives from advocacy or legal organizations, including those that focus on Black women and girls. 
“This is my third time to try and get a critical piece of legislation passed into law,” Stubbs said at a press conference Friday. 
Stubbs, inspired by a similar task force in Minnesota and one focused on Indigenous women in Wisconsin, first introduced the proposal during the 2021-2023 legislative session, but it failed to gain traction. The second iteration of the bill, during the 2023-25 session, passed the Assembly but stalled in the Senate as former Sen. Duey Stroebel initially refused to allow the bill to move forward. It eventually received a public hearing and was approved by a committee but never advanced to a vote on the Senate floor. 
“Can anyone tell me why this critical legislation could not get scheduled? Can you tell these families why their loved one was not important enough to at least get a hearing?” Stubbs asked at the press conference. “It is not fair to these victims and their families that they have to continue to wait for this Legislature to do something.” 
Stubbs said Wisconsin has the “worst disparity in the nation” when it comes to Black women and girls being killed. A 2022 investigation by the Guardian found five Black women and girls were killed each day in the U.S. in 2020. Wisconsin was the worst in the country, with the rate doubling that year. 
Coauthors on the new bill include Rep. Pat Snyder (R-Weston), Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) and LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee). 
“I’m demanding that we get an answer,” Stubbs said. “I am demanding that we get justice. How many more victims do we need in this state before we do something?”
Stubbs was joined at the press conference by Sheena Scarborough, mother of 19-year-old Sade Robinson, who was murdered last year.
“The things that we have gone through as a family,” Scarborough said. “They stand behind me knowing exactly what it’s like being a victim of a severe traumatic crime in the worst possible way… We are still dealing with ongoing trauma daily.” 
A jury found Maxwell Anderson guilty last month of murdering and dismembering Robinson, who had gone on a first date with him in 2024. Anderson’s sentencing is this week. 
Scarborough said there wasn’t enough support as she dealt with law enforcement and navigated the criminal justice system for the first time following her daughter’s murder. The lack of support  pushed her to start the Sade’s Voice Foundation, she said. The nonprofit was formed to advocate and provide  support for the families of missing Black women and girls.
“There weren’t many other supports through this time…. It doesn’t matter if you are Republican or Democrat. These are our babies. This was my daughter. She was a granddaughter. She was a sister. She had her whole life ahead of her,” Scarborough said. “The task force is definitely needed.”
The task force would examine several related issues. They include systemic causes of the violence Black women and girls experience, the appropriate methods for tracking and collecting data on violence against Black women and girls, government practices including policing related to investigating and prosecuting crimes against Black women and girls, measures that could reduce violence against them and ways to support victims and their families.
The final report, which would be due by 2027, would need to recommend policies and practices that would be effective in reducing gender violence and increasing the safety of Black women and girls and help victims and communities to heal from violence.
Angela Arrington, the social action coordinator for Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., said that  the task force could help address the persistent violence that Black women and girls face. 
“They are more likely to experience homicide, sexual assault and other forms of violence than their white counterparts, and these cases often go unsolved or receive less attention,” Arrington said. “The epidemic of violence is a complex issue with deep-rooted historical and systemic causes requiring comprehensive and coordinated action to address.” 
Attorney General Josh Kaul said lawmakers are needed to establish a task force and that a state investment must be included.
Kaul and Gov. Tony Evers included creating a task force in their budget proposals, but the Republican-led Joint Finance Committee did not include it in the final proposal. 
“People are ready to step up,” Kaul said. “The problem now is not whether there is interest among folks in collaborating and working to identify solutions. What we need is legislative will. We need the legislators and the Senate and the Assembly to pass legislation that will help ensure we have this task force… It’s clear that there is a need not just for action, but for there to be an investment so that we can seriously consider these issues.” 
He alluded to the new budget approved earlier this month that was celebrated as a bipartisan compromise by legislative leaders and Gov. Tony Evers.
“The Legislature was so close to passing legislation that would help us move forward on this issue, but we’ve seen there’s an opportunity for some compromise in this legislative session,” Kaul said. 
The bill includes one position supported with state funding of $80,200 in 2025-26 and $99,500 in 2026-27. 
Kaul said the additional Department of Justice employee would be essential to coordinate the work of the task force, including gathering data that may be needed. 
A similar task force focused on Indigenous women and girls was formed in 2020 by Kaul after legislation failed. Kaul started that task force without state funding by using federal funding from the Violence Against Women Act. He said at the press conference that the agency doesn’t have funding  for a similar pathway for the proposed new task force. 
The 2023 version of the bill did not include funding when it passed the Assembly. 
“This is a really significant issue that takes the investment of time and resources, and I don’t want to see a group come together without having the resources they need to be successful,” Kaul told reporters. “I want to see this done properly and right and that’s what this bill would do.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.



The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)August could be interesting if Montanans concerned about the course of our federal government will reach out soon to our four-member congressional delegation.
The Senate and the House calendars call for them to be in recess between Aug. 4 and Sept. 1 – adequate time for at least one or two town hall meetings. Each member of our delegation – Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke – has a section of their official websites for scheduling requests. And each has local offices around the state one can visit or call for information. 
Good places to start. 
With House Speaker Mike Johnson shutting down that chamber a week early, we might expect Downing and Zinke to have even more time back home. 
But there are obstacles. Congressmen are under orders from Republican leadership not to hold in-person town hall meetings with their constituents. Our team has been avoiding them like the plague.
Call-in imitations of town hall meetings are now the standard where questions are screened and controlled in advance with no opportunity for follow-up. But not that they are plentiful. Downing, for example, has been able to spare three entire hours since taking his seat in January to speak at his constituents en masse.
Daines and Sheehy boast they are proud to meet with constituents one-on-one — thousands of them, they say. But how do ordinary Montanans figure out how to meet up with them? A chance encounter at a fund-raiser? 
All four of them are frequent guests of Fox television talk-show hosts, especially Laura Ingraham and Larry Kudlow on Fox Business. We might ask, what do those people have that the people who put our quartet into office don’t have? 
There is much to discuss, beyond question. 
I can understand the fear apparently being felt by the delegation, even by the three men who are so proud of their warrior status as SEALS and in combat search-and-rescue, and the fourth member who honed his skills with 28 years of private-sector business experience. 
But guys – give us a chance, would you? 
No member of our delegation provides their schedules publicly. Montana congressmen used to, you know, both Republicans and Democrats. Restricting schedule information began when Greg Gianforte and Daines sequentially held the single House seat, according to a long-time state political observer.
It is reasonable that during the recess each member will want to spend private family time, and have some commitments and fund-raisers already scheduled – the latter particularly for Daines and Downing who have started their 2026 reelection campaigns.
However, it is also reasonable to assume each one would have time available to accept an invitation to speak with a citizen group, even perhaps outside of their own perceived comfort zone. 
If our congressmen deem their constituents as deserving of interacting directly with them, it is important we commit ourselves to respectful and orderly events.
For the sake of our collective civic health in Montana, we cannot go on with the intolerable situation of our congressional representatives stiff-arming our requests to meet face-to-face with them. Somebody must blink – if our four representatives will not change their practices, then it is up to we citizens to make the effort to try to forge a better way forward for all of us.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-31-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

Brown — a staunch pro-lifer — has been a fixture in the Senate Republican caucus since 2014. But now high-profile GOP Hoosiers like U.S. Sen. Jim Banks and Attorney General Todd Rokita have put her in the crosshairs for 2026.
And they appear to have found their man — former Allen County councilman and current Northwest Allen County Schools board member Darren Vogt, according to several Allen County sources.
Brown has known Vogt for more than 20 years. She defeated him in the 2014 primary for her current seat. Since then, he has supported Brown — hosting a fundraiser, endorsing her in a congressional run and even inviting her to his son’s wedding.
“It’s rather sudden,” she said.
Brown hasn’t had a primary since her 2014 run.
Vogt declined to talk to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, saying only “I’m strongly considering and will be making an announcement soon.”
Immigration
The focus started when Rokita called out Brown for not hearing a stringent immigration bill during the legislative session. As the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she has the power to choose which bills get heard. Ultimately, the legislation died.
On June 3, Rokita posted on X that Brown ignored “repeated warnings that sheriffs needed stronger statutory direction on their obligations to detain illegal aliens. She refused to hear (House Bill) 1531 and deprived her colleagues of the chance to do their jobs and vote on common sense immigration legislation.”
Brown, who is also an attorney, ultimately filed a disciplinary action against Rokita.
Banks – who Brown challenged for his old congressional seat in 2016 — replied, “Liz should be primaried.”

Brown told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that law enforcement came to her with concerns on that bill, which would have required them to honor immigration detainer requests. Detainers are not backed by a judicial finding like a warrant.
She supported a separate immigration bill that did become law.
Brown said the Rokita immigration bill had a lot of problems that weren’t fixable.
“I think what people need to understand is some of these issues are federal issues, and I would turn to anyone who is representing us at the federal level to say, ‘hey, why haven’t you fixed this problem?’
“I think it’s fair for local sheriffs and local law enforcement to say, ‘We will be happy to assist you,’ which they’ve been doing 100%, and I fully support, but you need to make sure the procedures are being followed so we know how we can back you up.”
Some think Vogt has a good chance at winning, despite the support she will likely have from the Senate Majority Campaign Committee and their coffers.
Brandon Seifert — a Huntertown councilman — said Brown has been around “Indianapolis liberals” for too long.
He noted she is still extremely conservative on the issue of life and abortion.
“But the other core conservative issues … she’s just lost her way. She has completely lost her way.”
He recently shared several text ads on his Facebook page questioning the immigration decision as well as two previous votes by Brown in recent years. They are paid for by Hoosier Leadership for America — a nonprofit that was established in 2024.
The group has a Huntertown P.O. Box. The incorporator is a man out of Virginia that the ICC could not locate.
Seifert said he is not behind the group and doesn’t know who is. But he said their points are valid.
He is disappointed that Brown is no longer the attack dog of the Republican Party that she used to be. He has supported her in the past and she is his senator.
“It’s gonna be a heck of a race. I’ve given my support to Darren 100% and am fully behind him, because we need a change, and he’s the one to be that change.”
Other issues

Brown also voted against a bill to ban transgender Hoosiers from high school sports in 2022. She did support a college ban this year.
Browns’s conservative credentials have dipped recently, according to two GOP rankings.
The Conservative Political Action Conference issues annual rankings of lawmakers. In 2019, Brown’s score was 85% and has since dropped to 61% in 2023.
GOP-aligned Americans for Prosperity also issues scorecards. Her ranking in 2022 was 100 and dropped to 86 and 78 in the next two years.
Donors behind the Hoosier Leadership for America nonprofit are shielded under law — but if it were organized as a political action committee, they would be public.
The Internal Revenue Service says on its site that “The promotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office. However, a section 501(c)(4) social welfare organization may engage in some political activities, so long as that is not its primary activity.”
But Marjorie Hershey, professor emeritus of political science at Indiana University, said there is no enforcement against these dark money groups. That means they can hide donor identities who might want to avoid the scrutiny of supporting a candidate or issue.
And she noted the U.S. Supreme Court has erred on the side of free speech, likening spending on campaigns as speech.
“All of this has been just a steady weakening of the original purpose of this stuff,” she said. “Because, you know, as they say, money will find a way.”
As for Brown, she is ready for a fight.
“I’m committed to running again. I have been a strong advocate for northeast Indiana and the conservative values of our district up here,” she said.

This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th.  Meet Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A growing number of Americans — more than 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4 — have served as a family caregiver for a loved one in the past year. The figure is a jump of 20 million Americans compared to a decade ago, according to findings released Thursday by AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC).
The surge is due to a confluence of factors, including Americans living longer but in some instances, in poorer health. That is requiring more people to engage in the work of family caregiving. There is also a growing recognition of who is a family caregiver — or a person providing care to an adult or child with a complex medical condition or disability, often without pay.
The report finds that these caregivers are managing financial risks, their own poor health and isolation. As in a previous iteration of the survey, roughly 60 percent of family caregivers are women. Women, LGBTQ+ caregivers, and those who felt they had no choice in becoming caregivers are significantly more likely to report feeling alone.
“We need systems that see caregivers, value them and support them — because they are not just helping families, they are holding up our entire health care system,” said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, CEO of AARP. “This impacts all of us because most of us will be a caregiver or need one at some point in our lives. And too often, people don’t realize that they are a caregiver until they’re already overwhelmed and unsupported.”
Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences because of their growing responsibilities. They’re draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing. One in 5 report that their own health is fair or poor.
The “Caregiving in the U.S. 2025” report, which surveyed nearly 7,000 caregivers nationwide, also finds nearly 1 in 3 family caregivers are part of the “sandwich generation” of caregivers who raise children while simultaneously caring for adults in their lives.
“This dual responsibility is a recipe for burnout and requires solutions that recognize caregiving happens across the lifespan,” said Jason Resendez, CEO of NAC. “It’s time to recognize and value this continuum of care that we all experience and benefit from, and the responsibilities themselves are becoming more complex and more intensive.”
During a media call Thursday, AARP and NAC shared the story of Alma Valencia, a woman from Pasadena, California, who has cared for her mother for the past 10 years. Valencia’s mother has dementia. Valencia said she eventually left her career to become her mother’s full-time caregiver. That meant losing a stable salary and benefits, and isolation.
“Like so many others, I didn’t plan for this,” she said. “I stepped into the role because someone I love needed me.”
The report shows 65 percent of family caregivers now help with at least one activity of daily living, including intimate tasks like bathing, dressing and feeding. Over half say they’re performing complex medical and nursing tasks that once primarily took place in clinics and hospitals, including administering injections and managing medical equipment. But only 11 percent of family caregivers say they’ve received training for basic caregiving tasks — and just 22 percent get any training for complex medical and nursing tasks.
Both AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving are calling for federal policies that include national paid family and medical leave, a federal tax credit to bring relief to out-of-pocket costs and greater access to respite care, training and support services, as well as stronger workplace protections that recognize caregiving responsibilities.
These organizations have been advocating for these policies in joint reports for years, but now they come amid a changing federal landscape. President Donald Trump this month signed a tax and budget law that is estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over 10 years. Nearly eight million family caregivers rely on Medicaid for their own health care coverage, according to Resendez.
Resendez said advocates are seeing progress at the state level, with several establishing paid family leave policies or advancing caregiver tax credits and long-term care insurance programs.
“This is an issue that continues to build strength and visibility, and this report helps to put numbers behind the urgency for that continuing, and for translating that into solid action,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/long-term-care-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

(File photo courtesy of Tracy Brooks/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)As Idaho changes to a totally new method for counting wolves, officials with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game have increased the state’s 2023 wolf population estimate they reported publicly last year.
Officials increased the 2023 wolf population estimate by 85 wolves, an increase of about 7%, state officials confirmed.
The change comes as Idaho is seeking to reduce the number of wolves in the state and as some outside researchers have stressed the importance of an accurate wolf count.
During the July 2024 Idaho Fish and Game Commission meeting, state officials estimated Idaho’s 2023 wolf population at 1,150 wolves as of Aug. 1.
Ghost wolves: As Idaho aims to reduce its wolf population, advocates worry counts aren’t accurate

But during an interview Wednesday at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s Boise headquarters, Wildlife Bureau Chief Shane Roberts and Wildlife Research Manager Matt Mumma told the Idaho Capital Sun officials are no longer using the 1,150 estimate.
Instead, they have increased the Aug. 1, 2023 wolf population estimate to 1,235 wolves.
The change was made after Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials added four additional measurements to the new method the state uses to estimate the wolf population, Roberts and Mumma said. 
“The new estimates are better and more accurate than the other ones, which were likely slightly off,” Mumma said Thursday. 
“Through simulation, we determined that the addition of these metrics improved the accuracy of the model,” Mumma added.
Jeff Abrams, a wildlife program associate for the Idaho Conservation League, said the state should be as precise and transparent as possible in its wolf estimates and use conservative figures for the number of nonbreeding wolves and the amount of lone wolves used in statistical models.
“Generally, we believe they should be more conservative – based on research previously cited in (the department’s) own wolf management plan,” Abrams said. “We believe folks should take a closer look at fundamental assumptions the agency is feeding into their new model.”

Roberts said the state’s new model for estimating wolves uses a wide range of options and does not rely on static assumptions. 
Even with the revision, Mumma said the state’s numbers are still well within a 95% credible interval and Roberts said the larger overall population trends reported since 2019 have not changed. 
“The overall trend since 2019 is down, but in the last three years of estimates, it’s fairly stable,” Roberts said.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials provided the revised 2023 wolf population estimate after the Idaho Capital Sun requested follow up information about changes to the new wolf population estimation method on July 18.
Officials estimate the wolf population in Idaho because wolves are too elusive and Idaho is too rugged and remote for the state officials to physically count every wolf.
Overall, the state says the wolf population is on a downward trend from 2019-2020, when more than 1,600 wolves were estimated. Last year, Idaho’s wolf population decreased by almost 100 wolves from 2023 to 2024, state officials said earlier this month. 
 Idaho officials also recently changed date they report the wolf population estimates

The change in metrics is part of a much larger overhaul of how Idaho counts its wolf population. From 2019 to 2023, the state used trail cameras to estimate Idaho’s wolf population. 
Then in July 2024, Roberts announced the state switched to a new method that uses age and genetic data taken from a tooth from every dead wolf checked by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game each year. State officials call the new method the ABC method, short for Approximate Bayesian Computation. 
After switching from trail cams to age and genetic data from teeth, the state also switched when it reported Idaho’s wolf population estimates. 

For years, Idaho reported its wolf population as of Aug. 1.
But last week when Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials presented the 2024 wolf population estimate, they switched the reporting date to May, the Sun previously reported. 
The change makes a difference because of wolf population dynamics. The new May numbers are likely to show higher wolf populations than the previous August estimates. 
For example, the state’s ABC method estimated the 2024 wolf population higher in May, at 1,235, but lower in August, when it was projected to be 1,140, according to data provided by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.
The new May estimate sets the state’s wolf official population estimate at its highest point in the year, right after when the new pups are born in the spring. Throughout the rest of the year, the wolf population declines as wolves are killed by hunters and die of natural causes until the population reaches a low point in the spring just before new pups are born. That means a population estimate tied to May — when the state’s new wolf population data is reported — would always be expected to be higher than a population estimate tied to August, which was when the state’s previous estimate was based on.
Roberts said he understands moving the date from August to May may cause some confusion, but he said state officials moved the date to May because they believe the new ABC method is most accurate right after pups are born because one of the factors the ABC model estimates is new litters. 
On the other hand, Roberts said the state believed the old Aug. 1 date was the most accurate date to use for trail cams because state officials actually deployed the cameras during the months of July and August. 
Moving forward, Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials submitted their new ABC method for consideration for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Roberts told the Sun Idaho that the Idaho Department of Fish and Game plans to consistently use the May numbers going forward.
 Idaho seeks to reduce the wolf state’s wolf population

These changes to how Idaho counts its wolves are happening as Idaho is in the middle of a six-year plan to reduce the state’s wolf population by more than 60%. The 2023-2028 Idaho Gray Wolf Management Plan calls for reducing Idaho’s wolf population down to an average of about 500 wolves, with a low of about 350 wolves, driven largely by human hunting of wolves.

Some outside researchers have questioned the state’s previous trail cam wolf population methods and told the Idaho Capital Sun the accuracy of Idaho’s wolf population is extremely important as Idaho reduces its wolf population. 
Abrams, a wildlife program associate with Idaho Conservation League, said Thursday he supports the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, which is commonly referred to as IDFG, switching away from trail cameras and trying to improve the way the state estimates wolf populations.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game estimates Idaho’s wolf population decreased to 1,235

“It’s helpful that IDFG wants to improve the way they estimate wolf abundance,” Abrams said. “This is something (the Idaho Conservation League) and many others have encouraged the agency to do in the past. Idahoans want wolves to be managed responsibly and not have populations jeopardized. It benefits everyone to have accurate estimates of how many wolves we have. It’s important that the public has trust in this process.”
Abrams said he is happy the state is submitting its new ABC method to a peer-reviewed journal. But Abrams said the state should be as precise and transparent as it can be in how it estimates the wolf population. 
“However, we do still have some questions on basic assumptions used in the new model about pack size,” Abrams said. 
Abrams also called for the Idaho Department of FIsh and Game to resume publishing wolf reports every year that include detailed data about wolf population characteristics, harvest and hunting data, livestock depredation and more. Abrams said he hasn’t seen the state release a detailed annual wolf report of this kind since the 2016 Idaho Wolf Management Report.
“The department could make another improvement by getting back to publishing an annual wolf report, so the public understands how close IDFG may be getting toward their management target,” Abrams said. “They haven’t done this in almost 10 years.”
Abrams said he is concerned about how close the state could be getting each year to its wolf population management goal and he wonders what the mid-winter population low-points are for wolves. Abrams said the new May population estimate the state releases doesn’t provide that information to the public because the May estimate reports Idaho’s wolf population at its highest point each year, right after pups are born in the spring. 
“The (Idaho Fish and Game) Commission itself also said just last year, the agency needs to be careful about overshooting their management goal,” Abrams said. 
Roberts said the reason the Idaho Department of Fish and Game switched to the new ABC method is because they want to be as accurate as possible and realized the old trail cam method would be less accurate as the number of wolves decreased.
“Part of the reason, as we mentioned in last year’s presentation, that we switched methods to the ABC is because our own research suggested that the camera method was going to become less reliable as we were able to get fewer pictures of wolves,” Roberts said. “So that was a big impetus for the switch.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Ryan Walters and his merry band of administrative leaders should not be operating the State Department of Education like their own private fiefdom, oblivious to the laws that govern public access.
Yet our state superintendent and those leaders he’s entrusted to serve us appear to be happily doing just that in denying access to one of the most basic records that’s long been released through our state’s Open Records Act — resignation letters.
And Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office, which is supposed to help enforce open records laws, has strangely — and inexplicably — been sitting on the sidelines like a stupified observer as this continues to play out.
Walters has seen a number of senior employees exit stage left for greener pastures. He also leads an agency whose administrators have proven that they’re not the strongest champions of laws that govern public access. After all, they lost a lawsuit that accused agency leaders of violating First Amendment rights related to public meeting access and face another that contends the Education Department is not complying with the Open Records Act.
The latest dustup involves a request Oklahoma Voice filed earlier this year seeking access to all employee resignation letters submitted since Jan. 1. The agency issued a blanket denial, citing a provision of law that it claims bars the release to protect employee privacy and one that allows public bodies to keep documents private if they pertain to an internal personnel investigation.
As far as we can tell, there’s no indication that any of these employees are subject to any investigation, and for any state agency to inaccurately cite a provision of law inferring such would be reckless and potentially damaging to someone’s reputation. One would also hope that there weren’t personnel investigations into multiple high-level employees because that would indicate Walters’ is making really bad hires.
Normally resignation letters are as dry as parched earth, and pretty much every other state agency I can think of typically releases them without issue. Even the State Department of Education used to do so without batting an eye. 
I’ve never seen a blanket denial like this.
That’s why it’s so odd that the Department of Education has chosen this hill to die on, and that Drummond’s office, which lawmakers have empowered to help the public fight for open records access, has sat idly by, seemingly wringing its hands.
A recently leaked scathing resignation letter may shine some light on why the Education Department is so reluctant to release them. 
The Education Department’s former chief compliance officer wrote in her resignation letter that the agency has “fundamental operational issues” and “senior leadership attitudes” that will need to be addressed in order to “achieve the outcomes that Oklahoma students deserve.”
She also leveled accusations of “manipulation of school accreditation and deleting employee review processes,” but did not include specifics.
In short, the letter portrays a very unflattering portrait of the inner workings of an agency that receives over $3.8 billion in annual state appropriations and raises questions about its operational integrity. 
That’s something the public deserves to know. And it’s why the access to resignation letters should be an undisputed right.
Our state is one that believes — or at least used to — that “people are vested with the inherent right to know and be fully informed about their government.” And that access to government records helps Oklahomans “efficiently and intelligently exercise their inherent political power.”
That’s straight from the state’s Open Records Act. It’s also why Oklahoma agencies have done the right thing and provided resignation letters without argument, particularly for high-ranking officials.
It boggles the mind that the Attorney General’s Office, which is supposed to have a public records ombudsman to fight for public access, has refused to intervene in this issue and insist upon their release. It’s even stranger because last year, Drummond took a swipe at Walters following what he called an “alarming number of complaints” of his agency’s poor compliance with the state’s records act and sent a sign he wasn’t going to stand for it.
But ahead of the publication of our story highlighting our records battle, the Attorney General’s Office and its “public access counselor” refused to comment or address our complaint because of a pending lawsuit involving a single resignation letter. 
I could see not releasing a single letter that’s subject to litigation, but to allow an agency to issue a blanket denial to withhold all undisputed ones is nuts. There seems to be no reason Drummond couldn’t have advocated to release the rest.
Unless, that is, his office wants to keep our government shrouded in secrecy or he doesn’t believe the public should view resignation letters written by public employees.
The fight over resignation letters at the state Department of Education proves why lawmakers need to further strengthen public access laws, not water them down. If there’s any lingering doubt that these are public, maybe they need to spell it out. 
This also highlights how critical strong advocacy from the Attorney General’s Office is in this realm.
Because it’s never a good idea to give a government bureaucrat absolute power to determine if the public is entitled to records. In the wrong hands that power can lead to unintended consequences, making government less accountable and accessible to the very people it is supposed to serve.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.
Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

A draft bill that would make an exception to Wyoming's nuclear waste ban is intended to accommodate a California firm's plans to ""mass-produce"" microreactors near Casper.
The post Wyoming lawmakers consider nuclear waste storage as tensions rise over microreactor plant proposal appeared first on WyoFile .","Lawmakers will consider draft legislation this week that would allow manufacturers of “advanced nuclear reactors” to store high-level radioactive waste at their Wyoming facilities. It would be the second exception to a decades-long ban on nuclear fuel waste storage in Wyoming — removing a barrier to what nuclear energy proponents here say could become a lucrative new manufacturing and power production sector that also reinvigorates the state’s uranium mining industry. 
The measure faces significant public opposition, however, particularly in Natrona County, where Radiant Industries proposes to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing plant on the outskirts of Bar Nunn. The company notes the location is “actually over a mile away from any home,” and meets the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s distance requirements. Many residents object to Radiant’s plan to house spent nuclear fuel waste on site — a location they say is too close to homes, schools and businesses.
“Bar Nunn does not want nuclear waste,” Midwest Republican Rep. Bill Allemand told a crowd of about 200 on Thursday evening in Bar Nunn, citing his own polling of constituents in House District 58. “We want manufacturing. We would love for Radiant to come here and manufacture and put the waste somewhere else.”
Such declarations earned raucous cheers and applause, lending credibility to Allemand’s claims that about 70% of respondents are against storing the waste.

Allemand organized the town hall, he said, because he believes state and local officials — along with Radiant — are rushing too quickly to change Wyoming law to accommodate the company’s plans. Bar Nunn residents, along with all Wyoming residents, deserve a longer conversation and an opportunity to learn about a complex and high-stakes industry before they can decide if it’s a good fit. How to impose limitations such as siting and whether to allow the industry’s radioactive waste warrant further examination, he said.
Both Allemand and Glenrock Republican Rep. Kevin Campbell urged the crowd to attend and speak up at the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee’s hearing on Wednesday in Casper, when the panel will consider the “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage” draft bill.
Neither Allemand nor Campbell serves on the Minerals Committee.
A similar piece of legislation, Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” was defeated during this year’s legislative session.
But not everyone in Bar Nunn has made up their minds about Radiant and its plans for the community. A smattering of attendees at Thursday’s event raised their hands in support of the project. Bar Nunn Mayor Peter Boyer, urged to the lectern by Allemand, gave a solemn and terse response to an apparent rumor in the community that his tentative support of the project is because he’s been bribed by Radiant.

“I’ve never taken money,” Boyer said. “I wouldn’t ever take money. I didn’t go to Iraq, serve my country for eight years, bleed, watch my friends die so I can be accused of bribery. That’s bullshit. And I’m pissed, and I’m tired of this. Everybody has been at everyone else’s throat, and that is unacceptable.”
Bar Nunn town council member Dan Sabrosky posted a comment on a Facebook post about Thursday’s event: 
“People were mad [including those] I spoke with that left early,” Sabrosky wrote. “They are tired of controlled Townhalls and being fed false information to try [to] scare them. People are educating themselves about this industry and realizing that reality tells them it’s the safest energy industry in the Country.”
Radiant and Wyoming’s nuclear waste ban
Bar Nunn, like most Natrona County communities, is well acquainted with industrial, manufacturing and tech companies. But nuclear energy is new to the entire state, where a ban on storing spent nuclear fuel has been in place for decades — despite repeated efforts to open Wyoming to commercial storage of the industry’s radioactive waste. 
Without a permanent repository in the U.S. — or an apparent path to one — critics of waste storage have long argued that if Wyoming were to allow “temporary” storage, the state would likely become a de facto permanent repository.

But lawmakers managed to carve out an exception in 2022: “Temporary” storage is allowed, but only if the radioactive waste is associated with a nuclear power plant operating in the state. Wyoming still won’t accept even a pound of the estimated 86,000 metric tons that reside at dozens of nuclear power plants across the country.
The 2022 exemption, enshrined in House Bill 131, “Nuclear power generation and storage-amendments,” was made to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. 
Similarly, the “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage” draft bill on the Minerals Committee’s schedule for Wednesday appears to have been drafted to accommodate another company’s ambitions.
California-based Radiant Industries, launched in 2019, proposes to build a microreactor manufacturing plant just outside Bar Nunn’s border. The town of 3,000 residents is located just a few miles north of Casper, home to 59,000. Radiant plans to build a 100-plus-acre campus where it will “mass produce” and fuel 1-megawatt Kaleidos microreactors, which are “designed for deployment anywhere it’s needed without the need to refuel for years,” according to the company.
Although Radiant may sell the microreactor units, it also plans to lease them, according to the company. When the units need refueling, the mobile reactors will be shipped back to Radiant’s Wyoming facility — from all over the world — and the spent fuel will be stored at the Bar Nunn campus, where it will remain until there’s a permanent federal repository to send it.
“Our microreactors will come back to our factory to have the spent fuel — which is about the volume of two Walmart gas grill propane tanks — removed and temporarily stored on site in dry casks until they can be shipped to a national repository as soon as it’s been selected,” Radiant Vice President of Communications and Marketing Ray Wert told WyoFile via email. “We’re very hopeful that the [Trump] administration will be standing up a national repository site shortly.”

Radiant also needs Wyoming lawmakers to make another exception to the state’s waste storage ban for its business plan to work here. The draft bill up for consideration this week would add “advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers” to the state’s short list of exceptions.
But critics say that’s no small departure from the 2022 exemption to the waste storage ban. 
Under the proposed legislation, Wyoming would accept radioactive fuel waste for the benefit of Radiant’s customers from across the nation and the world, giving the state’s residents an unequal portion of the burdens and risks that come with the industry, Rep. Campbell told WyoFile.
“If we do this with Radiant, we set a precedent to store nuclear waste from anywhere on the globe,” Campbell said, adding that several other companies have floated proposals to manufacture microreactors in the state.

The piecemeal additions of exceptions serve the end-goal for many longtime proponents of nuclear energy projects in the state, Campbell said: Namely, to open Wyoming’s doors for commercial nuclear waste facilities. House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” a measure to do just that, was also considered and defeated in this year’s legislative session.
“The next step is to go right back to where we were at with House Bill 16: ‘Oh, why don’t we just become the nuclear repository?'” Campbell said.
It doesn’t make sense, Campbell added, to change state laws for Radiant when the company hasn’t even submitted an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the project. Radiant plans to file an application as soon as “we’ve finalized our location,” the company told WyoFile.
Political divides emerge
Wyoming’s congressional delegation, along with Gov. Mark Gordon and top energy officials in the state, staunchly support welcoming nuclear energy endeavors to the state while chastising an inept federal bureaucracy for not building a permanent, national repository for spent nuclear fuel waste.
But political lines are being drawn on the waste issue. 
The Wyoming Freedom Caucus posted a statement on its Facebook page on Thursday declaring the group’s opposition to nuclear waste storage: “Wyoming must continue to be a leader in proven energy production, not settle as a dumping ground for nuclear waste from other states. California billionaires insist on saddling our landscapes with their windmills, their solar panels, and now their radioactive casks.”
The group’s statement also criticizes efforts to secure a $25 million grant from the Wyoming Business Council to support the buildout of water, sewer and other infrastructure to help support Radiant’s manufacturing campus, calling it a subsidy.
“Fantastical promises of huge revenues to the State, overt gaslighting, and outright lies aren’t what we use to craft policy,” the group stated.
Meantime, Natrona County resident and Natrona County School Board Trustee Kyla Alvey has launched a change.org petition to “Support Radiant and bring new energy jobs to Natrona County.”The Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee will meet Tuesday and Wednesday at the Thyra Thomson State Office Building in Casper. It is scheduled to discuss the “Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage” draft bill on Wednesday morning. The meeting will also be live streamed.

Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine could become the second rare earth extraction operation in the U.S., but the minerals face an uncertain domestic market under President Trump.
The post Republican excitement for Wyoming rare earth mining contradicts the party’s disdain for renewables appeared first on WyoFile .","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News (hyperlink to the original story), a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
At the foot of Wyoming’s Bighorn Mountains sits a mine potentially full of minerals crucial for renewable energy, yet capable of drawing praise from some of the United States’ most ardent supporters of fossil fuels. 
On July 11, the U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the former CEO of a hydraulic fracturing company, joined former West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin and Wyoming’s congressional delegation and governor, Mark Gordon, at the ribbon cutting ceremony for Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine, which could one day become just the second source of rare earth minerals in the U.S. 
But the minerals, including but not limited to scandium, gallium, germanium, praseodymium, neodymium, terbium and dysprosium, are locked up in coal, according to Ramaco — and it is that coal that has driven Republican enthusiasm for the mine. 
Rare earth minerals are critical components in a long list of technologies, including solar cells, wind turbine rotors, batteries, magnets, missiles, motors, semiconductors and smartphones. A vast majority of the world’s known critical mineral deposits lie in Asia, particularly in China.
But as Ramaco looks to bring the Brook Mine online in 2027 — July’s ribbon cutting marked the opening of a pilot plant — some wonder what kind of domestic market it will find after President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans gutted federal incentives to boost the development and manufacturing of renewable energy technologies earlier this month. 
“I would argue that a large portion of the projected need [for rare earth minerals] is in clean energy,” said Steve Feldgus, former principal deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management at the Department of the Interior. 
Despite his disdain for renewable energy, Trump has been eager to mine more rare earth minerals, signing an executive order in March expediting the permitting process for mines to extract the elements.  
Ramaco intends to sell some of the coal present in the mine, a costly form of energy and a major contributor to the climate crisis, but it should amount to less than 1% of all the coal exported from Wyoming, Jeremy Sussman, Ramaco’s chief financial officer, said in an email.
That small portion of coal didn’t stop Wright from touting the mineral as the mine’s major achievement. In a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, the secretary of energy said, “You’re going to see a lot more of big, beautiful, clean coal!” and noted that he was celebrating not only the opening of a mine for rare earth minerals, but also the first coal mine to open in Wyoming in 50 years.
Ramaco has analyzed one-third of the mineral deposit, according to a July letter to shareholders signed by CEO Randall Atkins, and Ramaco’s pilot project will test processing techniques for rare earths.
Broadly, “there is a rare earth element resource [in coal],” said Lauren Birgenheier, a professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Utah. In the Brook Mine’s case, “how excellent it is is still probably to be determined, but it appears excellent enough for them to feel like they can move forward.”

With only a third of the mine mapped and rare earth prices subject to change — Ramaco’s price estimate for scandium, a crucial component of fuels cells used in hydrogen-powered machines, was over 200% higher than the U.S. Geological Survey’s estimate of $1.2 million per metric ton — Feldgus said it was too soon to say for sure what the mine’s future holds.
“It’s still going to be a little bit longer before they can say that ‘this is actually what we’re going to mine,’” he said.
Sussman said Ramaco’s estimates were for 2028 and accounted for attempts from China “to manipulate pricing” by keeping rare earth values low, thereby “disincentivizing western projects.” He said he expects the market to improve as the U.S. tries to source rare earth minerals domestically, and pointed to a recent Department of Defense contract for neodymium at $110,000 per ton — twice the mineral’s typical spot price, according to Sussman — as evidence that the market for western critical minerals was improving.
Despite its support for policies that depress U.S. renewable energy markets, Wyoming’s congressional delegation, made up entirely of Republicans, lauded the effort to extract rare earth minerals in statements released after Ramaco’s groundbreaking ceremony.
Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso said the mine will “support American industries, and strengthen our supply chains.” Cynthia Lummis, the state’s other senator, added that the mine “will produce resources needed to achieve energy independence and grow our economy.”
But where the domestic demand for those minerals will come from is uncertain, as many of the industries they would supply face questionable near-term futures in the U.S. after Trump signed legislation earlier this month gutting many incentives for renewable energy technologies.
“The excitement over rare earths is sort of at odds with the destruction of demand for clean energy,” Feldgus said. “The magnets that a lot of these minerals go into, I mean, those are critically important for electric motors, for turbines, for anything that is built off the clean energy economy.”
The policy whiplash in the U.S. has left Sussman unfazed. “Our rare earth elements and critical minerals are vital to national defense,” he said. And those same technologies Feldgus outlined “are still projected to grow at a meaningful pace,” he said. “In fact, the [U.S. Department of Energy] projects wind capacity in the U.S. to grow from 113 [gigawatts] in 2020 to 404 [gigawatts] in [2050].”

Columnist Kerry Drake loved the thrill of taking rodeo photos in the arena. Now he writes that he’s too afraid of the traffic to even visit the park. 
The post Surviving, and occasionally thriving, during Cheyenne Frontier Days appeared first on WyoFile .","The latest edition of Cheyenne Frontier Days has been put to bed. Hundreds of volunteers who ran the “Daddy of ‘em All” can rest, retailers can count their profits, and fans — at least the ones who didn’t join the carnival or become rodeo circuit roadies — have gone home.

Opinion

And residents like me can rejoice at surviving 10 days of madness. We feel safe on the streets again, no longer dodging drivers who are even worse than we are. We can make trips to grocery stores and downtown without making battle plans.
I wasn’t always this jaded. As a photojournalist for the then-Wyoming State Tribune in the 1970s, I fully embraced my job covering Frontier Days, from pancake breakfasts and parades to afternoon rodeos and evening concerts.
I’d usually join local and traveling journalists at a bar to discuss the day’s events because, of course, we thought we knew everything. As I count down my most memorable good, bad and embarrassing moments, let’s start with one that could still get me pummeled by country music fans.
10 — The Hitching Post was our favorite place, because it had a good live house band. The only downside for my ears was a cowboy who invariably came on stage to sing the last couple of songs. That was my time to leave, because this guy was always off-key.
I am chagrined to confess it was future country superstar Chris LeDoux, a legendary rodeo competitor from Kaycee. Years later, I interviewed him and learned that he was also an amazing Western sculptor and probably the nicest man on the planet.
9 — Another faux pas, this time at the rodeo. Reporters watched for contestants leaving the arena, stopping them before they disappeared under the stands to shed their equipment.
A woman who was the Denver correspondent for the New York Times kept beating me to interviews. I’d stand around patiently to ask questions about their techniques, background, motivation, etc., while my new competitor always asked the same thing: “What’s the name of that horse (or bull) you rode?”
I couldn’t reconcile how someone writing for the nation’s most prestigious paper could ask such a lame question. The reporter was Molly Ivins, who became one of the premier political columnists and hellraisers in America. See a trend here?


8 — I’m glad Molly wasn’t around when the Frontier Days public relations committee convinced the livestock committee to name some of the bulls after local journalists. I was in the arena waiting to take a photo of my namesake busting out of the gate when I heard the confused announcer say, “Here’s so-and-so, today’s leader, riding Kerry Drake. [Long pause] Now why on Earth would someone name a bull Kerry Drake?”
Why indeed? A genuine WTF moment for everyone in the stands, the cowboy and the bull.
7 — This isn’t a “moment,” but a fashion statement. The newspaper’s mandatory dress code was a sport coat and tie, but the rodeo required us to wear a cowboy hat, long-sleeve Western shirt and cowboy boots, no exceptions. Why, Frontier Days could lose its authentic image if someone snapped a photo of us covering the event wearing a sensible T-shirt to avoid heat stroke!
But I really didn’t mind. Losing the tie was a big plus, because I still hate wearing one. And I learned that my Dad was right, a good pair of cowboy boots are indeed the most comfortable footwear ever. I just wish they gave us a clothing allowance, because even in the 1970s, all that Western garb was expensive.
6 — In high school, most of my friends were listening to Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix, but I wore out my copy of “Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison” — again, Dad’s influence. So when the “Man in Black” held a press conference, I jumped at the assignment. While l should have been more professional, I followed him to the elevator, shook his hand and thanked him for all his music. I’d do it again.
5 — Speaking of music, I saw almost every major country star of the era because they loved playing Frontier Days. As long as we sat in a booth on the catwalk, people with media credentials could watch for free. I saw classic concerts by Cash, Merle Haggard, Charlie Daniels, Charley Pride, Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, Jerry Jeff Walker and Buck Owens. 
But hands down, the most unforgettable performance was by Kenny Rogers in 1978. Not my favorite singer, but it was during a deluge and he stood on stage wearing a soaked yellow slicker, playing his full show under the worst conditions I’ve ever seen.
4 — Reporters are often bumped up the editorial ladder, so eventually most of my Frontier Days writing landed on the opinion page, where I took up the cause of finally appointing women to chair the rodeo’s volunteer committees. It was one of the rare occasions when Cynthia Lummis — then-state legislator, now-U.S. senator — and I were fighting for the same thing.
Every year, we saw it rejected by men who hated the idea. But Lummis was rodeo royalty as a former Miss Frontier Days, and she eventually won them over.
But the guys who ran the show treated me as a traitor to my gender who ruined their world. Still, that was nothing compared to my decision to let PETA and other animal rights activists air their views about rodeo’s alleged cruelty to livestock. Burning me at the stake would not be enough punishment for that sin.
3 — Those guys could have exacted their revenge by tossing me in the legendary Zipper carnival ride. Despite fears of permanent damage, I willingly bought tickets when my future wife wanted to go for a few spins nearly 40 years ago. I’ve had a pain in my neck ever since, though she reminds me I’ve been a pain to her for just as long.
2 — Perseverance can pay off handsomely, as my friend Pete Laybourn proved when, after many years, he won the wild horse riding contest. It’s a fan favorite, and I’ll never forget the smile on his face when he claimed his prize.
1 — My chart-topper was the opposite of Laybourn’s experience. I loved taking photos in the arena because you can’t beat the action. But after a record rain drenched the rodeo grounds overnight, it was a sea of mud. I didn’t want to ruin my boots, so my father loaned me a pair of hip waders.
That worked fine until I drifted way too far from the fence and got literally stuck in the arena’s mud during the bareback event, making me an easy target for a stray horse. When I picked myself off the ground, I held my mostly dry, intact camera high in the air.
I didn’t expect cheers or gasps that I survived, but I also didn’t anticipate waves of laughter from thousands of spectators that kept growing louder as I trudged off, every inch covered in mud. Even my “friends” let me know it was the funniest thing they’d ever seen. It would have gone viral but YouTube hadn’t been invented. 
I’m sure I will get over the humiliation someday. Ask me in a couple of decades.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-28 10:16:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Some hope, some worries: Mississippi’s agriculture GDP is a mixed bag",Katherine Lin,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/28/mississippi-agriculture-gdp-mixed-farmers-livestock-poultry/,"Ag was the largest contributor to state GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025, but agriculture GDP gains were largely due to $120 million in federal payments to Mississippi farmers.","It’s been a disparate few years for Mississippi’s agriculture sector. Even as natural disasters and trade wars have caused row crop prices to decline, record high beef prices, growing poultry production and hundreds millions of dollars in federal disaster payments have bolstered the sector.
Some farmers have reported that federal payments have been slower and lower than needed as they continue to feel the impacts of bad weather in 2023 and 2024 exacerbated by low prices, high costs and trade wars. In Mississippi, row crops, which include soy beans, cotton and corn, have been among the hardest hit.
“This is one of the worst years for row crops,” said Dr. Joshua Maples, an agricultural economist at Mississippi State University. 
Row crops, especially soybeans, are an important part of Mississippi’s economy with soybean production valued at over $1 billion. Farmers are still recovering from the effects of past severe weather conditions and the outlook for 2025 is not promising with higher than normal rainfall that may result in a lower crop yield.
The prices of row crops have declined since 2022 leading to smaller profits for farmers who are struggling to break even with high production costs. As a result of 2018 tariffs, China, the biggest importer of soybeans in the world, shifted to buying more from South America, a loss that the U.S. industry has not recovered from.
The bright spots in the agriculture industry have been the livestock and poultry industries. Poultry, the largest agriculture sector in Mississippi, grew by 10% according to data from the Mississippi State University Extension largely due to strong production.
But livestock saw the most growth, with a 14% increase.
“Livestock is the shining star of Mississippi,” said Mike McCormick, a cattle farmer and president of the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation. Beef prices have soared due to historically low numbers of cattle in the United States. As of January 1, 2025, there were 86.7 million head of cattle in the United States, the fewest since 1951. 
While cattle farmers are currently seeing higher returns, they struggled for years with drought and weak profit margins leading to smaller herds. Farmers are trying to grow their herds but the process will likely take a few years, so beef prices will likely continue to be high.
In 2024, the state’s agricultural nominal GDP remained relatively unchanged with a decrease of 0.4% while the overall state GDP grew by 4.2%.

Agriculture GDP makes up around 2% of the state GDP. At the end of June, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that in the first quarter of 2025, Mississippi’s economy grew 0.7%.  The agriculture sector was the largest contributor to growth of any industry at 0.83%. This was the third straight quarter that agriculture had the largest GDP growth rate in the state.
But agriculture GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was largely due to $120 million in direct payments from the federal government to Mississippi farmers.
“It’s not reflective of the reality farmers are facing right now,” said Andy Gipson, Mississippi’s agricultural commissioner on a recent episode of Mississippi Today’s podcast The Other Side, of what would appear on paper to be robust growth in farming output.
These payments are part of the American Relief Act that was passed in December 2024 that set aside more than $30 billion in direct payments to farmers to help with losses from economic changes and natural disasters. The money is being paid out through multiple programs, including the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, or ECAP, and the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program, or SDRP. The commodity program helps farmers impacted by increased production costs and falling crop prices while the disaster program helps those affected by severe weather in 2023 and 2024.
 “The $120 million is about 3.5% of the total GDP the state gained from ‘Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting’ in 2024,” said Dr. Sondra Collins a Senior Economist at the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning. She expects to see the impact of these programs on GDP throughout the year as applications continue to be submitted and money is paid out. 
McCormick’s family has been farming in Mississippi since the 1820s and says this is one of the most challenging periods for farmers since the farm crisis of the 1980s. 
“Farming has always been a risky business,” said McCormick.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/06213500/IMG_0328.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Every Nebraska worker was set to have paid sick leave starting this fall, because voters approved it through a citizen-led initiative.
That change was part of a wave of ballot measures Nebraska voters embraced in recent years, including the legalization of medical marijuana that left lawmakers and a newly created commission to craft the framework of how the new medicine would be regulated. 
Voters also approved increasing the minimum wage and tied future annual pay bumps to inflation. And they rejected state funding to help pay some of the costs of students attending private K-12 schools.
But the officially nonpartisan, GOP-led Nebraska Legislature this session, often with gubernatorial support and the support of at least one Democrat, poked and prodded for changes that would have weakened or reversed those ballot measures. 
Some lawmakers argued that they wanted to make those measures more “workable.” Others sought to reimplement the school voucher law voters rejected.
Different groups of lawmakers resisted each time, often filibustering or arguing against the changes. Many accused the legislative majorities of going against the “will of the people.” 
  A new GOP supermajority 

Nebraska was one of several Republican-led legislatures nationally that sought to restrict or, in Missouri’s case, reverse ballot measures voters approved this year.
Majorities in Lincoln did so after having built a 33-member supermajority. With the new supermajority, conservatives could modify, weaken or repeal citizen initiatives without crossing the political aisle — if Republicans stayed in lockstep.
 Nebraska’s GOP lawmakers and Democratic State Sen. Jane Raybold of Lincoln did so on paid sick leave, weakening the voter-approved law’s blanket requirements for sick leave and adding new restrictions. 
Now employers will no longer be required to offer paid sick leave to young teens, ages 14 and 15, or to temporary workers, seasonal agricultural workers and workers at the state’s smallest businesses, those with 10 or fewer employees.
The larger majority also made the filibuster, a tactic long used in the Unicameral to stall or kill legislation that lacks consensus, less effective. 
Some lawmakers, often Democrats, lamented that the statehouse had become less pragmatic, while Republicans blamed them for using the once-rare stall tactic too often to resist a different will of the voters, conservative lawmaking majorities the people elected. 
Some Democrats said they were left little choice but to stall, as Republicans more frequently stuck together to pass their most controversial priorities.
On medical cannabis, lawmakers refused to establish a clearer framework of how the new laws should be implemented. 
The majority tried to slow down voter-approved minimum wage increases but failed after one lawmaker missed the final round vote. That proposal is already set to be reconsidered next year. Supporters of the slowdown had argued businesses needed more predictable increases. 
Throughout the session, worker advocates and union leaders spoke out against the proposed changes to citizen-led initiatives.

“I don’t understand how democratically elected senators can so easily go against these democratically supported initiatives,” said Sam Washburn, a student activist, in March.
One state senator, speaking privately, said during a last-ditch effort to slow the minimum wage increase that the statehouse is “not a serious place,” and that lawmakers are “not serious people.” 
As the Legislature pushes back against voter-approved laws, lawmakers are also asking voters to consider letting them run for a third term in 2026 via a constitutional amendment. 
Now, after the dust settles, both state parties will try to pick up seats by turning to the same voters. Republicans will try to gain more seats and strengthen their majority to the point that a handful of conservative holdouts would hold less sway. Democrats are trying to end the super majority and restore the filibuster’s strength. 
 The Never-Ending Culture War 

The Nebraska Unicameral, while it isn’t as loud or larger-than-life as some statehouses, also had its culture war spats this spring — from talk of stopping the “elitist” class from promoting lab-grown meat and other foods they call unnatural to restricting what high school and college sports team transgender students can join. 
The Legislature passed legislation that would require public school districts to adopt a policy so parents can see what materials are in school libraries, as book bans passed by school boards and states have drastically increased in recent years.
Nebraska also joined 26 states in having a law that restricts which sports teams transgender students can join. Transgenders people’s participation in sports has become a wedge issue in recent years. ​​Fewer than 10 transgender students have filed to participate in middle school and high school sports in the state over the past decade, according to the Nebraska School Activities Association.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area continued proposing bills that affect transgender Nebraskans. In 2023, her bill passed restricting gender care for some minors. That year, her bill and legislative resistance to it sidetracked the session, as State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha filibustered nearly every bill.
ACLU Nebraska Executive Director Mindy Rush Chipman said in a statement, “The constant targeting of LGBTQ+ Nebraskans must stop.”
Kauth, who had to limit her latest bill to high school and college sports to pass it this year, has said she would reintroduce a proposal to set similar sex-based legal restrictions on school bathrooms and locker rooms during next year’s legislative session. 
“The work is not done,” Kauth said. “We’re going to continue.”

 The governor’s future 
Gov. Jim Pillen claimed victory for the bill’s passage. He had identified Kauth’s sports restrictions bill as one of his priorities for the 2025 session. 
Pillen, who announced his 2026 bid for reelection as the session wound down, achieved most of his legislative priorities, including a law against foreign agents, age verification for future social media accounts, the ban on lab-grown meat and a merger of the state’s agencies in charge of overseeing water quality and quantity.
But Pillen fell short a second straight year at convincing some Republican holdouts to support a proposal to alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president to a winner-take-all system, which every state but Maine and Nebraska use. 
President Donald Trump and campaign surrogates had expressed support for the change during his 2024 campaign, which some pundits thought might come down to the results in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. In the end, former Vice President Kamala Harris won the “blue dot” in the Omaha area but lost Nebraska as a whole to Trump.
While the debate made national headlines, political observers had known the GOP holdouts for months. The bill’s sponsor, State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City, knew he was short votes. The governor still pressured lawmakers to debate the change.
The reason: Pillen might need Trump’s backing in 2026, as the Republican governor could face a GOP primary challenger with ties to Trump world. At worst, his team hopes to keep Trump from endorsing an opponent. It would like to earn the president’s backing.

Pillen might face questions about budget troubles slowing his momentum on his top priority, securing lasting property tax relief. 
A handful of Republicans joined most Democrats to oppose Pillen-favored changes to the property tax code, including broadening the sales tax base to cover more of the costs of funding public education that is currently covered by local property taxpayers. Three times now, enough senators have balked at Pillen’s push to tax more goods and services to pay for property tax relief.
He also could face scrutiny for mishandling line-item vetoes to the state’s two-year budget.
“What happened with the delivery of the vetoes is not a problem with the budget,” said State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee.”
Clements said the budget was put together well, but that a majority of lawmakers would have supported all of Pillen’s intended line-item vetoes. Some Democrats disagreed with that assessment.
 A nation that needs help
Some state lawmakers, following the lead of cohorts in other states, tried and fell short at infusing more religion into public schools, testing the legal limits of the separation of church and state.
One proposal would have required displaying the Ten Commandments in every Nebraska elementary school classroom and in every middle or high school building. Another would have allowed school districts to employ unlicensed religious chaplains to counsel students. 
Neither made it out of committee. 
The lawmakers behind the bills say they aim to restore morality and character among Nebraska students, saying that they believe the nation needs help.
One of the four proposals, Legislative Bill 550, would have let K-12 students be excused during the school day for off-site religious instruction and coursework. That proposal was included in a broader education package that sidetracked the Education Committee for a month. 
LB 550 was married to a proposal that would have given Nebraska teachers more paid time off around significant life events. It fell to a filibuster on the floor after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the logistical challenges of letting students leave.

Some who backed the deal have said that parents can already sign out their kids for any reason and that they do not see it as a state endorsement of religion. Critics argued it could open the door to more controversial educational religious bills, including vouchers for private K-12 education and display of the Ten Commandments.
“I think in any normal course of a session, a bill like LB 550 would be seen as a radical piece of legislation,” said State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha during the floor debate. 
A “historically conservative” budget 
Beyond the culture war battles, Lawmakers balanced the budget mostly by using the state’s “rainy day” cash reserve fund and a series of cash transfers and spending cuts to fill budget holes, a budget Pillen touted as “historically conservative.” 
“I believe we are setting the Cornhusker State up for success,” Pillen said. 
Some Democratic lawmakers compared the budget to “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” a fairy tale where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he has extravagant clothing. They questioned the math behind it. 
Pillen, should he win reeelection, would face future budgets based on the limitations of the current one — less revenue than anticipated and increased spending over time — a budget already back in the red, facing a deficit of $95 million due to lower tax revenues. 
A vocal, ever-changing group in the Legislature’s minority spent much of the session filibustering. They lost most fights but scored a few wins.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln expressed pride that they had blocked the proposal that would have slowed the state’s voter-approved minimum wage increases, for now. 
“I’m glad that we were at least able to fight for everyday working Nebraskan,” Dungan said.

Wes Moore and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton speak to reporters Sunday after a 90-minute meeting to discuss the recent FEMA denail of an request for areas hit by devastating floods in May. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A decision to deny federal emergency aid to areas of Western Maryland hit hard by flooding in May is being called petty, partisan and punishing by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D).
State, federal and local officials met for 90 minutes inside a Westernport restaurant Sunday to discuss last week’s denial by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the next steps they can take.
And while there is bipartisan agreement that the denial is a “gut punch” to the area, ant that there must be an appeal, there is disagreement on the motivations behind the decision.
Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland) said that while the reason for the rejection is not yet clear, he does not believe it was political. But Gov. Wes Moore blamed the denial squarely on President Donald Trump (R).
“His decision was a political decision,” Moore told reporters gathered under an awning next to the Port West restaurant Sunday. “There’s no other justification that could make where West Virginia had around the same amount of damage that was done” and had its application approved, while Maryland was rejected.
The comments to reporters are some of the strongest yet made by Moore as he continues to decry a denial of federal aid by the Trump administration.
Moore, McKay, Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton met at Port West Restaurant, which was hit hard by flooding that overwhelmed the town’s Main Street area in May. But on Sunday, it was reopepned and doing brisk business.
“Port West and the Subway are staples here,” McKay said, standing outside as a thunderstorm passed through.
Lawmakers call denial of disaster assistance for Western Maryland floods a ‘gut punch’

McKay said the two restaurants were beneficiaries of both a shovel brigade organized by area residents and local government aid that quickly provided some funding that allowed both to jumpstart their own recoveries.
The town and parts of Allegany and Garrett counties were inundated by storms in May. Westernport, which sits near the Potomac and George’s Creek, was among the flood damaged towns.
George’s Creek surged to more than 12 feet above major flood stage. Wills Creek in Cumberland rose 8 feet. The Potomac River also flooded. Areas of both counties were evacuated. Midland, Lonaconing, and Westernport were among the hardest-hit areas.
Moore declared a state of emergency in the area. In addition to providing some state aid, an application for federal recovery funds was also submitted.
Official damage estimates in that request approached $90 million, including damage to the George’s Creek Railroad and to exposed water and gas lines. Many of those damages were offset by insurance claims and further reduced through a “joint assessment” process in which FEMA agrees with some claims but denies others, until the damage estimate was reduced to $15.8 million.
In a letter sent to state and local officials last week, FEMA denied that funding even as it approved $11.7 million in aid for two West Virginia counties hit by a different storm in June.
Hamilton said the area is still struggling to recover. Half a mile away, Ross Street is still closed after part of the road was damaged by the flooding.
“That road alone leads down into town,” Hamilton said. “We have approximately 10 first responders from the fire department, EMS, that live on that hill. By that road not being open, it’s going to delay response. They’re going to have to go a little further out and down … that is going to be a major problem.”
The town of about 2,000 people has a $2 million budget. Damage to the municipality — excluding private property — is currently estimated at $10 million, including the loss of four city vehicles, Hamilton said.
“We lost a lot — the town itself — all of our equipment, our trucks … we lost four vehicles,” she said. “We were able to recently, through insurance money, to replace only three.”
The town has been renting additional equipment “because we don’t have the money to purchase that as well. So financially, it is affecting the town as well as all the citizens.”
With months left in the summer, Hamilton said she is already concerned about residents in the area come winter.

“Families here lost their furnaces. They have no money to replace those. So, we have families that will be cold this winter or will result to other means to heat their homes, which is a concern for the fire department as well,” Hamilton said.
“I’ve been a 25-year member with the fire department and usually homes that don’t have the capability of heating, they switch to kerosene, they switch to electric heaters, and it’s very scary for us to know that that’s probably what a lot of those families are going to do,” she said.
Hamilton said a lack of federal aid will hamstring recovery efforts.
“Honestly, I think we’re going to have to let the road set closed as it is right now,” she said of Ross Street. “You know, we’re only able to do what we can do.”
“There is money that the state has given us that right now we’re using for hot water tanks, looking to provide furnaces, those types of things for our residents,” she said. “People have to come first. The road is secondary to our residents.”
Still, Moore, Delaney and McKay said they hold out hope of reconsideration.
Moore said the state is appealing even though the denial letter offers little insight as to the reasons the state request was rejected. And while McKay and some others said they hoped the federal agency would elaborate on the reason for the denial, Moore was more cynical.
“I’ve stopped trying to do the mental gymnastics of trying to understand how this administration is making its decisions, or what to expect when it comes to partnership with them,” Moore told reporters. “What I do know is the decision that they made, it is petty, it is partisan, and it is punishing and is deeply unfair to the people of Allegany and Garrett County.”
McClain Delaney and McKay both said they have asked for meetings with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
“It’s important that they are forced to justify why … they rejected it so abruptly, because it does seem that any Democratic member who’s asked for help hasn’t received it,” McLain Delaney said.
“I believe that no matter what, your ZIP code doesn’t matter. You know, people over politics, so it’s horrific,” she said. “But the one thing I keep reiterating is this is the best of what recovery looks like — it’s when state, federal and local come together. They pool their resources, and they figure out ways to leverage them to, you know, lift up in the best and most economical way.”

McClain vowed to press the administration for funding.
“We’ll embarrass them,” she said.
When asked if she thought the Trump administration is susceptible to those tactics, McClain Delaney said that “if there is enough publicity and enough of an outcry, it does look embarrassing for them because it looks like they’re penalizing people.”
McKay said he still is not attributing the decision to politics and to punishing an area that voted for Trump even as the state overall did not in 2024.
“I tend to believe that it is not political,” McKay said. “I tend to believe, just from the simple fact … that I don’t believe that FEMA, those who are at FEMA, at that level, are playing politics with applications.”
McKay said he hoped state leaders could push for a reconsideration on the merits of the case.
“I believe that we have shown the metrics that we meet everything,” McKay said. “There is an appeal process. I disagree about trying to embarrass anybody. My grandma said you could always catch a whole lot more flies with honey than a baseball bat.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9586-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

White wrote in their 1975 journal paper that “In 1963, about 18 m northwest of Kaleidoscope Geyser, a violent eruption that may have been a single event scattered scores of blocks of sinter about a newly created crater about 3 m in diameter” but suggested that the event was either directly or indirectly related to the Hebgen Lake earthquake. (Photo by George Marler/ Yellowstone National Park in 1965)Although they mostly go unnoticed by humans, small earthquakes occur much more frequently than large earthquakes, and knowing more about these tiny seismic events can help us better understand the earthquake hazard and geological processes occurring in a region. Using conventional methods to measure the magnitude of small earthquakes in Yellowstone, however, can be challenging. But perhaps artificial intelligence (AI) approaches offer a solution. After all, AI is already helping to refine earthquake location procedures in Yellowstone.
Earthquake magnitudes are calculated from the energy released by the earthquake as recorded by a seismometer. In Yellowstone, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations (UUSS) operates a network of seismometers to monitor earthquakes in the area. Generally, magnitude measurements for a single earthquake are made at several stations in the network independently, and the estimates are then averaged into the final magnitude that is reported. Accurately computing magnitude values for small earthquakes becomes challenging when 1) there are not enough measurements, or 2) earthquakes are happening close together. This is a particular problem during swarms of small earthquakes because the signals from individual seismic events can overlap. Usually, this can be fixed by a seismic analyst after they locate the earthquake, but not always! About 2% of the earthquakes in the UUSS catalog do not have a magnitude computed, likely because of a combination of these issues, so the value is reported as -9.99. To solve this problem, let’s reach into our AI toolkit!
  Example of a Yellowstone seismic waveform recorded at station YMC (at Maple Creek in the northeast part of Yellowstone National Park) with earthquakes for which a magnitude could not be determined. The magnitude was therefore set at -9.99 in the University of Utah Seismograph Stations catalog. The gold area highlights one event, but there are several others close by. The entire window is ~1 minute long. The close occurrence of several earthquakes in such a short time window and their small magnitude values make it a challenge to calculate an earthquake magnitude for any of these events.
Most people are likely familiar with complicated “deep learning” models, like ChatGPT, that accept and output complex data like long text sequences and images. The deep learning models we use in processing small earthquakes are similar, and they take ground motion data from seismometers as the input. Deep learning models like these are a type of machine learning, which describes algorithms that learn patterns in a dataset to estimate values of interest for new data. The models learn the patterns during a training phase, in which the model is provided with examples — sort of like a test with an answer key. After training, the model can accept inputs it has never seen before and estimate the output, given what it learned from the training data.
There is also a somewhat simpler, though still powerful, type of machine learning that relies on human-defined features that describe the data instead of the more complicated, raw data to make predictions. In a recent study, UUSS scientists used this method to train models to calculate earthquake magnitudes based on short windows of data, so it won’t generally be a problem if earthquakes are close together.
In the new approach, the UUSS scientists trained one machine learning model for each station in the Yellowstone region using data from the UUSS earthquake catalog. Each model uses features describing the earthquake signal — such as the amplitude — and the location of the earthquake to estimate a magnitude value. The new method makes better use of the available data by accounting for multiple types of seismic waves, and the method also can take advantage of data from more seismic stations because of the rigorous training step. The net result is that there are up to 4 times as many measurements available to calculate a magnitude. Like in the conventional approach, these measurements are combined to determine a final magnitude.
  A map of the stations operating in the Yellowstone region between 2012 and 2024 shown as triangles with fill and edge colors indicating whether they are used to calculate magnitudes using traditional approaches, artificial intelligence methods, or both. Many more stations can be used with the AI magnitude method, allowing for more small-magnitude values to be computed. The black dots show the locations of the earthquakes cataloged by the University of Utah Seismograph Stations that were used to train the AI models.
The new method will ultimately complement, and not replace, the traditional approach for magnitude calculations. This is because traditional methods work very well most of the time (except for these small, nearby events), and because the machine learning approach does have its limitations, mostly because the models are only going to work well for earthquakes that are similar to the training dataset. So, for example, a model may fail to estimate the magnitude of an earthquake occurring near Hebgen Lake if it saw very few training examples from that area. Similarly, if most training examples were greater than M0.5, the model may perform poorly when applied to earthquakes with a magnitude less than 0.5. Combining predictions from multiple station models can help us to remove and identify poor magnitude estimates, but it can be challenging to know when the models are uncertain. In the future, UUSS scientists plan to expand the approach to not only provide a magnitude, but also an assessment of the confidence in that magnitude.
These machine learning methods are at the current cutting edge of seismology, and Yellowstone provides the perfect location to train and test the new approaches!

(Getty Image)A group of Tennessee electricity providers is taking early steps toward turning part of the West Tennessee Megasite into a power plant designed to generate extra power when demand peaks.
The cooperative has its eye on about 100 acres located near a new substation the Tennessee Valley Authority built to help power the megasite and its tenants, including Ford’s massive BlueOval City electric vehicle and battery manufacturing campus.
The group wants to resurrect the Tennessee Power Distribution Company, a nonprofit, tax-exempt electricity generation and transmission “co-op of co-ops” created in 1999 in case local electricity distribution became an open market. 
The power industry didn’t experience such a transition, so co-ops are considering other uses for the company, according to Mike Knotts, CEO of the Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, a group of 23 nonprofit electric co-ops that serve more than 2.5 million Tennesseans. The co-ops purchase their energy from TVA and distribute it locally to customers, accounting for about 25% of the federally-owned public utility’s annual revenue, Knotts said.
“This started back at Christmas Eve of 2022 when we experienced a first for our area — which was rolling blackouts — where there was simply not enough capacity to produce energy in the TVA service territory,” said Knotts, who also serves as Tennessee Power Distribution Company president. “So we as local utilities were called upon to, in rolling increments … turn your power off.”
Affordable, reliable and sustainable: report compares utility performance

Winter Storm Elliott plunged much of Tennessee into single-digit temperatures that year, and mechanical failure combined with historically high electricity demand resulted in the rolling blackouts. The utility made multiple changes to its emergency communications procedures and fortified its facilities to try to withstand frigid conditions the following year.
Knotts told members of the West Tennessee Megasite Authority on Wednesday that the group sought to ensure this would never happen again and landed on the idea of building a “peaking facility” themselves.
Such facilities are intended to operate only when electric consumption needs reach extreme highs, running about 10-20% of the year, Knotts said. The site would generate power using simple cycle combustion turbines powered by natural gas. These turbines do not generate steam and as a result have little discharge water.
The Tennessee Power Distribution Company would then sell that power to TVA to be distributed where it’s needed. 
The long process ahead
The Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, with TVA’s cooperation, completed a site selection study to determine how and where the cooperative could “build assets to produce energy that could complement what TVA does and not disturb the contractual relationship between our cooperatives and TVA,” Knotts said.
The study focused on the Megasite property adjacent to the TVA substation — it’s close to transmission infrastructure, the interstate and a natural gas pipeline installed to serve BlueOval City.
Knotts said the group has had “fruitful” conversations with state officials, and it’s time to move on to more formal arrangements. The cooperative is negotiating with TVA, he said, and will soon start the roughly two-year process of applying to connect to the power transmission grid. 
Ultimately, Knotts said the project would need a binding letter of intent and then a long-term lease agreement for the land from the Megasite Authority. The project also would need the blessing of the State Building Commission and must clear a federal interconnection study.
Several Megasite Authority board members posed questions about the proposed facility’s impact, including potential nitrous oxide emissions. Knotts said the facility would require an air quality permit from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. 
The Megasite Authority board did not take formal action on the issue Wednesday, but each member of the board expressed interest in learning more about the proposal at a September meeting.
Knotts said while he does not speak for TVA, the utility has “stated publicly that it has a deficit for capacity,” in addition to a debt cap set by federal law limiting how many new generation projects TVA can take on.
“Plants like this are going to be built, so our members decided, jointly, we would rather do this, given our service mission, given we are nonprofit entities … than outsource it to a for-profit company,” he said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Workers’ rights and the state budget were among the top themes of Nebraska’s 2025 legislative session as lawmakers tried to balance new voter-approved laws with legislative power, all while dealing with a major budget deficit.
State lawmakers had telegraphed their intent to adjust what Nebraskans passed in recent years, including votes to increase the minimum wage (passed by about 59% of voters in 2022) and mandate paid sick leave for all workers (passed by about 75% of voters in 2024).
The labor laws came into focus in the first contested vote of the 2025 session in January, the choice for chair of the Business and Labor Committee.
  State Sens. Kathleen Kauth and John Cavanaugh, both of Omaha, sought to chair the Business and Labor Committee in the 109th Nebraska Legislature. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Both candidates for the post — Omaha State Sens. Kathleen Kauth and John Cavanaugh, a Republican and Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, neither of whom had yet served on the committee — hinted that the laws from Nebraska’s “second house” might need adjustments.
“We need to make sure that we honor the intent of those [voter-initiated] bills and get through the process successfully,” Kauth said Jan. 8. She would be elected committee chair 31-18.
Cavanaugh described the need for possible “technical updates and implementation” to some of the ballot-passed laws while stating the Business and Labor Committee should “be respectful of the will of the voters but also make sure that we are taking into consideration those very real concerns.”
The labor proposals worked their way through Kauth’s committee, and the fights spilled over like proxy wars into other labor measures and the budget.
If 2023 focused on health care and 2024 focused on education and taxes, in that year’s regular and special sessions, 2025 focused on the budget and labor, often a direct response to the “will of the voters” from recent elections.
‘Will of the voters’
The phrases “will of the voters” or “will of the people” were repeated throughout the session and became rallying cries for opponents of the labor bills. One example was the morning of March 26 when the phrases were said 44 times by 14 different senators during three hours of debate on proposed changes to paid sick leave, legislative transcripts show.
The proposed tweaks were panned as partisan and nearly divided the 49-member Legislature along ideological lines. One Democratic exception, State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a grocery store executive, joined 32 of 33 Republicans on the labor-related, voter-passed laws.

The result left 33 votes, which is the minimum threshold to overcome a filibuster but also change voter-approved laws as required under the Nebraska Constitution. However, the minimum wage proposal led by Raybould stalled procedurally but will likely return in 2026 and pass if all supporters hold.
Supporters defended the efforts to water down paid sick leave protections and slow minimum wage increases as necessary for businesses, citing fiscal and cost restraints.
“I don’t think we’re undoing the will of the people as much as we are contemplating what the financial impact may be,” State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area said in late March.
But opponents regularly questioned the message to “working families” and made the fight personal, especially for Raybould and other business owners.
“We can see by opening the door to undermining the will of the people under the auspices of so-called ‘technical corrections,’ it has opened a Pandora’s box to completely defy the will of the people,” State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln said the same day Sorrentino spoke.
‘Nebraska: We do not like competition’
Two other labor fights moved more quickly, including a pair from freshman State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, and led to the gnashing of senators’ teeth early in the session.

Hallstrom’s first bill classified rideshare drivers for Uber, Lyft and Door Dash as independent contractors, locking workers out from some employee-based protections for discussing organizing into unions (Legislative Bill 229), while the other increased the legal threshold to sue companies after cybersecurity breaches, protecting businesses from lawsuits unless they showed “willful, wanton or gross negligence” in securing data (LB 241).
The fights repeatedly drove a wedge between some progressives in the legislative minority and Raybould, who also joined 32 Republicans on the rideshare and cybersecurity bills over filibusters.
Conrad and State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, both progressives, viewed the Hallstrom bills as part of an emerging theme of being hostile to labor as the pushes to change voter-led laws waited in the wings.

McKinney on March 4, during debate on a smaller fight over liquor licenses designed to help in-state distillers, said the state was reaching a new slogan: “Nebraska: We do not like competition.”
“It’s either competition or helping out corporations,” McKinney said at the time.
State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, one of two Democratic lawmakers representing Trump-won districts, led the distillery measure that Raybould opposed to the point of seeking an attorney general’s opinion. She argued Quick’s proposal would have given “preferential treatment” to in-state operators and could entangle other liquor laws and lead to lawsuits. The bill passed 33-13.
Conrad on Feb. 4 called out “palpable disdain both for the voters of Nebraska and for working families,” and on March 6 she said “anti-worker legislation” was moving “at record pace.”
Legislature’s referendum power
Hallstrom, a former longtime lobbyist who had worked around the statehouse since 1981 when he graduated from the University of Nebraska College of Law, defended his legislation as helping protect “flexible work” for rideshare drivers. He said it would help working families. He said his other bill limiting lawsuits after data breaches would cut back on “speculative risks” that he argued could strain judicial resources or cost businesses.

Hallstrom said he doesn’t buy into the criticisms of him and others that they had advanced “anti-worker legislation” or pushed back on voters. 
Instead, Hallstrom and Raybould repeatedly pointed to the Nebraska Constitution, as amended by the voters in 2004, that gives the Legislature the ability to amend voter-approved laws with at least 33 votes. Voters set the 33-vote threshold that year, moving it up from a simple majority.
“Not only have the people spoken with regard to the specific statutory initiatives regarding minimum wage and paid sick leave, but they’ve spoken just as loudly to the authority of the Legislature to make revisions where deemed appropriate and necessary,” Hallstrom told the Examiner.
Finding a ‘balanced approach’
Raybould was among those who repeatedly said senators in the majority were standing up for a “balanced approach” to “good policy,” which she and others argued would better help keep Nebraskans safe, healthy and employed with benefits and competitive wages.
  State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln. Jan. 9, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)
Her minimum wage proposal sought to slow the annual rate at which the state’s minimum wage increases beginning in 2027, rather than increasing it based on inflation as voters mandated. Raybould’s measure would also carve out teen workers, aged 14 or 15, for a “youth minimum wage.”
“You have to always balance it out to make sure that we maintain the economic vitality and vibrancy and economic growth in our state without falling off and creating a cycle of cost increases that are so much harder for Nebraska families to be able to afford,” Raybould said in April.
Raybould took barbs from colleagues she usually agrees with, including Conrad. In March, Conrad urged her “friends on the left,” primarily Raybould, to renege from what she called an “ongoing assault on working families and workers’ rights” that were “undermining your values.”
“You claim to support civil rights. You claim to support human rights,” Conrad said. “Yet, without economic justice, Nebraskans have no opportunity to be empowered to exercise those.”
Raybould has decided to not seek reelection in 2026. She said her decision was not related to the “rather brutal” 2025 session or her minimum wage bill.
‘Making it so that it will work’
The paid sick leave law voters passed required sick leave to be paid to all employees beginning Oct. 1. But before the law takes effect, legislative changes led to passage by freshman State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney this spring will leave out teens aged 14 or 15, agricultural workers, independent contractors and businesses of 10 or fewer workers from the new requirement.

The back-and-forth was similar to that of minimum wage but featured a seemingly brief compromise in Strommen’s proposal that would have allowed more employees to be entitled to paid sick leave, including requiring it of businesses with 6-10 employees and for 14 or 15 year olds who are parents.
Strommen had said his measure recognized the “will of the voters, while also avoiding a few serious detriments to small businesses and workers and the Nebraska economy.”
But at the urging of State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, lawmakers reconsidered the “compromise.” It returned to the new Strommen requirements.
The majority yanked the “compromise” partly because the floor fight over the bill continued even after the changes had been adopted.
“We’re not taking away what the voters said they wanted. We’re making modifications to it,” Jacobson said in May. “We’re making it so that it will work for small businesses and for employers.”

The “compromise” would have also reinstated the voter-approved right for employees to sue to enforce the law, rather than solely relying on the Nebraska Department of Labor. Some lawmakers hope to revive that provision in 2026.
Employers can still choose to offer paid sick leave to any employee before the law takes effect Oct. 1, and employers can pay any employee above the state minimum wage, for that matter.
The way the public can petition the state government could also change as Strommen introduced an interim study to examine Nebraska’s ballot measure process, including possible statutory or constitutional tweaks.
Medical cannabis
The labor fights also played at least a small role in the defeat of efforts to tweak medical cannabis laws to legalize and regulate the drug, which voters approved in November. 
But unlike the paid sick leave and minimum wage proposals, longtime advocates for medical cannabis, including those who led the 2024 campaign, had supported and asked for the legislative changes.
Cavanaugh was among those helping negotiate a path forward for the bill while Kauth worked with the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office on a hemp-related ban that some worried could ensnare the new legal framework for medical cannabis.

Some conservatives, including State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, described the lawmakers’ efforts on medical cannabis as “political theater,” saying the proposal was meant to get around lawsuits, which have so far failed.
Storer and State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County were among senators blasting progressives for embracing changes to the voter-approved medical cannabis legislation yet deriding conservatives for pursuing changes to the voter-approved laws on paid sick leave and minimum wage.
“This bill’s unnecessary, inappropriate, undermines the will of the people and implements recreational marijuana,” Andersen said at the time.

Progressives, including State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha, who similarly opposed the minimum wage and paid sick leave legislative bills, contended that cannabis would not “leap off the shelves” and corrupt Nebraska youths, as some opponents had suggested. 
He said senators, sometimes, needed to go outside and “touch some grass and just think about what the world is like outside of this room.”
“Let’s not get too concerned about ‘fighting against the will of the people,’” Fredrickson continued. “Let’s help shape it. Let’s help put in the right guardrails in place, and let’s help build a system that we can be proud of and puts our patients first.”
Ongoing budget balancing
Minimum wage, paid sick leave and medical cannabis could all return in 2026, as could major adjustments to Nebraska’s 2025-27 budget.
Lawmakers began the 2025 session trying to juggle a $432 million projected hole but needed to cover even more after an economic forecast in April estimated fewer state receipts for the next two years.
  State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Lawmakers juggled roughly $850 million in changes, such as creating new revenue streams, cutting state spending, scrounging for loose dollars in state cash funds and dipping into the state’s “rainy day” fund. In the end, they finished the session with $4.15 million to spare.
“It seemed like an insurmountable mountain to climb, but we did it, and we also did not cut essential services,” State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Appropriations Committee chair, said after the budget passed in May.
Still, the budget fight isn’t over. Just last week, revised fiscal estimates, including receipts coming $86 million short in May and June, returned the two-year state budget to a nearly $100 million deficit that will need fixing.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista identified the state budget as the top issue of 2025 before the session began, and he has said it again will be top of mind in 2026.
Arch had told his colleagues to prepare for and be mindful if there is an economic shift before 2026, notably in state receipts or via the federal government. 
Those urgings came before the latest state projections and before Congress passed President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” that could cut Nebraska’s share of Medicaid dollars and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 23, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Gov. Jim Pillen, who, along with all of Nebraska’s congressional delegation, supported the federal bill, has said the state is “prepared” if federal funding stalls or slows, which he called “our job.” But he has taken a different approach than recent GOP governors in trying to draw down “more than our fair share” of federal dollars.
Also likely to be considered as part of the 2026 budget debate will be Pillen’s attempted line-item vetoes from the end of the 2025 session, the official copies of which were delivered to the wrong office in May, which lawmakers said made the attempted vetoes null and void. 
Next year will also feature a new Pillen goal to state agencies under his control: Cut 10% from the just-approved $5.5 billion annual spending.
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha had compared the budget state lawmakers approved in 2025 to the fairy tale “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he has extravagant clothing. She said the budget, which she opposed, was “based on a number of sleight of hands.”
“It is not actually balanced,” DeBoer said in May. “We’re just making it look like it’s balanced.”



Oher 2025 items of note
Among other major legislation in 2025:

Property taxes — For the third time in a row, lawmakers rejected attempts to shift some of the burden from local property taxes onto currently sales tax-exempt goods and services. The governor has acknowledged that the failure to pass more property tax relief in 2025 could lead to increased property tax bills as lawmakers hope to address the perennial issue in 2026. In the meantime, a new School Financing Review Commission will meet and soon begin suggesting long-term solutions.
Social media and cellphones — Lawmakers approved age verification for all social media sites, beginning July 1, 2026; implemented new social media design features meant to protect children and required school districts to adopt policies with the goal of banning most student cellphone use on school grounds. The creation of child sexual abuse material using artificial intelligence will also soon be prohibited in the state.
Juvenile justice — A broad “public safety” package included a bill from State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, at the request of Gov. Jim Pillen, to allow the detention of younger juveniles, as young as 11, down from 13. All temporary and alternative placement options must be exhausted before a child aged 11 or 12 can be detained.
Legislative oversight — A new legislative division and committee was created in a multiyear standoff with the executive branch over legislative oversight of child welfare and corrections.
School retirement — Questions over whether the state should continue contributing to public employees’ retirement funds when obligations are fully funded came to a head with the Governor’s Office fighting with the Nebraska State Education Association and a flareup among Lincoln lawmakers. In the end, school employees received a benefit if obligations are nearly or fully funded, leading to more take-home pay in the upcoming year and a smaller cost for the state.
A new state department — Beginning July 1, the Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment was established from the merger of the former Nebraska Department of Natural Resources and the former Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy.

But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.

The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

After months of  uncertainty and scrambling, we’re now told the funds are coming — but too late to avoid the  chaos caused by the delay. 
Most administrators I’ve spoken with in North Dakota were prepared to make things work  without these funds if they believed their students would still benefit. That’s the “we’ll make it  work” attitude that defines rural communities. However, with property tax caps imposed by state  law, declining enrollment, and the constant uncertainty surrounding federal funding, these same  administrators are bracing for a tough spring in 2026. The challenge is not just funding; it’s how  we attract and retain teachers in these conditions. 
US Education Department to unfreeze contested K-12 funds

Rural schools, students, and communities have always shown remarkable resilience in the face of  adversity. But this federal funding freeze and subsequent late reinstatement doesn’t just impact  the budgets — it undermines the stability that families in rural areas rely on. Schools in North  Dakota have been left trying to piece together plans without knowing if they would have the  funding to pay for essential services. Educators have had to delay hiring, adjust programs, and  scale back on services they knew were crucial for their students’ success. As Kirsten Baesler  notified us Friday at 10:56 p.m., these funds are now back in the mix, but how many late-night announcements do we need before we realize the impact of this uncertainty on our rural communities? 
Rural schools don’t run on “maybe.” We plan carefully and rely on these federal funds to provide  essential services, from migrant education to after-school programs. But when we’re told to wait,  then suddenly rush to use funds months late, it only makes the work harder and more uncertain. We need stability. It’s time for the federal government to recognize that rural schools can’t  function on last-minute decisions and delayed promises. Our kids deserve better than this.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-115093584-scaled-1-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.
 
The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans misrepresented family’s immigration history

Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A coalition of media groups, including the Tennessee Lookout, is challenging a new state law making it a crime to come within 25 feet of a law enforcement officer after being told to stay back.  
Tennessee’s so-called “buffer” law lays out scenarios in which reporters or others approaching police may be arrested and charged with a misdemeanor.
They include situations in which an officer is conducting a traffic stop, working the scene of an alleged crime or handling “an ongoing and immediate threat to public safety.” The law does not require an intent by journalists to disrupt police activity and gives officers discretion to decide when to order reporters and photographers to stay away. 
Bill expanding Tennessee law enforcement powers during protests draws pushback

The law has “grave implications” for the ability of journalists and news organizations to exercise their First Amendment rights, the lawsuit said. 
“The Act authorizes law enforcement officers to bar journalists (and the public) from reporting — for any reason and no reason — on a wide range of events of public interest, including a parade, a rally, and arrest or an accident scene,” the complaint said. 
“The Act applies with equal force to a reporter gathering the news in a park, standing on a sidewalk or lawfully present in other spaces open to the public,” it said. 
The lawsuit is seeking a judgment that the law violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and an injunction blocking the law, which took effect July 1, from being enforced against the media organizations filing suit.
In addition to the Lookout, the Nashville Banner, Gannett, Scripps Media and TEGNA are plaintiffs in the suit, represented by Paul McAdoo and Grayson Clary of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The organization has successfully obtained preliminary injuctions against similar laws in Louisiana and Indiana.

Wisconsin Books to Prisoners and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections plan a second test of having books sent to incarcerated people. (Photo courtesy of Wisconsin Department of Corrections)  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The nonprofit Wisconsin Books to Prisoners told the Wisconsin Examiner that another pilot project involving the nonprofit and the Wisconsin Department of Corrections will take place in the next three to four weeks. 
The collaborations between the nonprofit and the department might lead to the books project being permitted to send used books to people incarcerated in prisons across the state. 
The department said last year that it could no longer accept used books from anyone, including the nonprofit. The DOC cited concerns about drug smuggling and alleged that some book shipments tested positive for drugs. This led to scrutiny of the department’s rationale for the used book ban. 
“We have hundreds of requests for books that haven’t been fulfilled since the only-new-books policy was established,” Camy Matthay of Wisconsin Books to Prisoners said over email. 
In an August 2024 email to the books project, a DOC official said the concern was not with the nonprofit but with people who would impersonate it. 
In late June, the books project organizers said they were able to send used and new books to Oakhill Correctional Institution in a pilot program. The books were added to the library collection, making them available for checkout by those who requested them. 
DOC communications director Beth Hardtke said the pilot program was designed to allow the DOC to test and refine its screening process for donated reading materials to ensure safety. 
Hardtke said that between 2019 and 2023, 20 incarcerated people died of drug overdoses in DOC facilities, while none have died of drug overdoses in 2024 or so far in 2025. She also cited a study about harmful effects that can occur when incarcerated people are exposed to drug-soaked paper strips. 
“The goal is to eventually allow WBTP to send reading materials to individuals at any DOC facility — safely,” Hardtke said in late June. 
Hardtke said at the time that starting July 1, WBTP would be able to send requested materials directly to individuals at Oakhill instead of the library.
Instead, the DOC has asked for a second pilot, Matthay said. For that, the books project will send books to a library at a second prison. Matthay said this pilot will take place in the next three to four weeks. 
“Should our books pass inspection without issues at prison number two, WBTP hopes to return to fulfilling our mission, i.e., sending books directly to prisoners who request books from us,” Matthay said. 
She said the group is not likely to return to sending books to prisoners directly before September. 
Matthay said that per the DOC’s request, the group will no longer fulfill requests for specific titles. Instead, prisoners are asked to request books by subject matter or genre. 
She said the group provides tracking numbers that will validate the source of the books, and that the nonprofit will also include embossed receipts. 
According to Wisconsin Books to Prisoners, in August 2024, the group asked the DOC if the organization could resolve the concerns about impersonation by providing a postal service tracking number for every package of books it ships. 
Hardtke said the department recognizes the importance of education and books as part of rehabilitation and maintains libraries at all institutions, offers books on electronic tablets and has educational partnerships with the University of Wisconsin System and the state’s technical colleges. 
Critics have raised questions about the quality of the selection on the tablets and whether the quality of the libraries varies by institution. 
Matthay said that when boxes of books have been returned to the nonprofit over the years, the cause was confusion in the mailrooms. 
In late June, the nonprofit said that many of the packages of new books sent to prisoners had been returned to the group. Sending new books to prisoners is not banned by the DOC. 
“We think this problem will resolve itself,” Matthay said, as the DOC establishes better lines of communication between the agency’s headquarters and the institutions that take in the books. 
“The DOC understands that this will improve security for WBTP as well as the DOC,” Matthay said. She added that “it is also understood that when these pilots are completed and if we get a greenlight, that the new policy — whatever that may be — needs to be clearly communicated to all employees (and prisoners too) to avoid confusion.”

Vibrant Health Products selected Rossville — a town of about 1,200 residents near the southwest border of Fayette and Shelby counties in West Tennessee — as its U.S. manufacturing location. 
The company will move into Rossville’s former Kellogg Company’s Eggo plant. Kellogg closed the plant in 2024, laying off 142 workers.
“This is a transformative moment for Rossville and our surrounding communities,” Fayette County Mayor Rhea “Skip” Taylor and Rossville Mayor Judy Watters said in a joint statement. “The acquisition of our former Kellogg facility by Vibrant Health Partners breathes new life into a vital part of our local economy while creating hundreds of quality jobs for our residents.”
The mayors also said the project “underscores the resilience and potential of our community.”
The company received incentives from the state, but the details of the deal are not immediately clear.
Vibrant Health Products will begin with bread production at the new site with plans to expand to other baked goods. 
The brand produces a variety of health-focused baked goods, including organic, gluten-free, grain-free, non-GMO, plant-based, paleo and keto options. Its main operations are located in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada.
“Our new bakery in Tennessee will help us increase production so we can welcome new customers and sustain strategic relationships, explore new possibilities for innovation, broaden our business in new product categories, create stable jobs on both sides of the border and pursue every opportunity to share our healthier products with the world,” Vibrant Health Products President and co-founder Stan Smith said in a Friday news release.

Nathan Toman, R-Mandan, chair of the Legislative Task Force on Government Efficiency, speaks during a subcommittee hearing of the Budget Section on June 25, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s version of DOGE is poised to begin work this week, but members say it won’t be just like the federal government version that inspired it.
“The federal thing seems to be ‘Gotcha. I caught you doing something wrong,’ instead of looking at what are our outcomes and how to do things better,” said Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo.
North Dakota lawmakers this year established the Legislative Task Force on Government Efficiency, similar to the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. The 10-member group meets for the first time Wednesday to begin looking for potential efficiencies in state government.
Rep. Nathan Toman, R-Mandan, who will chair the effort, said his goal for the task force is to work with state agencies to ensure they are running effectively. 
“We’re trying to view it as a partnership saying, ‘We want to help you guys succeed and we want the employees to succeed,’” Toman said. 
The first meeting will include presentations from the departments of Health and Human Services, Information Technology and Commerce. Joe Morrissette, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said those agencies, along with higher education and K-12 education, have some of the largest budgets.
“If the end result is going to be an impact on the overall state budget, you’ve got to look at those big areas,” Morrissette said.
  (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
North Dakota’s task force will not have Elon Musk’s chainsaw, with DOGE seeking out savings without the approval of Congress. The state version will submit a report before the 2027 legislative session that details possible cost savings, plus recommended legislation.
Toman also said the executive branch members of the task force may be able to take action to adjust some programs, if those changes are allowed under state law without needing additional legislation.
Lawmakers earlier this year approved a state budget of $20.3 billion for 2025-27, including federal and other funds. Toman said he believes the task force could find more than $1 billion in cost savings, though he said a more realistic goal would be saving hundreds of millions.
Toman said examples of efficiencies could include reducing funding allocated to programs, cutting staffing levels, reevaluating state partnerships with vendors and streamlining processes.
He added the task force will be looking at federal funding cuts to the state and their effects on state programs and agencies.
State Auditor Josh Gallion, one of the members, said he hopes the task force reduces redundancies and improves outcomes.
“But I also think we have to have a goal of reducing overall spending,” Gallion said. “Our state budget, the growth that we’ve had over the last decade is just not sustainable.”

Morrissette, also a member of the task force, said finding government program efficiency does not always mean finding things to cut.
“I hope the committee has an open mind when we look at things because there could be some opportunities where in order to do something better and be more effective, it may cost more resources,” he said. 
For example, he said his office recently hired a leasing agent for government facilities to take the leasing burden off of state agencies. The office also added a state construction supervisor so all state construction projects are handled under one roof, making it more efficient.
“I think long-term, we’ll save millions over time by having better negotiation on leases and better negotiation on construction managing fees,” Morrissette said.
Jonathan Casper, a former Fargo-area state senator and business owner, is the only person on the task force not currently serving in state government. He said he doesn’t expect the state task force will find misuses of programs and funds, but it can still look for efficiencies in government.
“North Dakota is constitutionally required to balance its budget. The federal government doesn’t,” Casper said. “Until such time as the federal government does, I think having something like DOGE on the federal level is different than on the state level.”
House Bill 1442, which created the task force, calls for the group to meet at least once every three months and operate until July 31, 2031.

Duff, of Hattiesburg, has been involved in state politics, but only peripherally or behind the scenes. Now, the tire baron is considering a political run of his own. His entrance into the 2027 Republican primary for governor could reshape a field of candidates likely to include several statewide officials. 
Duff served an eight-year stint on the state Institutions of Higher Learning Board, first appointed by former Gov. Phil Bryant. He has been a major contributor to many Republican campaigns in Mississippi, and earlier this year formed and funded a political action committee to help elect Republicans to city and legislative offices. He and his brother are major supporters of higher education and have donated millions to Mississippi universities.
As he mulls a run for governor, the billionaire businessman sat for a wide-ranging interview with Mississippi Today.
The conversation spanned his business philosophy, support for tariffs, concerns about Mississippi’s “brain drain,” and his investments in the state’s higher education system. It also touched on where he stands on issues such as immigration, Medicaid expansion, “school choice,” and his affinity for President Donald Trump.
The interview was conducted June 17 and has been edited for clarity and length.
Mississippi Today: Tell me about the moment when you knew that what you were building would grow far bigger than the family business your father had left you. When did you have a sense of the scale at which you were really working with? 
Thomas Duff: That’s a good question. Nobody’s ever asked me that before. When I got into our business, we were in very bad financial shape. Southern Tire Mart was a little company with about seven employees, losing money every month. My father was an attorney in Columbia. He loved business, but he was not active, he just liked to own them. I was finishing up a master’s degree in business, which I did not finish. So I was going to law school at Ole Miss and decided that I liked business much more than practicing law. So I said, ‘Can I stay on and just try to run this company?’ Because I grew up in high school working on tires, changing tires, retreading tires, being very involved in it. My dad said yes. And so I started, and that’s where we began. 
After I got involved in it and liked it, and frankly, started having some success in it, I would say, within about five to eight years after we began, I realized that this thing had potential. It’s really not a job, it’s an opportunity. And truthfully, I’ve never worked a day of my life because I’ve enjoyed being in business that much. 
Our business started with Southern Tire Mart. That has enabled us to be in other businesses and given opportunities. KLLM was a customer of Southern Tire Mart for many, many years, and it had undergone several ownership changes. It had gone public, it had gone back private. So we realized there were opportunities, and hopefully that it would be a profitable opportunity. And so we purchased other businesses that way, and that’s how we grew.
MT: Your core businesses require an integrated transportation ecosystem. Supply chain issues have now taken on a growing salience in our politics. Tell me about the evolution of supply chain issues, and your observations of debates surrounding onshoring versus offshoring that have come closer to the center of the political conversation. What has that been like to watch from your perspective?
Duff: We are uniquely affected by the supply situation. Also by the products that come from Asia and China, in particular. United States truck tire manufacturing only supplies about 70% of our needs in this country. So 30% have to come from outside the United States. So how do you deal with that? Where do you buy? What do you buy? Is it the right thing for customers to buy? 
It’s given us insights into how these foreign companies operate, and frankly, it’s not pleasing, because you see how so many of them have taken advantage of American laxity. Just being, frankly, lax in the way we operate in our supply management, it’s something that needs to be tightened up. We need more domestic manufacturing. There is the demand. There’s just not the manufacturing capacity. So our goal has been to try to increase that.

MT: With tariffs and trade policy being such a central element of political debate right now, what is your view on the trade-offs between free trade, getting products to market and protecting local industries? 
Duff: I think that’s a concern for a lot of people in Mississippi. I think we have watched American manufacturing be a serious problem for the last 25 years — it’s dissipated. We don’t have the trades and the things that we need. We are too dependent. 
But outside of supply chains, and we need to work on that, I have watched tariffs in the last few months be a good thing that’s happening. We approve of what President Trump is trying to do, because this mess existed long before he got here. He’s trying to correct it, and if we can correct it, which we will, it’ll take some short-term concerns, short-term hardships, but it’s going to be a long-term gain for our country. And I say that to you as a person who will probably pay more in tariffs, right? It will hit us hard. But is it going to be corrected? Yes, it will be. So, you know, we got into this mess over 20 or 30 years, it’s gonna take a little while to come out of it.
MT: What is your perspective then on short-term economic cost, let’s say, versus a longer-term structural fix in the economy. Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the country. How should people in a state like this who are working class perceive these sorts of trade-offs?
Duff: Obviously, it is a concern. The question is how much of a concern should it be to the average Mississippian? Again, this is a short-term situation. It will have great long-term benefits. And I think what President Trump is trying to do is appropriate, and it will be successful in the end. 
For example, when we had a 20% tariff here, the first time with President Trump’s presidency, our car prices went up three or four percent, what we found out was, in China, they’re more interested in employment and keeping those plants going than they are in profitability because they’re Chinese-owned anyway. It’s not like a normal company like I have that tries to show a profit. In China they’re trying to show employment. So when people talk about these tariffs and what they mean in pricing, we have no evidence that it’s going up that much. What we’re seeing is many manufacturers saying we’re reducing the amount of the increase and trying to work with the American consumer, that’s particularly true for the folks in Mississippi.
MT: You’ve said that retaining employees and attracting quality employees is a priority for you in business. As far as the labor market is concerned, how should Mississippians be thinking about immigration policy? How does reducing immigration impact the economy here in Mississippi?
Duff: You know, we value every person. Each is important for what they do and in their employment throughout our businesses, and frankly, throughout this state. Getting rid of people that have convictions, have problems that come from other countries, that should be one of the highest priorities of stopping the illegal immigration at the southern border. That is is very important, because we need that stability in our employment. 
We are doing well in finding qualified people to work, and I think that’s one of the reasons that we see a lower labor participation rate in our state, you’ve got to offer people good jobs. But you know what? You’ve got to do more than that. You’ve got to have appropriate child care. You’ve got to have good medical. You’ve got to have the things that attract people to say, ‘Hey, I desire to work.’ 
We need more Mississippians at work and we need to be more attractive in what we offer people. That’s very important, and that’s one of the greatest responsibilities that my brother and I have. Do we offer those types of opportunities? Employment wise, social wise. I mean, having proper nursery care, having proper health care is just as important as your wage in today’s world. 
MT: Sure. And to that end, let’s talk about the social safety net. Of course, private employers play an important role in providing access to health care, but there is a segment of Mississippians that may need to rely on the public benefits. Do you think Mississippi should expand Medicaid? 
Duff: You know, I think there are so many rules about Medicaid expansion, it’s hard to always say I’m in favor of it or not in favor of it. Do people need better medical care in the state of Mississippi? Yes, sir. Do more people need to be included in that? Yes, the health of our state is so important. So we have got to offer those things through businesses, through state assistance that helps all Mississippians have better health care. That’s got to be one of the top responsibilities that we all have. How it’s done in today’s changing political environment? I don’t know what to say, but I do know that it’s got to be of the highest importance, and we need to take care of all Mississippians.
MT: So what you’re saying is you’re neither wedded to expansion nor entirely against it? Are you saying you’re open to all options? 
Duff: I want to know the facts and the facts that are best for the people in Mississippi, and those facts have changed with a new president. So it’s hard to really say until we understand the changing political environment.  
MT: I want to ask you about your conception of “welfare” as well. It’s been a politically charged term for a long time, people have different ideas about what programs should be considered welfare. How do you think about welfare and how it relates to the safety net here?
Duff: Well, we need a safety net that’s appropriate and takes care of needs, especially for people who have those needs. We also need a system where people participate, where they’re paid adequately, where they can take care of their families and take care of themselves. 
So my definition of those things would be, if you can work, you need to work. And it’s not just working, it’s working at a higher level. Some people have jobs that they could easily go to someone else, and they could do higher-level jobs. Can you have a better education? Can you have workforce training? How can you maximize your potential in your job?
MT: You mentioned education and training. You and your brother have invested about $50 million in Mississippi universities. So higher education has been a focus of yours, and the issue of “brain drain” has been one of your central concerns. How would you propose that either yourself or others fix this brain drain issue in Mississippi?
Duff: The first thing we’ve got to do, and it’s not a simple answer, we need to have K-12 education that is excellent. And by having excellent education, you prepare people either for vocational jobs or for going into a four-year college route. But you’ve got to have the basics done. 
We have made rapid progress in that. The Mississippi Miracle is real, and we see that. But the real question is, as everybody else is getting better, can we keep our foot on the accelerator and continue to expand K-12? Now we go to vocational, which is so important. We were talking in a meeting this morning about the vocational needs and of some of our businesses, it’ll amaze you what we pay vocational employees, and I’m glad to see they do really well. They have great incomes, a good living. And I like seeing those things. And then we decide to go with the four-year college route, or however many years you decide to go to college, it is important that they receive a good education.

Education, I can tell you, having served eight years in the Institutions of Higher Learning, Mississippi provides a great education for the money spent, an excellent education. Now, the problem we have in our state is the fact that within three years, half of our college graduates are living somewhere else. That’s our problem. So we have got to start a development in our state of economic activity, and it’s going to come. 
Everybody thinks that we need to grow by hitting home runs and going and finding an Amazon or someone like that to come in. The best way to grow our economy is to take the small businesses and get to know them. There’s no one cookie cutter way for a person to go from seven employees to nine, right? I remember when I had seven employees. I’ve got 15,000 now. So you have to learn to adapt and grow. And if you grow your small businesses, you grow your communities. And if you grow your communities, you grow this state.
And you know, as someone who is one of those employers, we hire 50 college graduates a year in our training programs, in our companies, and it’s a great program. These people get great job opportunities, and frankly, our retention rate is excellent. But you know, it worries me when I have my meetings with these new folks and ask, “Where do you want to live? Why do you want to live there?” And the bulk of these students are from Mississippi colleges, and they say, I want to go to Nashville, Atlanta, Phoenix. I want to live somewhere else. And I’ve never had anybody come in and say, “I want to go live in Greenwood” or “I want to live somewhere around here.” And that concerns me, because we’re letting that problem happen. These are our best and brightest students, and we’re letting them go somewhere else. 
Shame on us for not having those opportunities. That’s what we’ve got to do to grow this state. Population wise, economic wise, social wise, when you have a state that’s prospering economically, you solve a lot of problems.
MT: Before we move on from K-12, do you think that taxpayer dollars should follow students to private schools? Do you think that undermines public education?
Duff: You know, the success of a community is its public school system and its school system, yet every parent deserves the opportunity to make sure their child has the best education that they can get. So is there a place for school choice? Yes, again, the definition of what school choice is goes from left to right, but the overriding consideration needs to be, every parent needs to have a very good hand in their child’s education. And whatever that means, we need to do. So we’re not scared of competing and having great schools, we want them. How does that need to be? I think that’s up to the community and the parent.
MT: Moving on to the Institutions of Higher Learning and politics. I know that most of the work of the IHL just relates to the functionality of the university system. But I want to ask you about your observations of higher education while serving in that capacity, because there’s no denying that college campuses have become a battleground for the culture wars in this state and in the country more broadly. Do you think the state government should play a more active role intervening and regulating the activity of campus life?
Duff: Mississippi pays a good part of the education of college graduates. They should have a say in it, but their say needs to be, how can this student receive the most comprehensive education? 
There’s certainly definitions between liberals and conservatives, what’s important, what’s not important. Some of that’s just part of growing up and learning how to operate. Overall, I would say that our schools present a wonderfully conservative balance of what to do. Two things that I think needs to be done is as I have watched students come in. 
When taxpayer dollars at four year colleges are having to be spent for math and reading and things like that to bring them up to a college level before they even start, that’s an indictment of our K-12 education, and we’ve got to do better in that. 
I (also) think it’s important that we learn more of our civic responsibilities. I don’t think that’s taught as much anymore. What it means to be an American, a Mississippian. What does it mean to be a future member of society, a citizen? The importance of voting. Those type of things need to be added into college curriculums. Learning our constitution, that type of stuff that makes you more well rounded and makes you a better student and adult.
MT: Is there a political thinker that informs your worldview? If you think to yourself, “Where should I come down on a certain issue?” Are there certain leaders or thinkers that you look to for guidance or knowledge?
Duff: I’m a voracious reader. I’m also an avid watcher of newscasts. I like to see all points of view. I’ve always believed if you only had one point of view, that makes you fairly narrow minded. So all points of view are important and you can learn from all of those things, even when you don’t agree. I go into many meetings with our folks and say this is a point of view that’s expressed. It might not be mine, but let’s debate it. Let’s take it apart. Let’s see what’s good about it, what’s bad about it, and we learn from that. So that’s what college is about.
MT: If I could just push you on that a little bit. I appreciate that you consider and take in all points of view. But you do have politics yourself, and you have created a political action committee with a priority to elect conservative candidates. So within the realm of conservatism, I suppose, what sort of conservative are you? Do you identify with a particular political figure? What to you makes a quality conservative leader that you would want to support?

Duff: I am a conservative. I believe that less government is better. I believe that each of us should have the ability to raise our families, to live our lives and to accomplish what our God given abilities are. So I am very conservative. I’m not trying to raise taxes. I’m not trying to have these social things that jump out there. I think that goes with being in families and being an individual.
The political leader that has affected us, certainly in the last 10 years, would be Donald Trump. He has revolutionized not only the Republican Party, but also the way that people view government, whether you like him or disagree with him, and I happen to like him. I think that what he’s doing in his administration is exactly what he said he would do. And I think 75 million people said ‘I like what he says he’s gonna do. I’m gonna vote for him.’ And he’s following through on that example. So he could probably be the one, if you were to ask me, that would have an influence. But his influence comes from vision and leadership. It’s not always his views, just the fact that he says, ‘I feel it should be this way, and I’m going to offer leadership through myself and the folks that I work with, and hopefully there’s buy in from the people that see it.’ 
MT: Yeah, and just jumping off that, I do want to ask directly about the PAC and the purpose behind it. What do you hope to achieve by potentially ushering in a new cohort of leaders in Mississippi?
Duff: That’s what it’s really for, to have conservative minded people take on these responsibilities because they’re very important economically in their communities and statewide. 
Are they the type leaders that will be exemplary moving forward? 
Mississippi has come so far. Our governor has done a great job, but it’s important for the future that we don’t take the foot off the gas pedal, that we move forward. And it will be different than it is today. The growth of things like AI, the growth of the political challenges that we have, you’ve got to have a person who is a leader, who can have a vision for being able to continue moving forward.
MT: Will you run for governor in 2027?
Duff: I love this state. This state has been good to me. I love being a part of this state. If I can assist and help in the leadership of moving forward in this state, I want to be a part of it. But as far as saying I have to have this as a stepping stone or something else, I don’t need that. 
If I can be of service, and enough people believe in that, then perhaps we can all together move Mississippi forward. So that’s where I stand now. This election is 29 months out. 
MT: I want to close by asking you what Mississippians might not know about you that you want them to know as you go and meet more of them and consider this run for governor? 
Duff: I think what I would want Mississippians to know is I’m just like them. I started out in menial labor, growing up in high school, throughout college, basically put myself through college, got involved in a business. I still work 50 to 60 hours every week. I love my family. I’m very devoted to them and involved with them. But we work, my brother and I work hard. We try to be fair and honorable with every person we deal with.
And you can take principles of business and apply it to certain aspects of government. I think that’s where it comes to vision and it comes to leadership. Those are the most important things that I think our state needs, where everybody is working together for a common goal. I don’t expect people to agree with everything I say, but I would hope that people would say ‘he cares, and I hope that’ll be a difference.’",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/24175319/Thomas-Duff-1-1.jpg,,,2025-07-28 06:56:52.622386

Today, thanks to the hard work of the Ways and Means Republicans, we will make those tax cuts permanent and prevent an end of the year tax hike.” — Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va.
Miller apparently believes that the government should run deficits that our children will pay off. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the big, beautiful bill (or more accurately the budget buster bill) — even after accounting for the Medicaid and Affordable Care Act cuts in the bill which will leave countless West Virginia residents without insurance — will still increase budget deficits by $3.4 trillion over the next decade.
I am a proven fiscal conservative who wants a balanced federal budget. Otherwise, we are leaving our children and grandchildren a tremendous crisis which will blow up in their lifetimes, ruining the U.S. economy.
Yes, the national debt is out of control due to both parties. However, only one party currently controls the presidency and Congress — the GOP. Therefore, this column will look at their past spending and recently approved spending bill. Childishly saying, “but look at what the Democrats have done in the past” is unhelpful in analyzing the impact of Trump’s recently passed budget buster bill, which takes Trump’s 2017 temporary tax cuts and makes them permanent. The BBB also cuts Medicaid/ACA, contrary to Trump’s promises.
Trump is a known quantity; he had a first term. One of his 2016 priorities was to push through a package of historic tax cuts, which he did in 2017. In an interview back then with Sean Hannity, he declared that his tax cuts would stimulate the economy, contrary to what the Congressional Budget Office calculated when it estimated almost a $2 trillion increase in debt over a decade.
Trump stated that — due to increased growth — his 2017 cuts would lower, rather than raise, our national debt. So did his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said “at 3% economic growth this tax plan will not only pay for itself but in fact create additional revenue for the government.” The first Trump tax cut did exactly the opposite of what Trump and Mnuchin predicted. Here are the facts.
In 2016, the last year of Barack Obama’s presidency, our annual deficit was an unacceptable $585 billion. However, despite Trump’s promises to the contrary, it grew every year in large part due to his tax cuts. In 2019, prior to COVID-19, it was up to nearly $1 trillion. By 2020, it was over $3 trillion annually. These are the same tax cuts that Trump pushed to make permanent in his recently passed budget buster bill.
Here is who benefits from those tax cuts this year: 

The wealthiest 1% of households will get tax cuts averaging in excess of $60,000
For more normal working-class Americans (i.e. households in the bottom 60%), their tax cut will be less than $500

In 2017, as in 2025, Trump strong-armed Congress into supporting him, against their better judgment. For example, here is what Trump and the Senate’s GOP leader misleadingly stated at the time —

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — “We are totally confident this is a revenue-neutral bill and probably a revenue producer.” 
President Trump —  “We have $21 trillion in debt. When this [tax cut] really kicks in we’ll start paying off that debt like water.”  

The GOP’s BBB increases budget deficits by $3.4 trillion, on top of an already outrageous national debt. The GOP is saddling West Virginia’s children with excessive debt and hypocritically covering it up. Remember this fact when you vote in 2026 and 2028.

(Photo from the CDC)After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled through its shadow docket earlier this month that President Donald Trump could move forward with plans to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, U.S. government employees across Pennsylvania braced themselves.
Philip Glover, the national vice president of the district of the American Federation of Government Employees that covers Pennsylvania and Delaware, says thousands of employees have likely been laid off around the country since the ruling, though exact numbers haven’t been shared with unions yet.
But for employees at the Pittsburgh-area campus for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the ruling only added to a sense of uncertainty that workers say has become a constant of employment under the Trump administration. 
“It’s been the entire range of human emotion,” Suzanne Alison, a steward at the local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees and a NIOSH employee, told the Capital-Star after the ruling. “I haven’t talked to a single person who feels like their job is safe.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While the Supreme Court ruling allowed the Trump administration to move forward with thousands of previously stalled layoffs, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HSS) is tied up in a separate lawsuit moving through a federal District Court in Rhode Island.
Filed by Democratic attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C., the suit argues that layoffs at key divisions of the Health Department, including NIOSH, are being conducted illegally. The judge in that case, Melissa DuBose, has ordered that, for now, the department has to keep those workers until the case moves forward.
The state of Pennsylvania is not part of the lawsuit.
The NIOSH facilities in Allegheny County house two key teams, whose impacts are felt across the country. There’s the coal mine safety division, which houses researchers and scientists studying how to prevent fatalities and injuries in coal mines. And there’s the National Personal Protective Technology Lab, which certifies the nation’s respirators, from the N95 masks that became ubiquitous during the COVID-19 pandemic to specialized devices used by firefighters and Marines.
Federal officials call miners’ health a ‘priority,’ but are cutting a Pa. team studying mine safety

Employees on both teams, with more than 160 federal workers between them, now feel stuck in a holding pattern.
“It feels a lot more precarious.”
For Pennsylvania-based NIOSH employees, nothing has been normal since the beginning of the Trump administration’s efforts to slash the federal workforce. There were the layoffs of probationary employees (workers who have been with the agencies less than one or two years), buyouts and offers of early retirement, and the reduction in force notices, which alerted employees across both divisions that many jobs would be terminated this summer.
A series of lawsuits held up various parts of the downsizing efforts. And federal lawmakers from both parties raised alarms about the impacts of cuts to divisions ensuring the safety of miners.
At a hearing on Capitol Hill in May, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. assured lawmakers that “work on mine safety will continue.” Yet employees of the Pittsburgh mine safety team largely remain on administrative leave, and notices that their jobs will be terminated July 2 remain in effect, though layoffs have been held up by lawsuits. Until the Rhode Island judge rules or HHS reverses course, no one can be laid off.
There were other decisions that impacted their ability to work too. The department, for instance, instituted a communications freeze and a block on work-related travel earlier this year, and credit cards were frozen that were typically used to purchase necessary research materials.
With so many people remaining on administrative leave, many affected mine safety workers are coming into work on a voluntary basis. Brendan Demich, chief steward of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) local chapter that represents the Pittsburgh-area NIOSH employees, and an employee of the coal mine safety division, says morale has dropped.
“It’s really hard to do anything,” he said. “It feels a lot more precarious right now.”
Federal cuts threaten to close Pennsylvania lab that certifies N95s and other respirators in June

Still, some are continuing their work.
Demich’s own team, which is working on a virtual reality training program for mine safety teams, has cut its ambitions and is winding down their work. Now, they’re getting what they can to industry partners in the hopes it can still prove useful.
“These are all people who have been laid off, told they can take administrative leave—basically a paid vacation—and there are still people going into work, essentially voluntarily,” he said.
Employees at the National Personal Protective Technology Lab have had a slightly different experience. In April, many were preparing for their lab — the only one in the country certifying respirators for NIOSH — for permanent closure. Yet, following a May ruling on a class action lawsuit in West Virginia, they learned that the decision to shutter the division had been reversed.
But even those workers have not been able to feel a sense of security. That same month their layoffs were reversed, HHS released a proposed budget for 2026 which listed their division among those having their funding cut.
The coal mine safety team employees, who are still subject to layoffs pending a court ruling, found the opposite. The broader mine safety division would remain funded under the proposed 2026 budget

Employees in both NIOSH divisions in Pittsburgh, as well as their union representatives, say they’ve sought clarification from leaders at the U.S. Health and Human Service Department, NIOSH, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But they’ve been met with silence.
Spokespeople for HHS and the CDC did not respond to questions from the Pennsylvania Capital-Star seeking clarity.
“We haven’t had anything communicated to us through official channels,” said Demich. “Our division leader is communicative with what they know, but there’s a breakdown of communication from the higher levels of HHS. Our division leaders are finding things out about the same time our front line employees are.”
Democratic congressmen from Pennsylvania have also weighed in, with all seven in the 17-member House delegation signing onto a letter last month asking the agency to reverse its decision to lay off people in the mine safety division.
In recent weeks, lawyers for Health and Human Services moved to have the case blocking layoffs across NIOSH dismissed, arguing the U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to fire thousands of federal workers applied to them as well. The judge shot down the argument.

HHS lawyers also argued earlier this month that layoffs should be allowed in states like Pennsylvania that are not a party to the lawsuit. They argue the current court-ordered pause is too broad following another recent Supreme Court ruling effectively ended nationwide injunctions.

(Getty Images)A group of lawyers who defend people facing capital punishment has asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to take extraordinary action to restrict a prosecutor’s use of the death penalty.
Washington County District Attorney Jason Walsh filed notices of his intent to pursue sentences of death in 11 out of 18 homicide cases his office has prosecuted since he took office in 2021, according to a petition the Atlantic Center for Capital Representation filed this week.
Listen to Peter and Emily’s audio recap: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/27eppkWASCOweb.mp3
 
The filing alleges that in two pending cases, Walsh is pursuing the death penalty without evidence to support it. And it outlines a pattern in which Walsh’s office has allegedly held other defendants for trial for capital murder without establishing the basic facts required to support their charges.
Earlier this month, a Washington County judge dismissed criminal homicide and other charges against a Donora woman who was held for nearly four years while Walsh pursued the death penalty against her. In dismissing the charges, the judge stated the prosecutor’s theory was “based wholly on speculation.”
The Atlantic Center made the request on behalf of two clients, Jordan Clarke and Joshua George, who are charged separately in the deaths of their infant children. It alleges Walsh is seeking the death penalty against them despite scant evidence that the deaths were intentional or especially cruel, heinous or depraved warranting the ultimate punishment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Walsh, who became district attorney after his predecessor’s death and was elected as a Republican in 2023, called the Atlantic Center’s filing a “liberal smear campaign” by an anti-death penalty group. 
“I pursue the death penalty consistently in cases where the death penalty fits,” Walsh told the Capital-Star. “The petition is false, misleading and untrue.”
Marc Bookman, executive director of the Philadelphia-based center, said prosecutors are entrusted with the discretion to seek the death penalty, but must provide evidence to establish certain elements of the crime before doing so. Bookman said Walsh is abusing that discretion. 
“We’re not offended by him because he’s tough on crime,” Bookman said. “I have a problem because he doesn’t appear to know the law and he’s seeking the death penalty viciously when it doesn’t apply.”
Under Pennsylvania law, the death penalty may be applied only when the killing at issue was intentional and there is at least one aggravating factor, Jules Epstein, a professor at Temple University Beasley School of Law, said.
Aggravating factors can include when the victim is a police officer or other first responder, murder for hire, torture, killing in the commission of another felony and more than a dozen other circumstances. 
Epstein, who has reviewed hearing transcripts, said the cases are indicative of problems in Washington County’s criminal justice system that extend beyond the district attorney’s office. He noted that magisterial district judges, who conduct preliminary hearings, have a responsibility to determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to support the charges. 
To support a first-degree murder charge required for the death penalty, prosecutors are required to show evidence that the defendants’ had a criminal intent before the killing, such as an action or statement beforehand. 
Without such evidence, “The only proof is that it’s a tragic accident,” Epstein said. “And that district judge should say, ‘The proper charge here is third-degree murder.’”
In the cases at issue in the petition, that didn’t happen.
“Why a prosecutor, in a case that is so clear, would seek the death penalty when the law says you can’t do it … is a problem,” he said. “And if it happens more than once, … as someone who’s been involved in capital case work a long time, that’s a system breakdown.”
The petition asks the Supreme Court to employ its “King’s Bench power” to intervene in the cases and prevent Walsh from pursuing the death penalty. It also asks the court to establish supervision over the Washington County District Attorney’s Office by a special master and prohibit it from pursuing the death penalty without approval from an out-of-county judge.
It also asks the court to order the office to consult with the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office before seeking the death penalty and to appoint a judge from another county to review every death penalty case charged since 2021. 
In the case of Clarke, the petition alleges, Walsh filed homicide charges and notice of aggravating factors to pursue the death penalty before the manner of his two-month-old son’s death had been determined. It also claims Walsh attempted to improperly influence the death investigation.
Prosecutors allege Clarke killed Sawyer by shaking him in their McMurray home. Clarke, who lives with mobility issues as a result of a car crash when he was a child, told detectives he had tripped over a plastic bag and fell on his son. Clark’s grandfather and aunt were in the house at the time of the incident and called 911, the petition says.
Sawyer was taken to Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh, where he ultimately died on May 24, 2022. The Allegheny County medical examiner determined the cause of death to be bleeding on the brain and the manner of death was undetermined. Walsh, however, obtained a court order from Judge John DiSalle directing that an autopsy be performed by a Washington County coroner’s office pathologist, despite the child’s death in Allegheny County.
The Washington County Coroner’s Office determined the cause of death was blunt-force trauma to the head and torso due to “shaken baby syndrome/abusive trauma” and declared the death a homicide. Although Allegheny County issued a death certificate, Coroner Timothy Warco filed a second certificate listing the death as a homicide, which the state Department of Health rejected.
Clarke was held on criminal homicide and related charges after a preliminary hearing where Warco testified that the results of Sawyer’s autopsy were still pending. A physician testified the injuries were consistent with shaken baby syndrome, despite not having reviewed medical records prior to the child’s fatal injury, the petition says.
The Atlantic Center alleges the testimony was insufficient to establish that Clarke intended to kill his son. It also argues that the aggravating factors, including torture, are also not supported by the evidence. 
George also faces the death penalty for the death of his son Oliver, who died after becoming ill in December 2021. Prosecutors allege George killed Oliver by shaking him and causing head trauma.
Oliver did not show indications of illness or injury until several hours after George had left him and his two other children at their grandmother’s house. The petition alleges that the district attorney’s office withheld the testimony of the pathologist who conducted Oliver’s autopsy and ultimately testified that the child would have shown signs of trauma immediately after suffering the injury.
Although the petition requests that the district attorney’s office be barred from pursuing the death penalty in the case of the Atlantic Center’s two clients, it also details the cases of three others who were held in jail for years awaiting capital murder trials.
According to the petition, Walsh’s office sought the death penalty for Jah Zhanee Inifi Sutton in connection to the murder of a man at a Donora convenience store. 
Prosecutors alleged that Sidney McLean and Devell Christian shot and killed the man in February 2021. Based on the discovery of Sutton’s DNA on a bullet casing at the scene of the killing and her alleged relationship with McClean, the district attorney’s office charged Sutton with conspiracy to commit homicide and possession of an instrument of crime.

At a preliminary hearing, a state police trooper testified Sutton was not at the scene of the killing and that it was likely her DNA on the casing. Pressed by Walsh, who asked if it was possible Sutton was waiting in a car outside during the shooting, the trooper testified “anything’s possible.” 
Sutton was held on the charges and Walsh filed a notice that he would seek the death penalty. When Sutton’s attorney notified Walsh that none of her charges qualified for a death sentence, Walsh simply added criminal homicide to her charges.
Nearly four years after her arrest, Judge Traci L. McDonald dismissed the charges after finding the trooper’s speculation about Sutton’s whereabouts during the killing was insufficient to sustain first-degree murder charges, particularly when the death penalty was on the table.
“Four long and fearful years after the Commonwealth improperly (and absurdly) sought the death penalty based on virtually no evidence, the Washington County courts finally held the Commonwealth to its burden. This was cold comfort for Ms. Sutton,” the Atlantic Center’s petition says.
The filing also outlines the cases of James Riley May IV and Shannon McKnight, who faced capital punishment for the drug-induced death of their three-month-old daughter. The couple called 911 after finding the baby unresponsive and an investigation found she died from ingesting fentanyl.
In a preliminary hearing, Walsh presented testimony that there was drug paraphernalia scattered in the bedroom where the couple slept with their children. According to the petition, their one-year-old son was also found to have indications of cocaine in his system.
“There was no testimony establishing any particular actions that either defendant had taken, how the baby had been exposed to the fentanyl, or any fact that would show that either of them had the intent to kill,” the filing says.
After 2½ years under the threat of the death sentence, May and McKnight each pleaded guilty to drug delivery resulting in death.
“If DA Walsh is allowed to continue abusing his discretion in seeking death sentences, other defendants facing capital trials in Washington County will give up their right to trial to avoid an illegal threat of death,” the petition argues. 
Walsh said the age of the victims in the challenged cases alone constitute an aggravating factor that supports the death penalty and their injuries leave little doubt about intent.
“When babies have fractured skulls and are beaten to death, that’s intentional,” he said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/gavel-bang-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-28 05:56:12.160985

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island says the state’s Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) gave inadequate notice to nearly 30,000 Rhode Island motorists who received late renewal forms for vehicle registrations set to expire in July.
Vehicle registrations that were originally scheduled to go out June 11 were all sent by July 14 after “a failed computer file transfer” halted their mailing by about a month, said DMV spokesperson Paul Grimaldi.
As a result of the delay, 29,145 affected vehicle owners now have through Aug. 31 to renew their registration — which can be done online.
The delay was announced via a news release on July 11 and is featured at the top of the DMV’s website.
“We appreciate our customers’ patience and understanding as we worked quickly to resolve this issue,” DMV Administrator Walter “Bud” Craddock said in the July 11 statement.
In a July 17 letter to Craddock, ACLU of Rhode Island Executive Director Steven Brown commended the DMV for the extension but said he believed most of the affected drivers were likely unaware of their forms getting sent out late.
“Absent receipt of a timely notice sent out by the vendor, they may not realize that their registration is expiring, much less that this extension has been granted,” Brown wrote. “The same lack of knowledge may hold true for police departments across the state.”







Drivers caught operating with an expired registration face an $85 fine. Registrations that have been suspended because of lapsed insurance or expired inspection can be reinstated for a fee of $253.50, Grimaldi said.







Brown asked what steps the DMV took to ensure police don’t pull over drivers next month still awaiting their updated tags.
In his response Wednesday, Craddock wrote that a notice was sent to the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association and that Rhode Island State Police were tasked with posting it on the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System.
“While this is considered ample time for individuals to renew their registrations, the decision was made to extend the renewal period in case some were out of state for summer vacation,” Craddock wrote.
Sidney Wordell, executive director for the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association, confirmed via text message that notices were received and distributed to all municipal police departments. Rhode Island State Police Lt. Col. Robert Creamer also confirmed that agency posted the required notice to the national system.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Anyone who has tried to buy or rent a home lately in Rhode Island has seen firsthand the impacts of the state’s housing shortage, including bidding wars to access homeownership or significant yearly rent increases for tenants. The median sales price of a single-family home in Rhode Island rose to $520,000 as of June, 2025, according to the Rhode Island Association of Realtors, and rental costs in the Providence metro area climbed at one of the fastest rates in the nation, reflected in a median asking rent of $2,145.
A root problem is that Rhode Island is building fewer homes per capita than any other state in the nation. We need 24,000 homes just to meet today’s needs. With an average household size of 2.4, and a lower median household income than our neighboring states, new housing production must include smaller and more affordable options. 
A recent Stateline story in Rhode Island Current detailed the impacts of the lack of homes for sale that are affordable options for teachers, highlighting that the housing crisis does not discriminate. Workers across all sectors and all educational backgrounds are impacted. The lack of homes in Rhode Island prevents teachers, child care workers, and retail workers from living in the communities they serve. 
There is a profound irony in the fact that even builders of homes are priced out. Consider that someone earning the average income of a skilled trades worker with four-plus years of experience — $68,717 — is unable to afford most homes on the market in Rhode Island. A family of four now needs an annual income of $151,067 to purchase a home. This is dispiriting news for our state’s hardworking residents trying to secure a future for themselves and their families.  










With an average household size of 2.4, and a lower median household income than our neighboring states, new housing production must include smaller and more affordable options. 


The status quo has consequences; it pushes young people out of the communities they grew up in, as they move away in search of more affordable housing options. The lack of home choices stops older adults from downsizing into a more accessible home, putting them in a situation of maintaining a home that is too large, too expensive, or too difficult to move around in. 
Allowing more types of homes can help address this shortage. That’s why we are thankful to the Rhode Island General Assembly for passing 10 housing-related bills. Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island championed five in particular that will allow more homes — and more naturally affordable home types, such as townhomes or apartments in mixed use areas — to be built.
Among them is a new law that removes obstacles for townhomes and another law that allows smaller residences to be developed above retail spaces. 
Townhomes are a great option for a first-time home buyer, or an older adult seeking to downsize. Slightly smaller, with less yard to take care of, these attached homes are often less expensive due to their smaller size and the sharing of land costs across multiple households. Legalizing townhomes in communities across Rhode Island will put more homeownership opportunities within reach of teachers, young adults just starting their families, and older neighbors who are looking to downsize. 
State lawmakers also passed legislation to make it easier to build what are now called mixed-use developments to replace empty office buildings or aging strip malls with the kind of homes on walkable main streets so many people want to live in, with spaces for living and spaces for commerce together in one area. 
These policies are popular with voters. Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island recently conducted polling showing 88% public support for the state to do more to expand housing choices. We found that 70% of voters support allowing townhomes to be built anywhere other homes are built, and 87% support allowing homes to be built near jobs, shopping centers, in aging strip malls, or near transit. 
These are policies and strategies we can use to build more home types so that every Rhode Islander has a choice about where they live, and what type of home they live in that isn’t solely dictated by cost. But they’re not the only ways we can give more choices to Rhode Islanders looking to find the homes they need here in the Ocean State. We made progress this legislative session, but there is much more to do. We look forward to more collaboration with the General Assembly next year.
 



5 legislative wins for new housing production in Rhode Island
The Rhode Island General Assembly passed these bills championed by Neighbors Welcome! Rhode Island in the 2025 session. Gov. Dan McKee signed them into law in late June and early July.
Mixed-Use Zones: H5800 | S1090A
Underused commercial land served by public infrastructure, aging strip malls and vacant commercial lots are an opportunity to build new homes and mixed-use neighborhoods while preserving the state’s farmlands and forests. This law allows cities and towns to apply mixed-use overlays in commercial zones where appropriate, ensuring new homes are not built near heavy industry or other environmental nuisances.
Electronic Permitting: H5803Aaa | S1087
Rhode Island has made significant progress in reducing delays by creating a new online permitting system, but many state and local permits remain to be added to the platform. This law empowers the Department of Business Regulation to continue expanding e-permitting, speeding up new home construction and creating cost-savings that can be passed on to residents.
Oversized Lot Splits: H5794B | S1086Aaa
This law allows double lots to be subdivided for new homes as long as the newly created lots resemble nearby parcels, maintaining neighborhood character. For example, a 10,000-square foot lot surrounded by 5,000-square foot lots could be divided in two.
Townhomes: H5798Aaa/S1083A
Townhomes offer a path to homeownership at a more affordable price point and are significantly easier for builders to finance compared to condominiums. This law allows for townhomes in residential zoning districts at reasonable levels of density, depending on the type of community, while allowing cities and towns to retain control over key design characteristics.
Building Code Changes: H5804A | S1089Aaa
New triple-deckers or other small multifamily buildings in Rhode Island have had to meet the same commercial building code requirements as high rises, shopping malls, and hospitals. That’s cost-prohibitive. So this law reclassifies three- and four-family homes as residential, making these homes more cost- effective to build while maintaining the high safety standards of modern construction.

The North Dakota Department of Agriculture last week announced the award of a $300,000 grant for drone scouting in the 2025 and 2026 growing seasons. The project aims to help weed control officials respond to new infestations quickly.
Grand Farm, a research organization with a campus near Casselton, is taking the lead on the project.
Grand Farm celebrates first building to foster ag innovation

Nathan Marcotte, senior program manager of technology and innovation at Grand Farm, said the state grant helps continue a first phase of the project that involves teaching an artificial intelligence system what a weed looks like by feeding it hundreds of photos of the plants at different growth stages and other variables, such as different times of the day. 
Marcotte said researchers will be working with farmers and weed officers in five southeastern counties — Barnes, Cass, Richland, Steele and Traill. The project will focus on soybean and sugar beet fields.
Marcotte said an initial phase of the project targeted Palmer amaranth, an herbicide-resistant weed with a limited presence in North Dakota but with the ability to spread quickly. The next phase will build on that work, he said. 
“The focus is, within those five counties, to build up a weed image library and model so it can detect more than just Palmer amaranth,” Marcotte said. 
Fields found to have weeds will remain confidential and identified at the county level only, the Ag Department said. 
The funding for this program was approved during the 2025 North Dakota legislative session. 
Grand Farm is leading the research project partners including Thales, an aerospace company, iSight Drone Services that provides the drones, and North Dakota State University. 
Marcotte said landowners will be advised of any drone flyovers before they take place. Farmers and property owners interested in participating in the project can email info@grandfarm.com.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Despite Trump administration rhetoric accusing Democrats of protecting violent criminals and drug-dealing immigrants, the administration’s arrests have been catching a smaller share of criminals overall, and a smaller share of people convicted of violent and drug crimes, than the Biden administration did in the same time frame.
While the Trump administration has caught more immigrants with convictions for drugs and violence, their share of the rising arrest numbers is smaller, as more people get swept up for minor traffic violations or strictly immigration crimes, according to a Stateline analysis.
Forty percent of the nearly 112,000 arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Jan. 20 through late June were of convicted criminals. That’s compared with 53% of the nearly 51,000 arrests for same time period in 2024 under the Biden administration.


The share of people convicted of violent crime fell from 10% to 7% and drug crimes from 9% to 5%, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project.
The project, led by attorneys and professors in California, Maryland and New York, collects and posts public, anonymized U.S. government immigration enforcement datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Some Democratic states are among those with the highest share of violent criminals in this year’s ICE arrests: Hawaii (15%), Vermont (13%), and California and Nebraska (12%) — while some of the lowest shares were in more Republican states: Maine (2%), and Alabama, Montana and Wyoming (3%).
Immigration attorneys see an increased push to arrest and detain immigrants for any type of violation or pending charge as President Donald Trump pushes for higher arrest and detention numbers to meet his campaign promise for mass deportation. Trump officials have called for 3,000 arrests a day, far more than the current average of 711 as of June and 321 a day during the same time period under Biden.










The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling.


– Oregon Republican state Rep. Cyrus Javadi


Arrests have accelerated since about mid-May, when government attorneys began asking to revoke bail and arrest people who show up for court hearings after being released at the border, said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 16,000 immigration attorneys.
“We’re not completely sure what the reasoning or the goal is behind some of these policies, other than they want detention numbers up,” Dojaquez-Torres said.
“They seem to have really been struggling to get their deportation numbers up, and so I think that’s one of the reasons why we see a lot of these policies going into effect that are meant to kind of circumvent the immigration court process and due process.”
Arrests of people convicted of violent crimes increased by 45% from about 5,300 to 7,700 compared with last year. For drug crimes, the increase was 21% — and they fell as a share of total arrests, from 9% under the Biden administration to 5% this year.
Arrests for those not convicted of any crime nearly tripled to about 67,000, and increased from 47% to 60% of arrests.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended ICE arrests Wednesday. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the agency was “targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens and taking them off American streets. Violent thugs ICE arrested include child pedophiles, drug traffickers, and burglars.”
In Oregon, arrests during the first part of last year increased from 51 under the Biden administration to 227 under the Trump administration, with those not convicted of any crime increasing from 34 to 137. Those with convictions for violent crime increased from 3 to 16. Even some Republicans are concerned with the new emphasis on non-criminals.
“The majority of recent ICE detentions involve people with no convictions. That’s a pattern I find troubling, especially when it risks sweeping up people for things like expired tags or missed court dates,” said Oregon state Rep. Cyrus Javadi, a moderate Republican representing Tillamook and Clatsop counties.
Nationally, nonviolent crimes have risen as a share of immigration arrests. The most common crime conviction for those arrested this year is driving while intoxicated, which was also the top offense last year under Biden.
But this year it’s closely followed by general traffic offenses, which rose to second place from sixth place, surpassing such crimes as assault and drug trafficking.
Traffic offenses, outside of driving while intoxicated and hit and run, rose almost fourfold as the most serious conviction on record for those arrested, the largest increase in the top 10. Those offenses were followed by increases in the immigration crime of illegal entry, meaning crossing the border in secret, which tripled.
The increase in traffic violations as a source of immigration arrests is a reason for cities to consider limiting traffic stops, said Daniela Gilbert, director of the Redefining Public Safety Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit devoted to ending mass incarceration.
“It’s an important point to consider intervening in so that there can be less interaction, and so ICE has less opportunity to continue its indiscriminate dragnet of enforcement,” Gilbert said.
The institute argues in general that traffic stops should be limited to safety issues rather than low-level infractions such as expired registrations or single burned-out taillights, both because they do not improve public safety and because they disproportionately affect drivers of color.
Such policies limiting stops under some conditions are in place in 10 states and in cities in six other states, according to the institute.
The most recent state polices took effect last year in California and Illinois, while a policy is set to take effect in October in Connecticut. The most recent city policies were in Denver and in East Lansing and Ypsilanti, Michigan. Six other states have considered legislation recently.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, has been named the 2025 recipient of the Chief Standing Bear Prize for Courage.
Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and a former U.S. congresswoman, served as Interior Secretary during the Biden Administration.She will be presented with the award during a ceremony Oct. 13 — Indigenous Peoples’ Day — at the Lied Center for Performing Arts in Lincoln.
The award is given annually by the Chief Standing Bear Project, a nonprofit group founded in 2022 to recognize those who embody the spirit of Ponca Chief Standing Bear. It was Standing Bear’s legal fight with the U.S. government that led to the recognition of Native Americans as “persons” under the law.
A Project official said that Haaland, a 35th generation New Mexican, is being recognized for overcoming financial hardship as a single mother to earn a law degree and become the first Native American woman to lead a state political party, one of the first Native American women elected to Congress and becoming the first Cabinet Secretary,
“Former Secretary Haaland’s life and leadership reflect the many forms that courage can take — quiet resilience, determination in the face of hardship and the willingness to lead, even when the path is uncertain,” said Katie Brossy, board president of the Chief Standing Bear Project.
As Interior Secretary, Haaland addressed the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous people and helped the nation confront the painful legacy of federal boarding schools.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Woonsocket City Councilor James Cournoyer wasn’t shocked to see Fitch Ratings pull its credit ratings for the city on July 14 for failing to turn in a fiscal 2023 audit, among other financial statements. 
“The only surprise was that it took them as long as it did,” said Cournoyer.
Moody’s Ratings yanked its bond ratings in October for the same reason; S&P Global Ratings lowered its rating of city water bonds the next month. 
Without bond ratings, the northern Rhode Island city with the sixth largest population in the state can’t borrow any money to pay for future capital projects like schools or infrastructure upgrades — not an immediate concern for Cournoyer since the city isn’t planning to issue bonds. Much more distressing is the disarray of city finances, including the still-incomplete fiscal 2023 audit, now more than 18 months overdue.
A newly hired city finance director and promise of near completion on the overdue report offer a glimmer of hope. Not that the problem ends there.
“We’re digging ourselves out of a hole, a deep hole,” said Cournoyer, who works as a finance director for Textron, Inc. “We’re grappling with 10 years of a Lisa Baldelli-Hunt regime. She basically destroyed the financial organization in the city of Woonsocket. Now, we’re left to clean up.”

Baldelli-Hunt, Woonsocket’s former mayor, resigned on Nov. 9, 2023 in the wake of a land purchase that violated the city charter’s rules around notice to the council, and appeared to be a sweetheart deal with her former boss. The deal was uncovered and reported by WPRI-TV 12 in October 2023. No criminal charges have resulted. But her specter continues to haunt city hall, as city officials grapple with the fallout from her decade of leadership. 
Baldelli-Hunt’s resignation came less than two months before the Dec. 31, 2023 deadline by which all cities and towns across Rhode Island are required under state law to turn in an audited financial report to the Rhode Island Office of the Auditor General. 
Punctuality is not a new problem, nor one isolated to Woonsocket, as municipalities nationwide struggle to turn in financial reports amid staff vacancies and the rapid decline of accounting firms able and willing to perform local government audits, said David Bergantino, the state auditor general.
A year ago, in July 2024, two other municipalities, East Providence and Coventry, had also failed to submit their fiscal 2023 audited statements to the auditor general, according to the office’s compliance report. Both have since turned in the reports, Bergantino confirmed Thursday. Woonsocket, on the other hand, has not.
The price of paperwork problems 
Its lack of timely financial reporting doesn’t just risk bond ratings. It also compromises the city’s ability to form an accurate spending plan for the current fiscal year — risking major deficits if it underestimates expenses or overshoots revenue, Bergantino said.
“At this point, we’re in fiscal 2026,” Bergantino noted. “When you don’t have the prior fiscal year done, or the last two, it impacts current operations.”
Not to mention the separate but also overdue audited statements to the federal government on how the city spent federal pandemic aid and routine grant funding. Baldelli-Hunt’s land deal relied on $1.1 million in federal funding to buy a five-acre plot of vacant land for use as affordable housing.
 The city has since reversed the deal and commissioned a $15,000 investigation — later forwarded to law enforcement — that detailed her negotiations with her former boss, who owned the land, on the purchase price, as well as her concerted efforts to keep the transaction secret from staff and the city council — violating the city’s charter, according to news reports. But the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant funds Baldelli-Hunt tried to use to buy the land could leave the city vulnerable to federal repercussions for misusing its money, said John Ward, former city council president who unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2024.










We’re grappling with 10 years of a Lisa Baldelli-Hunt regime. She basically destroyed the financial organization in the city of Woonsocket. Now, we’re left to clean up.


– Woonsocket City Councilor James Cournoyer


Ward, who retired after 17 years as finance director for the town of Lincoln in 2023, made the city’s financial state a key part of his campaign. He lost the November 2024 nonpartisan mayoral race by 3 percentage points to Mayor Christopher Beauchamp, who took over the mayoral post after Baldelli-Hunt resigned in 2023.
Leading into the election, Woonsocket’s paperwork problem took a turn for the worse after the accounting firm hired to audit its financial statements abruptly quit, also first reported by WPRI. 
In a May 28, 2024 letter to the council, Mary Sahady, principal for Hague, Sahady & Co., listed five reasons for the decision, including continued rescheduling of meetings, missing reports and untimely and incomplete responses to the firm’s requests for information. Sahady also referenced an accusation made by some council members at a May 22 meeting that Baldelli-Hunt swayed the firm’s prior audit reports.
Ward and Cournoyer blamed the firm’s resignation squarely on Baldelli-Hunt, even though she had left city hall six months before.
“The issues surrounding their resignation all related to the games and misinformation and delays occurring under the Baldelli-Hunt administration, without question,” Cournoyer said. “I don’t care who the next mayor was, they would be in the same position after inheriting the mess they got from her.”
Beauchamp declined to answer any questions for this story.

The blame game
Baldelli-Hunt pointed the finger back at the city leaders still in office.
“How many years do I need to be gone before they start to realize I am not the problem?” she said in an interview Thursday. 
Baldelli-Hunt touted the city’s financial accomplishments under her tenure as mayor, from the brink of receivership when she started in 2013 to a balanced budget, less debt and strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies. 
“I turned the city of Woonsocket around,” she said. “I took the bond rating from junk to stable and positive. I did a hell of a job in this city and I am proud of it.”
She continued, “Maybe, potentially, they’re just ill-equipped to handle things.”
Sahady’s letter reinforces Baldelli-Hunt’s final point, noting that insufficient city financial staff has led to inadequate tracking of its money. When Beauchamp became mayor in November 2023, he immediately fired the city’s finance director. The city has since struggled to hold on to a permanent replacement, relying on a longtime finance department employee Christine Chamberland to serve as interim finance director for a majority of the next 20 months.










How many years do I need to be gone before they start to realize I am not the problem?


– Former Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt


Meanwhile, Sahady’s surprise resignation sent the city scrambling to find a new accounting firm to audit its financial statements. Sahady had already completed more than 80 hours of fieldwork and meetings on the fiscal 2023 audit — with a $8,554 cost, according to the bill included with the resignation letter.
The subsequent contract with CBIZ forced the city to start the process over with the new, more expensive firm. Cournoyer estimates the city has spent more than $300,000 for CBIZ to audit its fiscal 2023 statements based on the agreed-upon hourly rate.
In May 2025, CBIZ submitted a draft audit report to the City Council for review, with the caveat that the report remains unfinished, awaiting major updates including lengthy and detailed financial disclosures from the lawsuits filed against the city, which continue to multiply. The cases are mostly unrelated to the land deal, spanning disputes over allegedly inaccurate property tax assessments, the environmental and health effects of improperly treated sewage flowing into the Blackstone River, and the wrongful arrest of an unhoused person. The fired former finance director, Cindy Johnston, has also sued the city, alleging her termination violates anti-discrimination laws related to her disability, The Valley Breeze reported. 
“As every day goes by, any new lawsuit or new activity also has to be disclosed,” Cournoyer said.
The draft audit has not been made public, but a copy was obtained by Rhode Island Current. The 200-page report shows the city ended fiscal year 2023 $165.5 million in the red, due to $248.1 million overspent through its general, government spending account, partially offset by revenue gains in its separate funds for water and wastewater treatment services. 
CBIZ does not include any commentary on the city’s fiscal 2023 financial performance, which saw a $5.6 million decline in its net position compared with the prior year.
But Cournoyer fears that even after the audited report is finally finished, and resubmitted to Fitch and Moody’s, the city’s new credit rating will not be as strong because of its deficit.
Fitch rated Woonsocket’s bonds at an A+ in July 2024, while Moody’s upgraded its assessment of the city’s bonds to “Baa2” in October 2023. Both are considered investment-worthy grades, though not the strongest possible ratings.
Calling in financial cavalry 
One spot of rare good news is the city’s newly hired finance director, James Lathrop, who started on July 21. Some might not view the $145,000-a-year job of putting the city’s broken financials back together as worth the headache. Lathrop was unfazed.
“This is no more difficult than anything I’ve done in Chester and Lansdale,” Lathrop said of his most recent two jobs resuscitating a pair of Pennsylvania municipalities from receivership and multimillion-dollar bank statement discrepancies, respectively. 
A former 2022 Republican state general treasurer candidate and Bryant University graduate, Lathrop has made a career of helping cities and towns escape difficult financial situations, including others in Rhode Island. He expects Woonsocket’s fiscal 2023 audit to be finished and ready to submit in the next two weeks, with plans to immediately begin the also overdue fiscal 2024 audit. 
Ward still has his doubts.
“This is not just about being a good bookkeeper,” he said of sorting through the tranche of mismatched and missing reports spanning three or more years. “This is about, can you play chess?

(Shannon Heckt/ Virginia Mercury)Amazon Web Services pulled an application for a 7.2 million square foot data center in Louisa County last week, after a surge of resident opposition. Concerns remain, however, over the impact of the county’s three other data centers that are in different stages of development, none of which were required to go through the conditional use permitting process that allows for more community input.
Virginia doesn’t have statewide data center regulations. Localities are making their own rules.

“We have heard the community and appreciate the desire for more robust input in any future projects that may be brought forward in the county, and we are confident that this is a goal that can be accomplished.” said Charles W. Payne, Jr., an attorney representing AWS.
Residents gathered Thursday night in the community center of a Baptist church in the rural town of Mineral. Many said they felt lighter knowing one project is, at least for now, off the table. Some people passed out stickers that read “Don’t Loudoun my Louisa” — a reference to the proliferation of data centers in Northern Virginia — and yard signs urging the board of supervisors to say “no” to more data centers..

“We’re letting or even entertaining the idea of a billion dollar corporation coming around and messing with our drinking water. I think it’s pretty humiliating,” Louisa resident Brittany Carroll said.
Loudoun County has one of the highest concentrations of data centers in the state. Conversely, winding roads cut through pockets of forest and farmland that stretch far and wide in Louisa. Some Louisa residents fear Loudoun’s level of development would destroy the rural nature of their community.
The county has been open to the digital industry since 2018 when the Technology Overlay District was developed, Lousia County Supervisor Duane Adams said.
A few dozen community members attended the informal meeting about the data centers already in the works, one of multiple held since the third AWS application was announced. The crowd audibly grumbled during discussion of the AWS campuses already approved with by-right permits.
AWS proposed the third data center to be one of the largest in the area by far. The 1370-acre plot near the Northeast Creek Reservoir prompted concerns about construction near schools in the area and how much water would be needed to cool the systems inside the building. The land is currently zoned for agricultural use and is used for timber production, adding to concerns of losing the rural land.

After the latest application was filed, community members took to social media and local meetings to share worries and debate over possible sound pollution, loss of agricultural land, and the rapid rate of development. Some people went so far as to say they felt betrayed by the board of supervisors for agreeing to the initial two AWS sites. Adams sees the tension as an opportunity for community collaboration.
“We threw the nets out, we went fishing and we landed two big fish. So we accomplished our goal. [We shrank] the technology overlay district,” Adams said. “Then let’s be very deliberate as we move forward with this, and that’s when we added the CUP process, which is why you see the engagement with the community. I think that’s really positive.”
AWS already has two data centers in the works in the county’s Technological Overlay District (TOD) that allowed the facilities to be permitted by-right, meaning the public had less of a say in the project. In 2024, the county Board of Supervisors revised the TOD to be smaller and to add the conditional use permit for future projects to allow the public to be part of the process.
Amazon has invested $35 billion into the commonwealth, with $11 billion of that being in Louisa county for the two AWS data centers. 
Adams has been very supportive of the two data centers in the county. A third proposal is being considered as EdgeCore recently purchased 697 acres in the Shannon Hill business park to build a 3.9 million square foot facility. However, that proposal includes a closed loop cooling system and does not have as heavy of impacts on community water sources. Some at the public meeting felt the project was far enough away from residences that light and sound would not be a major concern.
“We’re going to see one of the data centers on the existing campuses come online (by the end of the year). So we’re going to see some of the things that we’ve talked about in the abstract actually become hard base facts, and that’s water usage, employment opportunities, tax revenue …I’m taking a long view of this. I don’t think there’s a rush,” Adams said.
The town Council of Mineral, which lies to the east of the TOD,  published an opposition to the new proposed AWS project in June over concerns of traffic from construction, noise pollution, water use, and other concerns brought to their attention by residents.
The Piedmont Environmental Council, who presented facts about data centers at the meeting, acknowledged the draw of building data centers is the tax revenue for the county through personal property tax and real estate taxes. But the computers inside of data centers rapidly depreciate, decreasing that revenue for the county.
“More folks need to be concerned about putting all their eggs in the data center revenue basket because it can be a really risky move. Loudoun County at the height of the pandemic had a $60 million budget shortfall because two of their data centers were not able to refresh their computing equipment as scheduled due to supply chain issues,” said Sarah Parmelee, land use field representative with the Piedmont Environmental Council.
Parmelee went on to say while data centers are essential for internet use, the demand has exploded due to the growth in AI technology. There are now questions about how long that demand will last and if all the proposed data centers will come to fruition. Microsoft recently canceled two gigawatts worth of data center leases across the U.S. and Europe, claiming their existing data centers have them on track to meet the current demand. It leaves Parmelee and other Virginians with more questions.
“We need to slow down, we need to start really looking at these things and asking how many of them do we actually need?  How many of them can we actually support without throwing away everything that makes Virginia an awesome place to live, work and play?” Parmelee said.
Louisa resident Savannah Walker works in the data center industry with nearly 20 years of experience. She said the third AWS site was too large of a facility without the proper infrastructure in the county in place to support it. She had taken charge in the community effort to get educated on the project and speak out about concerns.
“We have to have them. It is what it is. It’s today’s world. However, there’s a time and a place for them,” Walker said.
Some residents floated the idea of putting a moratorium on data centers in Louisa County. 
Adams said with the revisions to the TOD that now required a conditional use permit and heavy public involvement, it will already be more of a challenge for future proposals to get through. He said it is a positive thing to see the public involved in the process and that residents get to have more of a say in what is allowed to be built.
The letter from the attorney representing AWS didn’t specify if the company would ever come back with a future application in the county. Some residents are gearing up for another round.
“They’re going to be back; we have to control how it happens,” Walker said.

Virginia consumers probably noticed it for the first time when they saw pop-up notices while they were shopping online. 
Senate Bill 754, the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, put protections in state law from having an individual’s health information sold or shared with third parties without that person’s consent. That was particularly welcome for women in an age when draconian assaults on reproductive rights in some states includes vacuuming up the most private of data, from menstrual cycles to birth control preferences.
The legislation passed by a 21-17 Senate vote on Jan. 24. One Republican joined 20 Democrats voting for the bill; all 17 nay votes were Republican. One Democrat and one Republican did not vote.
New Va. law protecting reproductive health data prompts Walmart’s online data collection pop-ups

Three weeks later, it cleared the House on a 52-43 vote. Two Republicans broke ranks and joined 50 Democrats in support. Four of the five delegates who did not vote were Republicans.
On this one, Gov. Glenn Youngkin differed from most in his party and, in March, chose the greater good, signing the bill patroned by Senate Democrats Barbara Favola of Arlington and Scott Surovell of Fairfax. It took effect on July 1, the start of Virginia’s new fiscal year.
O happy day!
Alas, Virginia, no good deed goes unpunished.
On the bill’s effective date earlier this month, customers shopping their favorite online retailers started seeing notices pop up on their computer monitors. They vary, but in essence they inform consumers that they must consent to have their online data harvested if they wish to continue shopping.
Some were quite up-front about it, such as the one initially posted by Walmart. The world’s largest retailer was remarkably straightforward in describing limitations that Virginia’s brand-new VCPA applies to consumer data about sexual and reproductive health merchandise. It explained that by clicking the “Continue shopping” button and proceeding to browse the site, users consent to Walmart using their data to complete the purchase, provide the requested feature and for general analytics, operations and fraud prevention.
Janet Peyton, a McGuireWoods attorney* who advises clients on data privacy issues, noted that Walmart’s advisory isn’t proposing to provide the data to third parties, only for its own internal use. Virginians have more robust data privacy protections under a slightly older state law, she said, and nothing in Walmart’s disclaimer waives those.

“It doesn’t say anything about your other privacy rights under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and, in fact, there are lots of other (rights),” she said. The Walmart pop-up, she said, constitutes “a very limited consent specific to this health information that they’re gathering.”
Walmart has significantly pared down its pop-up since early July, dropping the references to the family-planning and intimate products.  
Other big chains that offer those products are far less conspicuous in letting Virginians know about the newer privacy law.
The CVS drugstore chain, for example, has a small, obscure disclaimer at the bottom of its landing page under the curious heading “Improving your site experience.” It says in miniscule type that by continuing to shop on the site, you give the pharmacy giant the right to share your data with “trusted third parties, including our marketing, analytics and research partners.”
Its rival apothecary chain, Walgreens, similarly requires users to do a lengthy scroll downward to find its privacy link nestled in the sub-basement of its webpage. There, one finds a “Your Privacy Choices” link that jumps to a consumer rights box outlining non-specific rights afforded customers in Virginia and 15 other states. In that box, there are links to pages that allow consumers to access, correct and delete their data, and to opt out of the sale, sharing or use of their data for targeted advertising, rights Virginians have had since the VCDPA took effect Jan. 1, 2023.
  After the passage of a new privacy law in the 2025 General Assembly session, pop-up notice now greets Virginia customers shopping online at Walgreens and other retailers. (Screenshot by Bob Lewis)
Those pages ask users to jump through multiple hoops just to verify their identity and, after that’s done, opt out of sharing, selling or bartering your data.
I undertook the exercise on several big chain retailers’ websites, including the aforementioned. I had to confirm unsettlingly specific personal information, including an approximate range for my mortgage payments, which of several random home addresses was once mine, banks where I held accounts decades ago, names of relatives and more. It’s precisely the sort of info you don’t want out there. With that completed, I was informed that I would be updated on the progress of the request or, in one case, get an email I could use to complete the process within a couple of weeks. I’m not holding my breath.
Creepy? Sure felt that way.
Confusing? Yes, on any number of levels, not the least of which is a state-to-state patchwork of statutes that even legal professionals find challenging because there’s no nationwide data privacy law.
Burdensome? Sure.
“It can be done. It is a little bit cumbersome — not particularly consumer friendly — but it’s not saying anything here about waiving your right to make a data access request or opt out of those other things,” Peyton said, referencing the Walmart disclaimer.
Data in large-scale retailing is money. Huge money. Ask Jeff Bezos, the founder of the all-online Amazon, the planet’s second-largest retailer after Walmart.
E-commerce retail sales ballooned from $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2000 to $300.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
Data are essential to that. As Charlotte Rene Woods explained in her reporting on July 8, pop-ups informing users about “cookies,” or other data that websites collect and store aren’t uncommon in online transactions. Some are necessary to complete them.
That’s been true for more than 30 years, back in the phone-modem days when many folks of a certain age got their first excursions into cyberspace via America Online with its cheery “You’ve got mail!” log-in greeting. The age of Amazon, Google and Meta is built on data.
It’s no mystery, then, that there’s no incentive other than the law’s baseline requirements for retailers to make it as easy as allowing consumers to click one icon to keep their private data private.
On the other hand, some of them have made relinquishing at least a slice of your privacy exactly that easy.
*(Point of personal disclosure: From my years at McGuireWoods, I have known Janet as a top intellectual property/data privacy and security lawyer with a long list of national accolades.)

(Courtesy of Natalie Emmerson)In January 2024, Bowdoin freshman Natalie Emmerson collected signatures for U.S. Sen. Angus King’s re-election campaign. Frequently, she was asked by voters, “isn’t he already on the ballot?” 
That’s when she realized that by working on the campaign she was learning information about how elections and democracy work that most people didn’t know.
That lesson prompted Emmerson and classmate Larsen Van Horn one year later to create a podcast called “Pine State Politics: In Session,” where they learn and educate listeners about basic civic processes, like how a bill becomes a law, the difference between state and federal government, the role of lobbyists and much more from some of the biggest names in Maine politics: former Congressman and U.S. Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, current Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, and King himself.
“A lot of young people want to get involved, but don’t know how,” Emmerson said of the political process. “That’s exactly what the point of the podcast is. We’re digging into the mechanics of how everything works.”
Van Horn, who is from out of state, said the podcast is a way for her to learn more about how Maine’s government and elections work, for instance, concepts like ranked-choice voting and clean elections funding. He said this is especially important because, like other college students, he is able to vote in Maine elections. 
Next year, the podcast could be played in high school classrooms across Maine as part of a newly offered curriculum that Emmerson and Van Horn are partnering with the Maine Department of Education to develop. 
For example, in the first episode, the hosts asked Bellows and Washington, D.C. lobbyist and University of Maine adjunct professor Peter Madigan which issues are handled locally and which are federal: Who do you call about a road that needs paving? Which office handles disability payments?
That segment will help prompt classroom discussion questions, Emmerson said, such as “What issues can your congressperson help you with? What is a district office and what do the people who work there do?”

“Some of these questions will require the student to look some information up for a complete answer,” she added. “The conversation in the snippet will help point them in the right direction. That way students stay engaged and are required to ask questions and think critically about the systems they’re learning about “
The department hopes the collaboration will make the democratic process more accessible and engaging for young people, particularly because it’s a resource developed by other young people. 
“They’re a great example of youth voice in civic education, which is something we want to be promoting because … there is very low youth engagement nationwide in civic life,” said Beth Lambert, chief teaching and learning officer at the Maine Department of Education.
The podcast breaks down complex government processes in a non-partisan, approachable manner, Lambert said, which was another reason the partnership appealed to the department.
“They’re not diving into polarizing policy debates in these podcasts,” she said. “It really emphasizes how democracy works and encourages understanding across the political divides, which is key in our classrooms.”
The lesson plans, which will be available this fall, will allow high school teachers to use specific segments in civics, U.S. history, and current events classes. Since Maine allows local districts to control curriculum, teachers in each district will be able to decide whether to use the lesson plans. 
But the initiative reflects the department’s broader commitment to promoting youth-driven learning experiences that encourage students to understand and actively participate in democratic processes. 
Next year, the department will be rolling out another learning opportunity for elementary students — interactive town halls. These day-long events, developed in partnership with the Secretary of State and local municipalities, will immerse young students in democratic processes such as town council meetings. Students will participate in various roles, such as reporters, candidates, and voters, learning about local government, the role of the media and policy through hands-on activities. 
These new initiatives are part of “broader efforts to support interdisciplinary, inclusive and relevant learning experiences,” Lambert said, which are a department priority.

Public school advocates are wary.,Ethan DeWitt,,,,,https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2025/07/28/community-colleges-are-hailing-a-part-time-teacher-law-public-school-advocates-are-wary/,"For 26 years, the Community College System of New Hampshire has offered a proposal to public high school students: Take a college-level course taught by a faculty member, earn college credit, and use that credit to save time and money in college.

Kelly Ayotte this month, allows K-12 schools to hire faculty from New Hampshire’s colleges and universities to teach up to 20 hours a week of classes. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin) For 26 years, the Community College System of New Hampshire has offered a proposal to public high school students: Take a college-level course taught by a faculty member, earn college credit, and use that credit to save time and money in college.
That program, originally known as Running Start, has ballooned in popularity. What started with 25 participating high schools has grown to more than 100, serving around 11,000 students, according to Chuck Lloyd, the vice chancellor of the community college system. Each year, more schools are seeing examples of that interest: high school seniors graduating with full associate’s degrees. 
Now, a new state law could help expand that system. House Bill 90, signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte this month, allows K-12 schools to hire faculty from New Hampshire’s colleges and universities to teach up to 20 hours a week of classes. 
To Lloyd, the bill will empower community colleges to expand their high school dual enrollment partnerships. It allows the school district to pay the community college faculty member directly, and for the faculty member to better divide their time. 
“We loved our partners so much, we wanted to make it work, but it really wasn’t scalable,” he said in an interview. “We couldn’t take our automotive instructor and do it for three or four different high schools, because they wouldn’t have the bandwidth to come teach our college students.” 
But the bill applies to all courses — not just dual enrollment courses for college credit — meaning it also allows a school to hire the faculty members for standard math or English classes. Democrats, public school advocates, and teachers have heavily criticized that piece, arguing it will allow schools to cut corners to save money and potentially lower pay to teachers, and that it could degrade the quality of instruction. 
Republicans say the bill is a simple change that provides schools a tool to help with persistent staffing shortages.
“The way I see it is, if there is an open space and there’s a teacher who has passed a background check, they have experience teaching at a college, and they’re more than willing to teach at the high school, I would much rather that teacher be in the classroom than nobody at all, and the class doesn’t get offered, and the students can’t learn that subject,” she said. 
HB 90 allows any full-time or contracted faculty member of the University System of New Hampshire or Community College System of New Hampshire to work part time in a public school without obtaining a credential. To do so, they must have “expertise or significant professional experience” to teach in the schools, and pass a criminal background check from the Department of Education. 
The law requires the faculty members to abide by the state’s code of conduct that applies to K-12 teachers, even though they have no credentials that could potentially be revoked. And it excludes former K-12 teachers whose licenses have been revoked. 
Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and the bill’s prime sponsor, said the bill is meant to help schools, not take away teachers’ jobs.
“This bill is attempting to aid schools that do not have the staff in place or are encountering scheduling difficulties to ensure all students have an equal opportunity to receive a dual and concurrent education,” Ladd, who is chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, said in testimony to senators earlier this year.
Rep. Valerie McDonnell, a Salem Republican and co-sponsor of the bill, said the law’s main aim is to build partnerships for career and technical education. Salem has a CTE center, where high school students can go for classes to prepare them for professions or trades that are not always taught in high school, and the new law could help more high schools in her area contribute to that program, she said.
“It’s specialties, maybe automotive or cosmetology,” McDonnell said in an interview. “So having a CTE center, Salem has found that (the new law) would be helpful.”
But McDonnell also noted the law could be used to help high school administrators fill spots when hiring teaching help is difficult.
“The way I see it is, if there is an open space and there’s a teacher who has passed a background check, they have experience teaching at a college, and they’re more than willing to teach at the high school, I would much rather that teacher be in the classroom than nobody at all, and the class doesn’t get offered, and the students can’t learn that subject,” she said.
But teachers have protested.
“I am insulted that this would even be considered for the education of our college (bound) students,” wrote Jamie Bolduc, a teacher of 24 years from Fremont, in written testimony to the House. “Our certifications show that we have demonstrated the skills required to educate others; it would be like going to have surgery with someone who has never been to medical school”
Kate Griffin, of Hooksett, agreed, arguing in her own testimony that the law would “dumb down” teaching. “Education is a multifaceted and complex job,” she said. “We need certified professionals who are up to the task, not those who do not also understand the complexities of child development and how children learn.”
The National Education Association of New Hampshire, the state’s largest teacher’s union, has also opposed the bill. 
“While New Hampshire’s inadequate and inequitable school funding system has exacerbated teacher shortages in property poor and lower-income communities, lowering  the standards for who can teach is an inappropriate response,” said NEA-NH President Megan Tuttle in a statement earlier this month. “For school districts with fewer resources, this law could incentivize administrators to hire uncertified and untrained temporary fill-in educators rather than licensed teachers who are invested in the school community and their students.”
For now, it’s not clear whether public schools are interested in hiring part-time teachers from colleges. 
Mark MacLean, the executive director of the New Hampshire School Administrators Association, said in an email he has not heard anything this summer from his member school districts. And a spokeswoman for the University System of New Hampshire said the university was unaware of any public school that has reached out to faculty seeking to hire.
Any moves by schools to hire faculty as part-time teachers would most likely occur on an individual, case-by-case basis, and might not be known to college administrators, Lloyd said.
Lloyd said he is unsure how much interest there is among community college faculty to teach standard classes in K-12 schools. 
And he stressed that the community college system does not take any stance on whether its members teach non-college courses; the organization is only seeking to promote the law’s role toward dual curriculum courses. 
But when it comes to those courses, Lloyd is hopeful the partnerships will continue to increase.
He pointed to one area in which HB 90 could help community college faculty members: working hours. Under the current system, faculty are paid by their community college for the work they do with high schools, and any hours they work at the K-12 school are subtracted from the hours they can spend teaching their courses to college students. Under the new law, if hired by a school district, a faculty member can move forward with two separate contracts and two separate hourly limits, Lloyd said. 
“It really makes it cleaner,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nhti-1024x670.jpg,,,2025-07-28 05:56:12.160985

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)School districts in Ohio and across the country will now be receiving billions of dollars that were being withheld by the Trump administration, funds local public education workers and supporters said are critically needed as the new school year approaches.
The Trump administration halted distribution of $6.8 billion in funds allocated by Congress in March, though $1.4 billion was unfrozen for one of the U.S. Department of Education’s grant programs earlier this month. On Friday afternoon, the White House reportedly announced it will release the rest of the funds due to schools.
The news comes after Ohio school districts, pro-public education organizations and hundreds of individuals signed on to a letter on July 21 urging state and congressional leaders to help release federal funds.
Led by the coalition Honesty for Ohio Education, the letter was directed at Attorney General Dave Yost, the U.S. Department of Education and Ohio’s congressional delegation, expressing “deep concern” over the freezing of federal funding for the state’s public schools.
The funds for Ohio amount to about $185 million for the 2024 fiscal year, according to Honesty for Ohio Education, the absence of which the group said has been “causing widespread disruption and panic to district planning and school operations.”
“This funding is not hypothetical – they are federal dollars already allocated by Congress,” said Dr. Christina Collins, executive director of Honesty for Ohio Education, in a statement. “The withholding of these necessary funds harms children, educators and school communities every day it is delayed, undermining educational progress.”
The federal monies can be used for school districts with low-income families, after-school programs and other educational services, to provide students with “significant opportunity to receive a fair, equitable and high-quality education, and to close educational achievement gaps,” according to the Ohio Department of Education & Workforce website.
“Ohio schools rely on these federal Title funds to support critical services and programs for students,” the letter from the public school supporters stated. “The continued delay in releasing these funds has created uncertainty, disrupted district planning and jeopardized the academic and social supports that many of our students depend on.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe money is allocated based on “accountability systems to identify and support schools with academically struggling students” and the funds must be used “to improve student outcomes, including academic achievement,” according to the state education department.
The groups wrote in their letter that the funds “are essential to ensuring equitable access to education for all students, especially those with the greatest need.”
Cleveland Heights-University Heights and Shaker Heights school districts both signed on to the letter, along with the Shaker Heights Teachers Association, retired members of the Ohio Education Association and the Ashland County Community Academy.
Organizations such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of Northeast Ohio, the Lake County NAACP and the Ohio Council of Churches also joined in on the letter.
The districts, groups and individuals asked for specific things of each entity to whom they sent the letter. They called on Yost to “take all legal and administrative steps necessary to secure the immediate release of these funds,” and asked Ohio’s members of Congress to “publicly and forcefully advocate for the prompt distribution of these federal dollars to our school districts.”
Of the U.S. Department of Education, the letter asked for a partnership with state and federal officials “to ensure these funds are delivered swiftly and equitably, as intended by law.”
“Ohio’s children cannot afford to be caught in political or bureaucratic limbo,” the letter read. “The state must act now to honor its obligations and ensure that every child has the resources they need to learn, grow and thrive.”
Yost’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.

Almost half of the 63 million Americans who care for a family member say they struggle financially to do so. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
‘A purpose in this world’: Older adults fear elimination of program that helps them find work

The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

The Mississippi State Department of Health, like other state health departments, is concerned about the potential loss of federal funding. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Between 2016 and 2022, as congenital syphilis cases rose nationally and especially in the South, Mississippi saw a one thousand percent increase — from 10 to 110 — in the number of newborn babies who were hospitalized after contracting the disease, known to cause developmental issues, intellectual disabilities, and even death.
So in 2023, the state Department of Health mandated that all medical practitioners screen for the disease in pregnant mothers, and it has been running advertisements to spread awareness.
Annual congenital syphilis cases in Mississippi rose from 62 in 2021 to 132 in 2023, according to state data. The number fell to 114 last year. There have been 33 cases so far this year.
That work won’t stop despite potential budget cuts, Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said in an interview. “We’re going to keep doing what we have to do, you know, to keep it under control.”
State by state, public health departments take a similar approach: They monitor, treat and try to stem preventable diseases, alongside their host of other duties. But in the coming year, health department officials — with their agencies already strapped for cash — fear they’ll find it much more difficult to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 would cut the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by more than half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion. The proposal serves as a wish list from the administration, a blueprint for the Republican-controlled Congress as it works through upcoming spending legislation.
If lawmakers hew to Trump’s vision, then state and county public health departments would be hit hard. States contribute to their own health departments, but a lot of them rely heavily on federal funding.
And around half of local public health department funding comes from federal sources, primarily the CDC, as noted in a 2022 report from the National Association of County & City Health Officials.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

“The federal government provides a lot of funding, but the actual implementation of public health programs happens at the state and local level,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF, a health policy research group. “Each state has its own approach, in many ways, to how public health programs are overseen, how they’re funded, how they are implemented.”
In announcing his department’s share of the proposed budget, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump’s goals align with “new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”
But many local health leaders point to the longtime mission of state public health departments in preventing the spread of disease.
“Local public health is on the front lines preventing communicable disease, operating programs to prevent chronic disease, ensuring our septic and well water systems are safe,” said Dr. Kelly Kimple, acting director of North Carolina’s Division of Public Health within the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I’m very concerned,” Kimple said, “especially given the magnitude of funding that we’re talking about, as we can’t keep doing more with less.”
Clawing back COVID-era grants
Other federal budget cuts also have states worried.
Many state public health departments grew alarmed when the Trump administration announced in March that it would be clawing back $11.4 billion in COVID-era funding for grants that were slated to extend into 2026.
Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia sued. A federal district court in Rhode Island temporarily blocked the cuts, and the case remains tied up in court.
The court’s preliminary injunction may not protect temporary staff or contractors, though. Public health departments have been laying off staff, cutting lab capacity and reducing immunization clinics, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Historically, public health departments receive funding in “boom and bust” cycles, meaning they tend to get more federal support during emergencies, said Michaud, of KFF. But “since the Great Recession of 2008, there was a general decline in public health support funding until the COVID pandemic.”
For example, KHN and The Associated Press reported that between 2010 and 2019, spending on state public health departments declined by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments fell by 18%.
Nationally, syphilis cases reached historic lows in the 2000s, thanks to robust prevention efforts and education from public health officials. By 2022, however, cases reached their highest numbers nationally since the 1950s.
“In the wake of the COVID emergency, you’ve seen a sort of backlash to what people had been calling the overreach of public health and imposing vaccination requirements and lockdowns and other public health measures,” Michaud told Stateline.
Smallpox, cholera and typhoid
Public health departments and officials go back to the 19th century, when there was a greater emphasis on sanitation efforts to prevent spread of diseases such as smallpox, cholera and typhoid, which were rampant at the time.
By the end of the century, 40 states had established health departments, which to this day are responsible for water sanitation, tracking the spread of disease, administering vaccinations, furnishing health education, providing screenings for infants and some prenatal care for moms at local clinics, offering family planning services, and tracking and treating sexually transmitted infections, among other things.











What we're seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.


– Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF



Kimple pointed to measles as a current example of a disease that’s spreading fast. When North Carolina’s health department detected a case in the state, she said, the department “identified and contacted everyone who might have been exposed, helped people get tested, worked with doctors to make sure they knew how to respond.”
That’s the legacy of local public health, Michaud said.
“The federal government cannot decide, ‘This public health program will happen in this state, but not that state,’ that kind of thing. And cannot declare a national lockdown. The COVID pandemic tested a lot of those boundaries. It really is a state and local responsibility to protect public health. And that’s always been the case, since the beginning of our country,” Michaud said.
“And what we’re seeing now is a complete upheaval of the funding going into public health.”
A major cut in services
Kimple said she’s seen recent progress in her state in the support for funding public health.
“North Carolinians viewed our work as highly important to improving health and well-being in the state, and appreciated the local presence, the reliable information, the role in prevention and efforts to protect, in particular, vulnerable communities,” she said.
Similarly, Edney said that Mississippi state lawmakers were showing more support, despite some setbacks in 2016 and 2017. New federal cuts could throw a wrench in the health department’s economic plans and its ability to reach small communities.
“Now the federal rug is being pulled out from under us,” he said.
Edney said he expects the federal share of his department’s public health funding to fall from its current 65% to around 50%.
Edney said he’s been trying to strengthen Mississippi health department’s longevity by diversifying its revenue streams by, for example, accepting private donations.
The state will not stop doing its “core” work, he said, regardless of federal funding.
“We’re not going to cut back on services at the county health department, because what we do now is all mission critical,” Edney said.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Ann Cornwell has been the soundtrack of the Arkansas Senate for decades.
Standing behind a lectern in the well, Cornwell has read thousands of bills, resolutions and governor’s letters and recited senators’ names as they cast their votes.
The first and only woman to be Secretary of the Senate and its director, colleagues describe Cornwell as a committed public servant who’s led with grace and a commitment to excellence while directing staff and legislators through the intricacies of creating state law.
After 45 years in the Senate, Cornwell plans to retire in December.
During the waning days of her final legislative session in April, a staged argument erupted between two senators. The distraction allowed staff to slip into Cornwell’s hands a resolution honoring her years of service. 
Cornwell began to read the text aloud but paused when she saw her name. Lawmakers laughed and applauded, while family and friends hiding in side rooms spilled onto the Senate floor. 
The surprise was a welcome one, perhaps the first for a woman who’s had her hand in the meticulous details of running the Senate for years. 
“I was totally shocked, especially with the kids coming in from out of state. It was a big surprise, it really was,” she said. 
Overcome, Cornwell handed the resolution to a colleague to read. 
“For forty-five (45) years, Ann Cornwell has been the heart and soul of the Senate because of her dedication to the institution and its processes, loyalty to the first branch of government, unmatched work ethic, affection for each senator, and support of Senate and legislative staff,” the resolution read, in part. 
While Cornwell feels fortunate to have a job she absolutely loves, she’s looking forward to spending her retirement visiting family, traveling with legislative colleagues from around the country who’ve become close friends and learning to play Mahjong. 
“I love the Senate, I always have. I still love it and I know I’m going to miss it, but it’s time,” she said. “I’m ready, and I think the Senate’s in a good place right now for me to leave.”
Origin story
Sabrina Lewellen said she has one of the world’s best jobs as deputy director and assistant secretary to a “superhero.”
Having worked alongside Cornwell for two decades, Lewellen said she’s blessed to have learned from a “fearless, dedicated public servant” who’s committed to the details. 
“Her grace, her unmatched dedication to all things Senate…I have had the honor to be in the presence of true greatness, and I am going to miss her.”

Though she’s now synonymous with the Senate, politics was not Cornwell’s obvious destiny. Growing up in Russellville, she was an athletic child who loved swimming and diving. She also studied physical education at Arkansas Tech University where her dad coached.
“I dropped out of that when they plopped a rat in front of me I had to dissect and I said, ‘I’m out of here.’ So I changed to business,’” Cornwell recalled with a laugh. 
While in college, Cornwell married her husband and gave birth to their son. She had twin girls two years later, and the young family moved to Tennessee and Texas before ultimately settling in North Little Rock. 
Cornwell cared for her children, played tennis and bridge, and was active in Junior League. One day friends suggested Cornwell join them at the Capitol for session work because “it’s fun,” and she did. 
She began her career in the Senate in 1981 as a journal clerk. Cornwell became assistant Secretary of the Senate in 1991 and the full-time Secretary and fiscal officer in 1995. She’s served in her current role since 2009. 
When she started four decades ago, did Cornwell think she’d still be here? “Absolutely not,” she said with a hearty laugh. 
Cornwell, who loves being in session and busy, has seen lots of change during her time in the upper chamber. Women are now elected to Senate seats instead of serving temporarily after their husband’s death. Technology has evolved. Many things are now digital, but the process remains the same so staff can still run a session if the computers go down, Cornwell said. 
Institutional legislative staff are the “indispensable facilitators of democracy,” according to Lewellen, who said she’s grateful for Cornwell’s  “legacy leadership.” 
“It’s quite a machine and it doesn’t happen by accident, and the Anns of the world who help construct it, it’s just true brilliance,”  Lewellen said.

During Lewellen’s first day in the Senate in 2003, Cornwell taught her some important lessons. One is “this is a very big deal and never treat it less than that,” Lewellen said. 
Another, Cornwell said, is “there’s no job that you’re too good for,” including taking out the trash.
“Everybody works together and helps each other, and that’s what you’ve got to understand: is that if something needs done, you’ll help somebody, you’ll do it,” Cornwell said. “I don’t expect anyone to do something that I would not do, and I’ve done everything.”
Lewellen remains in awe of her hero, who’s “touched hundreds of thousands of pages of history.” 
“There is some real strength and intelligence and integrity and intentionality, commitment and sacrifice that goes on behind the scenes, and she is one of those warriors whose strength has just been unmatched,” Lewellen said. 
Like family
In 2010, Missy Thomas Irvin, a newly-elected Mountain View Republican, was lost in the Senate chamber the first time she met Cornwell.
“She just immediately embraced me with a hug and just said, ‘Welcome to the Senate,’ and then directed me to the office I needed to go to…I’d still never forget her demeanor of…you are now in the Senate and you’re a part of the Senate family,” Irvin said. 
The following summer, Fayetteville Democrat Greg Leding, a new House representative, was wandering around San Antonio alone during a legislative conference. Cornwell spotted him and insisted he join her and other legislators on a riverboat tour. 
“I just always remember that because I was still very much a new member of the House, I wasn’t even in her chamber, but still made me feel incredibly welcome,” Leding said.

Cornwell is a warm and pleasant person who loves to socialize, according to Leding, who grew to know her better after joining the Senate in 2018. 
“Even if you’ve never met her, she can make you feel like you’ve been friends for years within minutes of meeting her,” he said. 
Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge said working with Cornwell provided “a great deal of relief” when she began presiding over the Senate in 2023. 
“She is a selfless leader, she enjoys life, she has an incredible, witty personality, hardworking, someone you want to be around,” Rutledge said. 
Irvin said she also appreciated Cornwell treating all lawmakers equally. 
“What you do for one senator, you do for the next one…doesn’t matter if it’s the number one in seniority or if it’s the 35th in seniority, you treat them all the same. It’s totally nonpartisan,” Cornwell said. 
The Senate stalwart’s mark on the body is “indelible and it’ll never be the same,” Leding said. 
Never one to sit idle, Cornwell said she’s exploring volunteer opportunities during her retirement, and can provide assistance behind the scenes at the Capitol if she’s needed. 
As she prepares for this next chapter, Cornwell hopes she’s remembered as someone who worked hard and always tried to do her best.
“And that I was fair. That I’ve always been fair and tried to uphold the institution…45 years is a long time to be up here…it’s been a good ride,” she said.

(Getty Images)More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces, and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt, or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing, and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

Ohio Reps. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, and D.J. Swearingen, R-Huron, once again introduced a bipartisan bill that would make the  walleye Ohio’s official state fish. 
“I’m optimistic that we’re going to be able to reel this one in and finally make the walleye our state fish,” Brennan said. “We are the walleye capital of the world, and Ohio is open for anglers from all over the place to come here and experience what Ohio is all about.”

The lawmakers introduced House Bill 312 at the end of May and it had sponsor testimony last month in the House Arts, Athletics and Tourism Committee. Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa are the only states without a designated state fish. The walleye is the state fish in Minnesota, South Dakota, and Vermont. 
“By having an official state fish, it allows the state of Ohio to market that to folks in other states,” Brennan said. “I’ve talked to environmentalists who said that having a state fish can help them on their grant applications with different levels of government and with other nonprofits that make donations.”  
There are 72.1 million walleye in Lake Erie at least two years or older, meaning they are ready to be caught and kept, Brennan said in his testimony. For comparison, there are about 600,000 white-tailed deer in Ohio, he said. 
The Walleye are the nickname of Toledo’s professional minor league hockey team and Port Clinton celebrates the annual Walleye Festival as well as the Walleye Drop on New Year’s Eve.
Brennan — who grew up fishing on Catawba Island — and Swearingen introduced the same bill during the previous General Assembly and it easily passed the House with only four dissenting votes, but it ran out of time in the Senate and died. 
“It’s not really controversial,” Brennan said. “I mean, we passed almost unanimously last year.” 
Having the walleye become the official state fish would help show off Lake Erie, Swearingen said. 
“There’s a lot of people that come into the district just to fish for that fish on Lake Erie,” he said. “The economic impact is pretty large.”
Jason Fischer runs three competitive walleye tournament series in Ohio — the Lake Erie Walleye Trail, the Walleye Fall Brawl, and the Ohio Walleye Federation. 
“Ohio is the walleye capital of the world,” he said. “No questions asked, it is just astronomical.” 
People from more than 20 states and Canada come annually to compete in the Walleye Fall Brawl. 
“You come to Ohio to fish for walleye because it’s the best place in the world to do it,” Fischer said. 
Ohio fishing has an economic impact of $5.5 billion per year, according to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. 
“Just because somebody comes here to fish doesn’t mean that the restaurants don’t benefit, the fuel stations don’t benefit, the hotels don’t benefit,” Fischer said. 
For Ohio Marine Trades Association President Michelle Burke, naming the walleye the official state fish is no brainer. 
“This shouldn’t even have to be brought up again,” she said. “It should just be a full vote. We love eating perch. Perch tastes great, but I think what the walleye does for Ohio far exceeds any other fish.”

Mike DeWine’s new property tax reform working group met on Thursday to discuss relieving the burden homeowners are facing. The group has not been well received by some Republican lawmakers, who are not obligated to act upon the group’s suggestions.
The working group has 60 days to attempt to solve what business leader Pat Tiberi and former state Rep. Bill Seitz say is the most challenging issue in Ohio: property tax relief and reform.
“Our objective is to provide as much meaningful property tax relief as we can, particularly to those who need it most, and do it in a way that does not break the bank of the state of Ohio,” Seitz said during the meeting.
DeWine assigned the pair to co-chair the new group, which is made up of local officials and school superintendents. The group has a report deadline of September 30, when the state budget bill goes into effect.
The governor created this group as a way to discourage overrides to his vetoes.
House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) and the GOP have passed one override.
In the two-year state operating budget, DeWine vetoed restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. That provision eliminated levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it would have prohibited them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy. But the House narrowly passed an override on the provision, 61-28, just clearing the threshold of 60 votes.
The speaker also wants to override two other vetoes. However, he was unable to get the votes to override them.
DeWine removed a provision that would have allowed county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away from passed school levies if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
He also vetoed another that would have required that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
“Transparency, clarity — gives the opportunity for voters to know what they’re voting on, for locals to control taxes,” Huffman said.
The governor’s working group isn’t necessary, he said.
“The legislature has studied and acted … I’m not interested in participating in that,” Huffman said.
Neither is state Rep. David Thomas, who has been leading the override charge. He sighed when I brought it up to him.
“I don’t know exactly what else could be put out there that’s not already been said,” Thomas said.
Republicans have said that local governments should be responsible for providing property tax relief since appraisals have skyrocketed over the past few years.
Educators like John Patterson say that Ohio should bear the cost.
“The state has not done its best for local governments and for the school districts,” Patterson said.
Schools and municipalities have been underfunded while the wealthy have received tax cuts, Patterson said.
“I’m asking for a balance between property tax, sales tax, and obviously, income tax, for all taxing entities across the state of Ohio,” he said.
Veto overrides could lead to massive cuts, he said, to school programs and staffing.
Local law enforcement and firefighters could also face challenges due to levy restrictions.
“The FOP is very concerned about potential reductions in funding for law enforcement across Ohio and are looking forward to seeing the results of Governor DeWine’s task force,” said Jay McDonald, President of the FOP of Ohio. “Many jurisdictions across Ohio are barely able to provide basic services now, and we are interested in hearing any ideas on how those services will be sustained with a reduction in revenue.”
Tiberi said he knows that policy will need to have a balance, and every idea is on the table when coming up with relief.
“We have to figure this out because it’s important to our citizens, it’s important to our seniors, it’s important to our kids who we want to stay here, live here, buy a house here and create a business here,” Tiberi said.

(Getty Images)For the past two weeks now, I’ve gone to the movies.
That’s probably the first time in a half decade or so that I’ve actually chosen to buy tickets, make the drive out to the Lawrence multiplex, and watch two films on two successive Sundays. The first was the latest incarnation of Superman, the second a new take on the Fantastic Four.
I’m not actually the world’s biggest superhero movie fan. I enjoy them well enough, but I’ve sat out most recent entries. Too much spandex, too many capes, not enough human connection — except the punching and kicking kind. Yet the Fantastic Four and Superman both interested me enough to take the plunge. My husband, at one time a devoted comics reader, made the decision easier. We can always find something to talk about afterward, even if the movies are bad.
Yet neither movie was bad. And both had a lot to say about the world right now.
Sunday columnist Max McCoy covered Superman for the Reflector a couple of weeks ago, noting recent controversy about the hero’s immigration status. (He’s from the planet Krypton, after all, although raised right here in Kansas.) The Fantastic Four film reboots the first superhero team created for Marvel Comics, setting up a confrontation with cosmic baddie Galactus in alternate-history 1960s New York. Picture analogue robots, flying cars and sleek spaceships. It depicts a world in which nations eagerly work together to combat a common threat.
Wouldn’t it be nice to live in such a world? Wouldn’t it be nice to have that world inhabited by super-beings who work for the betterment of everyone?
Each film adopts a pointedly optimistic, earnest tone. My husband noted that either one would have been unthinkable 10 or 20 years ago, when irony was the coin of the realm.
These days, we want sincerity. Even in our escapist weekend entertainment, we want to believe that we can work together with our fellow human beings. We want to believe that folks among us can be, well, super. If you want wisecracks and sarcasm, you can pull up whatever social media platform you choose.
The films put me in mind of another Kansas Reflector columnist, Mark McCormick. Last week, he argued that attacks on the U.S. Department of Education undermine the common good.
“Increasing waves of politicians exalt qualities that should disqualify them as public officials: a mistrust of government, demonizing opponents, and supporting private schools with public money,” Mark wrote. “These qualities should stand as barriers to candidacy, not bona fides.“
Both the Fantastic Four and Superman devote themselves to the common good.
That’s why they’re superheroes — not because of their powers, but because of their morals. They serve humanity. They serve their country. They serve one another. The Fantastic Four literally contains a family: Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) and Sue Storm (the Invisible Woman) are a married couple, while Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) is Sue’s brother and Ben Grimm (the Thing) is a close friend. During the film, Reed and Sue welcome their son, Franklin, into the world.
“They are parents first,” director Matt Shakman told Variety. “They are scientists and explorers second. And they’re superheroes only when they have to be. I come at this as a dad and as a husband. That’s what makes it so special to me.”
Every summer brings superhero films. Almost every superhero film brings battles between good and evil. Yet these films, and this summer, suggest to me that both filmmakers and audiences yearn for more than thrills. They want clarity. They want warm, nurturing, uncomplicated goodness.
Unfortunately, that’s not the world right now.
We live in a state and nation riven by partisan divides. Figuring out the right course in a shattered political landscape can flummox the most informed among us. Rather than the bright clarity of the movies, alternate realities where we know good from bad and right from wrong, where villains helpfully sneer and snarl at heroes, we have to make the best-informed decisions we can. We make decisions without knowing the outcome, only hoping for the best.
Superheroes appear in comic books on and screen. Those of us navigating troubled times have to find that heroism, moral clarity and dedication to others within ourselves.
We may not fly. But we can soar.

(Photo by Jnaiah Price)Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.
The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
States are making it easier for physician assistants to work across state lines

McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Amid mental health crisis, new compact allows social workers to practice across state lines

Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

Twenty-eight-year-old Michaela Bonner has been working 12-hour shifts as an emergency medical technician in Norfolk, Virginia, for the past four years, while attending and paying for college to finish her prerequisites for medical school.
But now that President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending law bars students from borrowing more than $50,000 annually in unsubsidized federal loans for medical school, Bonner is worried her dream of becoming a doctor is financially out of reach.
“I get told, ‘Well, we really need you. We have a physician shortage, and you’ve done all this work leading up to this point,’ and that’s true as well, and it’s not that I want to quit,” Bonner said in a recent interview. “But there are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can’t take out the full cost of living through loans.”
The tax and spending law includes provisions that significantly alter the student loan process for higher education. The law halts current student loan repayment plans for loans that are granted on or after July 1, 2026. On that date, the law also terminates Grad PLUS loans, which have helped people pay for their higher education degrees and total cost of attendance. Current borrowers will be grandfathered in.
The federal law gives current borrowers enrolled in loan repayment plans for students based on income — such as those plans known as SAVE or IBR — until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. Interest collection will resume Aug. 1 for students enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan.
At the same time, medical or law school students hoping to get unsubsidized federal loans — in which the borrower is responsible for paying the interest at all times rather than the government — will only be able to borrow $50,000 per year, with a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in areas such as history or philosophy have a $100,000 lifetime cap.










There are no systems in place that I can rely on to support me now that I can't take out the full cost of living through loans.


– Michaela Bonner, aspiring medical student


The average yearly cost of medical school for the 2024-25 academic year ranged from around $42,000 to $72,000, depending on whether the school was private or public and whether the student was a resident or nonresident, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Some congressional Republicans say that students need to be working harder to pay for higher education, like medical school, on their own. Others say the caps put the onus back on colleges and universities to rein in the rising cost of tuition. But critics of this legislation say the loan caps are only going to harm students, especially from lower-income backgrounds, and will exacerbate physician shortages.
In recent years states have tried to ease physician shortages by implementing various policy solutions. Since 2023, at least nine states have made it easier for doctors trained in other countries to get medical licenses. States have also participated in interstate licensing compacts, allowing nurses and physician assistants to travel across state lines to work, so long as they are licensed in one state within the compact.
For student loan relief, more than 20 states have enacted legislation to address student loan forgiveness, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a group that tracks states policies. Georgia passed a measure that will expand a cancelable loan program for physicians working in rural and underserved areas. Idaho also created the Rural Nursing Loan Repayment Program, offering nurses $25,000 in forgivable loans after three years of service in a rural area.
McKenzie Richards, a health care policy fellow at the conservative think tank Cicero Institute who has been studying the pace of physician shortages, told Stateline that the national physician shortage could potentially exceed 100,000 by 2034. At the end of 2024 that projected number was closer to 64,000 physicians.
Richards said states will be looking toward more policy solutions should the student loan changes exacerbate physician shortages.
“We know what’s going to be happening coming down the line in just five years, so I think policies that states can adopt to get out of this are really important to be looking at now,” she said.
“The hope is that by capping [federal loans], it will encourage schools to lower tuition prices,” Richards added. “Then maybe they need to be admitting more students, which would have a great downstream effect for getting more doctors through.”
Other students will be in the same boat, said Lesley Turner, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and an economist.
“This is going to hit some students worse than others,” Turner told Stateline. “Those [students] in more expensive programs tend to borrow more, and so for those students they will need to return to private student loans or other ways of financing their graduate education.”
Many students were already questioning their capacity to go to medical school before the student loan caps, said Shannon Jimenez, dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
“I expect that this bill, this cap, is going to push people out of primary care and into specialties to help pay off those higher interest rate loans,” Jimenez told Stateline. She added that caps will likely deter students from lower socioeconomic statuses from going into primary care — important in places like Arkansas, where she says there is a “maldistribution of physicians.”
“Many schools like us try to attract those students, because they’re more likely to go into primary care and serve in underserved areas. So it’s going to tie our hands in a lot of ways.”
Large states and more rural states will feel the gaps more deeply, said Richards, of the Cicero Institute. Louisiana, for example, is projected to be short almost 5,000 doctors from a variety of specialties by 2030, including close to 400 primary care doctors. Already more than a third of Louisiana physicians are close to retirement age — similar to the situation in neighboring Arkansas.
As for whether schools will just be able to lower tuition, Jimenez said, “it makes no sense.”
“We still function in a somewhat market-driven economy and have to compete with other schools around us, so our cost is based mostly on what we have to pay our faculty, and that’s not going to go down,” she said. The annual cost of attendance at her school is between $80,000 and $85,000.
Bonner, the EMT, holds a political communications degree from Regent University and now is studying biomedical sciences at Old Dominion University. She already has $20,000 in loans, she said, and for the rest of college tuition, she has paid out of pocket. Since she’s supporting herself, she hasn’t been able to save much.
She’d planned to take the medical school entrance exam next spring, but now worries about how she’d pay for living expenses while attending. “Medical school scheduling doesn’t allow for working, so you have to take out loans for living expenses,” she said.
“A lot of people, I feel, would be panicked if you had worked for eight to 10 years of your life and found out that all the systems that you were banking on in a really academically challenging space are disappearing,” Bonner said.
“I don’t see a path forward for certain, but I’m fighting to make one.”

More than 63 million Americans are caregivers for a family member with complex medical needs, a 20 million increase over the past decade, according to a new report.
But state policies, workplaces and the American health system haven’t kept up with this surge in family caregiving responsibilities, said Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan, a physician and the CEO of the AARP, which released the report with the National Alliance for Caregiving, a nonprofit policy and research organization.
“Nearly half of caregivers say they face major financial consequences, draining savings, falling into debt or struggling to afford basic needs like food and housing,” Minter-Jordan told reporters on a call this week.
One of the biggest reasons for the surge in family caregivers is that Americans are living longer, yet they’re not necessarily healthier. There’s a 12-year gap between the average number of years that Americans live and the number of years they’re healthy.
The caregiving role typically involves helping a family member with daily tasks like bathing, dressing and eating. But more than half of caregivers also perform more complex medical tasks, such as managing catheters or administering injections, the report found.
A growing number of caregivers are so-called “sandwich caregivers” — parents caring for their children as well as for an adult family member, such as an aging parent. About 17 million people are sandwich caregivers, compared with 11 million a decade ago. And most caregivers are also working a job.
And while the bulk of caregiving still falls on women, 40% of American caregivers are men.
Some states have heeded the growing calls for action.
Earlier this year, Maine lawmakers created a state program to provide respite care, which includes services such as adult day care that give family caregivers a temporary break.
Also this year, Tennessee extended its pilot program that provides respite care for Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, and also passed a bipartisan bill that directs the state Medicaid program to develop guidelines to allow family caregivers to be paid for their work.
Last year, Nebraska passed a tax credit for family caregivers; Oklahoma passed a similar law the year before. And while the United States is one of few countries that doesn’t mandate paid family leave at the federal level, 13 states and the District of Columbia have established their own paid family leave rules.
Meanwhile, the historic cuts to Medicaid enacted as part of the GOP’s Big, Beautiful Bill Act will shift health costs to states, leaving experts worried that family caregivers could lose Medicaid-funded services they rely on.

Like the rest of the nation, North Carolina faces some enormous policy challenges these days. Thanks to sustained disinvestments in an array of core public services, our state is fast becoming coarser, less healthy and more divided.
Unfortunately, Republican legislative leaders seem unconcerned. Rather than working with Governor Josh Stein to tackle our numerous outsized problems, they spent the recent legislative session advancing divisive culture war bills and failing even to pass a new state budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.
And now, rather than honestly owning up to and addressing their shortcomings, they’re returning to Raleigh this week to double down on them with a plan to override Stein’s vetoes of several destructive and hyper-partisan bills. And the overdue budget? It’s nowhere in sight.
The bottom line: Caring and thinking lawmakers of both parties should take a stand against this failed and divisive strategy by sustaining Stein’s vetoes and sending a message to legislative leaders that it’s past time to end the games and work together for the good of all North Carolinians.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)No reading of tea leaves or consulting the crystals appears necessary to remind us that the 2026 election is in full swing … at mid-year of 2025. Candidates are announcing intentions, editorials are being written, and public polling is afoot, the first of which for me landed in my text messages last week.
With a growing number of Democratic and a pair of Republican hats in the ring, Nebraskans in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District will have a bountiful slate of hopefuls from which to choose as Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon’s successor. U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., will be challenged by registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn. Gov. Jim Pillen has announced his bid for reelection. Those willing to run in this political universe deserve some respect, too.
Some in the chattering class — this space included — have on occasion referred to these days, weeks and months as “silly season,” a snarky broadside not without basis. For details, check some of the frivolity that has accompanied recent campaigns when we set about practicing the bedrock principle of a democratic republic: representative government. Surely the next political contests will provide an intermittent inanity or perhaps some full-on foolishness. 
But make no mistake. What’s at stake this time is anything but silly.
Serious season
This “season” is as serious as one has been. That’s because the shibboleths are correct: Elections have consequences, and we get the government we choose. Even a cursory reading of the morning headlines or a map of the republic’s current misdirection underscores the point that the nation has arrived at a critical intersection.
Election “issues” include the usual suspects: taxes, inflation, immigration, education, foreign policy and jobs. Those and others such as climate change and international trade need to be parsed, debated and delineated among those vying to represent Nebraskans. 
Given the rocky road on which we find ourselves, however, at this juncture in the nascent campaigns, only two issues have worked their way to the top of my mind. Whether they will get any “play” in the 24/7 phalanx of media that hops aboard these long, expensive journeys to a seat in Congress or the state’s corner office remains to be seen. Pro tip: Don’t hold your breath.
First is perhaps more of a group exercise. I’m wondering who, if any, among candidates — incumbents or hopefuls — share the concern that Congress has ceded its co-equal status as a full and functioning branch of government? Or are they comfortable with governing via executive order? See DOGE’s rampage and ransacking for evidence of such acquiescence.
Numbers look off
The numbers are in, too. According to GovTrack.us, Congress has enacted just 27 pieces of legislation since raising its aggregate right hand in early January. Despite the GOP having a majority in the House and Senate, that’s the fewest number of bills in the first six months since the 103rd Congress in 1993, when Democratic President Bill Clinton also enjoyed a political advantage in both houses. 
Nor does passing the Big Ugly in early July make up for the meandering pace of problem solving. All of which adds to the incredulity of House Speaker Mike Johnson extending the August recess while he appears to need time to mitigate the House’s role in a scandalous tempest starting to howl. Less production apparently equals longer recesses.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Second, and of even more importance for a candidate to consider than undoing Congressional capitulation or unchallenged conformity, is whether he or she, as an elected official, would be willing to stand in the face of complete horse hockey and demand that when we do the people’s business, we do it with the facts, not conspiracy theories, internet rumors or simple, bald-faced lies. 
Case in point: Did any of Nebraska’s quintet of representatives publicly question that the country’s director of national intelligence, at a regularly scheduled press conference in the White House briefing room, accused a former presidential candidate of abusing prescription drugs using information from Russian spies? That was also about the time, contrary to evidence, the president was trying to sell the snake oil that a former president should be indicted for treason.
Nebraska used to enjoy a reputation for producing independent political thinkers, a feather in our caps. As we navigate this election season, I’ll be listening for those kinds of voices as taxes, inflation, immigration, education, foreign policy, jobs and more dominate our electoral discussions.
Given the seriousness of this election, however, I’ll mostly be listening for voices who want to return Congress to its full power and who will speak and respect facts, evidence and the truth.

 SMYRNA, Del. Delaware Emergency Management Agency launches a new Delaware School Safety Center as an extension of its Comprehensive School Safety Program. Delaware is committed to providing safe and secure learning environments for students. The DSSC features a new, user-friendly website (https://de.gov/demaschoolsafety) that will be a central hub for training, resources, and coordination where schools and families can access guidance, tools, and best practices on school safety planning and response efforts.



   Joshua Bushweller said that ensuring a safe environment for all Delaware students is of paramount importance.
 

  “The DSSC is a collaborative effort that supports educators and first responders and engages students and parents to build safe and resilient schools communities,” said DEMA director A.J. Shall.
 


 The CSSP was established in 2012, following the passage of Omnibus Safety Act. It laid the foundations for comprehensive, standardized emergency planning at all public and charter school across the state. The act required all schools to have safety plans, conduct lockdown drills and tabletop exercise, as well as critical incident training.


 Delaware has made significant achievements in the area of school safety. Delaware was the state that provided uniform aerial maps for all 19 districts of public schools and charters to ensure rapid response by law enforcement to school buildings and campus during emergencies. Delaware launched Safe DE in 2023. It is a comprehensive safety suite with a 24/7 anonymous report application that empowers students, staff and families to access crisis resources and report safety concerns. Delaware’s School Safety Center offers comprehensive Behavioral Threat Analysis (BTA), enabling school-based teams to identify and respond to potential threats proactively. The Center also provides secure case-management software that facilitates consistent documentation, collaboration and follow-up during the assessment process.



  The Delaware School Safety Center was created to help prevent incidents at schools by preparing educators to work together with community partners in order to mitigate and manage crises.
 

  “Nothing is as important as student safety. Students learn and teachers can teach when they are safe. Safety is not an accident, it’s a deliberate decision.  Secretary for Education Cindy Marten said, “The launch of the Delaware School Safety Center is so important because it represents our shared commitment to create safe and welcoming school environments where teachers can teach and students can flourish.” I am grateful to DEMA for its focused leadership and proud that Delaware is always at the forefront of putting students’ needs first.
 


 The new DSCC offers a range of services that will enhance school safety as part of its core mission. These include:



  After-School Activities – Officials are able to provide schools with tools and guidance in order to plan and manage safely after-school activities, extracurricular sports and gatherings of the community on school grounds.
 

  Law Enforcement Training – School resource officers and constables can receive the latest law enforcement training, with an emphasis on relationship-building, safety planning and de-escalation.
 

  Safety Assessments: Trained professionals are available to help schools identify weaknesses and make practical recommendations based on evidence to enhance school security.

(Screenshot via Facebook page of HOMES Inc.)The groundbreaking Wednesday for a new neighborhood in the Floyd County seat of Prestonsburg wasn’t just a ceremony for Tom Manning-Beavin. The crews working for his nonprofit had already started digging trenches to pour concrete foundations of future homes. 
“My crew leaders were talking to the city building inspector as we were leaving, coordinating the inspection of those footers,” said Manning-Beavin, president and CEO of Frontier Housing in Morehead. “We’ll pour and just start rocking and rolling.” 
The quick pace Manning-Beavin describes is one that nonprofit housing builders in Eastern Kentucky have tried to keep up in the three years since catastrophic flooding inundated Eastern Kentucky communities in the summer of 2022. The aftermath of that disaster ruined thousands of homes and killed dozens of people, and the region has grappled with more devastating floods since, including in February. 
It also has brought about collaborations between Kentucky state government, nonprofit builders and local officials to develop several “higher ground” communities out of flood plains. 
Newly built homes have been going up, some on former strip mines, and flood survivors are slowly starting to move in. Housing developments are still being planned. In Floyd County, the planned neighborhood called New Hope Estates will have 34 homes funded by federal disaster funds previously allocated. 
Despite builders trying to ramp up construction, the need for housing is both vast and urgent.

Ashley Tackett-Laferty, D-Martin. (Provided via Flickr, Office of Gov. Andy Beshear)
Scott McReynolds, the executive director of the Perry County-based Housing Development Alliance, said his nonprofit has built roughly 400 homes over roughly 30 years. In  past years, the nonprofit would typically consider 20 homes built in a year as a “great year.” 
He now expects to build around 60 this year, with a total reaching up to 140 over two years. 
“We’re producing at a scale that just a few years ago was not conceivable. And so on the one hand, I think this is a great push,” McReynolds said. “On the other hand, I don’t know that it’s sufficient.” 
Fahe, a network of more than 50 nonprofits across Appalachia including the Housing Development Alliance and Frontier Housing, rallied around the slogan “Housing Can’t Wait” in the wake of the 2022 floods to call on the Kentucky legislature to allocate immediate housing funds for the region. It’s evolved in the years since into a call to action to address the broader housing shortage across Appalachia, setting an ambitious goal of building or rehabilitating 60,000 homes through 2030 across the multi-state region that Fahe serves. That would double the pace of housing work that the Fahe network does. 
Reynolds said his nonprofit’s calculations, utilizing census data on housing and income, estimate that about 40% of the tens of thousands people across the primary counties they serve of Breathitt, Leslie, Perry and Knott are “inadequately housed.” He said that can include people experiencing homelessness, people living in substandard housing with structural issues or people paying a disproportionate amount of funding on rent or a mortgage. 
“If that number is even remotely accurate, then we need thousands of affordable units. And even with the flood recovery, we’re building hundreds,” McReynolds said. 
Collaborations building communities
One success story is just outside the Letcher County seat of Whitesburg — eight homes on top of a hillside for flood survivors called Thompson Branch. It’s the second planned “higher ground” community in the region to finish construction, according to the office of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. 
Seth Long, executive director of the nonprofit housing builder HOMES Inc., that led the construction of the community, said one of the flood survivors his nonprofit is trying to get into a Thompson Branch home has been living in a 16-foot trailer since the 2022 flood. 
“When I walked him through the house, which is a modest ranch-style house, he was like, “My whole trailer could fit in this one room. He said, ‘You don’t know what it’s like to live three years in a trailer,’” Long said. “He hasn’t been able to move one way or another because there’s nothing that’s available.” 
The homes at Thompson Branch also feature solar panels and an energy efficient design, a part of Home Inc.’s efforts to greatly reduce electricity costs for residents in a region that struggles with some of the state’s highest electricity bills. One of the flood survivors who moved into Thompson Branch, he said, was “tickled to death” to have an electricity bill of only $22.58. 
Another statistic that sticks with Long: More than 500 households in Letcher County have used  federal buyout programs to move out of the flood plain after the 2022 and 2025 floods. Those are hundreds of houses that aren’t being replaced in his community. 
“We’re still yet, three years later, feeling a very sharp impact,” Long said. “That federal investment is now just really practically hitting the ground to where builders are building houses back.”
The work of building homes is just getting underway for Long and other builders. There’s a planned “high-ground” community of 115 homes in Jenkins that’s moving forward. HOMES Inc. is also partnering with the Letcher County government on a few housing projects including turning an old high school building in Fleming-Neon into rental units. They’re also one of several housing nonprofits involved with a higher ground community called Chestnut Ridge in Knott County.

Frontier Housing, the Morehead nonprofit, is also launching a factory in Martin County to build customizable modular homes that it hopes can ramp up the production of housing in multiple Eastern Kentucky communities. 
Building out the infrastructure to serve these homes and securing and developing the land has taken years, nonprofit housing builders told the Lantern. Long said the work of actually building the homes is “just hitting the ground.” 
Builders including Long will still be tapping into the remaining pool of nearly $300 million in federal disaster housing funds allocated after the 2022 floods. But builders believe more investment is needed to keep building on the boom of construction. 
Fahe and other nonprofit housing builders came before the Kentucky legislature last year asking for $200 million to be placed into state housing trust funds to pay for housing construction and rehabilitation. Republican leadership, as they were crafting a two-year state budget, declined to make that investment and questioned the capacity of housing developers to effectively use that money  in a two-year timeframe.
Long said the progress nonprofit housing builders have made in three years shows they do have the capacity to build — if given the resources. 
“One of the things that have limited capacity has been property to build and investment to develop that property. If those things are in place, we can build as many houses that are needed,” Long said. “This kind of momentum, this kind of investment is what moves the needle. It gives impact. It can get attention. It can house people.” 
Floods and funding
Many aspects of future housing work are uncertain, such as how to plan for the next flood or storm. The trauma of going through a major flood can remain with people. 
“It is hard to heal from that,” said Courtney Rhoades, an organizer at the nonprofit legal group Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center in Whitesburg. She mentioned the anxiety of dealing with flash flood warnings earlier this month and hearing the news of destructive flooding in Pike County earlier this year. 
There needs to be more affordable housing, she said, but it needs to be done in a way that includes the input of communities. That includes people with personal connections to their land. 
“I think the ‘higher-ground’ communities is great in the sense of if people want to move,” Rhoades said. “You also need to find solutions for people who don’t want to move away.” 
She believes the construction of the Thompson Branch community incorporated local feedback well, given its close proximity near Whitesburg for people who live and work locally. 
Another question for the future: what will happen under a new administration to federal housing programs that builders rely on.
The Kentucky Housing Corporation, the quasi-governmental agency that allocates federal housing funding, has spoken out against a Trump administration budget proposal that the agency argues could cut federal housing monies, including programs for housing construction, received in Kentucky by 44%. 
“At a minimum, it’s chaotic at the federal level,” said Jim King, the CEO of Fahe. “We don’t know what the commitment of federal resources that have traditionally supported this kind of work will look like.” 
He said Fahe’s nonprofit members are instead leaning into private philanthropy and funding to meet their longer-term housing goals in lieu of uncertain federal and state support. While he considers the Kentucky governor and the Kentucky legislature to be “great partners” when involved, he isn’t going to be limited by their funding choices. 
“I think Eastern Kentucky has spent a lot of time waiting for other people to show up with resources. And that’s — quite honestly — that’s the dynamic I’m actually interested to change,” King said.

It was a symbolic show of solidarity with the real Gaza Freedom Flotilla boats, which have tried to bring humanitarian relief to the two million Palestinians in Gaza – almost always without success and on one occasion resulting in the killing of 10 crew members by Israel.  
One boat – the Madleen – was boarded by Israel in international waters on June 8. The entire crew was arrested and deported from Israel, and its cargo impounded. It only garnered as much publicity as it did because the climate and human rights activist Greta Thunberg was on board.

Another Flotilla ship, the Handala, was intercepted by Israel July 27 in international waters. Among the humanitarian supplies it was carrying was baby formula for starving babies in Gaza.
Besides raising awareness of the ongoing genocide there, the New Haven Freedom Flotilla was raising money for the World Central Kitchen (WCK). It had been feeding tens of thousands of starving Gazans until it was forced to stop for seven weeks due to Israel’s total blockade from March to May, after unilaterally breaking the second ceasefire since October 7. WCK started up operations in late June, but announced on July 20 that it was shutting down again because they had run out of supplies, since Israel is preventing 3,000 trucks from entering the territory.
Our kayakers paddled just outside the Lighthouse Point swimming area, eight of them each displaying a letter that spelled out FEED GAZA. We landed near the lighthouse where we were greeted by dozens of supporters, singing songs and holding banners that demanded, “Permanent Ceasefire Now,” “U.S.: Stop Arming Israel” and “Stop Starving Gaza – Stop ICE – Free Palestine.”

We shared watermelon and got acquainted, since many of us did not know each other and people had come after learning about the event from various lists and social media.
This was a unique action, and it was a local angle on a horrible international tragedy and crime, funded with our tax dollars. It was, therefore, newsworthy. I sent out the news advisory to the usual suspects, but didn’t get much pick-up. One TV station called to say they were planning to come, unless “breaking news” intervened. Then – guess what?! – “breaking news” intervened.
I guess the fact that Israel’s murderous assault on Gaza had been going on for 644 days at that point made it old news.
The confirmed death toll in Gaza so far is more than 58,000 souls, not counting all those buried in the rubble, with some estimates in the hundreds of thousands. And here’s an almost unbelievable twist. Since the U.S. stopped funding UNRWA – the U.N. agency responsible for meeting the needs of displaced Palestinians since 1947 – and since Israel kicked UNRWA out of Gaza, a new U.S.- and Israel-supported organization, the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), is in charge of feeding the starving populace. 
So far, according to the U.N., at least 875 Gazans have been killed trying to access food, the vast majority at the four sites operated by GHF. (UNRWA ran 400 community-based sites.) According to a report on the Israeli news site Ha’aretz, some Israeli soldiers have revealed that they were ordered to shoot to kill unarmed people who posed no threat. When Hamas and other fighters entered Israel on October 7, they massacred 736 Israeli civilians. So, more Palestinians have been killed trying to get food than Israeli civilians were killed on Oct. 7.
When Israel broke the ceasefire in March, I was filled with anger and despair. I’d been holding signs and banners since mid-October of 2023, but none of my messages seemed adequate to the enormity of Israel’s crimes. It came to me to make a sign that reads, “Palestinians are human.” It’s by far my most popular message. I get dozens of horn honks and thumbs up whenever I hold it at busy intersections. Someone even blew me a kiss.
The American people do not agree with sending billions in military aid to Israel to destroy Gaza. If you agree that two million people – including a million children – do not deserve to starve, you can help by donating to WCK. And if you think the more than $350 million from Connecticut taxpayers currently going to Israel to carry out its atrocities could be put to better use, contact your federal elected officials to demand that they turn off the spigot. And tell them to demand that Israel allow the trucks stuck at the border into Gaza.
Every day the death toll from starvation rises, one more proof of Israel’s genocidal intentions.

However, these low performances are not anomalies — but the status quo, highlighting the state’s prolonged struggle to reverse its affordability issues.   
In early July, CNBC released its annual “America’s Top States for Business” report in which the Constitution State finished middle-of-the-pack, placing 28th overall. The top five were North Carolina, Texas, Florida, Virginia, and Ohio. 
Despite Connecticut improving its overall ranking by four positions from last year, driven mostly by leaps in subcategories like ‘workforce,’ the state still lags in critical areas such as ‘Economy,’ ‘Cost of Doing Business,’ and ‘Cost of Living.’ (See Table One) 
TABLE ONE: CONNECTICUT’S CNBC RESULTS 
CATEGORY 2025 GRADE 2025 RANK 2024 RANK DIFFERENCE Economy D+ 38 39 +1 Infrastructure C 33 29 +4 Workforce B 8 20 +12 Cost of Doing Business D+ 44 43 -1 Business Friendliness C 35 39 +4 Quality of Life B 5 9 +4 Technology & Innovation C+ 19 25 +6 Education A- 5 4 -1 Access to Capital C+ 16 22 +6 Cost of Living D+ 37 34 -3 
Connecticut’s subcategory scores from CNBC are consistent with other national and local surveys released over the past year, indicating a concerning pattern.
WalletHub ranked Connecticut 49th for starting a business; and the Tax Foundation placed the state 47th for the most burdensome tax climate for the tenth consecutive year. The CT Mirror also recently asserted that while Connecticut boasts high average salaries, its cost of living is among the nation’s highest.  
Meanwhile, earlier this year, Realtor.com listed Connecticut third among the states with the highest median property taxes. As the real estate website noted, “Overall, Connecticut residents faced some of the largest property tax increases in the last decade. …Bridgeport, Stamford, and Norwalk are paying some of the highest.”  
When compared to other New England states, New Hampshire eclipsed the Constitution State with the second highest median property tax. Vermont had the lowest rate in the region ranking 33rd. (See Table TWO) 
TABLE TWO: HIGHEST MEDIAN PROPERTY TAX 
STATE MEDIAN PROPERTY TAX AMOUNT New Jersey $9,413 New Hampshire $7,715 Connecticut $6,944 Washington $6,338 New York $6,096 Texas $5,860 California $5,248 Massachusetts $5,142 Rhode Island $5,111 District of Columbia $5,087 
High electric and gas rates, coupled with Connecticut’s ranking among the worst states to retire, exacerbate its affordability crisis — which may endure without curbing government spending and regulations. 
Yet fiscal restraint appears unlikely. Lawmakers are aiming to loosen the state’s fiscal guardrails — bipartisan reforms passed in 2017 to limit the growth in government spending and stabilize the state’s finances — in a rumored special session this fall. Indeed, lawmakers already broke several of the guardrails this past legislative session, despite the reforms’ effectiveness. Since enacted, they have reversed decades of pension underfunding, improved Connecticut’s creditworthiness, and saved the state more than $170 million annually in reduced pension debt payments.  
And despite declaring to be a “strong believer in the spending cap,” Gov. Ned Lamont and lawmakers exceeded the constitutional limit for the first time in nearly two decades to address anticipated Medicaid shortfalls from the federal government. 
Increased government spending, often funded by higher taxes, undermines economic vitality. Indeed, over the years, Connecticut has lost numerous corporate headquarters fleeing to other states (e.g., General Electric, Aetna, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, even LEGO) mostly driven by cost of business expenses.  
Connecticut’s business community has expressed a lack of overwhelming confidence in the state’s economic outlook. In a 2024 survey conducted by the Connecticut Business & Industry Association (CBIA), 86% of business leaders felt the cost of doing business in Connecticut was increasing; and only 8% believed the business climate was improving, versus 39% who said it was declining.  
Although Connecticut’s GDP grew by 2.6% last year, the state economy is not particularly on sound footing, contracting for the “first time in more than three years in the first quarter of 2025 amid tariff concerns, slower consumer spending, and ongoing volatility in the state’s jobs market,” according to CBIA.  
These circumstances would not be as harsh if Connecticut residents received quality government services in return for higher property taxes, helping fund local government operations and schools — yet this isn’t the case. A March 2025 WalletHub report ranks the Constitution State 37th in the country for taxpayer return on investment.  
In short, residents are paying more for less services.  
Further tax increases to fund programs will likely worsen affordability. Higher taxes raise property costs, exacerbating cost-of-living burdens and driving residents and businesses to more affordable states. This vicious cycle leads to the foreshadowed conclusion: a reduction in the tax base. 
Ultimately, Connecticut’s rankings are unlikely to improve without fiscal discipline. All roads to recovery and affordability stem from government restraint, which had once saved the state from a budgetary crisis. 
Lawmakers must resist short-term spending increases, prioritizing fiscal responsibility to ensure a more prosperous future.

This story was updated at 10:38 p.m.
Vermont Green Football Club’s magical season will continue next week in the USL League Two national championship after a 4-2 penalty kick shootout victory over Dothan United Sunday night.
Owen O’Malley netted the Green’s fourth goal in the shootout, punching the club’s ticket to the national championship next Saturday — and sending the sold-out crowd at the University of Vermont’s Virtue Field into a raucous celebration. 
“I do it for the fans, man, you know?” O’Malley said. “I just love these guys so much.”
Goalkeeper Niklas Herceg made two dramatic saves in the shootout to help secure the win.
“The reaction [to me] saving the penalties was incredible. It gives you more energy to maybe save the next one again,” Herceg said.
The Green and Alabama-based Dothan battled through an evenly matched, scoreless 90 minutes in regulation. Vermont Green seemed to have the edge in the two 15-minute extra time halves. But despite a few chances, Vermont couldn’t find the back of the net.
“At the end of the day, we deserved to win,” said Vermont Green FC Head Coach Chris Taylor.
The 2025 season has been the club’s highest-achieving by far, with a 16-match undefeated record, a first-place finish in the northeast division, and an ongoing deep run into the playoffs. In 2024, the Green placed third in its division and won two playoff matches, but were ultimately knocked out by the nationally top-ranked Seacoast United of New Hampshire.
This year, the club will play for the national title — and for the growing fanbase in Vermont.
“These boys, they’re special,” Taylor said. “It’s a humbling experience, I would say, for me to see a community like this support our team.”

(Courtesy photo/Arkansas State Police)Arkansas law enforcement officials are seeking the public’s help in finding a suspect in the killing of a couple in their 40s at Devil’s Den State Park on Saturday.
Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, of Prairie Grove were hiking with their two daughters when they were attacked, according to an Arkansas State Police press release on Sunday. The girls, ages 7 and 9, were not injured and are safe with family members, the release said. The family had recently moved to Arkansas from another state, state police said.
ASP was notified of a double homicide at the Washington County park about 2:40 p.m. Saturday, and the couple was found dead on a walking rail, the release said.  The agency’s Criminal Investigation Division is investigating the suspected homicide.
Investigators asked that anyone who visited the park Saturday check cellphone photos and video and GoPro camera footage for possible images of the suspect. State police asked, however, that anyone with photos or video not post footage on social media, as this could jeopardize the investigation.
“Anyone with images of the suspect, information about the suspect or his whereabouts should contact ASP Troop L at (479) 751-6663,” the release said.
State police on Sunday described the suspect as a white male of medium build wearing a long-sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up dark pants, a dark ballcap and sunglasses. He was carrying a black backpack and wearing fingerless gloves, according to state police’s description.
He was seen driving toward a park exit in a black, four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda with the license plate covered by black tape, the ASP press release said. He may have traveled on Arkansas Highway 170 or 229 near the park, state police said.
The area where the couple was found remains cordoned off and secured by law enforcement, the release said. The park’s website on Sunday said all trails remain closed.
Located in a remote, rural and rugged area with thick vegetation and no cellphone service near West Fork, the park is a popular hiking and mountain biking destination.
Shea Lewis, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism, issued a statement saying, “We are deeply saddened by the tragic events that occurred at Devil’s Den State Park. … The safety of our visitors and staff is our highest priority, and we are working closely with Arkansas State Police and various law enforcement officials as the investigation continues.”
Col. Mike Hagar, director of State Police and secretary of Public Safety, said his agency is working with local, state and federal law enforcement to apprehend the suspect.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ASP-patrol-car-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-27 21:56:45.008145

(Photo by Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Ninety-six percent of all registered voters in Idaho believe that public lands should remain in public hands, according to a new poll paid for by Conservation Voters for Idaho.
The poll was conducted in the aftermath of a federal proposal from U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to make millions of acres of public land in the U.S., including in Idaho, available to be sold off.
The poll specifically asked Idaho voters questions about Idaho public lands and who they support in Idaho’s 2026 U.S. Senate race.
Alexis Pickering, executive director of Conservation Voters for Idaho, said she has never in her career seen Idahoans from all sides of the political spectrum unite behind a single issue like they have behind public lands this year.
“It really is clear that voters are unified in keeping public lands in public hands,” Pickering said in a phone interview Wednesday.
“It demonstrates that Idaho voters are very cognizant of this fight right now,” Pickering said. “They are very engaged, and they are not going to sit this out.”
More than 60% of the land in Idaho is public land of some form.
Idaho’s registered voters are clear on their support for public access to public lands
The polling firm Change Research conducted the poll among 1,027 registered Idaho voters from July 15-17. The margin of error was 3.2%, according to Change Research.
One poll question asked voters, “Did you support or oppose the amendment to sell off over 3 million acres of public land across 11 Western states, including Idaho?” – with 87% of respondents saying they opposed it.
Battles over public lands loom even after sell-off proposal fails

Another poll question asked voters which statement came closest to their opinion:

Public lands in Idaho, where people enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and biking, should remain public and be protected so that everyone can keep enjoying them.
Public lands in Idaho, where people enjoy outdoor activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, and biking, should be made available for purchase and private ownership.

Ninety-six percent of Idaho registered voters said public lands should remain public, including 97% of registered Democrats and 95% of registered Republicans, the poll found.
Lee withdrew his amendment to sell public lands after a public backlash and three of Idaho’s four members of Congress provided public opposition from within the Republican Party to selling public lands.
Even though the public lands amendment was withdrawn, Pickering said the issue isn’t going away. She said Conservation Voters for Idaho plans to highlight public lands as a central issue and continue to hold elected officials accountable for keeping public lands public.
Pickering also said the public is deeply invested in the issue and knows Lee could file another proposal to sell public lands. She compared the proposal to sell public lands to waking a sleeping bear.
“Now that they have woken the bear, it will be really hard to get that bear back in hibernation mode,” Pickering said.
How Idaho’s congressional delegation responded to public lands proposal
Three of Idaho’s four members of Congress, U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo and U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, all R-Idaho, provided public Republican opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands, the Sun previously reported.
On June 20, Risch and Crapo, both announced they were opposed to the provision in the budget reconciliation process to sell off public lands. Simpson co-sponsored the Public Lands in Public Hands Act.
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, opposed the Public Lands in Public Hands Act, the Utah News Dispatch reported.
In a phone interview with the Idaho Capital Sun earlier this month, Fulcher said, “public land should remain public, but the control, management should be local stakeholders, not the federal government.”
Polling data shows that Risch received a 10% bump in support among all registered voters after they learned Risch provided opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands, up from 41% to 51%. Among registered Republican voters only, Risch’s support increased from 60% to 72% after voters learned Risch provided opposition to the proposal to sell off public lands.
The poll only asked voters about Risch’s upcoming U.S. Senate race, where he faces re-election in 2026. The poll did not ask about Crapo, Simpson or Fulcher, Pickering said.

As the planet gets hotter and its reservoirs shrink and its glaciers melt, people have increasingly drilled into a largely ungoverned, invisible cache of fresh water: the vast, hidden pools found deep underground.
Now, a new study that examines the world’s total supply of fresh water — accounting for its rivers and rain, ice and aquifers together — warns that Earth’s most essential resource is quickly disappearing, signaling what the paper’s authors describe as “a critical, emerging threat to humanity.” The landmasses of the planet are drying. In most places there is less precipitation even as moisture evaporates from the soil faster. More than anything, Earth is being slowly dehydrated by the unmitigated mining of groundwater, which underlies vast proportions of every continent. Nearly 6 billion people, or three quarters of humanity, live in the 101 countries that the study identified as confronting a net decline in water supply — portending enormous challenges for food production and a heightening risk of conflict and instability.

The paper “provides a glimpse of what the future is going to be,” said Hrishikesh Chandanpurkar, an earth systems scientist working with Arizona State University and the lead author of the study. “We are already dipping from a trust fund. We don’t actually know how much the account has.”
The research, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, confirms not just that droughts and precipitation are growing more extreme but reports that drying regions are fast expanding. It also found that while parts of the planet are getting wetter, those areas are shrinking. The study, which excludes the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland, concludes not only that Earth is suffering a pandemic of “continental drying” in lower latitudes, but that it is the uninhibited pumping of groundwater by farmers, cities and corporations around the world that now accounts for 68% of the total loss of fresh water in those areas, which generally don’t have glaciers.
Groundwater is ubiquitous across the globe, but its quality and depth vary, as does its potential to be replenished by rainfall. Major groundwater basins — the deep and often high-quality aquifers — underlie roughly one-third of the planet, including roughly half of Africa, Europe and South America. But many of those aquifers took millions of years to form and might take thousands of years to refill. Instead, a significant portion of the water taken from underground flows off the land through rivers and on to the oceans.
The researchers were surprised to find that the loss of water on the continents has grown so dramatically that it has become one of the largest causes of global sea level rise. Moisture lost to evaporation and drought, plus runoff from pumped groundwater, now outpaces the melting of glaciers and the ice sheets of either Antarctica or Greenland as the largest contributor of water to the oceans.
The study examines 22 years of observational data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, satellites, which measure changes in the mass of the earth and have been applied to estimate its water content. The technique was groundbreaking two decades ago when the study’s co-author, Jay Famiglietti, who was then a professor at the University of California, at Irvine, used it to pinpoint where aquifers were in decline. Since then, he and others have published dozens of papers using GRACE data, but the question has always lingered: What does the groundwater loss mean in the context of all of the water available on the continents? So Famiglietti, now a professor at Arizona State University, set out to inventory all the land-based water contained in glaciers, rivers and aquifers and see what was changing. The answer: everything, and quickly.

Since 2002, the GRACE sensors have detected a rapid shift in water loss patterns around the planet. Around 2014, though, the pace of drying appears to have accelerated, the authors found, and is now growing by an area twice the size of California each year. “It’s like this sort of creeping disaster that has taken over the continents in ways that no one was really anticipating,” Famiglietti said. (Six other researchers also contributed to the study.) The parts of the world drying most acutely are becoming interconnected, forming what the study’s authors describe as “mega” regions spreading across the earth’s mid-latitudes. One of those regions covers almost the whole of Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Asia.
In the American Southwest and California, groundwater loss is a familiar story, but over the past two decades that hot spot has also spread dramatically. It now extends through Texas and up through the southern High Plains, where the Ogallala aquifer is depended on for agriculture, and it spreads south, stretching throughout Mexico and into Central America. These regions are connected not because they rely on the same water sources — in most cases they don’t — but because their populations will face the same perils of water stress: the most likely, a food crisis that could ultimately displace millions of people.
“This has to serve as a wake-up call,” said Aaron Salzberg, a former fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center and the former director of the Water Institute at the University of North Carolina, who was not involved with the study.

Research has long established that people take more water from underground when climate-driven heat and drought are at their worst. For example, during droughts when California has enforced restrictions on delivery of surface water to its farmers — which the state regulates — the enormous agriculture enterprises that dominate the Central Valley have drilled deeper and pumped harder, depleting the aquifer — which the state regulates less precisely — even more.
For the most part, such withdrawals have remained invisible. Even with the GRACE data, scientists cannot measure the exact levels or know when an aquifer will be exhausted. But there is one foolproof sign that groundwater is disappearing: The earth above it collapses as the ground compresses like a drying sponge. The visible signs of such subsidence around the world appear to match what the GRACE data says. Mexico City is sinking as its groundwater aquifers are drained, as are large parts China, Indonesia, Spain and Iran, to name a few. A recent study by researchers at Virginia Tech in the journal Nature Cities found that 28 cities across the United States are sinking — New York, Houston and Denver, among them — threatening havoc for everything from building safety to transit. In the Central Valley, the ground surface is nearly 30 vertical feet lower than it was in the first part of the 20th century.
When so much water is pumped, it has to drain somewhere. Just like rivers and streams fed by rainfall, much of the used groundwater makes its way into the ocean. The study pinpoints a remarkable shift: Groundwater drilled by people, used for agriculture or urban supplies and then discarded into drainages now contributes more water to the oceans than melting from each of the world’s largest ice caps.
People aren’t just misusing groundwater, they are flooding their own coasts and cities in the process, Famiglietti warns. That means they are also imperiling some of the world’s most important food-producing lowlands in the Nile and Mekong deltas and cities from Shanghai to New York. Once in the oceans, of course, groundwater will never again be suitable for drinking and human use without expensive and energy-sucking treatment or through the natural cycle of evaporating and precipitating as rain. But even then, it may no longer fall where it is needed most. Groundwater “is an intergenerational resource that is being poorly managed, if managed at all,” the study states, “at tremendous and exceptionally undervalued cost to future generations.”
That such rapid and substantial overuse of groundwater is also causing coastal flooding underscores the compounding threat of rising temperatures and aridity. It means that water scarcity and some of the most disruptive effects of climate change are now inextricably intertwined. And here, the study’s authors implore leaders to find a policy solution: Improve water management and reduce groundwater use now, and the world has a tool to slow the rate of sea level rise. Fail to adjust the governance and use of groundwater around the world, and humanity risks surrendering parts of its coastal cities while pouring out finite reserves it will sorely need as the other effects of climate change take hold.

If the drying continues — and the researchers warn that it is now nearly impossible to reverse “on human timescales” — it heralds “potentially staggering” and cascading risks for global order. The majority of the earth’s population lives in the 101 countries that the study identified as losing fresh water, making up not just North America, Europe and North Africa but also much of Asia, the Middle East and South America. This suggests the middle band of Earth is becoming less habitable. It also correlates closely with the places that a separate body of climate research has already identified as a shrinking environmental niche that has suited civilization for the past 6,000 years. Combined, these findings all point to the likelihood of widespread famine, the migration of large numbers of people seeking a more stable environment and the carry-on impact of geopolitical disorder.
Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, lauded the new report for confirming trends that were once theoretical. The ramifications, he said, could be profoundly destabilizing. “The massive overpumping of groundwater,” Gleick said, “poses enormous risk to food production.” And food, he pointed out, is the foundation for stability. The water science center he co-founded, the Pacific Institute, has tracked more than 1,900 incidents in which water supplies were either the casualty of, a tool for or the cause of violence. In Syria, beginning in 2011, drought and groundwater depletion drove rural unrest that contributed to the civil war, which displaced millions of people. In Ghana, in 2017, protesters rioted as wells ran dry. And in Ukraine, whose wheat supports much of the world, water infrastructure has been a frequent target of Russian attacks.
“Water is being used as a strategic and political tool,” said Salzberg, who spent nearly two decades analyzing water security issues as the special director for water resources at the State Department. “We should expect to see that more often as the water supply crisis is exacerbated.”
India, for example, recently weaponized water against Pakistan. In April, following terrorist attacks in Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suspended his country’s participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, a river-sharing agreement between the two nuclear powers that was negotiated in 1960. The Indus system flows northwest out of Tibet into India, before turning southward into Pakistan. Pakistan has severely depleted its groundwater reserves — the region is facing one of the world’s most urgent water emergencies according to the Science Advances paper. The Indus has only become more essential as a supply of fresh water for its 252 million people. Allowing that water to cross the border would be “prejudicial to India’s interests,” Modi said. In this case, he wasn’t attempting to recoup water supply for his country, Salzberg said, but was leveraging its scarcity to win a strategic advantage over his country’s principal rival.
What’s needed most is governance of water that recognizes it as a crucial resource that determines both sovereignty and progress, Salzberg added. Yet there is no international framework for water management, and only a handful of countries have national water policies of their own.
The United States has taken stabs at regulating its groundwater use, but in some cases those attempts appear to be failing. In 2014, California passed what seemed to many a revolutionary groundwater management act that required communities to assess their total water supply and budget its long-term use. But the act doesn’t take full effect until 2040, which has allowed many groundwater districts to continue to draw heavily from aquifers even as they complete their plans to conserve those resources. Chandanpurkar and Famiglietti’s research underscores the consequences for such a slow approach.
Arizona pioneered groundwater regulations in 1980, creating what it called active management areas where extraction would be limited and surface waters would be used to replenish aquifers. But it only chose to manage the water in metropolitan areas, leaving vast, unregulated swaths of the state where investors, farmers and industry have all pounced on the availability of free water for profit. In recent years, Saudi investors have pumped rural water to grow feed for cattle exported back to the Arabian Peninsula, and hedge funds are competing to pump and sell water to towns near Phoenix. Meanwhile, four out of the original five active management areas are failing to meet the state’s own targets.
“They like to say, ‘Oh, the management’s doing well,’” Famiglietti said, but looking out over the next century, the trends suggest the aquifers will continue to empty out. “No one talks about that. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say it’s an existential issue for cities like Phoenix.”
Both California and Arizona grow significant portions of America’s fruits and vegetables. Something has to give. “If you want to grow food in a place like California,” Famiglietti asked, “do you just bring in water? If we deplete that groundwater, I don’t think there’s enough water to really replace what we’re doing there.” The United States might not have much choice, he added, but to move California’s agriculture production somewhere far away and retire the land.
Chandanpurkar, Famiglietti and the report’s other authors suggest there are ready solutions to the problems they have identified, because unlike so many aspects of the climate crisis, the human decisions that lead to the overuse of water can be speedily corrected. Agriculture, which uses the vast majority of the world’s fresh water, can deploy well-tested technologies like drip irrigation, as Israel has, that sharply cut use by as much as 50%. When California farms reduced their take of Colorado River water in 2023 and 2024, the water levels in Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, jumped by 16 vertical feet as some 390 billion gallons were saved by 2025. Individuals can reduce water waste by changing simple routines: shortening showers or removing lawns. And cities can look to recycle more of the water they use, as San Diego has.
A national policy that establishes rules around water practices but also prioritizes the use of water resources for national security and a collective interest could counterbalance the forces of habit and special interests, Salzberg said. Every country needs such a policy, and if the United States were to lead, it might offer an advantage. But “the U.S. doesn’t have a national water strategy,” he said, referring to a disjointed patchwork of state and court oversight. “We don’t even have a national water institution. We haven’t thought as a country about how we would even protect our own water resources for our own national interests, and we’re a mess.”
