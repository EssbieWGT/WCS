(Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)Ashley Vance wakes up most mornings surprised by the quiet. No shouting. No searching for a safe couch. No fear of who she might encounter in a crowded shelter. For the first time in years, the 20-year-old trans woman has a door she can lock, a bed that’s hers, a future she can imagine.
But Ashley’s relief is fragile.
Her journey from foster care to shelters to the small housing program helping her today reveals a larger truth: when the child-welfare system stops at the threshold of adulthood, queer and trans youth are often left to find stable housing alone. In all of New Mexico, there are two housing programs built specifically for LGBTQ+ young people, according to Adrien Lawyer, co-Executive Director of the Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico—with limited beds, years-long waitlists, and almost no state funding.

This story originally published on New Mexico In Depth.

“I always knew who I was, so I always thought of myself as a girl,” Vance said. She was still just a kid—at 10 years of age, meant to be worrying about homework and friends—when she began her transition. By 11, her home life had become unstable, and a teacher contacted the state’s Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) after growing concerned about her well-being.The agency tried sending her back home, but after she ran away several times, they conceded she needed a safer place.
What followed, though, was a different kind of instability.
“Every time I got used to a place, CYFD would move me again. I never had time to settle. I never had time to be a kid,” she said. Some homes were crowded, others unwelcoming, and she often hid who she was to avoid trouble.
At 15, the state referred her to Casa Q, a housing program in Albuquerque for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer teens with nowhere else to go. For several years, it offered her a kind of predictability she needed: meals with housemates, weekly outings, adults who understood what it meant to be queer. “It was the first place where I felt seen,” she said.

That stability ended the day she turned 18 and, due to state rules, her placement ended automatically. New Mexico is considered “top five” in the nation for LGBTQ+ legal protections, with state policies that affirm transgender residents, according to Lawyer. Yet the state’s legal protections don’t help young queer adults aging out of foster care find safe living spaces.
After leaving Casa Q, Ashley experienced a blur of friends’ couches or city shelters. At one of the city’s largest shelters, she cried every day. “I didn’t feel safe. I had to keep myself quiet about who I was just to make it through the night. When I told people I was trans, that was a mistake,” she said. Even simple acts, like asking for respect, using her correct name and pronouns, or showing her identity, could put her at risk of harassment or exclusion.
Her search for something more than survival eventually led her back to the only programs in the state built specifically for queer and trans young people. Casa Q provided stability when she was a teenager. Casa Lola, another small program painstakingly built by the queer community for LGBTQ+ young adults struggling to access safe and stable housing, now gives her a chance to rebuild what she lost when childhood services ended but adult support never fully appeared.
Behind the Numbers: Youth Left Out
Homelessness in New Mexico has intensified sharply. A statewide annual count in January recorded 4,683 people experiencing homelessness—a more than twofold increase from 2,057 in 2021.
By one recent ranking, New Mexico had roughly 217 homeless individuals per 100,000 residents, placing it among the states with higher rates nationwide.
This year, the annual count identified 428 homeless youth in Albuquerque and 409 elsewhere, for a total of 837 youth statewide. Youth under 18 made up 22% of transitional housing and 17% of emergency shelter residents in Albuquerque, and 38% of transitional housing residents outside the metro.
The count also shows 34 individuals statewide who identify as  transgender, nonbinary, questioning, or other gender identities, but it is unclear how many are youth.
National research suggests these numbers understate the scale of LGBTQ+ youth homelessness.
Covenant House, a national nonprofit helping youth particularly vulnerable to homelessness,  estimates that about 40% of homeless youth in the U.S. identify as LGBTQ+, despite making up a small fraction of the general youth population. LGBTQ+ youth are 120% more likely to experience homelessness than their peers, according to the organization. CYFD has cited the same figures in its “Supporting Youth to Thrive” manual, acknowledging the disproportionate impact on LGBTQ+ young people.
Many end up cycling through shelters or living on the streets.
Finding Safe Harbor
In New Mexico, Casa Q is one of the rare places built to understand the needs of young queer people. The name itself reflects the mission: a safe home, “Casa,” for queer youth, “Q.”
A homeless shelter specifically for LGBTQ+ and youth of color, it serves teens escaping family rejection, homelessness, or violence. Since opening 10 years ago, it has served more than 100 young people, many arriving with nothing: no clothes, no ID, no safe adult to call.
The home is licensed by CYFD, has five bedrooms, and can serve up to eight residents at a time. “There are very few places like this. We’re the only program that’s lasted this long, and the need hasn’t slowed down,” said Executive Director Shannon Darrell.

For many teens, Casa Q is the first place where adults share their lived experience as queer people. Darrell explained, “It makes a difference when young people see themselves in the people supporting them. They feel safer. They open up faster.” Jericha Lee, the program’s director, added, “When I was younger and going through my own challenges, I didn’t have anything like Casa Q. Youth shouldn’t have to choose between a bed and their identity.”
Bella Garnet, a client advocate, said, “Unfortunately, the world is not very kind to members of the queer community, especially the trans community. A lot of our youth come from abusive homes. Their biggest challenge is trust and accepting that someone actually wants to help them.”

Ashley found that trust at Casa Q. “They taught me how to feel safe around people again,” she said.
Support continues long after residents leave. Lee said, “Just like having family, having a support system that never goes away.” Former residents can return for food, hygiene products, or a conversation, keeping a lifeline open well into adulthood.
Bridging to Adulthood
What happens when residents turn 18? Some transition to Casa Q’s Transitional Living Program (TLP), which supports young adults ages 18 to 23 in off-site apartments. Residents gain independence while receiving support with healthcare, employment, and education. They’re expected to maintain a job and savings to cover at least six months of rent.
“We meet them wherever they’re at,” Lee said. “Let’s work on finding you employment. Let’s work on school. If they do not feel prepared, we’ll work on extending it.” Two current TLP residents previously lived at Casa Q as minors.

But the program is small, with a long waitlist. “By the time clients move out, many have aged out or found other programs,” Darrell said. “We need more housing, opportunities, and funding to help these young adults succeed.”
When Ashley reached 18 years of age, there weren’t any openings in the program. But eventually she was able to find a spot at Casa Lola, across town, which operates under the Transgender Resource Center, a statewide organization addressing housing gaps for adults.
Like Casa Q, the name signals its mission: “Casa,” a home; “Lola,” honoring a trans woman who experienced chronic homelessness and died from related health consequences. Lawyer, co-Executive Director, explained, “Even when she finally got help, it was too late. Her story is a reminder of how deadly housing insecurity can be. Casa Lola bridges the gap for people who age out of youth programs or are struggling to find stable housing as adults.”
The house provides six beds, with stays up to two years. And it also has a long wait list. Since opening in early 2024, 20 people have stayed at Casa Lola. Three have completed the program and moved into permanent housing, while the others remain in the house or are continuing to work toward long-term stability. Most staff are LGBTQ+, ensuring residents are surrounded by adults who share their identities.
Krys Pomeroy, who works at Casa Lola as a resident assistant, emphasized the sense of community: “A lot of folks who come here have been through places where they weren’t seen, weren’t supported. We provide that sense of family and accountability.”

For Ashley, Casa Lola provides stability after years of uncertainty. “I have a stable living situation, and I’ve always had to be really independent. I never had a place I could call home until programs like this,” she said. “People here get me. They’ve helped me not feel like I have to hide. I feel welcomed, and if I have a bad day, I have people to come home to.”The program has also helped her set concrete goals. “I’m saving 30% of my paycheck, around $150 each time, for things like a car, an apartment, cosmetology school, and finishing my GED. For the first time in a long time, I have goals that make me feel better about myself.”    The Funding Challenge
Casa Lola and Casa Q are part of a fragile spectrum of LGBTQ+ housing. One catches youth before the system fails them; the other bridges the gap into adulthood.
Together, they highlight an urgent need for affirming housing in Albuquerque. There are similar housing programs, like New Day, Crossroads for Women, and Barrett House, but they aren’t specifically designed to be affirming spaces for the LGBTQ+ community.
Sen. Michael Padilla, D-Albuquerque, who was himself a foster youth, said aging out of care is like “the floor falling out from under you.” The stakes are high. “I looked at the data, and 70 to 77% of individuals who have ever been in foster care, and 77% of their children, end up in foster care. There is a perpetual cycle of instability,” he said. “I would say 35 to 40% of aged-out foster youth become homeless before they’re 21.”
Padilla sponsored 2019 legislation creating the state’s Fostering Connections program to help aging-out foster youth a year with housing assistance and educational support, using federal Title IV-E and Chafee Act funds. “The children that are affected by these services don’t have a bunch of high-powered lobbyists running around the Roundhouse,” he said. “I feel like I’m their lobbyist. I’m their person up there.”
But for LGBTQ+ youth specifically, Casa Q and Casa Lola fill a gap that general foster care transition programs don’t address: the need for housing where young people don’t have to hide who they are to stay safe.
Both programs face the same obstacle: funding. Casa Q’s transitional housing program relies on grants and donations. Casa Lola operates primarily through a private gift that enabled the house’s purchase, with staff pursuing grants and other resources.
Lawyer noted the challenge of expansion: “The worst thing for our communities is to say, ‘look at this wonderful thing we made for you,’ only to close it because we couldn’t fund it.”
Despite limited resources, staff continue to stretch their capacity. “It can feel heavy sometimes,” Garnett said. “But being able to be there for them in their darkest moments gives you purpose.”
Vance knows how rare her path has been. She moved from Casa Q to Casa Lola, one of the few in New Mexico to successfully navigate both programs.
But she also knows how easily it could have gone differently. “I think about the people I met in shelters who didn’t make it here,” she said. “A lot of them are still out there.”
Vance can picture a path ahead. But her story underscores what advocates say is urgent: programs like Casa Q and Casa Lola can change a life, but only if a bed is open when a young person needs one.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ashleyvance-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 17:58:27.024499

(Courtesy of Anna Keyzer)LINCOLN — A proposal from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services for changes to a Medicaid waiver allowing aging Nebraskans and those with a disability to remain at home is causing panic for some families and caregivers.
The proposal to the state’s Aged and Disabled Waiver would limit the need-determined reimbursable hours of caregivers from a current cap of 112 hours to 70. Of those hours, a paid live-in family caregiver could be reimbursed up to 40 hours, a part of the program with no current cap. 


Aged and Disabled Waiver eligibility

Be eligible for Nebraska Medicaid.
Have a disability or be over the age of 65.
Meet Nursing Facility Level of Care.
Demonstrate need for services.

More information is available here.


The annual costs that Medicaid would reimburse under the waiver would also be limited based on changes in the yearly costs of nursing home care statewide.
“If they truly do this, it’s going to be pretty devastating to our family,” said Anna Keyzer of Lincoln, who has utilized the payments for up to 112 weekly hours to help afford to care for her 21-year-old son, Simon. “I don’t know how anyone would suddenly lose 72 hours’ worth of a paid job and be OK.”
Yearly nursing home costs were $92,438 in the last fiscal year, which ended June 30. Families would need an administrative review once costs reach 150% of the annual cost ($138,657), and families could be paid as much as 175% of the cost of that care ($161,767) if they pass a clinical review from a DHHS team. 
DHHS says the changes are needed to make the program, which splits costs between the state and federal government, fiscally “sustainable.” The state faces a projected $471 million shortfall by mid-2027. Pillen is seeking to cut state spending by $500 million. DHHS is the largest state agency.

‘Pulling their lives apart’
Keyzer adopted Simon from Bulgaria in 2013, just before his 9th birthday. He weighed 18 pounds then and now weighs 72. Keyzer became his caregiver when he turned 19, and the family struggled to find outside options, including some who would quit soon after or leave during a shift. 
Simon has Renpenning syndrome, a rare genetic condition that occurs mostly in males. He is hard of hearing and blind, has auto-aggression, is tube fed and has osteoporosis because of a lack of nutrition when young.
Marie Wohlers of Crawford said her family is reimbursed for 80 weekly hours of family provided care under the AD Waiver to care for her 28-year-old daughter, Michaela. Wohlers noted that in the Nebraska Panhandle, support systems are already fairly limited, and she said families are mindful of rising costs.
“I feel like it’s pulling their lives apart, and with no support systems in place that if this happens, what happens to these individuals?” Wohlers said.










I really, truly hope that they listen to us family members, as caregivers, as taxpayers, that our opinion truly counts, because we are what the State of Nebraska is about.

Michaela has Rett syndrome, a rare genetic neurological disorder that primarily affects females and causes progressive loss of motor skills and language. She is unable to move herself, can’t walk or talk, is tube fed, has severe gastrointestinal issues, is at-risk for pressure sores and has a seizure disorder. 
Wohlers said she and her husband involve Michaela in their Panhandle cow-calf ranching operation as much as possible.
Wohlers worries the proposal puts Michaela and others at a higher risk for poor health or being taken advantage of. Wohlers said the waiver is meant to give individuals a better quality of life.
“I just feel like a lot of these things are going to make things more challenging, and it’s going to limit the quality of life for a lot of individuals,” said Wohlers, a former Crawford school board member.

Proposed waiver changes

Maximum reimbursable caregiver hours, 112 hours reduced to 70 hours.

No more than 40 hours could be paid to an in-home family caregiver.
An additional 30 hours could be added, but would need to be delivered by someone outside the home.


Maximum reimbursable costs each year are based on yearly nursing home costs, which were $92,438 as calculated by DHHS.

Families would need to undergo an administrative review if costs reach 150% of the annual cost ($138,657).
Families could be paid as much as 175% of the cost of nursing home care if they pass a clinical review from a DHHS team ($161,767).

‘Preserve the program long term’

At an emergency Dec. 19 meeting of the committee, Tony Green, director of the DHHS Division of Developmental Disabilities, said the changes are needed because, for the past 10 years of the program, costs have been “far outpacing” population growth, of 34%. 
More than 10,000 Nebraskans are now using the specific Medicaid waiver, according to DHHS.
DHHS spokesperson Jeff Powell and Green said the waiver’s total costs have increased 322%, from $91 million to $383.6 million (an average of $29.3 million annually). The duo said the individual cost per person has risen 218%, from $14,610 to $46,415 (an average of $3,181 each year).
Green said the Legislature has not provided a budget to support those costs, so DHHS is trying to find an alternative route through the “normal” five-year renewal point.
“It necessitates the state doing something to preserve the program long term, or we would have to implement a waiting list,” Green told the Olmstead Advisory Committee.
One of many Medicaid waivers
Phil Gray, second vice president for the Arc of Nebraska, a statewide nonprofit that advocates for Nebraskans with intellectual disabilities, said at the Olmstead meeting that the state’s description of the proposed changes might seem “reasonable,” but the “reality” parents might face is different.
“I’m not convinced that this process is going forward in any kind of manner … that you can manage in a reasonable way without having the catastrophes we’re hearing about,” Gray said.

Gray and others note that the AD Waiver proposal follows Pillen and Green taking steps to end a services waitlist for Nebraskans with developmental disabilities. Some said they worry success for one waiver now could hurt another.
Keyzer also worries the move is “political,” so Pillen and DHHS can say they offered solutions, even if they’re not “real” or practical. She and other families noted that many family caregivers work for minimum wage ($15 an hour, effective Jan. 1), yet some agency caregivers could be paid much more per hour. 
They say the changes aren’t fiscally responsible.
“These are the most intense mama and papa bears in this state who have been protecting their loved one and … fighting every step of the way to make sure that our children are alive and are OK and are living their best life,” Keyzer said. “We will continue to fight.”
Balancing hours
Joni Thomas, an AD Waiver recipient and Olmstead advisory member, said she had polio when she was two and a half, in 1959. It was the end of the second wave of the epidemic, and though the vaccine was out and her family had received it, she was already sick. She spent nine months in the hospital, including six in an iron lung.
Thomas said her mom was given the opportunity to put her in an institution, but her mother refused, saying, “She’s my child, and if she lives through this, I’m taking her home.”

Now 68 years old, Thomas said she grew up always wanting three things out of life: to own her own place with a personal set of keys, to drive and to have a job and not what she’s facing now. Thomas retired in 2023 and founded a nonprofit to bring awareness to an “untapped” pool of talent.
“I got all of those things,” said Thomas. “But at the same time, the programs are set up to really kind of keep you impoverished.”
Thomas currently uses the AD Waiver to cover about 10 hours overnight, to help her sleep comfortably and safely, and a few hours daily so she can go to the bathroom three times a day and help prepare food, of which she said a whole-food, plant-based diet has reduced sickness and kept her out of the hospital. 
If Thomas is limited to 70 hours or more, depending on a couple of proposed exceptions, it’ll affect how many hours she has per day, including to sleep. 
The fear is also real for Thomas’ mother, who is 91 and has significant dementia. The family worries the waiver changes would cause one of Thomas’ mother’s “greatest fears in life” to come true, that she couldn’t stay at home and live out the rest of her life comfortably.

When Thomas first found out about the changes, her first thought was, “Oh my God, the whole thing I fought all my life for is going to happen to me.” 
She said care needs to be certain, and doesn’t want to rely on a volunteer to use the bathroom. She said for those questioning her opposition to living in a Medicaid facility, they should visit one and ask themselves if they would want to live there. 
‘Cutting off our nose’
Multiple Olmstead advisory members and families have also pushed back on Green, with many questioning whether the calculated nursing facility rate the state is using is accurate.
For instance, Kierstin Reed, president and CEO of LeadingAge Nebraska, which represents nursing homes and assisted living facilities, told Green that institutions have a variety of payment rates based on the complexity of need. She told Green she would “guarantee” most would exceed $162,000, if not well more with some daily rates of $1,000.
Reed told Green the $92,000 limit would count for “bare minimum,” “custodial-level care,” not the care needed for AD Waiver participants. She told him the waiver changes are a “choice.”
“We’re cutting off our nose to spite our face,” Reed told the Nebraska Examiner.

Nebraska also has a workforce problem, Reed said, and some facilities can’t support the needs of all patients, either. Some Nebraskans don’t have a nursing home within 100 miles, let alone bed openings in one that accepts Medicaid residents. Reed said families also know their loved ones’ needs.
“They have the intuition to know what the routine is and what things need to look like and what their loved one needs and what every sound or every movement might mean,” Reed said.
Wohlers, whose family lives north of Crawford, said there is a day center in Chadron, almost 30 miles away, which was a “clear no” for Michaela.
“Not being able to talk doesn’t mean you don’t have thoughts or things you want to say or things you want to express,” Wohlers said. “It just means it’s harder for you to do so.”

Reed also expressed concerns that many AD Waiver recipients will still need the same level of care they are receiving now, which exceeds the state’s proposed hourly limits, and that family caregivers won’t have time to work to make up for the income lost to the new caps.
Keyzer is one of many families who worry whether they could get another job to fill the gap while still providing the same level of care their loved ones need. Many said they also worry about relying on strangers for care.
Green, responding to Reed, said “there’s not a clean way” to know how many families are above the proposed 70-hour limit. He said limiting families to 40 hours is “common” in other states.
‘Budgets are balanced on our backs’
Alana Schriver, executive director of the Nebraska Association of Service Providers, said many service coordinators are not aware of the changes being proposed for services that are a “lifeline” for many families. She said the timing seems intentional to seek public comment over the holidays, when families and advocates might be distracted or short on time.

Schriver said human lives are “more important than any dollar bill” and that anyone might need the AD Waiver one day. She placed blame for tight budget times on Gov. Jim Pillen for signing significant income tax breaks in 2023.
“Tax breaks for the wealthy should not come on the backs of the aging and disabled,” Schriver said.
Thomas said Nebraskans with disabilities are taxpayers, and she lives a “typical life” where she picks up her grandson five days a week and watches him at home while his parents work. But Nebraskans with disabilities are “at the bottom of the list.”
“Once again, budgets are balanced on our backs,” Thomas said. “I thought we were moving beyond that, but we’re not.”

Keyzer echoed those concerns and suggested DHHS fundraise or try to ask for additional state dollars. Green did not answer Keyzer when she asked if DHHS tried to seek additional funding, and Powell did not answer when the Examiner asked. 
“Is this really the way to produce funds?” Keyzer asked. “To scare us all, right before the holidays, and tell us we have to figure out how to survive without incomes and still take care of our kid? I don’t know how to do that.”
While the changes are still in the proposal stage, some families said they’ve been told their hours will be cut Jan. 1. Green sidestepped a mother when she asked him at the Olmstead meeting. Powell said no changes would occur until July 1.
‘Paying grandmas to be grandmas’
Pillen signed significant income tax cuts during his first year in office, in 2023, for anyone making more than $18,000. Since then, he has faced significant budget challenges, which also complicated his plans for additional property tax relief, moving his proposals toward a shift from broadened or increased sales taxes.
Speaking with the Examiner ahead of the 2026 session, 69-year-old Pillen, who turns 70 in one week, said he’s old enough to remember when neighbors took care of one another and “government was not in this stuff.”
“I’m 100% to take care of the most vulnerable,” Pillen said. “But, I mean, the hardcore reality, we the people in Nebraska, in instances, are paying grandmas to be grandmas.”

Jim Pillen as he signs four bills on improving government efficiencies. July 16, 2025. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)
Pillen said he has to ensure there’s accountability and not “waste and abuse.” He said DHHS had written $300,000 checks so Nebraskans aged 98 to 100 could stay at home, which he said “sure as hell” ought to be the exception, not the norm.
According to DHHS data, it’s unclear how many situations Pillen described have occurred. Powell said 95% of AD Waiver recipients already receive services “at or below the proposed budget limit” based on the nursing home rate. Green and Powell said 255 participants exceed the proposed cap of about $162,000, which is 175% of the nursing home rate. 
Reed and Schriver said the high costs are for the most medically needy Nebraskans. Thomas added that 255 people might not seem like a “big deal,” but “it is if you’re that person.”
‘Hope that they listen’
A couple of Olmstead Committee members asked Green why he didn’t bring the proposal to the advisory group sooner, to which Green said he disagrees that the changes affect waiver access.
“Access to the waivers is still here, and preferred,” Green said.
State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue is one of a handful of lawmakers watching the changes. He said he is and will remain “deeply engaged” and feels he is a voice, as he understands on a personal level how services and changes can impact a home. 
His oldest of three children, 37-year-old Isaac, was diagnosed at age 4 with Fragile X syndrome, an inherited genetic disorder that affects the X chromosome. 
“We have had tremendous people walk with us in the special needs arena,” he said. “I fight hard for special education and for the disabled community because I know what the needs are.”

Of possible waiver changes, he said that he has been digesting and trying to discern what it all means. He said he is eager to hear organizations and others weigh in by Jan. 5. He knows changes could impact many and that some could face possibly devastating decisions of sending their loved one to a care facility. 
His son lives with the family and attends day services at Duet in Bellevue, a community-based provider for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities.
“Any time you have a restriction or a reduction in services, there is going to be a negative impact,” Rountree said. For people who require around-the-clock care, he said the changes “will be detrimental, almost destructive.”
DHHS plans to submit the state’s waiver renewal request to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in early 2026. DHHS anticipates savings after, but Powell repeatedly declined to give current agency estimates, citing the possibility that the proposal could change.
“I really, truly hope that they listen to us family members, as caregivers, as taxpayers, that our opinion truly counts,” Wohlers said, “because we are what the State of Nebraska is about.”

(Photo by Eli Voorhies for Washington State Standard)U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. declared a public health emergency Wednesday over this month’s flooding in Washington state. 
The action from Kennedy, the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is focused on helping meet the needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. As part of that, his agency is providing access to HHS emPOWER, which gives data on the number of Medicare enrollees reliant on medical equipment dependent on electricity and other health care services that could make them especially vulnerable to a disaster.
The announcement could be a good sign for the state’s chances of getting a major disaster declaration from President Donald Trump to potentially open up tens of millions of dollars to deal with the flooding’s aftermath. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson plans to ask for such a declaration in the coming weeks.
The flooding from heavy rain and overflowing rivers forced thousands of evacuations, breached multiple levees and damaged numerous highways. It still didn’t quite reach the levels some forecasts predicted. One person has been reported dead.
Kennedy’s order follows an emergency declaration from Trump that unlocked federal resources to respond to the storm. 
John Knox, of the department’s Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, said in a statement that, “HHS stands ready to assist state and local response efforts in the state of Washington due to the potential health care impacts from severe storms.” 
Health and Human Services has also waived penalties for violating federal health privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, for hospitals. 
“With today’s declaration and waiver, HHS is helping ensure that residents in the storm’s path have continuous access to the care they need during and after this storm,” Knox said. “ASPR’s highly trained personnel are prepared to support state and local actions to save lives and protect the delivery of health care services.”
The federal Disaster Distress Helpline is also available for crisis counseling. The multilingual hotline, open 24 hours a day, can be reached via call or text at 1-800-985-5990. 
The declaration is retroactive to Dec. 9. 
A windstorm forecast to arrive in western Washington on Wednesday could exacerbate problems, as saturated soil from the recent rain could make trees and powerline poles especially susceptible to falling over. But the wind is now not expected to be as intense as predicted earlier this week.

As new legal battles challenge President Donald Trump’s National Guard troop deployments in U.S. cities, Vermonters have been amping up efforts to express their public opposition.
From handing out flyers at the Vermont National Guard headquarters in Colchester to meeting monthly to discuss local efforts, a small group of residents said they are finding growing interest and solidarity to the cause of fighting what they call fascism.
On a recent Sunday afternoon, about 25 people showed up at the Fletcher Free Library in downtown Burlington to learn about a “Do Not Turn On Us” effort to connect with military personnel about their right to disobey illegal orders.

Rachel Siegel, one of the eight or so organizers, said the event sprouted from a national community effort involving a handful of people from different states earlier this year, including one from Vermont. 
Before they knew it, they had set up a mailing list, organized emails and began to help coordinate groups across the county.
“It was just a tremendous amount of stuff for a group of people that are not an organization and have no infrastructure. We had no staff. We didn’t have a comms person,” she said.
Siegel said she also distributed flyers on Labor Day at the Air National Guard’s open house in Colchester, reminding the Guard of its duty to “protect and assist Vermont communities” during emergencies. That spurred enough public interest for the local activists to host monthly meetings to discuss different kinds of local actions, she said.
A former city councilor in Burlington and former director of the Peace and Justice Center, Siegel has participated in many civil actions over the years opposing apartheid, F-35 fighter jets and policies of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.
She and her daughter were among 13 protesters who were arrested in 2018 as they blocked traffic while opposing family separations outside the ICE facility in Williston.
The flyering events outside the National Guard went very well this year, she said, with passing cars and members of the Guard willing to take flyers.
Joseph Brooks, a spokesman for the Vermont National Guard, said in an email that the residents handing out flyers exercised their First Amendment right “in an organized and respectful way.”
“We have had no incidents or altercations with anyone, and as result it fosters a productive dialogue. The fact that we can have such a dialogue is a testament to the strong relationship we have with the community and that our fellow Vermonters reflect back to us,” Brooks wrote.
Colchester resident Sherri Wormser said she heard about the event and joined because she thinks Vermonters need to present an organized front to prevent illegal military deployments in America or abroad.
“It’s still very important for all of us to speak up against the injustices that are occurring here and in bigger cities as well. But I’m also concerned that if it’s not stopped, that smaller and smaller towns are going to have the presence of the National Guard,” she said.
She said they plan to meet over the weekend “for ongoing resistance and flyering.”
Residents were dismayed last week when the Vermont Air National Guard was deployed to the Caribbean, reportedly in support of Trump’s military escalation against Venezuela. 
Siegel said she found the deployment “abhorrent” and was concerned about young adults heading into a potentially violent situation during the holiday season.
“I hope that they know their legal rights. We will continue to do what we can to connect with families and friends so that they can share our message to follow their oath and not obey illegal orders,” she said.
Wormser said it is “horrifying” for young troops to have to risk their lives abroad for a mission not authorized by Congress.
“We cannot forget the human aspect of all this. Our neighbors may be asked to kill somebody’s neighbors 2,000 miles away,” she said.
While he wasn’t one of the original organizers, Gordon Clark of Burlington said he is glad to be part of the local activism effort.
“We’re currently a small group of Vermont citizens who are shocked and appalled by what is going on in our country these days on many different fronts, but on one in particular: the use of our National Guard … being sent to other American cities and unconstitutional orders and whatnot. So we started an effort,” he said.
He learned of the group by word of mouth and said he hopes more people learn about the opposition effort and join them. 
“I would ask [Gov. Phil] Scott what he is doing about the deployment of the Vermont Air Guard to an apparent forward area of an unsanctioned war in the Caribbean,” he said.
The activists’ latest effort — a petition — went live on Dec. 1. It calls on Scott to oppose the deployment of the Vermont National Guard to American cities, against American citizens, and in unauthorized military actions abroad. It has 123 signatures as of Wednesday with several comments from Vermont residents who have signed it.
The organizers plan to send the petition to Scott when they have a substantial number of names, said Clark, who has also collected more than 60 signatures on a paper petition he is circulating.
Siegel said the local group has not yet come up with a name, but keeping people engaged in small actions feels motivating “because we know that fascism is, in part, fueled by people giving up hope.”
“If we, the people, can do a small thing. If they can create a petition. If they can sign a petition. If they can show up at an open house and hand out flyers. If they can make a flyer,” she said. “Any of these small things that keep people engaged and active will help people continue to do more things like that and help us resist and stop all authoritarianism.”

Nguyen told Commerce employees on Tuesday that he is leaving but didn’t disclose his new job. He said he didn’t anticipate taking off “until sometime in January.”
“Although I can’t tell you where I’m going just yet, I will be working in Seattle, closer to home,” he wrote in an agencywide email. “Sometimes opportunity knocks, even when you haven’t invited anyone to your door. Recently I was offered an opportunity outside of Commerce that I have accepted because it was the right thing to do for my family.”
The chamber, an independent business organization with 2,600 members, plans an announcement Monday concerning its chief executive officer position. A spokesperson declined further comment.
Rumors of Nguyen’s selection had begun circulating online and among business lobbyists in recent days. Nguyen did not return multiple phone calls for comment.
The job has been open since Rachel Smith left as the organization’s president and CEO to become president of the Washington Roundtable.
Nguyen, a White Center Democrat, was in his second term in the state Senate representing the 34th Legislative District when Gov. Bob Ferguson named him to the high-ranking post. He is the first member of Ferguson’s executive cabinet to quit, though others have retired. 
Nguyen led an agency with a $7.9 billion budget and that administers more than 100 programs in the areas of housing, energy, community and economic development, local government and business services. One of its largest portfolios is promoting development of affordable housing, a top priority of Ferguson’s.
In his email to employees, Nguyen wrote he was “honored” that Ferguson “put his faith in me nearly a year ago and I thank him for that trust.” He said he did not know if Ferguson would install an interim leader or hire a new director right away.
In a statement, Ferguson praised the outgoing director and didn’t say how he plans to replace him.
“I spoke with Joe, and it’s clear he received an offer he couldn’t refuse,” Ferguson said. “I deeply appreciate Joe’s work this past year.

When I did finally invite them into my life at age 43, I fell deeply—and some friends might add, madly—in love with our winged and feathered neighbors, especially the little ones that swarm backyard feeders throughout Alaska’s long and harsh winters.
At the heart of my late-in-life love affair with birds are black-capped chickadees, which first gained my attention more than sixty years ago, when I lived along the edge of rural Connecticut. Like other common New England birds, they quickly faded into the background of my world, for as a boy I was drawn to more exotic creatures: snakes and salamanders, frogs and turtles and trout.
My general disinterest in birds lasted more than four decades, until I settled in the foothills along Anchorage’s eastern edge.
On what’s known to locals as the Hillside, all manner of things began to grab my attention in new ways: the Chinook winds that rush and sometimes roar through the Chugach Mountains and down into the Anchorage Bowl; the winter commutes of ravens, which daily fly between their nighttime roosts in the mountains and the scavenging-rich environs of downtown and mid-town Anchorage; the spruce bark beetle and its infestation of local forests in the 1990s. But nothing grabbed me as deeply as the chickadees. They transformed my world, showed me some of what I’d been missing. In a way, they became my teachers.
“Something strange has happened,” reads one of my earliest Hillside journal entries, in December of 1993. “Something strange and magical and delightful. I’ve fallen under the spell of tiny forest creatures that rarely gained my attention in past years.”
My enchantment began on a Saturday morning, shortly before the winter solstice. Lolling in bed, I happened to glance outside. In the wooded backyard, several black-capped chickadees fluttered around a backyard spruce.
“Wonderful,” I thought. “Here’s a chance to meet some of my new neighbors.”
Inspired by their presence, and on something of a whim, I put an old, slightly bent baking pan on the back deck railing and piled on some sunflower seeds. Nothing happened that first day. But on Sunday, while seated at the dining room table, I watched a small feathered being land on the pan. It had a black-capped head and bib, white cheeks, a whitish beige belly and gray-streaked wings.
The chickadee grabbed a seed and zoomed off to a nearby tree. Then, in flashed another. And a third. For each, the routine was similar: dart in, look around, peck at the tray, grab a seed, look around some more and dart back out. Nervous little creatures, full of bright energy, they soon had me laughing at their antics. By the time they moved on, I sensed an all-too-rare upwelling of fascination and delight.
Within days, a whole new world opened up as woodland neighbors I’d never known, or even imagined, joined the black caps at my feeders: red-breasted nuthatches, common redpolls, pine grosbeaks, and pine siskins. What’s remarkable is that all of those species were—and are—common residents of the Anchorage area. Yet in prior days and years, I had no idea.
My newfound interest in birds grew quickly, surprising even me. What started as mere curiosity quickly bloomed into a consuming passion. I roamed bookstores in search of birding guidebooks, spontaneously exchanged bird descriptions with a stranger and purchased 50-pound bags of sunflower seeds.
All of this seemed very strange to a middle-aged guy who’d never been intrigued by birds — except for charismatic raptors — and had previously judged bird watchers to be rather odd sorts. I didn’t know what it meant, except that a door had opened. And I passed through.
My interest soon expanded outward from my feeders to the local landscape’s forests, coastal flats and tundra, and then even farther beyond, to Alaska’s far reaches. Suddenly, songbirds seemed to be everywhere. Where had they been hiding all those years? Of course they hadn’t been hiding at all. I simply hadn’t cared enough to notice them.
Helped along by local experts, I’ve gradually learned to recognize the songs, calls, and markings of dozens of species. But my favorites remain the songbirds that stay here year-round, adding bright voices and lively energy to our largely dormant winter landscape.
And among those birds, black caps have a special place at the top of my affections, partly for this reason: They’ve reminded me how my world can expand when I make the effort to pay attention. What else awaits me in our world, I wonder, that I haven’t yet discovered or noticed?

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-24 20:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT teen released by ICE marks first success story of new pro bono attorney coalition,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/24/ct-pro-bono-attorney-immigratio-ice/,The American Immigrant Legal Clinic offers services pro bono to immigrants who cannot afford legal representation.,"Advocates, attorneys, politicians and members of Meriden’s community gathered on Wednesday to celebrate the return of Kevin, a 16-year-old immigrant who had been detained in a federal detention facility for six months in Texas before his recent release. 
An attorney who worked on Kevin’s case said he saw the case as the first success in a much larger effort to provide legal representation to immigrants who are at risk of deportation by the federal government. 
Glenn Formica, a Connecticut-based immigration attorney, with support from the organization Connecticut Students for a Dream, has been bringing together lawyers and legal service organizations with different specialties to offer their services pro bono to immigrants who cannot afford to hire legal representation. They call the project The American Immigrant Legal Clinic, or TAILC. 
Formica said that during the first Trump administration, he’d been representing “crazy numbers” of immigration cases. In 2020, he said, he was representing 140 pro bono cases in his private practice.
“This time around, I needed something different,” he said. 
In the past, he’d done some work with community groups, trying to teach people about “red folders” and “blue folders” — methods for organizing the documents they would need if they were detained by ICE, Formica said. Red folders contain documents regarding employment and familial ties that can help persuade a court that the person is not a flight risk and should not be held on bond. Blue folders contain documents that make a legal case for the person to remain in the U.S. 
But this time, Formica wanted to go further. 
“I want the community to stop being lambs and I want them to be wolves, and I want them to learn what they need to learn to go hire lawyers and manage lawyers,” he said. 
Formica said the organization, which now includes 20 lawyers, was planning to open a clinic in New Haven in January, where people could bring the documents and have their cases transferred to panel attorneys and legal service organizations who could help.
Frances Bourliot, a partner with the legal firm Gonzalez Olivieri in Texas, who also assisted with Kevin’s case, said the new American Immigrant Legal Clinic was meant to fill a void that existed in the immigration system.
“Too many people in our community never get a real chance to be heard — not because of any judgment on the merits of their case, really, just because they don’t have access to legal support where it matters the most,” said Bourliot. 
Bourliot said the clinic also works with communities to teach them about what documents they might need and how to navigate the court system. 
“Organization in the beginning can be the difference between chaos and clarity,” she said. 
Maegan Faitsch, an attorney with Connecticut Legal Services, said she got connected to Kevin’s case after receiving a call from the pastor of St. Rose of Lima Church in Meriden, a church with a large immigrant congregation. 
Kevin, whose last name has been withheld out of concern for his safety, and his father were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a routine immigration check-in in Hartford in June, shortly before Kevin was set to graduate from Maloney High School.
The two were transferred to Texas. Kevin’s father was deported. Kevin was transferred to a detention facility for children run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, where he remained for six months.
Faitsch said ICE attempted to deport Kevin twice, once in the middle of the night. According to Faitsch, ICE had granted Kevin a single phone call before his departure, which he used to call her. She said she was able to stop Kevin’s removal from the U.S. 
ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Kevin’s lawyers connected with Bourliot in Texas and with Rep. Matt Blumenthal, D-Stamford, who works with the firm Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder. Blumenthal filed a petition in U.S. federal district court for Kevin’s release. The federal government decided to release him after that, they said.  
“I think sometimes putting the pressure on the government and letting them know that there are people out there who care about these kids, who are looking at what’s happening and who are there ready to fight for them and to protect their rights — It seems to be working for now,” said Bourliot. 
Kevin told reporters in Spanish that conditions in the detention facility weren’t bad, but that they had little communication with family members. He said he spent his days reading or looking for things to do. He said that the other young people in the facility were often under stress, having taken risks to leave their countries of origin, and having no knowledge of what had happened to the family members with whom they had arrived in the U.S. Some of them, he said, had been in the facility for a long time, and the experience had taken a toll on their mental health. 
“It’s very hard to go through this process, and I’ve seen a lot of people that have had a hard time because of it,” he told the crowd gathered on Wednesday. “It’s not easy and we’re all human and we shouldn’t be treated like this.” 
Kevin said he still misses his father, with whom he was close. Andrea Sanchez, an executive consultant for CT Students for a Dream, said the organization planned to help Kevin access college when he is ready. 
His immigration case is still ongoing, and Formica said the attorneys planned to request Special Immigrant Juvenile Status for Kevin, which, if granted, would give him the ability to remain in the U.S.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0738-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 15:57:22.747249

The most current version was updated on Dec. 19, 2025 (Courtesy Montana DPHHS). RiverStone Health, the public health department of state’s largest county, Yellowstone, has confirmed the first death of influenza in the state this season, as Montana statistics show that influenza cases are happening more rapidly than last year at this time.
The state’s most current published data goes through Dec. 19 and shows 1,238 cases so far.
RiverStone reported that an unvaccinated man in his 80s died two weeks ago. That was the state’s first confirmed flu death this winter.
But Yellowstone County is reporting a large uptick in influenza cases.
So far, there have been 584 reported cases and 25 hospitalizations. Both of those numbers mean that about half of the cases in state have been confined to Yellowstone County. Statewide, there have been 49 hospitalizations, according to the most current statistics.
A five-year average of flu in Montana shows that flu tends to be the most active during the last two weeks of the calendar year, but the 2024-2025 spike in Montana hit later, not peaking until March when the number of hospitalizations reached to nearly 120.
The trend for flu this year more closely resembles severe recent flu seasons, for example, 2023-2024, which saw 19,909 cases reported statewide. That included 907 hospitalizations and 44 deaths. Last year’s flu season was also notable: Fewer cases were reported, but the state reported a five-year high of 68 deaths due to the virus.
So far, 69% of the hospitalizations have been from people older than age 65, and more than 90% of those needing to be admitted were age 50 or older.
“Influenza may feel familiar, but it can be a severe and even life-threatening illness,” said Dr. Megan Littlefield, RiverStone chief medical officer. “It is important that everyone takes precautions to prevent spreading illness, especially to protect our vulnerable populations.”
 



 

	 More information about influenza 			



The flu spreads through coughing and sneezing with symptoms that can include high fever, chills, headaches, exhaustion, sore throat, cough and body aches.  It may take about one to four days after being exposed to the virus for symptoms to develop. Additionally, you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else one day before symptoms develop and up to five to seven days after becoming sick.
Everyday precautions can help stop the spread of influenza. Those measures include:

Getting vaccinated.
Wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
Washing your hands often with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Avoiding close contact with sick people.
Staying home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or necessities.

If infected with influenza, prescription antiviral medication such as Tamiflu can decrease symptoms and help speed recovery. These medications are most effective if given within the first two days of symptoms and are recommended for those most at risk for serious complications: children less than 2, adults older than 65, and those with underlying lung disease, heart disease or other chronic medical conditions.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A unanimous five-judge panel of the Montana Supreme Court has rejected a request by youth plaintiffs who successfully argued that the state has a constitutional obligation to protect the climate to assume control over legal challenges to several of the laws passed by the 2025 Legislature.
The order, issued Tuesday, said that the Held v. Montana litigants had not been able to show that the Treasure State’s highest court needed to assume jurisdiction, nor had they established why a district court setting couldn’t address their concerns.
The Held group of plaintiffs successfully led a first-of-its-kind lawsuit that said that the Montana Constitutional guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment” obligated the state to adopt more protections for the climate and human health. That trial took place in a Lewis and Clark County District courtroom and the decision was later affirmed by the Montana Supreme Court.
Since then, the Legislature has modified some of the state’s environmental laws. However,  the Republican-led state House and Senate said that while the state must disclose “greenhouse gas” emissions for many projects, that data cannot be used to halt progress in mining or natural resources, an action the Held plaintiffs disagree with.
Other cases, including on the federal level, have had much less success because the environmental protection has so far been derived from the state’s Constitution, not necessarily federal law.
The Held litigants are more than a dozen people, including minors, who argued that the Montana Supreme Court should take up the matter because of the urgency of environmental degradation and because the lawsuit had implications statewide. They petitioned for a “writ of supervisory control,” which is an extraordinary measure used sparingly by the Supreme Court to assume control of cases that would normally be heard in district court.
The five-member panel said that the Held plaintiffs did not establish that the issues were so urgent that they could not be addressed by a district court. In fact, the court cited several examples of timely matters heard by lower level courts, and cases where the Supreme Court had declined to take cases.
“(The Held litigants) brought their petition seven months after the law took effect,” the Supreme Court opinion said.
They had used a finding from the original Held case, which said that every ton of greenhouse gases exacerbates their injuries as the basis of their appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the court rejected that argument.
“Although petitioners argue that the development of the factual record is unnecessary given the factual record in Held, they do not address why the district court would not be equipped to consider the legal issues in a timely fashion and permit them to present an appeal in the ordinary course,” the opinion said. “In fact, district courts entertain constitutional challenges routinely and have the tools to address allegations of irreparable harm or similar questions of urgency.”

The Department will continue to fully comply with federal law and President (Donald) Trump’s direction to release the files.”A bipartisan group of U.S. House lawmakers used a discharge petition to force a floor vote in that chamber on legislation that required the Department of Justice to release all documents it had related to the Epstein investigation. The Senate approved the bill through the fast-track unanimous consent process. Trump signed the legislation and has repeatedly sought to distance himself from Epstein.The Justice Department released the first batch of documents Friday and released 30,000 more pages Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a social media post shortly after the DOJ announcement that he was disappointed in the process. “A Christmas Eve news dump of ‘a million more files’ only proves what we already know: Trump is engaged in a massive coverup,” Schumer wrote. “The question Americans deserve answered is simple: WHAT are they hiding—and WHY?

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle) Federal officials have ordered a temporary halt to the planned shutdowns of two coal-burning Indiana power plants amid President Donald Trump’s attempts to boost the coal mining industry.
The U.S. Department of Energy orders issued Tuesday require Northern Indiana Public Service Co. and CenterPoint Energy to keep those generating plants operating despite their intentions of closing them this month.
The 90-day orders say the two coal-burning units set for closure at NIPSCO’s Schahfer Generating Station near Wheatfield and one at CenterPoint’s Culley Generating Station along the Ohio River near Newburgh must remain “available to operate” until at least March 23.
The orders come as Trump has pushed policies to promote the coal industry while deriding the shift toward solar and wind energy as sources of electricity.
The Energy Department said the Indiana plants orders were needed because the “reliable supply of power from these coal plants is essential for keeping the region’s electric grid stable.” Both orders cited the growing power demands of data centers among the reasons for keeping the plants in operation.
“Keeping these coal plants online has the potential to save lives and is just common sense,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. “Americans deserve reliable power regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining during extreme winter conditions.”
The federal agency has issued similar orders for power plants in other states in recent months, including a large coal-burning station in Michigan.
Companies’ response
Indiana’s major utilities have over many years been shifting away from coal-powered plants toward using natural gas and renewable sources for electricity generation.
It was not immediately clear Wednesday how NIPSCO and Centerpoint would abide with the orders to keep the coal-burning plants in operations.

NIPSCO, which has more than 450,000 electric customers across northern Indiana, said it would comply with the order and was “reviewing the overall impact to our customers and company.”
“We recognize the importance of both reliability and cost management for our customers, and we will continue to engage with federal, state and local stakeholders as we adapt to evolving regulatory requirements,” Vince Parisi, NIPSCO’s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.
CenterPoint, which serves about 150,000 customers in the Evansville area, announced plans in 2023 to convert its last coal-burning unit at the Culley Generation Station to natural gas by 2027.
The company said its plans would reduce costs while preserving the Culley station’s generating capacity and adding solar and wind power sources in the coming years.
CenterPoint said Wednesday it would “continue to work collaboratively with our federal, state and local partners and remain focused on prioritizing affordability and energy security.”
“Working together, we will help contribute to regional electric reliability efforts to focus on what is most important — safe and reliable service for our customers and fellow Hoosiers during the upcoming winter months,” the company said in a statement.
The NIPSCO units set for closure generate about 850 megawatts of electricity and date to the 1980s, according to the federal orders. The CenterPoint unit generates about 100 megawatts and began operations in 1966.
Coal foes blast orders
Environmental groups and consumer advocates denounced the Energy Department orders, arguing they would force “households to pay more for coal’s deadly air and toxic water pollution.”
“The federal government’s order to force extremely expensive and unreliable coal units to stay open will result in higher bills for Hoosiers who are already reeling from record-high rate increases in 2025,” said Ben Inskeep, program director for the Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana. “We can’t afford this costly and unfounded federal overreach.”
An analysis by the Citizens Action Coalition released in July of Indiana’s five investor-owned electric utilities found that residential bills spiked by 17.5% in one year, or $28 a month on average statewide.
Ashley Williams, executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana, called NIPSCO’s Schahfer plant “one of the most notorious polluters in the country.”
“On-site coal ash contamination of groundwater, along with a proposed massive gas plant and AI data center, compounds an extremely dire situation and creates an unconscionable environmental burden,” Williams said. “The Trump administration is trying to steal away our futures by keeping us tethered to the dirty coal energy of the past.”

This story is co-published by the Wrangell Sentinel and Northern Journal.
An Indigenous community is locked in a debate about the pros and cons of a major new mine on their traditional lands — and a big cash payment promised by the developer.
There is strong support, and fierce opposition. A lot of money to be made, and a wild river to protect. The community faces a pivotal choice.
Though this story sounds like it could be unfolding in rural Alaska, a version of it has actually been playing out just across the border with Canada, in northwest British Columbia. Still, it has implications for the Alaskans who live downstream from the proposed mine site.
In a referendum after weeks of heated debate, members of the Tahltan Nation earlier this month voted overwhelmingly to approve a deal with a Canadian mining company that hopes to revive a huge gold and silver mine, called Eskay Creek, which stopped producing in 2008. The project is located above the Unuk River, which flows into Alaska near Ketchikan.
The Tahltans’ backing is a major step forward for the project, and it comes as the Canada and B.C. governments intensify efforts to build more mines in the name of national security and economic growth. Several of the projects are near the border with Alaska, where state and federal elected officials are separately pushing mines that could help wean the U.S. off a foreign supply of minerals used in energy, electronics and weapons.
Just one day after the Tahltan vote, Canada’s federal government announced that it had approved a merger between two multinational mining firms with a condition that calls for advancing two other proposed mines in Tahltan territory. Both projects sit above tributaries of the Stikine River, a major, salmon-bearing waterway that straddles Canada and the U.S. and empties into the ocean near the small Southeast Alaska town of Wrangell.
Louie Wagner Jr., a Tsimshian and Tlingit resident of Metlakatla, a Native community at the southern tip of Alaska’s panhandle, said he’s concerned about the health of the Unuk River and its future with mines in its watershed.
Wagner and his family have fished and hunted moose along the Unuk for generations.
“That little river cannot handle it,” Wagner said in a recent phone interview. The Unuk is notable, he added, for its abundance of eulachon, a small, oily fish also known as hooligan that’s a staple for Indigenous communities in Southeast Alaska.
Though rarely discussed in Alaska circles, the Tahltan Nation’s approach to mining has major implications for the industry’s future in the transboundary region. A top U.S. Department of Interior official visited the region last year to learn more about models for how Indigenous nations can partner with mining companies.
There are more than a dozen early-stage mining projects in Tahltan territory, many above rivers that flow into Alaska. And the Eskay Creek vote could serve as a preview of future deals between the Tahltan government and the for-profit mining companies promoting development.
For months, members of the First Nation debated whether to approve a deal, known as an impact benefit agreement, that Tahltan elected leaders had negotiated with Vancouver-based Skeena Resources, the company pushing Eskay Creek.

The specifics of the agreement have not been made public. But Tahltan officials have said it guarantees benefits worth more than $1 billion over the life of the mine, mostly in cash but also in contracts and wages.
The deal also calls for an upfront payment from Skeena, intended to be distributed to individual Tahltan members — to the tune of $7,250 each, according to Tahltan officials. And the agreement reportedly gives the First Nation government some environmental oversight over the mine.
The nation backed the deal with support from more than 77% of the roughly 1,750 Tahltans who voted, according to the Tahltan Central Government. Payments are expected to go out to members in 2026.
“Tahltan Central Government is not standing on the sidelines,” Tahltan president Kerry Carlick said in a statement after the vote.  “We are embedding ourselves directly into the governance of environmental protection.”
Tahltan leaders have long worked to navigate political tensions between an expanding mining industry and efforts to protect traditional lands and wildlife.
The Tahltan government has entered into a number of agreements with mining companies. But it also has opposed efforts to mine coal and drill for natural gas near the headwaters of major rivers in the region.
And some Tahltan members have been outspoken critics of the Eskay Creek project and the company promoting it.
In the leadup to the recent vote, arguments erupted on social media, and relationships among community members grew strained, some Eskay Creek opponents said in interviews.
“This is causing internal conflicts,” said Tamara Quock, a Tahltan member who lives in northern B.C. some 350 miles east of the mine site.
Quock said she thinks the promise of the direct payments “enticed” some people to vote in favor of the agreement. Debate over the project, she added, grew more intense after that condition was added to the deal.
Quock said she feels Skeena is “using the Tahltan people” to generate its own profits.
She and other critics have voiced concerns about a perceived lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest within the First Nation’s government. They also say they are worried about possible environmental impacts from the project, which would involve digging two open pits and storing millions of tons of mining waste above the Unuk River.
Skeena didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Alaska Native leaders, fishermen and environmental advocates who live downstream, in Southeast Alaska, for years have expressed concerns about Eskay Creek and other proposed mines in the region, saying they don’t trust Canadian regulators to safeguard Alaskan interests.
“You can’t cut these watersheds in half and expect to adequately protect them,” said Guy Archibald, executive director of the tribally led Southeast Alaska Indigenous Transboundary Commission. “Right now they’re cutting the baby in half and ignoring the effects on the Alaska side of the border.”
The commission last month filed a legal challenge in B.C. court, asserting that regulators had failed to consult Alaska tribes on several proposed mines in the region, including Eskay Creek.
Meanwhile, after a major spill last year at a Canadian gold mine in the Yukon River watershed, Alaska’s congressional delegation called for more oversight of Canadian mines near transboundary rivers like the Unuk and Stikine. The statement from the delegation — which has strongly supported mine development in Alaska — called for “binding protections, financial assurances, and strong transboundary governance.”
“As British Columbia seeks to advance numerous mines just upstream from Alaska, we are still asking them to fully remediate legacy sites and firmly commit to binding protections for Alaska interests,” Joe Plesha, a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, said in a recent statement. “Senator Murkowski is actively considering new ways to make our B.C. neighbors take Alaskans’ concerns seriously.”

Ottawa and B.C.’s provincial government, meanwhile, are funding new infrastructure projects and prioritizing permitting for energy and resource development projects, including Eskay Creek and the expansion of a huge copper and gold mine in the Stikine watershed, called Red Chris.
Canadian officials say existing regulations are geared to minimize impacts in the shared watersheds. Major projects undergo thorough environmental assessments before they’re approved, a spokesperson with the B.C. agency that leads those reviews, the Environmental Assessment Office, said in an email.
“Making sure large-scale projects are properly assessed is critical to making sure development is sustainable — to ensure good jobs and economic growth while also protecting the environment and wildlife, and keeping communities healthy and safe,” said the spokesperson, Sarah Plank.
Tahltan officials declined an interview request and did not respond to questions about Alaskans’ concerns or the First Nation’s agreement with Skeena.
Supporters of Eskay Creek say it could be transformational for the Tahltan Nation. Among proponents of the deal is Chad Norman Day, a former Tahltan president who has worked in the mining industry and now runs a consulting firm that does mining-related business.
“The benefits which flow to the Tahltan Nation from here will empower the people and territory unlike anything we have ever seen,” Day said in a statement after the vote.
Many Tahltan people work in mining, and the First Nation already generates revenue from Red Chris and another large operating mine, Brucejack, which started producing gold in 2017.
In 2019, Tahltan citizens voted in favor of an agreement with a different mining company pushing another, much bigger proposed mine partially in the Unuk watershed, called KSM. The outcome of that vote was nearly identical to the recent Eskay one, with about the same percentage in favor.
The first nation also, in the past five years, has entered into two joint decisionmaking agreements with the B.C. government for regulatory reviews of mining projects, including Eskay Creek.
Before it can start producing, Eskay Creek needs an environmental approval from the provincial government. A decision is expected early next year.

Farmers, researchers, the state and the federal government are trying to fight the infestation, but it’s a never-ending battle for landowners.","John Parker Campbell describes the wild pigs on his family farm as “a constant headache.” 
Hogs will eat up corn and peanuts that have just been planted, damaging acres of crops in a night. Some years the hog damage is worse than others but it has been a problem since his father started farming in Copiah County in the 1990’s.
In Mississippi, wild hogs create around $60 million to $80 million in damage every year, including eating crops and damaging property. Farmers, researchers, the state and the federal government are trying to fight the infestation, but it’s a never-ending battle for landowners. 
“Farmers have enough stress as it is. They don’t need this modern-day locust,” said Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson
Campbell and his father use traps and have an electric fence around their property to keep the hogs out. The fence has been effective, although the feral pigs have broken through parts of it before. However, it was expensive to initially put up and costs thousands of dollars each year to maintain. 
“You have to know that they’re out there,” said Campbell. “We keep an eye on our fields but you can get busy and then go a couple days without looking and they can just do a tremendous amount of damage.” 
The wild hog population has grown over the past 40 years, not just in Mississippi, but across the United States. In the 1980’s they lived in 17 states, now they can be found in 35. Previously, it was thought they cost the U.S. $2 billion a year but new research indicates that number is actually over $3 billion. 
Wild pigs are not native to the United States. The first population was escaped livestock brought to the Americas by European settlers. Later, Eurasian boars were imported for hunting and joined the wild hog population. With no natural predators and plenty of land, water and food, their numbers have grown.

While some owners successfully deterred pigs by using electric fences, the only way to manage the larger population is by killing the hogs.
Mississippi was the first state to launch a statewide wild hog-control program in 2020. The program provides education and traps to landowners.
The program operates with a budget of $183,000 a year which mainly goes to staff salaries and maintenance of smart traps and cameras. The program has four application cycles with each cycle receiving between 35 and 40 applications.
There are a number of ways to reduce the pig population, including using traps, aerial gunning and poison. While wild hogs are considered nuisance animals and can be hunted year round, hunting is relatively ineffective at controlling the larger population. 
Aerial gunning in Mississippi is only used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It also has limited use as the pigs can easily run into the trees for cover, whereas in places like Texas, there is more open and flat land. While there is ongoing research into the use of poisons, including contraceptives, it’s challenging to make sure that other animals don’t eat them.
Trapping is one of the most common methods and is preferred as it requires less time and effort than other methods. A new study from Mississippi State University looked at the economic benefits of trapping.
The average landowner in the study had an estimated $20,000 in hog damages per year. It showed that reducing a local pig population can lead to less damage and $300-$4,000 in savings per pig the next year for land owners. But combatting the wild hog problem is an expensive and constant battle. 
The study involved intense, dedicated hog removal through Delta Wildlife, a conservation nonprofit. 
Jody Acosta, Delta Wildlife’s nuisance-and invasive-species program manager, and his team set up and monitor traps around the Delta. While the team is experienced and knowledgeable, Acosta is clear that the job is not about the glory of hunting but about pest management.

Some of the trap doors will only close when a Delta Wildlife team member remotely pushes a button. So they work around the clock, often late at night, checking the live video feed of the traps. Once they successfully trap a group of pigs, a Delta Wildlife worker quickly makes their way to the trap so they can dispose of the pigs and reset the trap.
The study estimates that it would cost a land owner about $200 per pig if they outsourced every part of trapping. Strickland, one of the study’s authors, acknowledges that “it’s absolutely a big number” but says that the average landowner would likely pay less. Despite the initial sticker shock, Strickland said the study shows that pig removal results in a “positive return on investment” and that government programs are economically viable. 
Long term, Strickland thinks it’s possible to reduce the wild pig population through a concerted effort and investment. He urges farmers and landowners to take wild pigs seriously even if there’s only a few on their property at the moment.
“The problem will only get worse and worse,” said Strickland.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/09131825/Wild-Hog.jpg,,,2025-12-24 15:12:07.269728

(Photo via State Library and Archives of Florida Postcard Collection)University of Central Florida researchers using genetic information say that, with intervention, depleted flamingo populations in Florida can recover. 
A study led by biology graduate student Jessica Folsom used genomic data in determining the flamingo population and its genetics in Florida and proposes strategies to restore the population. 
Researchers found that flamingos in Florida and around the Caribbean display few genetic differences, including those held in captivity. 
Flamingos in Florida often fly in for a few months, but building a long-term breeding population would pose a challenge. 
“For more than a century, there were almost no conservation measures for flamingos in the U.S.,” said Steven Whitfield, a co-author of the study and a director at the Audubon Nature Institute. “That’s partly because flamingos were long considered a non-native species to Florida. With our work, we want to show they have always belonged here and there’s a scientific basis to support their recovery.”
According to the research, the long-term outlook for flamingos is “good,” but the existing population is not sufficient for recovery. “Moreover, habitat destruction, pollution and warming temperatures add to the challenges they face.”
“Natural recovery of the flamingo is unlikely in Florida without intervention,” Whitfield said in a news release. “But our study shifts that conversation. We can now confidently say ex-situ [managed in zoos or aquariums] flamingos are genetically compatible with wild populations, which opens possibilities for a future release program, even though logistical hurdles remain.”
Reintroduction, although, must be guided by policy, the researchers said. 
Lawmakers, for at least five years, have proposed replacing the mockingbird with the flamingo as the state bird.
In advance of this coming session, SB 150, filed by Sen. Gayle Harrell, a Republican from Stuart, passed the Environment and Natural Resources committee unanimously last month and has two more committees dates.
HB 11, an identical bill filed in the House by Republican Reps. Jim Mooney from Islamorada and Chip LeMarca from Lighthouse Point, passed the Natural Resources & Disasters subcommittee last month and has two more committees to pass.
Those bills would designate the scrub-jay as the state songbird, too.
“The flamingo is iconic to Florida. When I was growing up it was flamingos and palm trees. … But the awareness really comes with the conservation. The flamingo is now thriving in Florida,” Mooney said during a December House committee meeting.

Extirpation
Hunting and habitat loss during the 1800s resulted in extirpation of Florida’s flamingos by the early 1900s. Since then, the bird has shown “only faint signs of a true comeback,” according to the research. 
“Despite high vagility and the presence of nearby flocks in the Caribbean, the Florida population has yet to show substantial recovery,” the report says. 
“The ex-situ [managed] population had higher diversity compared to wild birds and were not significantly differentiated from the wild population, making these flocks possible sources for reintroduction projects,” the study says.
Flamingo representation is common in Florida, being displayed, for example, on state lottery branding and a ginormous piece of art in the Tampa airport.
“As a native Floridian who grew up in Tallahassee, Florida, I was fascinated and a little surprised to see the flamingo as a prominent state icon, yet I had never seen one in the wild,” said Folsom, the researcher who led the study. 
Hoffman said that zoo flocks, including Zoo Miami’s, were founded after a Hialeah horse racetrack owner released about 20 flamingos in the wild in the 1920s to boost his business.

Flamingos are protected by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service List of Birds Protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 2023. That law makes it illegal to hunt, kill, sell, export, or transport any migratory bird without a permit from the federal government.
The study was published in the American Ornithological Society’s Ornithological Applications journal. 
According to a 2024 Audubon Florida report, “Our iconic American Flamingos blown in from Hurricane Idalia in 2023 continue to remain in Everglades National Park thanks to available forage and quality habitat — a bright pink indicator of the success of our Everglades conservation efforts.”
An Audubon survey found 101 wild American Flamingos in Florida in February 2024, nearly half in Florida Bay.
“Flamingos were historically numerous in Florida until the 19th century plume trade — when an ounce of feathers was worth more than gold — decimated wading birds in South Florida,” the Audubon report states.
“Even after legislation and Audubon wardens protected these birds, extensive draining and ditching of the Everglades destroyed their habitat. Now that restoration momentum is flowing in the River of Grass, we are hopeful that protected wetlands and improved water flow will create enough habitat resources for the Hurricane Idalia flamingos to survive and thrive here.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC15095-1024x645.jpg,,,2025-12-24 14:58:24.551980

Laura Kelly, a Democrat entering her last year in office, is concentrating on shaping a new state budget, water policy and early-childhood development.","Gov. Laura Kelly, a term-limited Democrat, said her priorities in the 2026 legislative session will be development of a reasonable state budget, launching the new Office of Early Childhood and locking down a statewide strategic plan for use of water resources. In this Dec. 16, 2025, image, Kelly speaks during an interview with Kansas Reflector. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly approached the final year of her second term with a familiar plea that the Kansas Legislature pass a reasonable budget and a bleak realization the state wouldn’t be able to compensate for federal reductions in spending on health care and food programs.
The bell tolls 2 p.m. Jan. 12 on the annual legislative session in Kansas with the term-limited Democratic governor and a Republican supermajority in the House and Senate. As Kelly moved closer to departing the office, Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, would continue his campaign for governor and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, would be occupied with a campaign for state insurance commissioner.
Kelly, scheduled to deliver the State of the State address on Jan. 13, said developing a budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 would be her primary quest.
“No. 1 is always the budget,” she said in an interview with Kansas Reflector. “That the Legislature pass a balanced, reasonable, sane budget that funds the important responsibilities of state government.”
Kelly said it wasn’t possible for the state to fill in for slashed federal appropriations to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
“We are not really taking that approach. That’s the way we’ve been since these cuts started coming down,” the governor said. “One, we don’t really have the money. Where do you stop on those kinds of things? Can we backfill the cuts to Medicaid that are coming? Absolutely not. SNAP? We cannot.”
The U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee estimated the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed by President Donald Trump would eventually strip Medicaid coverage from 90,000 Kansans, place rural hospitals across Kansas at greater risk and prompt Affordable Care Act premium increases. Changes to the ACA compel higher personal insurance premiums after Dec. 31, but Medicaid cuts would be staggered during 2026, 2027 and 2028.
Overall, Kelly said, Kansas could lose least $150 million through federal reductions to health care programs.
The federal government has funded about two-thirds of the annual cost of Medicaid in Kansas, and covered all but administrative expenditures for emergency food aid under SNAP.
“Kansas is not alone,” Kelly said. “These programs like SNAP and Medicaid were really built on the premise of a partnership.”
Kelly said another objective was to sustain the push for economic development. The state’s commitment to financially support relocation of the Kansas City Chiefs to a stadium in Wyandotte County and a headquarters in Johnson County was a “game-changer for our state,” she said.
The governor said the process of recruiting the NFL franchise was an example of what Republicans and Democrats at the local and state levels could accomplish through collaboration. Masterson and Hawkins, as well as Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, D-Lenexa, and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Kelly and Lt. Gov. David Toland for the announcement Monday in Topeka.
“You don’t often see this type of bipartisanship in our politics today, but that’s how we do things in Kansas, especially when the stakes are high,” Kelly said.
In the 2026 session, Kelly said she also would focus on finalizing a long-term plan for preserving and enhancing the state’s water resources.
“We are on the cusp of coming up with that strategic plan that I’d like to see in place before I’m out of office,” Kelly said. “As I’ve said before, I don’t expect to solve the water problem by the time I leave, but I would like in place a structure and a funding source that will insure that we can address water.”
In addition, the governor said she was committed to standing up the new state Office of Early Childhood by July 1. The goals would be consolidation of programs housed in a cluster of state agencies and the upgrading of services beneficial to children.
“We will spend and invest a lot of energy to make sure,” Kelly said. “Part of the point of the Office of Early Childhood is to be more efficient, so I’m hoping that we won’t be looking at needing money.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC160871-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 13:58:06.949556

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)A federal judge’s ruling in favor of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and other Democratic state officials temporarily blocks the Trump administration from abruptly withdrawing federal money from housing programs for the homeless.
“More than $21 million in unlawfully held funds will now be processed for housing efforts in the commonwealth, supporting veterans, seniors, families with children and individuals with disabilities,” said a news release from Beshear’s office. 
Many Kentuckians at risk of returning to homelessness because of federal funding switch

Beshear said he was “thankful that today’s ruling will protect housing for 700 households and 1,200 Kentuckians.”
U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy of Rhode Island granted the preliminary injunction against a decision announced last month by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to shift billions in funding in the Continuum of Care program from permanent housing to temporary transitional housing.
Beshear’s office said the HUD changes would have capped funding to states for permanent supportive housing at 30% and required states to reapply for money previously approved by Congress and awarded in 2024. Now, that funding will be processed without the need to reapply, the news release says.
Kentucky was at risk of losing 70% of the more than $15 million currently approved that supports permanent supportive housing in 118 of the state’s 120 counties. The cap would have also negatively impacted more than $20 million in federal funding for rental assistance and supportive assistance for homeless Kentuckians, said the governor’s office.
HUD’s funding priorities for alleviating homelessness and its response to the judge’s ruling remain unclear. The New York Times reports a HUD spokesman, asked about the legal developments, said the department was “committed to program reforms” and would proceed according to the law.
Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, said the preliminary court order “provides legal clarity as the case moves forward as well as a directive to the federal government to honor its funding commitments made to communities, nonprofit organizations, and households in 2024. 
“The preliminary injunction should begin to provide some relief from the unnecessary disruption we have experienced since the government reopened in November. We look forward to seeing the administration’s update on renewal processing on December 30, and we hope that this gives families currently housed under the Continuum of Care program some peace of mind this holiday season.”
Earlier this month, HUD rescinded its Nov. 13 notice announcing the funding changes an hour before a court hearing on two lawsuits challenging the new policy, prompting McElroy, the federal judge,  to say, “It feels like intentional chaos.”

Greg Gianforte has requested President Donald Trump issue an emergency declaration to respond to damage caused by high winds on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation.
“On December 17, 2025, a historic, long-duration high-wind event and associated blizzard caused widespread destruction across Montana,” Gianforte wrote in a letter.
He said the storm brought gusts from 60 to 90 mph and more than 100 mph in the mountains.
“Most critically, the storm caused structural failure of the roof of the water holding tank supplying the Fort Belknap Indian Community,” Gianforte wrote.
The request Wednesday for emergency federal assistance is the second this month following flooding in northwest Montana, a blizzard in northeast Montana and high winds across the state.
Friday, the governor announced that President Trump had approved the request for help from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for flooding in Lincoln and Sanders counties and the Blackfeet Nation.
In the news release Wednesday, Gianforte said damage from the recent storm exposed Fort Belknap’s primary water source to potential contaminants, necessitating a boil order for approximately 700 homes, a detention facility, a hospital, restaurants, and tribal offices.
In the letter, Gianforte said the unique demographic and geographic challenges make the impact on the Fort Belknap Indian Community especially dire.
“Many households in the community are multi-generational, housing a high concentration of vulnerable populations, including children and the elderly, who are at increased risk during a water crisis,” the letter said.
He said federal support is needed due to the severity and complexity of the emergency, and it would go toward repairing the water tank, securing reliable and safe drinking water, and alleviating the financial burden of the “unanticipated second disaster in two weeks.”
An estimate of the damages statewide related to recent disasters was not immediately available Wednesday from the Governor’s Office.
However, Trump’s approval of the earlier emergency declaration allows up to $5 million in federal funds to help with response measures, according to the Governor’s Office.
Gianforte said the recent wind and snow affected the entire state, with 43 of 56 counties recording gusts of 70 mph or greater, and in northeast Montana, a blizzard that lasted up to five hours.
“Federal support is essential to ensure the health and safety of the affected population,” Gianforte wrote.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos08-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 13:58:06.949556
,DC,2025-12-24 18:09:30+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,National Guard shooting case moved to federal court as prosecutors weigh death penalty,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/national-guard-shooting-case-moved-federal-court-prosecutors-weigh-death-penalty,,"WASHINGTON — The man accused of shooting two National Guard members near the White House last month, killing one, was charged in federal court Wednesday, moving the case out of the local court system.United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro wrote in a statement the “transfer of this case from Superior Court to District Court ensures that we can undertake the serious, deliberate, and weighty analysis required to determine if the death penalty is appropriate here.”West Virginia National Guard members Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, were shot while on patrol in Washington, D.C., the day before Thanksgiving. “Sarah Beckstrom was just 20 years old when she was killed and her parents are now forced to endure the holiday season without their daughter,” Pirro added. “Andrew Wolfe, by the grace of God, survived but has a long road ahead in his recovery.”Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was already charged with first-degree murder while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed and two counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. The federal charges now also include transporting a firearm in interstate commerce with the intent to commit an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year and transporting a stolen firearm in interstate commerce.New details disclosedA seven-page document submitted to the court details Lakanwal’s movements ahead of the shooting, which took place just before Thanksgiving. But it doesn't shed any light on his possible motives.  A special agent with the FBI, whose name was redacted in the affidavit, wrote the .357 Smith & Wesson revolver used in the shooting was legally purchased by another person in Bellevue, Washington, in February 2008. But after that person, identified by the initials J.D., died in February 2023, the weapon was stolen. The affidavit alleges that Lakanwal obtained it from someone identified as W-1 after originally trying to purchase an AR-15, a compact AK-47-style stockless pistol and a pistol in October of this year. Lakanwal told this person that he believed he needed a weapon since he was driving for the ride-sharing services Lyft and Uber, according to the affidavit. The FBI agent, however, wrote that Lakanwal hadn’t driven for those services since May 25 and was unemployed when he sought the weapons. The person identified as W-1 in the affidavit was able to secure the .357 Smith & Wesson revolver and gave it to Lakanwal on Nov. 14. “W-1 explained that he gave the firearm to (Lakanwal) because he believed (Lakanwal) wanted it for personal protection while working as a rideshare driver. W-1 stated that W-1 was extremely nervous during the exchange and was visibly shaking,” the FBI agent wrote. “According to W-1, (Lakanwal) observed W-1’s nervousness and placed an arm around W-1 in an effort to calm him. W-1 stated that it is common knowledge among his peers that firearms acquired 'on the streets' are typically stolen firearms.”The revolver was loaded with five bullets at the time. Lakanwal went to a Big 5 Sporting Goods store the next day to purchase a box of ammunition. Route to D.C. trackedThe same day, Nov. 15, Lakanwal searched Google Maps for “Washington, D.C.” and “The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500,” according to the affidavit.The FBI agent wrote that Lakanwal’s Toyota Prius was in Washington state on Nov. 16, based on “license plate reader data that is made available to law enforcement through Customs and Border Protection.”The car was in Idaho on Nov. 19, Illinois on Nov. 21 and Washington, D.C., on Nov. 23. Day of shootingA few days later, on Nov. 26, Beckstrom and Wolfe were on patrol about two blocks from the White House when shot. Video footage from different locations near the shooting at 17th and I streets northwest showed Lakanwal “coming around the corner at the intersection with his hands raised in a firing stance.” He then “immediately began firing in the direction of Beckstrom and Wolfe, and they are both captured on video collapsing on the ground,” according to the FBI agent’s affidavit.

Two majors in the National Guard, identified as NG M-1 and NG M-2 in the affidavit, were talking with Beckstrom and Wolfe when the shooting happened. “NG M-1 reported that he heard gunshots; as he heard gunshots, he observed Beckstrom and Wolfe fall to the ground,” the FBI agent wrote. “NG M-1 then observed (Lakanwal), who was dressed in a knee-length, dark-colored jacket and armed with a revolver, (fired) additional shots. NG M-1 pulled his issued service weapon and fired shots at (Lakanwal). (Lakanwal) fell to the ground where he was detained by NG M-2.”The FBI agent wrote that both “Beckstrom and Wolfe were unresponsive and suffering from gunshot wounds to the head.”Beckstrom died as a result of her injuries at 5:58 p.m. the following day, Thanksgiving. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia charged Lakanwal with first-degree murder on Nov. 28, adding it to other criminal charges. Lakanwal pleaded not guilty in DC Superior Court during an arraignment on Dec. 2 and was denied bond in the case. West Virginia Gov.

The Department of Public Safety sent troopers to Winner and Sturgis for the ninth set of patrols undertaken as part of Gov. Larry Rhoden’s “Operation Prairie Thunder” public safety initiative.
The city of Brookings posted a notice on Dec. 12 saying that troopers would be in the area Dec. 17-19 for a Prairie Thunder saturation patrol. The city would “not be participating” in the operation, the notice said.
State tallies $43,000 in trooper overtime costs during Operation Prairie Thunder

Gov. Larry Rhoden, who announced the initiative in July, chastised the city for the announcement, which coincided with a press release from the Highway Patrol on previous efforts in Huron and Belle Fourche.
“It’s unfortunate that the city of Brookings would jeopardize an anti-crime operation and put the safety of our officers at risk by publishing this information,” Rhoden said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight.
Operations in Huron had drawn concern from some members of that city’s Hispanic community when additional troopers came to town in November for the first of two saturation stops, inspiring several social media posts about what some believed to be federal immigration raids. 
The Highway Patrol signed cooperation agreements with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement in advance of launching Operation Prairie Thunder, which initially targeted the city of Sioux Falls and surrounding areas. In total, troopers have questioned 81 people about their immigration status since the operation’s launch, and 57 people have been detained on behalf of federal immigration agents. 
Prairie Thunder patrols have led to a total of 419 arrests, according to the Department of Public Safety, and 271 of those arrests involved drug charges.  
The state never confirmed or denied plans to visit Brookings. Rhoden’s statement last week also said the state could not discuss “operational specifics” on future saturation patrols. 
The state routinely announces saturation patrols and sobriety checkpoints in certain areas, but news releases on such patrols only say which month they’ll take place.
Tuesday’s news release on Operation Prairie Thunder’s efforts in Sturgis and Winner said the saturation patrol resulted in 13 arrests and 25 total drug charges across the two cities, but did not mention the city of Brookings.

In response to a question from South Dakota Searchlight, Highway Patrol spokesman Brad Reiners confirmed that the Highway Patrol had not conducted a saturation patrol in Brookings.
Brookings Mayor Ope Niemeyer told South Dakota Searchlight that he was away from town on business last week, but said he hadn’t heard anything this week about extra troopers in town while he was away. He wouldn’t be able to comment on what impact, if any, the city’s announcement had on saturation patrol plans, he said.
The city had posted the notice to let residents know there could be additional officers in town, Brookings City Manager Paul Briseno told South Dakota Searchlight on Wednesday, and to clear up any confusion within the community about where those officers came from. There had been “questions in the community” about Operation Prairie Thunder, he said.
The state gave notice to Brookings that it intended to conduct its Dec. 17-19 saturation patrol, Briseno said, but did not reach out about its change of plans.
Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms did not immediately respond to a question on whether the city’s announcement of a patrol influenced decisions about where to send troopers.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-24 18:05:22+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Healey explores options to cover Mass. residents losing health insurance,Alison Kuznitz | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/health-care/healey-explores-options-to-cover-mass-residents-losing-health-insurance/,"Healey said Tuesday that the loss of subsidies will translate into ""upwards of 350,000"" Mass. residents losing their health insurance.","AS THOUSANDS OF residents drop coverage or hunt for higher priced plans through the Massachusetts Health Connector, Gov. Maura Healey said Tuesday that officials are exploring how to connect residents with other insurance options.
“We’ve seen premiums expected to increase two or three times,” Healey said on GBH News’ Boston Public Radio. “Now the good news — and I hope to be out with more word on this soon — we’re working to see how we can come up with ways to cover people.”
Tuesday marked the Health Connector’s deadline for Bay Staters to sign up for plans that start on January 1. It’s been a tumultuous open enrollment cycle, with more than 10,000 people already dropping coverage as they grapple with sticker shock from premium spikes.
In the aftermath of the country’s longest government shutdown, Congress couldn’t reach a bipartisan deal to extend enhanced premium tax credits, which are slated to expire on December 31 under a 2022 federal law.
Healey said Tuesday that the loss of subsidies will translate into “upwards of 350,000” Massachusetts residents losing their health insurance. GBH co-host Jim Braude asked Healey to clarify whether her administration is examining whether those people “could be covered by the state in some fashion.”
“Well there are other programs, Jim. There are other health insurance plans,” Healey replied. “And we just want to make sure that, you know, those people, if they qualify for a different plan, that we’re able to get them into that.”
Analysts say Massachusetts residents will face additional health insurance losses in 2027, as new Medicaid work requirements take effect under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A recent report advised the state to develop a model similar to the “COVID-era command center” to thwart coverage losses and ensure compliance with forthcoming federal regulations.
Massachusetts is expected to lose $3.5 billion annually once all health care components of that federal law take effect, according to Audrey Shelto of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Massachusetts. 
Healey did not directly answer a question from a caller who asked the governor to use her power and tap into the state’s more than $8 billion rainy day fund to stave off federal funding cuts. The caller, identified as Chris in Boston, said he has a disability and relies on MassHealth.
“I will say I am focused as we move into this budget season on making sure that we do what we need to do to protect the most vulnerable among us,” said Healey, who must file her fiscal 2027 budget proposal by January 28.
Later in the interview, Healey lamented that “health care is broken in this country.”
“And we’re seeing it every day with what’s happening with escalating health care costs for people and businesses around this country,” Healey said. “You know in Massachusetts, we can only work with the money that we have. And you know, you see the reports of hospitals struggling.”
The governor’s comments came after a veteran nurse called in to reflect on the closure of Carney Hospital in Dorchester during the Steward Health Care bankruptcy crisis. The caller, identified as Susan in Milton, told Healey Massachusetts has a “dearth of hospitals” and that she “had never seen health care so bad in my life.”
The state seized another Steward hospital, St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Brighton, by eminent domain in September 2024. Nurses at the facility — since renamed Boston Medical Center-Brighton — voted to authorize a three-day strike depending on how contract negotiations unfold, the Massachusetts Nurses Association announced Monday.
BMC Brighton nurses are concerned about potential plans to eliminate certain positions, curtail access to a pension plan, reduce paid time-off benefits, increase health insurance costs and not raise pay for the majority of nurses, the union said. The MNA said it represents 650 nurses at the hospital.
“To do this to our members, who already sacrificed so much during the turmoil of the Steward crisis and stuck with this hospital to ensure the safety of our community just adds further insult to the injury we have already suffered,” said Kate Cashman, a BMC Brighton nurse and bargaining committee co-chair.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gov.-Maura-Healey-at-the-Boston-Public-Library-on-Dec.-23-2025.webp?fit=1024%2C567&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 13:58:06.949556

(File photo)North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey is asking President Donald Trump not to pardon Greg Lindberg, who pleaded guilty last year to fraud and money laundering.
In a letter dated Tuesday, Dec. 23, Causey described Lindberg’s criminal conduct as deliberate and sustained.
“Mr. Lindberg’s criminal conduct was not incidental, technical, or victimless,” Causey wrote.

In a separate trial, he was convicted of attempting to bribe Causey, a Republican, who wore a wire for the Federal Bureau of Investigations to record Lindberg. 
The full FBI investigation took 18 months. In his letter to Trump, Causey wrote that Lindberg was recorded attempting to bribe him, in his official capacity as insurance commissioner, to remove a senior department official who found and exposed “serious financial improprieties” in Lindberg’s insurance work.
“The evidence presented was not speculative. It was contemporaneously recorded, exhaustively investigated, and ultimately proven in federal court,” Causey wrote. 
“Mr. Lindberg’s actions were a calculated attempt to undermine regulatory oversight, evade accountability, and silence those whose duty it was to safeguard policyholders, retirees, and working families,” the letter continued.
Causey said Lindberg’s misconduct and its consequences did not end with his conviction.
Instead, the victims — including policyholders and employees – continue to face the fallout and repercussions associated with the wrongdoings. 
“These harms are real, ongoing, and irreparable,” Causey wrote. “A pardon would not undo them; it would compound them by signaling that wealth, influence, and persistence can outweigh accountability.”
The letter comes as Lindberg has hired Keith Schiller, a longtime Trump associate, to lobby for a pardon on his behalf. 
U.S. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican representing North Carolina who is not seeking reelection in 2026, said in a social media post that he fully agrees with Causey.
“There should be no pardon given the troubling nature of this crime and all the evidence that supported the conviction,” Tillis wrote on X. 
During Trump’s first administration he granted a pardon to former N.C. Congressman Robin Hayes. Hayes, who was head of the N.C. Republican Party at the time, was accused of lying to FBI agents during the bribery investigation and had accepted a plea deal. In issuing the pardon, the White House said Hayes had the support of Tillis and other members of the state delegation.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG-3249-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 12:59:00.453913

Liz Brown will no longer chair the Indiana Senate’s Judiciary Committee after she earlier quit a Republican leadership position in protest of the congressional redistricting plan’s defeat.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray’s office announced late Tuesday that Brown had been removed from the Judiciary chair post she had held since the 2021 legislative session.
Brown, R-Fort Wayne, was a vocal supporter of the redistricting proposal demanded by President Donald Trump that the Republican-dominated Senate rejected in a 31-19 vote on Dec. 11. The following day, Brown resigned as the Senate assistant majority floor leader in charge of communications.
Brown’s position as Judiciary Committee chair had more direct influence on legislation, such as the handling of an immigration crackdown bill she’s sponsoring that has resulted in a conflict between her and state Attorney General Todd Rokita.
Brown said in a statement that Bray informed her of her ouster on Tuesday.
“It is apparent that effects linger from our failure to draw fair maps that would promote conservative Hoosier voices in Washington,” Brown said. “Senator Bray is utilizing his right to redefine Senate leadership after a tumultuous Fall. As I’ve said, our caucus has rebuilding to do to repair communication and trust with voters, and I will continue to do that.”
Bray’s office did not immediately reply Wednesday to a request for comment about why he removed Brown from the position.
Brown is also in a primary fight for her Senate seat.
Sen. Cyndi Carrasco, R-Indianapolis, will replace Brown as Judiciary Committee chair when the legislative session resumes in early January.
Carrasco, who joined Brown in voting to support the redistricting plan, is in her third year as a senator and is vice president and general counsel at the University of Indianapolis. She served as state inspector general under Gov. Mike Pence and was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Marion County prosecutor in 2022.
No other leadership changes have been made among Senate Republicans following the vote on redistricting, which the GOP senators opposed by a 21-19 margin.
Senate Majority Floor Leader Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, was another outspoken redistricting supporter but has maintained his high-level post and memberships on the Senate’s influential appropriations and tax committees.

He spent his days surrounded by those in suits and tidy haircuts advocating for change, sticking out intentionally to draw attention to his cause. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Morgan Walker Brown.","Died Dec. 16, 2025
Colchester, Vermont

Morgan Walker Brown died peacefully surrounded by love on Dec. 16. A person of enduring determination and wise compassion, to the very end he used his prose and his voice to advocate for people in need. Morgan inspired many to follow in his example of empathy, kindness and compassion. 
Among the many hats that Morgan wore, he was primarily a writer and activist in the Montpelier community. In recent years, he even began to show up around the community in a Santa suit to bring a smile and joy to those often forgotten in his role of Wandering Santa; this role had started as a small act of love for his visiting granddaughter and blossomed into a much larger deed as he subsequently brought holiday cheer to homeless encampments during the coldest months. His poetry was read aloud in press conferences and by legislators in the State House. Most importantly he presented it as a tool to advocate for people to have shelter and housing. 
Morgan spent many years experiencing homelessness in the latter half of his life. He was never afraid to push people to truly understand disability justice. Even while unsheltered, he never missed an opportunity to advocate for those who had less than he did. He spent his days surrounded by those in suits and tidy haircuts advocating for change, sticking out intentionally to draw attention to his cause. Morgan was not paid for this work; it was not a job but a calling in every sense of the word. It was who he was and was in every stitch of his being. 
After decades of experiencing homelessness, he found what he recently referred to as his “forever home,” which brought him stability, real community and deep friendships. He lived his life out in a small studio apartment that was “enough” for him. He had longed for all of this while he lived unsheltered and worked his whole life for all people to have the privilege of a place to call home. In the end of his life he was clear that he had found peace. 
Morgan leaves behind his beloved cat Cleopatra whom he adopted from the Central Vermont Humane Society 11 years ago. She lives up to her name as the Queen of his house. She brought him so much comfort and love, especially in the final year of his life in which she bestowed upon him strength and the ability to bear his trials with grace and dignity. She was most definitely his heart. 
He is survived by his siblings Alison Lawson and Jeff Hackett, his two children Justin Brown and Alex Grey, his daughter-in-law Rina Brown, and his beloved granddaughter Kirana Brown. 
And also, by his many friends, his beloved community, and those who have not yet found home. 
There is no better way to represent his wishes except in his own words. Morgan asked for all of us left behind to bring his empathy, love and compassion into all aspects of our lives. His challenge to us is to care for those who are experiencing homelessness; to fight for humane policies that treat all people like fellow human beings, every single day. 
In 2021 he wrote this poem while there was a twenty-seven-night protest on the statehouse steps to keep people sheltered:
In Lieu of Flowers 
(Remember and Care for the Living) 
For those living unhoused, 
abandoned to the streets, 
left to live in the woods, 
underneath bridges, 
sleep in dumpsters and the like; 
it is far too late to think of, 
remember fondly, send flowers 
or otherwise honor and memorialize them 
after they have languished and died from lying wet, 
frozen, alone and forgotten, 
due to deliberate indifference 
as well as from a lack 
of sufficient caring and empathy 
Morgan Brown fought for people, he represented people, and he showed up for people. In his final days, he asked that his legacy be carried on in all of us. Let us show up as he would have. In his own words, let us care for and remember the living each time we think of him. Morgan asked that donations in his honor be made to End Homelessness Vermont and Another Way. 
A memorial service will be held at a later date.

If we’re being honest, 2025 did not start out great. For basically the whole month of January, a series of wildfires raged across Los Angeles, killing hundreds (more on that number below). On the other side of the country, an Arctic blast brought historic snowfall and bitter cold deep into the South. Then Donald Trump took office for a second time on January 20 and immediately began to unravel the climate progress the United States had made under Joe Biden.
The rest of the year, which is on track to tie for the second hottest on record, was just as momentous, bringing all manner of climate events — some good, some bad. In a lot of ways, we’ll look back on 2025 as a critical moment, both for the environment and humanity. Here’s why.
 A firestorm consumes Los Angeles

Starting on January 7, wildfires continued for weeks and burned 78 square miles across Los Angeles, driven by strong winds and fueled by extra-dry vegetation. (The conflagration had climate change’s fingerprints all over it.) The fires destroyed more than 16,000 structures and forced more than 180,000 people to evacuate. In part because the blazes were burning through extremely affluent neighborhoods, the economic damages are estimated to be between $76 billion and $131 billion. The fires were 1 of 14 billion-dollar disasters to hit the U.S. in the first half of 2025, according to the research group Climate Central. (In May, the Trump administration announced that the federal government would stop tracking billion-dollar disasters, an essential way to assess climate risks.)
Officially, the fires killed 30 people. But this year, researchers got a better idea of just how bad wildfire smoke is for public health, as it exacerbates conditions like asthma and cardiovascular disease. In August, scientists published a new estimate of the L.A. wildfire death toll that factored in fatalities caused by the resulting haze: 440, or even higher. The next month, other researchers estimated that wildfire smoke already kills 40,000 Americans each year, which could soar to 71,000 by 2050 if humanity’s carbon emissions remain high. The flames themselves, it seems, kill but a small fraction of the fire’s total victims.
 Trump takes takes a hatchet to environmental regulations

Los Angeles was still burning when Donald Trump was sworn in for a second time and quickly began overhauling government agencies and axing environmental rules. The Trump administration’s deep cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, could leave communities even more vulnerable to the threat of wildfire smoke. Later in the summer, Trump signed the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill into law, which among other things tore up the only climate plan the U.S. had. That killed the tax credits that consumers were using to electrify their homes and offset the cost of EVs, and destroyed the capital that Indigenous tribes were using to develop clean energy projects. (Also see Grist’s recent coverage of the weird ways that Trump has been changing the culture and language around energy and climate change.)
 Extreme flooding is here to stay

Just as climate change is making wildfires worse, it’s actually making rainfall more catastrophic, too. That dynamic played out tragically on the Fourth of July weekend when flash flooding struck central Texas, most devastatingly in Kerr County, killing at least 135 people. Part of the problem is that, generally speaking, the warmer the atmosphere gets, the more moisture it can hold and eventually dump as rain. Making matters worse, the Gulf of Mexico has been exceptionally warm of late, which sent still more moisture into the atmosphere above Texas. (The same factors were fueling gnarly storms across the central and southern U.S. in the spring.) The resulting devastation is forcing a disaster-response reckoning not just in Kerr County but in similarly vulnerable communities across the U.S. Really, the world over is struggling to cope with extreme flooding: Storms and cyclones have killed more than 1,750 people in Asia since mid-November.
 Data centers emerge as a major environmental threat

In 2025, another kind of human-made environmental disaster garnered growing scrutiny: data centers. In February, we reported on Georgia joining other states in extending the life of fossil-fuel power plants (which the Trump administration has also been forcing to stay open) to meet the tech industry’s extreme demand for electricity. The AI boom is hurting consumers, too: All that extra infrastructure is driving up electricity prices for households, especially in data-center hotspot states. The industry is such an environmental mess that Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, suggested this summer that we build data centers in space instead.
Data centers are creating a water crisis, too: Nationwide in 2023, the facilities used 17 billion gallons of water directly to cool equipment, but they required more than 10 times that amount indirectly because they use so much electricity that’s generated elsewhere with steam. Accordingly, researchers at Cornell University this year found that the industry can reduce both its water and electricity footprints by building data centers where there’s abundant wind or solar energy, like West Texas.
 Earth crosses an ominous planetary boundary and tipping point

This year, scientists hit us with a one-two punch of bad environmental news: the crossing of the first “tipping point” and the breaching of another “planetary boundary.” A tipping point is when an Earth system suddenly and often irreversibly changes into something dramatically different, while a planetary boundary is a threshold that keeps the planet’s environments hospitable to life. Think of it like driving down a road, where the tipping point is an imminent cliff and a planetary boundary is a big sign warning of the drop.
In September, scientists announced that the seventh of nine boundaries had been crossed, this time the steady acidification of the oceans. (A quarter of humanity’s CO2 emissions have been absorbed by seawater, which creates carbonic acid.) That acidification is interfering with the ability of many organisms, like corals, mollusks, and crustaceans, to build their shells.
And speaking of corals, less than a month later, another team of researchers announced that the precipitous decline of reef ecosystems has pushed the planet to its first major tipping point. In the last 50 years, half of the world’s live coral cover has disappeared, as acidification pairs with rising ocean temperatures. All that stress causes corals to release the symbiotic algae that provide them energy, leading to coral bleaching. Even though corals are tipping, scientists are still breeding them in labs, hopefully finding varieties that can better stand the heat.
 Countries cop-out at COP

You’d think that with such dire news about tipping points and planetary boundaries coming out, the world would get more ambitious about lowering its emissions. But 10 years after the Paris Agreement — which set out to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, or in an ideal world, 1.5 degrees C — countries at the United Nations’ annual COP30 climate conference in November failed to come to an agreement on winding down fossil fuels. So we’re on track to get between 2.3 and 2.8 degrees of catastrophic warming by the end of this century, according to the U.N.’s own math. Every fraction of a degree means ever more severe effects of climate change — melting ice, sea level rise, extreme heat — and the further we go past 1.5 degrees, the more carbon we’ll have to remove from the atmosphere to bring temperatures back down to a safe level.
 Hurricane season ends without a single US landfall

This spring, forecasters were looking at high ocean temperatures in the Atlantic — the fuel for hurricanes — and predicting an above-average season with around 10 named storms. But as the summer stretched on, the hurricanes that seemed headed for the mainland U.S. instead turned back out to sea. Hurricane season ended on November 30 without a single hurricane making landfall in the country for the first time in a decade, thanks to some atmospheric quirks above the Southeast.
The Caribbean, though, did not fare so well this year. At the end of October, Hurricane Melissa — supercharged by climate change — ravaged Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Because of extra-hot ocean waters, the storm’s maximum sustained wind speeds doubled from 70 mph to 140 mph in just 18 hours. So while it’s unusual for the U.S. to escape landfall for a whole season, tropical cyclones will only get worse from here as ocean temperatures climb: This was only the second year in recorded history to have spawned three or more Category 5 hurricanes.
 Climate action has become unstoppable in many ways

Heading into 2026, it’s easy to look at all this and say, “Well, we’re borked.” Yes, the environment is buckling under the increasingly heavy burden of climate change. And yes, the Trump administration will continue its war on climate action. But unstoppable changes — the good kind — are also in motion that will help improve public health and reduce emissions, no matter what the federal government decrees.
For one, those environmental tipping points have positive counterparts that are now unfolding, thanks to local incentives and national policies elsewhere. The market share for new electric vehicles in Oslo, Norway, for instance, exploded from 13.6 percent to 95.8 percent in a decade, according to a report released in October. Solar panels have gotten so cheap that it’s now more economical to deploy renewables than to build more fossil fuel infrastructure. Accordingly, renewables are growing like crazy in the U.S. and beyond, with a new report finding that wind and solar are more than meeting the global rise in demand for electricity. Indeed, in the first half of 2025, renewables generated more electricity around the world than coal for the first time. The leaders of Africa’s growing economies, meanwhile, plotted a bold strategy this year to become a continent of climate solutions.
And keep in mind that in the absence of federal U.S. action on climate change, states and cities have stepped up to fill the void and have even increased their ambitions this year: They set their own emissions-reduction targets, regulated their own utilities, bolstered public transportation, drafted energy-efficient building codes — the list goes on and on. Yes, 2025 was an ominous year, both environmentally and politically, but that doesn’t mean that all is lost in 2026.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-24 17:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Advocates call on lawmakers to make changes to probation system,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/24/advocates-call-on-lawmakers-to-make-changes-to-probation-system/,"Legislation was introduced this year, but it never received a public hearing. Advocates want lawmakers to consider a similar bill in 2026.","Advocates, formerly incarcerated people and family members of incarcerated men and women are calling on state lawmakers to put forward a bill that would prevent people on probation from being sent back to prison for minor technical violations.
Legislation was introduced this past spring by Rep. Josh Hall, D-Hartford, but it failed to receive a public hearing. Advocates are urging lawmakers to consider a similar bill during the coming 2026 session.
Hall’s proposal sought to prevent people from being automatically sent back to prison for non-criminal violations of parole — things like missed appointments, failed drug tests, missing curfew or treatment or leaving the state without permission.
Hall’s bill also suggested introducing a system of “earned time credit” where people’s probation sentences could be shortened for complying with the conditions of their release. It would also have removed the fees associated with probation, including a $200 supervision fee and additional fees that vary depending on which program the probationer is enrolled in. (The $200 fee is usually waived by the court, and that program fees for sex offender programs are based on a sliding scale depending on a person’s income, according to a spokesperson for the Judicial Branch.)
Advocates and lawmakers gathered to discuss the issue at the Elmwood Community Center in West Hartford last week.
At the event, Talia Orr, co-founder of Seniors in Hartford Organizing for Power, told the story of her grandson, who is currently incarcerated. Several years ago, at age 28, he was arrested and placed on probation for three-and-a-half years. 
For the first two-and-a-half years, Orr said, her grandson was doing well until he missed a dose of medication. He missed a required health care appointment — a violation of his probation — and was sent back to prison for two months on a $50,000 bond. Orr declined to give her grandson’s name, citing concerns for his safety.
Orr said after her grandson was released, he checked into a rehab center. But his probation officer failed to inform the court, she said. When her grandson missed a required court date, a warrant was issued for his arrest and he was incarcerated again, this time on a $500,000 bond. 
Orr told the Connecticut Mirror that after about 30 days, things were straightened out with the court and her grandson was released. But in September of this year, his probation was revoked after being arrested again on another technical violation. He took a plea deal and was sentenced to three-and-a-half years. 
“If he makes it through all the restriction and pressures, including receiving proper medication and reentry support, that will really help stabilize him,” Orr said at the event. “He will be 37 years old.” 
Alex Brown, who is now working toward a masters degree in social work at the University of Connecticut, said at last week’s event that she also faced challenges while on probation. She’d spent four-and-a-half years at York Correctional Institution after being charged with vehicular manslaughter at age 19. At age 25, she was released on probation, and vowed she would never be incarcerated again. 
“ For many women, the fear of a [probation] violation shapes everything. A missed curfew, a forgotten permission slip, a phone call that doesn’t go through, any of it can mean being sent back,” Brown said. 
After years on probation, Brown said she received a violation for having police contact during a domestic violence incident. She was arrested and incarcerated for 48 hours. 
“ When I was originally incarcerated, I used to watch women come back again and again, and I just didn’t understand why. I used to think if someone just gave me a chance, I would never come back,” Brown said. “But I went back too — and it’s not because I was dangerous. It’s not because I committed a new crime, but because technical violations function as a revolving door in the system.” 
For Brown, the violation also led to an extension of her probation period. She has now been on probation for nine years. 
“Technical violations function as a revolving door in the system.” Alex Brown
Lawmakers who were present at the meeting expressed concerns that probation violations are required to be listed on applications for food assistance, known as SNAP. 
State Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, a member of the Judiciary Committee, told CT Mirror that she planned to rally other lawmakers to pressure the legislature’s Judiciary Committee chairs to take up the bill when the 2026 legislative session begins in February. 
“ The system’s broken, and people are just trying to do their best and keep getting punished,” said Gilchrest. “ People should not be incarcerated for these technical violations. It just feels like we keep moving back the starting line.”
Gilchrest said that as chair of the Human Services Committee, she could also introduce a separate bill that would address one of the concerns of advocates — the fact that people have to report any violations of probation on their applications for SNAP benefits, making them ineligible for SNAP.  
“And to hear … you missed a letter, or you got caught doing something that’s not putting the public in danger, and now you’re going to lose your food and you’re going to be put back in jail … that seems absurd,” said Gilchrest. 
Rep. Kate Farrar, D-West Hartford, who also attended the event, said she sees a clear need to boost funding for reentry centers, which provide assistance to returning citizens. “It’s really about making sure that as folks are coming back into their communities, that they actually have a fair shot at being able to support themselves,” Farrar said. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, a New Haven Democrat who co-chairs the Judiciary Committee, told CT Mirror in an interview that he supported the concept of the bill. He said depending on the probation officer, parole violations could be “teachable moments” for both the officer and the person on probation, or they could be used as overly constrictive ways to control the probationer. 
“It’s an important subject that I think should be raised,” he said.  
But Winfield said he couldn’t promise the committee would introduce a bill, given the large number of issues they have to consider in a short timeframe. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said in an email to CT Mirror that while he was “sensitive” to the concerns about probation, which had been discussed in the past, the bill had failed to get widespread support from lawmakers. 
“Perhaps it will be looked upon more favorably during the upcoming session that begins in early February,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0671-Copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 12:59:00.453913

Lowell, Massachusetts
Died Dec. 9, 2025
Lincoln, Massachusetts

Linda Kelliher Samets of Charlotte, Vermont, and New York, N.Y., passed away peacefully in Lincoln, Massachusetts on Dec. 9, 2025, following complications from recent surgery. A beloved wife, mother, sister, artist, horsewoman and friend, she was 79.
Linda was born on March 8, 1946, in Lowell, Massachusetts. The fifth of nine children, she attended Concord-Carlisle High School, where her artistic gifts emerged. She graduated from Massachusetts College of Art and Design (MassArt), which nurtured her creativity and helped set the course for her career and life. After college, Linda worked at an advertising agency in Boston before moving into a graphic design role at WGBH.
After moving to Vermont, Linda opened a one-room design studio in Burlington. At the time, she had been turned away from local agencies that told her that her work was too unconventional. But Linda knew better. She trusted her instincts. And so, she created her own place, her own path, and, eventually, her own company.
Over the decades that followed, Linda, together with her partner in life and business, Yoram, transformed her small design firm into Kelliher Samets Volk (now KSV), a nationally recognized marketing agency with offices in New York and Burlington. Her creativity, intuition, professionalism, and humanity influenced generations of designers, writers, and strategists.
Beyond her work at KSV, Linda was dedicated to numerous community organizations in Vermont, including Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, Special Olympics, Burlington City Arts and the Gailer School.
Linda had a deep love for animals and often said she preferred their company over that of most people. While she always had dogs and cats at her Charlotte home, her greatest passion was for horses. For many years, she owned and operated Windrunner Farm, a 30-horse barn in Shelburne, and she continued riding four or five days a week well into her seventies. For Linda, riding served as both a grounding influence and a source of joy.
After retiring from KSV, Linda’s life revolved around her family, horses, and her home in Charlotte, where she lived for over four decades. Though she described her daily routine in retirement as “puttering,” in reality, it was action-packed: she walked three miles a day (tracked carefully), painted in her home studio, cooked dinner for herself and Yoram every night, and enjoyed cards, dominoes, and any TV show with enough horses in it. On Friday evenings, she and Yoram brought Shabbat into their home, lighting candles and saying prayers, finding purpose in something bigger than themselves.
In addition to her husband, Yoram, Linda is survived by her daughter, Alex Samets, of Baltimore, Maryland, and her son, Theo Samets, of Los Angeles, California. She took great joy in seeing her children become the adults they are today. In recent months, she looked forward to becoming a grandmother and spending more time in Baltimore.
She is also survived by her sisters, Mardie Luppold, of Shirley, Massachusetts, and Leslie Luppold, of Concord, Massachusetts; her brothers, David (Christine) Luppold, of Concord, Massachusetts, Jonathan (Denise) Luppold, of Maynard, Massachusetts, and Jay (Deborah) Luppold, of Concord, New Hampshire; her brother-in-law, Robert Marquis, of Concord, Massachusetts; her sister-in-law, Carole Smith, of Portland, Oregon; and many beloved nieces and nephews. Linda was predeceased by her sisters, Priscilla Marquis and Deborah Luppold, and by her brother, Richard Luppold.
In lieu of flowers, contributions in Linda’s memory may be made to Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, a community she valued deeply, or to the Graham Equestrian Center.

(Photo by 	mroland/Getty Images)A supermoon — large, full, near the eastern horizon, with a golden, orange glow. The moon was at perigee, the closest point to the earth, and it looked massive and so bright that I thought the Kauffmans had installed a yard light. Of course not. The Kauffmans have no electricity here in Buggy Land, in the middle of the Old Order Amish settlement.
Frost Moon. Beaver Moon. Digging Moon. Deer Rutting Moon. It arrives just about the same time as the first frost. It marks the time when the beavers are preparing their lodges for winter.
And the time when animals are foraging for nuts and digging dens. The time when bucks abandon caution, chasing after and mating with does. The time when your car might collide with that deer on the road, smashing your grill, pitching the wild animal up into the air, only to land on your vehicle, moon-cratering your hood.
But I was the only one with a car in the Kauffmans’ barnyard. A horse and cart rattled in stuffed with young Amish neighbor women, their bonnets slipped down over their prayer caps. The women had ridden several miles in the dark, their slow-moving vehicle reflector on the back of the cart, their head lamps and a lantern in the front, and the illumination of the moon.
“Hello!” The Kauffmans called, parents and four children pouring out of their side door.
Inside, the house was decorated with a big sparkly blue banner hanging on the wall that read:
H-A-P-P-Y B-I-R-T-H-D-A-Y!
My childhood birthdays were fun and celebratory. Filled with small gifts, a birthday cake, parties and games of bobbing for apples and pin the tail on the donkey.
“This is the day they gave babies away, with every pound of tea,” my mother sang every year on my birthday, and we giggled and laughed together. Even as a child, I understood the humor and irony of the dark old folk song.
But as childhood moved into adulthood and my mother’s light passed too soon into the great beyond, birthdays became quieter and more solitary. A nice walk in the woods with my dog was all the celebration I desired. But this year was a milestone birthday, and I was happy to join a family who wanted to celebrate it.
The Kauffmans’ dining table was extended, filling the room, with about 15 wooden chairs of various sizes and shapes pushed into place. A veggie train, a coupling of halved green, yellow and red peppers stuffed with carrot and celery sticks, radishes, broccoli, and dip, chugged down the center of the table, its wheels, round slices of the tillage radishes that the Kauffmans grew as cover crops in their garden, tooth-picked in place. The engine was a cucumber with two carrot stumps for smoke stacks with cauliflower florets as puffs of smoke.
We all had healthy servings of the grilled chicken that Martha Yutzy had brought in a Swahn’s insulated cooler that kept the chicken warmer than any device I’d ever experienced. The train disappeared quickly, the children rushing to dismantle the cars, popping the raw vegetables in their mouths. Then came the dessert, a rich chocolate pan cake with white frosting swirling across the top.
“Now let’s sing for Mary,” Elmer said. “What song would you like?”
The guests were surprised I knew the common Amish hymns. But there was nothing I liked more than to hear my neighbors sing. A few years before, when Bertha, the mother and grandmother of this family, had lain dying in her living room, relatives gathered around her bed every night to sing.
Connecting to the divine through song

A cappella, in four-part harmony, their voices drifted through the window screens and floated toward me across the soybean field on the humid, summer air. I sat in front of my house and listened, every word clear and resonant, carrying the very intent to soothe and console. After several months, I began to recognize the hymns and their cadences. I couldn’t always translate the German, but I became familiar with the words and their accompanying tunes.
At the Kauffmans’ home birthday party, the parents, children, and invited guests belted out the hymns, the notes, represented by shapes in their hymnals, strong and bold, but nimble enough to harmonize with the others. I sat back and absorbed it all, singing along when I knew the words. These were the same hymns sung to Bertha, but this rendition was so much more upbeat and joyful.
We cleaned up all the dishes, washing and drying them by hand, plates, glasses, cups and saucers stacked back in the cupboard.
Then I ducked. A tennis ball whizzed over my head. The Kauffman boys had donned their baseball gloves and had taken positions in an imaginary infield in the living room. The ball flew back and forth, back and forth, thumping into the pockets of their gloves. The inning finally over, Menno, the 4-year-old, disappeared into the back room.
A few minutes later, Menno returned, waving a yellow flying sky lantern, or a trance balloon. Sky lanterns are paper lights that lie flat in their wrappers, but once you ignite a flame, they billow out and can be launched like hot-air balloons.
We all stepped outside with the lantern, the light of the supermoon bouncing off the metal roof of the goat shed. I’d never seen a sky lantern before. I knew it couldn’t be environmentally correct because it would eventually turn into litter. In another drier landscape, it could even be a fire hazard. But Martha lit the flame, the lantern lifting into the air, and I was immediately entranced.
Up over the goat shed, the lantern glided in the eastern sky, over the pasture that had caught many Kauffman softballs in the pocket of its glove. Up and up and away toward the neighbor’s pond where a few deer were bedding down for the night, drifting from us, smaller and smaller, the flame sparking and beginning to burn up the paper.
“It looks like a star,” I said.
“It’s a star!” The Kauffman boys echoed.
“It’s the Star of Bethlehem!” I said.
“The Star of Bethlehem,” the boys agreed.
Then the lantern seemed to stop, a tiny speck in comparison to the huge round moon that shone brighter and brighter, its golden glow bathing us in light in one of the darkest skies in the state. The lantern hung below the blue sparkle of the Pleiades star cluster, flickering, twinkling, in the constellation of Taurus.

I imagined a horse pawing, a beaver digging in, a deer flying through the air just like the lantern. All the folklore, the mythology, the religious imagery and beliefs throughout all the cultures of the world, were present in the night sky, guiding us to the place where we were meant to be.
Quietly at first, then louder and louder, we sang:
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim,
Giving the light for those who long have gone,
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on.
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem (Star of Bethlehem,)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns.
Give us a light to guide the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh, Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on (shine on.)

Mike DeWine signed several bills meant to provide property tax relief into law, but anti-property tax advocates aren’t impressed, and they are moving forward with their efforts to abolish them altogether.
‘They’re gonna price me out of my home’
Once his dream home, Brian Massie said after 20 years, it’s turned into a nightmare.
“I saw that the property taxes had gone up 40%,” Massie said.
The Concord Township homeowner has been frustrated with bills, ones he never thought in his nearly 80 years of life would get so high over the past two decades.
“If we stay on this path of ever-increasing property taxes, they’re gonna price me out of my home,” he said.
State lawmakers say they know it’s a problem, which is why they are cheering some brand-new laws.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has signed a slew of bills aiming to relieve property tax burdens.
DeWine says he wants to, “Fairly achieve property tax relief and at the same time, protect our schools, our police, our fire, and our essential other services.
House Bills 186 and 335 limit how much money school districts can get from rising home values — tying tax increases to inflation. These bills passed both chambers in a bipartisan fashion.
H.B. 309 allows county budget commissions to reduce property tax levies. It mainly passed along party lines, but a few Democrats joined the Republicans to pass it, while several members of the GOP voted no.
H.B. 129 implements a check on tax increases from school levies.
H.B. 124 gives county auditors greater oversight in using property tax sales information for determining property valuations.
“Property taxes in Ohio will be more understandable, and they’ll be more predictable for those taxpayers who pay property taxes,” said Pat Tiberi, the chair of the governor’s property tax working group.
But Massie isn’t impressed.
“Too little, too late,” he said. “If they can’t do anything for the seniors, that was sort of the straw that, as they say, broke the camel’s back.”
Ballot proposal
I asked Massie if he felt that Ohioans needed to take matters into their own hands because their representatives aren’t listening.
“That was basically our thought,” he said.
Massie is a part of the Committee to Abolish Ohio Property Taxes, currently collecting signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. Advocates from Citizens for Property Tax Reform, another group with the same mission, said it has collected more than 100,000 signatures already.
Lawmakers are worried, which accounts for the sudden action after years of letting taxes grow.
“I have to say that the threat of a ballot initiative is part of the thing that’s driving this,” House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said.
Those efforts are not good enough, some Ohioans have told News 5 and testified at the statehouse over the last year.
“These bills that were just signed into law, are they enough to gain your support?” I asked Massie.
“No, absolutely not,” he said.
The groups are trying to get the amendment on the November 2026 ballot.
The Committee to Abolish Ohio Property Taxes has already gotten signatures from the required 44 of 88 counties needed and has hundreds of petitioners deployed across the state, Massie said. It needs about 415,000 valid signatures and is aiming to submit about 620,000.
Education
Schools have been arguing for months now that these bills take away much-needed dollars for kids when they are already facing cuts from the state in expected funding.
“We’ll talk about [cutting] staffing, which impacts what programs we might consider to remain here at Parma and those that we might not be able to support,” Parma Schools Superintendent Dr. Scott J. Hunt told WEWS/Ohio Capital Journal. “Certainly, those things impact the quality of education we can provide for our students.”
While Massie said that schools just need to be more responsible with their money, the leaders of Citizens for Property Tax Reform have a more sympathetic outlook. Organizer Beth Blackmarr said that lawmakers have spent hundreds of millions on a stadium for the Cleveland Browns, rather than fairly funding schools or focusing on property taxes.
This summer, state lawmakers gave the Browns a $600 million performance grant for their new Brook Park stadium using unclaimed funds. Ohio’s Division of Unclaimed Funds currently oversees about $4.9 billion in funds, including forgotten bank accounts, utility deposits, uncashed checks and more.
Blackmarr said that the time spent finagling this proposal would have been better spent on problems that citizens are facing.
Districts worry that the ballot proposal will render public schools obsolete.

An Ohio judge has temporarily blocked the state from handing over $600 million to the Cleveland Browns for their new stadium.
Attorney Jeff Crossman is cheering Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Bill Sperlazzato’s ruling — a temporary restraining order (TRO) that will prohibit the state from using the cash, which comes from Ohioans, for the next two weeks.
“We’re pleased that the judge saw things the way we have been seeing them all along, which is that the state’s taking of this property is likely improper,” Crossman said after the hearing. “The process for which they’ve failed to undertake needs to be followed, and the state court judge hit the pause button to say that ‘Hey, let’s verify what they’re doing is actually constitutional.'”
This summer, state lawmakers gave the Browns a $600 million performance grant for their new Brook Park stadium using unclaimed funds. Ohio’s Division of Unclaimed Funds currently oversees about $4.9 billion in funds, including forgotten bank accounts, utility deposits, uncashed checks and more.
To check for unclaimed funds, visit unclaimedfunds.ohio.gov.
Previously, attorneys for the state argued that they are allowed to take the money, and some lawmakers claim that Crossman’s team is “forum shopping,” as a federal judge just shot down a request for a preliminary injunction.
In testimony in early December at the federal court, Unclaimed Funds Finance Director Amy Schellhammer said that they have not provided any direct notice to Ohioans, nor is it posted on their website, that $1.7-1.9 billion in unclaimed funds will be taken on Jan. 1, 2026.
A hearing for a preliminary injunction, a possible block while the case is litigated, is set for January 8.
We have reached out to the Browns for comment.

He planned to run to Columbia by Sunday.
Davis’ goal was possible for the first time this year after nonprofit Palmetto Conservation Foundation completed a 218-mile stretch of paths connecting the state’s capital to its coast. Over the next five to seven years, the nonprofit wants to finish its 30-year goal of connecting about 520 miles of trail extending across the state.
The stretch from Columbia to Awendaw marked a major piece of that. The final, 26-mile piece, named Boyd Passage after the prominent Columbia family that sponsored it, opened to the public over the summer.
400-mile Palmetto Trail gets a boost in state aid to connect, maintain the pieces

Soon after that trail opened, Davis, who has done long trail runs in the past, considered trying to run the whole thing.
“‘Hey, we’ve got a very unique section of trail here that comes right into Columbia, and that would be really cool to do,’” the 46-year-old recalled thinking.
Because of the time commitment, however, the idea seemed too far-fetched. Davis put the idea in the back of his mind for several months, until he attended a banquet for nondenominational Christian ministry Young Life and began to come up with a plan.
Touched by the stories of children the ministry helped, Davis decided to run the entire 218 miles in three days as a fundraiser to pay camp fees. People could pledge between 50 cents and $10 per mile or opt to make a single donation.
By the end of his trek, Davis raised nearly $12,000 — enough to send at least two dozen children to camp, he said.
Davis’ story
Running past palmetto trees on the fishing inlet of Awendaw, Davis set off in the middle of the night toward his home in Blythewood, just north of Columbia.
What stood out to Davis as he made his way across the state was how different the trail could be from one moment to the next.

He’d run through glades of pine trees, their needles blanketing the path, followed miles later by swampland, cypress knees jutting out of the water on either side of him. In what felt like moments, that could turn into hardwood trees, shedding their leaves for the winter.
For about 47 miles, he ran through remote swampland, where he saw not a hint of civilization until the trail neared U.S. Highway 52 near Bonneau, and he watched the cars whiz past. At other points, such as when he reached Columbia, the trail turned into sidewalks along busy streets.
“The varying terrain that you encounter along the trail, it’s a little bit of everything,” Davis said. “I think it represents South Carolina well.”
Davis made it as far as Eutawville, about 100 miles into the run, before painful blisters covering his feet forced him to stop. His goal of completing the trek in just three days turned out to be too ambitious for his body, with the rapid pace causing severe pain.
Even though he knew he wasn’t going to be able to finish the run by Sunday, Davis didn’t want to quit. So, the team of about 15 people who signed up to accompany him and bring him meals stepped in. Davis hopped in the van they’d loaded up with gear, and his team did the next 110 miles or so as a relay race, he said.
Davis met up with them again outside Columbia’s Fort Jackson. Ignoring the painful blisters on his feet, Davis ran the final seven miles with his crew behind him.
Near the end, Davis, a civil engineer and road designer, deviated from the designated path slightly to run up South Main Street toward the Statehouse. He was on the team that designed the renovations on South Main, which opened in July. With a police escort behind him, he knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance, he said.
“For a brief moment, all the pain went away, and it was pure joy that I was going again,” Davis said. “Shortly thereafter, reality set in, and it was a struggle. But I made it that last seven miles.”
Davis reached the Columbia Canal just before 3 p.m. Saturday. At the time, he told himself he would never try that again, but just a day later, he was already thinking about his next trip, he said.
Once the full trail is finished, Davis would like to try and run the length of the state. He acknowledged that would mean slowing down from his attempted breakneck pace, which would mean asking more from the people who volunteered to help him from his fitness group.
Any sort of extended trail run involves a lot of coordination to get food, water and other gear while on the trail. For safety reasons, Davis likes to keep a second runner with him as often as possible, especially at night.
But if he could figure out the logistics, he would do it, he said.
“I would love that, more than anything,” he said. “The biggest part of it is time.”
The Palmetto Trail
Davis’ weekend run is the sort of thing the trail’s stewards envisioned. Of course, few people are going to run the entire trail, but connecting the pieces gives people the option to enjoy it however they please, said Mary Roe, the nonprofit’s executive director.
“Whether it’s a small, 10-minute hike or a 10-mile hike, the trail is a natural resource for people in the state to enjoy,” Roe said.
The trail still has some significant gaps, Roe said. One big obstacle is the Tyger River in the Upstate, which the trail must cross for completion. That means building a bridge, which is an expensive prospect, though how much will depend on the exact plans.
For the moment, staff are focused on expanding the trail out from Columbia, past Lake Murray, and to Newberry, which is about 40 miles northwest by road, Roe said. That will give people a longer contiguous trail to hike before it eventually connects to pieces in the Upstate.
The trail reaches 410 miles in separate pieces. Over the next five to seven years, Roe hopes to see another 120 miles or so added to connect the rest of them. Those numbers could change if the routes don’t happen as planned, though she was hopeful for the trail’s future, she said.
“Will it be challenging?” Roe said. “Sure. But I can say that we’ve got a lot of good trail movement and a lot of good discussions happening.”
The nonprofit sometimes builds pieces of trail on its own and sometimes works with other organizations to designate existing trails or help with upcoming trails to add to the network.
For instance, the Saluda Grade Trail, a 31-mile stretch of abandoned train rail turned trail stretching from Inman into North Carolina, will join the Palmetto Trail when it eventually opens. Work to transform the property into a trail is underway, according to the nonprofits running the project.
Connecting the Palmetto Trail to major pathways in other states, including North Carolina, is a step closer to a major goal for Roe. Eventually, she wants to see South Carolina’s trail system integrated into larger systems, perhaps even feeding off the Appalachian Trail.
For the time being, though, the focus is on connecting the state in one long “spine” of a system, as she called it. The 218-mile stretch from Columbia to Awendaw represented a major step toward that, she said.
“I think it legitimized us,” Roe said. “We really are building the largest trail project in South Carolina.”
Although much of the nonprofit’s funding comes from donations, close to $9 million has come from the state Legislature since 2014. That included $1 million in the current budget, which runs until the end of June.
The cost to open a section of trail varies, Roe said. For the 26 miles that opened this year, the Boyd Foundation donated $1.5 million. Upkeep and maintenance also come with a cost, as volunteers repair sections of trail.
The trail is also popular, especially after outdoor recreation boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, Roe said.
The security cameras installed at certain trailheads get almost constant pings during the day, as people stop to eat lunch, take short walks or go for long hikes. She hopes the trail will become an economic driver, too, bringing outdoorsy tourists to the state and sending people through small towns they may not have visited otherwise.
“I think it’s a really special asset for the state of South Carolina,” Roe said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9003-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 10:12:32.474975

(Courtesy photos)When Kevin Thompson, 65, retired to Hurley, New Mexico, in July 2023, he wanted to stay busy and get involved in his new community, so he volunteered at area food banks and the local radio station. Then he stumbled onto the state’s Aging and Long Term Services Department Ombudsman Program, and through it began volunteering in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.
A disabled U.S. Navy veteran who grew up in New York City, Thompson first encountered the state where he’d end up about 40 years ago while changing commands and driving with his three children from San Diego, California, to Virginia Beach, Virginia. 
“We got lost coming out of Deming because there was no GPS back in 1983,” he told Source New Mexico. “I made it close to Silver City and it left an impression on me, the scenery and everything…I said ‘Man, I’m going to come back here one day.’”
Before making the move to New Mexico, Thompson wound up in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he looked after his ill mother in her last years. Margarite Whitehead was eventually moved into a hospice facility and Thompson said he would visit her as much as possible. She passed in 2021.
Thompson said he learned a lot by spending time in the facility with her, getting to know the staff and other residents. He also volunteered at a local Veterans Affairs hospital.
“I sort of formed a bond with the elderly people that were there…They felt that no one listened to them. They felt disrespected,” he said. “They were just feeling really helpless and lost. And I understand what that’s like because I’ve been in the hospital with a brain tumor and it’s the scariest thing in the world knowing that you’re by yourself and there’s no one there for you.” 
After moving to New Mexico and searching for a volunteer opportunity to keep him busy, Thompson was pointed in the direction of the Fort Bayard Medical Center in Santa Clara. There, he met an older woman who told him about her experience volunteering as an ombudsman. He connected with the Aging and Long-Term Care Department and started the online training process around August 2025.
States began operating ombudsman programs in 1972 through the Older Americans Act. ALTSD spokesperson Joey Long told Source that New Mexico’s program currently has 17 ombudsman volunteers, but expects to add several more volunteers by January 2026. The program oversees volunteers throughout the state, who visit residents of assisted living and nursing facilities on a regular basis. They are tasked with ensuring residents receive adequate care, and that any of their concerns are heard and investigated. 
Thompson started volunteering in mid-September. He said the training took several weeks and included reviewing documents and reading materials before meeting virtually with program organizers and other volunteers. After training, volunteers are sent out to various care facilities to speak with residents and record what they hear and see.
Thompson now visits three facilities in his area, volunteering about three hours a week, and hears from residents about how they’re treated by staff, the quality of food, whether they’re receiving the correct amount of therapy and other issues, like buzzers going unanswered by staff and wanting to leave the facility for a weekend home visit. He also walks around the facility and records what he sees, hears and smells, such as a group of residents working on a puzzle together or a resident’s room that smells strongly of urine.
“I’m still trying to get my footing together, but I do enjoy it,” he said. “Volunteering is in my blood. It’s just something I’ve always done.”
Thompson said the veterans ward at the Fort Bayard Medical Center is his favorite to visit because he is able to connect with the residents about similar experiences. 
“Us veterans tell the best stories. And talking with someone that understands your lingo, your jargon, your state of mind — a lot of these guys are deeply emotional because they haven’t spoken to a veteran unless it’s like some guy that’s been there as long as they are,” Thompson said. “And they’re not all elderly. Some of them are just injured to the point where they can’t live by themselves.”
He added that he tries not to talk too much to residents, but lets them lead the conversation. In Cincinnati, he said, several staff members at his mother’s facility wouldn’t take her complaints seriously until family members got involved because she was blind and had dementia.
“That really hurt my mom a lot. She felt like her words didn’t have value,” Thompson said. “These are people who have led families, who have had careers, who used to be teachers, doctors, lawyers, mothers, fathers, and in my estimation, they just don’t want to be forgotten.” 
Thompson described himself as a “middleman” and a “foot soldier” of the department – connecting people with information about ALTSD and informing the people in the department who have authority to investigate issues or complaints. 
“We can only listen, record and report to the state ombudsman who has the authority to follow through and see what they could do to help these people,” he said. “A lot of the folks, their memories are not that great. They’ll talk to you and you don’t know if what they’re saying is accurate. That’s not your job to decide if it’s accurate or not. You just listen to what they have to say.”
But that in and of itself is important, he said.
“I just know what I’m there to do, which is bring a little joy and comfort to these folks that I talk to. And the fact that I’m a good listener, and I ask simple questions, I don’t want to make it complicated and the fact that I don’t assume anything is extremely helpful,” he said. “They don’t need to pay me to tell me what my value is. Seeing the looks on these people’s faces is the best validation that I could ask for…. I just hope there’s someone there for me when it’s my turn.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ombudsman-1024x819.png,,,2025-12-24 09:56:49.662295

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ failed proof of citizenship law could serve as a cautionary tale for Congress and other states just beginning to craft similar voting restrictions, a report found.
Federal legislation reintroduced earlier this year would require voters to provide documented proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. Kansas has been there, done that.
A report from three organizations, analyzing data from Kansas and Arizona, posits that such citizenship laws are costly, error-prone and disenfranchise voters. Plus, citizenship is already a requirement to vote nationwide.
Noncitizen voting is vanishingly rare, said Lata Nott, director of voting rights policy at the Campaign Legal Center and one of the report’s authors.
“We wrote this report to look into the actual financial costs of these laws, but, of course, there’s also the cost of — it’s a nonmonetary cost — people get disenfranchised by these laws, or you make it really hard for them to vote,” Nott said.
It was issued by Dēmos, a New York-based think tank focused on democracy; the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit legal group; and State Voices, an advocacy organization with state-based affiliates across the country.
The report used Kansas and Arizona as touchstones to illustrate the unforeseen financial costs of executing documentary proof of citizenship laws as they gain traction in Congress and statehouses nationwide.
The federal proof of citizenship law hasn’t progressed, but Indiana, New Hampshire, Ohio and Wyoming enacted legislation in 2025.
Kansas’ stint with a documentary proof of citizenship law was brief. After the passage of the Kansas Secure and Fair Elections, or SAFE, Act in 2011, every Kansan registering to vote was required to provide documentary proof of citizenship, which could include a passport or a birth certificate.
The law was implemented in 2013, and it was in effect for more than 3 years before a judge blocked its enforcement.
The report’s authors reviewed fiscal notes attached to documentary proof of citizenship legislation. Lawmakers often didn’t provide any fiscal analysis, ignore fiscal effects on local governments or provide incomplete fiscal analyses.
The report said Kansas’ fiscal note was an example of “gross underestimation” of state costs and burdens on local election officials. Lawmakers estimated a $12,500 increase in expenditures in the Secretary of State’s Office in fiscal year 2011 and a $1,000 increase in the following fiscal year.
In its first full fiscal year, the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office spent more than $192,000 to implement the act. The report hypothesizes the office spent more than $350,000 in total between the law’s passage and effective dates.
At the time, county election officials did not have access to systems that could crosscheck passport numbers or birth certificate records.
Neda Khoshkhoo, interim director of democracy at Dēmos and an author of the report, said proof of citizenship laws erect social barriers, and those barriers are tied to a chronic underfunding of this type of legislation.
“They, ultimately, are a form of voter suppression, which has a particular impact on voters of color and low-income voters and other historically marginalized groups,” Khoshkhoo said.
The disenfranchisement compounds, she said, when downstream effects of underfunding lead to incorrect implementation of a citizenship verification system, and voters are increasingly denied access to ballots.
The report said documentary proof of citizenship did not work in Kansas and came at the cost of disenfranchising thousands of voters and millions of dollars lost. 
Implementing proof of citizenship laws typically require investments in technology upgrades, staff training and data privacy, Nott said. Kansas tied its citizenship verification process to its driver’s license database.
“When you do that, you will probably run into some errors,” Nott said. “Kansas has. Arizona has. And those errors, they’re not just minor errors. They’re errors that disenfranchise people, that take away their right to vote.”
However the report identified a larger problem. Division of motor vehicles clerks in Kansas weren’t allowed, by policy, to request proof of citizenship from voters when renewing or updating their licenses. Clerks statewide also were not allowed to inform people of the new requirement. 
The report said Kansas “faced a multitude of technological, organizational and legal challenges that were a direct result of the flawed system designed by the SAFE Act and its implementing regulations and directives.”
More than 30,000 Kansans were prevented from voting and saw their registrations suspended or deemed invalid because of the state’s law.
The report said there was “a yearslong breakdown in communication and coordination between the DMV, the secretary of state, county election offices, and voters” throughout the duration of the law.
In 2018, a federal judge struck it down, ruling the law unconstitutional and in violation of the National Voter Registration Act. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judgment in 2020, concluding the law had an outsized effect on voters. It ruled that the inclusion of noncitizens on Kansas’ voter rolls could be attributed to administrative issues. A confirmed 39 noncitizens successfully registered to vote in Kansas between 1999 and 2013, making up 0.002% of voters, according to the appeals court’s opinion.
The full cost of ameliorating the state’s errors was not documented, the report said.
Proof of citizenship laws can sound like common sense policy, said Marissa Liebling, senior director of programs at State Voices. But the complications and the financial hurdles that come with enacting them amass.
Then-Secretary of State, now attorney general, Kris Kobach was an advocate of the law, billing it as a way to combat voter fraud. Instances of fraud were never proven in court.
The state ended up paying $1.9 million in attorneys’ fees to the winning parties of two lawsuits, the report said. Staff time in the Attorney General’s and Secretary of State’s offices spent on the litigation wasn’t unaccounted for in the report.
A spokesperson for the current Secretary of State’s Office said Kansas’ documentary proof of citizenship law “was a tool to help with the integrity of Kansas voter rolls.”
Secretary of State Scott Schwab, who is a Republican candidate for governor, was a member of the House at the time the citizenship law was passed. He voted in favor of passage, according to legislative records.
Liebling, Khoshkhoo and Nott expect more proof of citizenship laws in 2026.
Nott interprets their increase in popularity as “one of many signs that we’ve had in the past few years that election administration has gotten so politicized.”
What once was a domain for “wonky election nerds,” as Nott put it, has become polarized in every aspect. 
Liebling said voter education, fail-safe options for voters and proper, accurate investments are solutions to costly, error-prone election legislation. The effects of proof of citizenship laws can be acute and profound for people who have historically been excluded from electoral processes, she said, but the issue touches everyone.
“When you compound the fiscal and administrative costs with a real burden on voters in many different communities and geographies across the board,” Liebling said, “I think it really requires some rethinking as to the value of these kinds of policies.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_5361-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 09:56:49.662295

(Photo by LordHenriVoton/Getty Images)With the most wonderful — and for some, the most stressful — time of year underway, a University of Iowa researcher is working to discover pathways in the brain to help decrease the risks that come with chronic stress and promote resilience.
According to a 2023 poll conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Psychological Association, more than 40% of respondents reported their stress levels increasing during the holiday season, described in the report as the time between November and January.
Jason Radley, a UI psychological and brain sciences professor who has spent a decade studying the effects of chronic stress “from the perspective of disease,” said the stress responses developed in the body to help in enduring harsh environments are triggered in modern times by things that “aren’t really immediately life threatening, like work pressure or financial problems.”
“The effects of stress on the brain and body can produce long-lasting changes in brain function and the pathways that regulate behavior,” Radley said.

Radley’s research focuses on the reaction to stress, also known as coping, and how the brain controls how the body copes. In studying the stress hormone changes and manipulating brain activity in rats, Radley said he and researchers working with him have shown that the prefrontal cortex of the brain in these lab animals is “rewired by chronic stress exposure.”
The human’s prefrontal cortex is the area of the brain “most strongly associated with higher mental functioning,” Radley said, like the ability to focus on different tasks, plan and make decisions. Seeing how rats’ brains respond to chronic stress should help in understanding how it can rewire humans’ brains as well, and increase risks of stress-related diseases and other medical issues.
Two pathways connect the prefrontal cortex to the brainstem, Radley said. Research has shown the pathways regulate what he called “active and passive coping.” Radley described active coping as “taking steps to resolve or reduce the stress,” like confronting tasks causing stress, while passive coping “can be more like withdrawing from the situation or procrastinating.”
“What we found is that if we activate this pathway that can increase active coping after chronic stress, we can reverse these physical changes and the adverse effects that we see with stress hormones and cardiovascular changes,” Radley said.
With these pathways identified, Radley said he and other stress researchers have grown more interested in resilience as a tool of decreasing risk. Radley has created a “behavioral task” for lab rats which he said is similar to training that first responders receive or soldiers go through in basic training, though on a much smaller scale, where people are exposed to milder forms of stress so they can learn to adapt in real stressful situations.
The task, which Radley said some call a “model of stress inoculation,” will hopefully unlock for researchers new pathways that they can activate in people to help mitigate risks of developing stress-related disease and promote resiliency.
How to cope with high-stress holidays
From the research Radley and others have compiled on stress and the brain and body’s interaction with it, he said something people can take away is that active coping — or facing stressors head-on rather than avoiding them — will help reduce feelings of being overwhelmed.
A June article from the Centers for Disease Control recommends caring for both mind and body to reduce stress, including taking breaks from social media, doing relaxing activities, practicing gratitude, connecting with others, getting enough sleep, moving your body and eating healthfully.
When asked whether his knowledge of stress and resiliency has led to this — traditionally tricky — time of year being any more calm or easy, Radley joked that “stress researchers are really good at alleviating stress and living stress-free” just like how “all doctors are healthy and dentists have good teeth.”
While Radley said his default behavior leans more toward procrastination and last-minute work than not, conducting his research has led him to think more about how he can actively cope in stressful situations like holiday shopping or figuring out when to take time off work when “research never rests.”
He’s gotten good at “getting things done at deadlines” after pushing things back, Radley said, but he can feel physical effects of the stress caused by his habits, especially as he gets older.
“What I’ve been trying to do since I’ve been more mindful of our research with active coping is to try to plan better, and just try to do things little bit at a time and not wait till the last minute,” Radley said.

Sockeye salmon, also known as red salmon, is among the species harvested for subsistence. (Photo provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The U.S. Department of the Interior is considering whether to change Alaska’s unique system of hunting and fishing, which gives rural residents priority on federal land in Alaska.
According to a notice published Dec. 15 in the Federal Register, the Interior Department is conducting “a targeted review” of the program mandated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
While no specific changes were identified in the notice, it prompted the Alaska Federation of Natives to react with concern.
In a message to members, it called the new proposal “a serious threat and a major step backward” in fish and game management within Alaska, according to a report Tuesday by the Anchorage Daily News.
Federal law requires rural residents to receive a priority when subsistence hunting and fishing, but because Alaska’s constitution prohibits the state from operating a system that gives one resident priority over another, the federal government uses one set of rules for hunting and fishing on federally controlled waters and lands, and the state uses another set for state-controlled water and land.
That has frequently led to conflicts between the state and federal government over management, and several lawsuits over the issue are currently in progress in federal court.
The Daily News reported that the suggestion to revise the two-tiered program came from Safari Club International, a large sport-hunting organization that has frequently sided with the state in lawsuits against the federal government.
Information posted online by the Interior Department indicates that the agency may consider:

Changing the makeup of the board that regulates subsistence hunting and fishing on federal land;
Reconsidering the rules that determine what parts of the state are “rural” and thus eligible for preferential treatment;
And the role of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in the program.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking a holiday break and will return to your inboxes on Monday, Jan. 5.
For five years, 39-year-old Sarah Jolly has been trying to start a family with her husband. After both participated in multiple tests, the Central Coast couple has yet to receive a clear-cut answer to their infertility issues. 
Throughout the ordeal, which has included three unsuccessful attempts of intrauterine insemination, Jolly said she has felt dismissed. Insurance also refused to cover any of her fertility tests or appointments, but covered her husband’s visit to a urologist. 

Jolly: “I’ve gotten a lot of comments societally, even from a lot of men, like ‘You should have kids. It’s the biggest privilege.’ But our society also doesn’t support women and getting the health care they need to be able to achieve that. It feels like a punch in the face that I wasn’t expecting.”

For Californians like Jolly who are struggling with infertility, some support is on the way. Beginning Jan. 1, certain health insurers will be required to cover fertility treatments and in vitro fertilization services, offering millions of Californians a chance to have a baby, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
The new law mandates large group health insurers — from employers with at least 100 workers — to cover fertility services, and does not apply to people who get their insurance through religious employers, federally regulated plans or Medi-Cal. The law also amends the definition of infertility to include same-sex couples and single people, opening up fertility benefits to these individuals.
In the U.S. roughly 9% of men and 11% of women of reproductive age struggle with infertility, and treatment can be costly: One cycle of in vitro fertilization costs an average of $24,000, according to a 2010 survey. For a successful pregnancy, which often takes multiple tries, the average cost was $61,000. These high price tags are the main reason people can’t access care, said Alise Powell, director of government affairs with RESOLVE: The National Fertility Association.

Powell: “Infertility is a disease and it should be covered by insurance like any other disease or ailment people have.”

Immigration fears color holiday season

Though 2025 marks the third year local organizers have put on a holiday festival in San Diego County’s San Marcos, heightened immigration enforcement activity has created an air of increased caution in the mostly low-income, Latino community, reports CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan.
Sponsored by the civic organization Universidad Popular in partnership with Restoration Abbey, a local church, the event includes a neighborhood procession, or posada, that reenacts the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem. As locals gather for the Posada Comunitaria event, however, volunteers keep watch for immigration agents — highlighting the challenges some community leaders face when planning cultural celebrations under the current Trump administration.
San Marcos appears to account for just a few of the immigration arrests in the San Diego area, but this year saw more arrests: Since September 2023, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested at least 38 people — but 20 of those arrests were between June and October 2025, according to a CalMatters’ analysis of federal data provided by ICE.
Despite the fears, organizers decided to go on with the show.

Alex Aguas, a priest with Restoration Abbey: “The practice of the Posada really invites people to think about … what does it mean to be on the margins and looking for sanctuary and shelter at this time?’ We also just get to have the opportunity to celebrate.”

(Photo courtesy of Iowa Department of Corrections)The Iowa Dental Board has reinstated the license of a Waterloo dentist convicted of being intoxicated at the state prison where he was providing dental care for inmates.
State records show that in December 2023, Paymun Bayati, also identified in board records as Payum Bayati, was arrested at Anamosa State Penitentiary shortly after completing a root canal on a patient inmate. Bayati was charged with public intoxication and was convicted in April 2024. He subsequently agreed to voluntarily surrender his license for at least one year.
Police records show that on Dec. 7, 2023, an Anamosa police officer was dispatched to the penitentiary in reference an impaired person who was trying to drive away from the prison. The officer reported arriving at the prison and meeting with the warden, the deputy warden and Bayati.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the police report, the warden said nurses reported Bayati appeared to be intoxicated and had just completed a root canal on a patient. The police officer reported Bayati’s speech was slurred and he “smelled heavily” of alcohol. Bayati then submitted to a test that allegedly indicated a blood-alcohol level of 0.158 — almost twice the legal limit for driving.
“He let me search his vehicle in the parking lot, where I located an empty flask that smelled of an alcoholic beverage,” the police officer wrote in his report.
Court records, which include the judge’s notes from the ensuing criminal trial, indicate the dental assistant who worked with Bayati testified that when she arrived for work on Dec. 7, 2023, Bayati had music playing on a computer and his head was resting on the counter. The trial notes indicate she testified that later, while doing the root canal, Bayati was swaying back and forth, closing his eyes, had trouble picking up dental instruments, and smelled of alcohol.
The judge’s notes also indicate the administrator of nursing testified that after she told Bayati he could not work and instructed him to gather his belongings, he told her he loved her and asked if he still had a job. She also testified that Bayati was staggering at one point, seemed confused and was laughing inappropriately, according to the judge’s notes.
“I don’t dispute that I was intoxicated,” Bayati testified, according to the judge’s notes. “How it came about is what I am arguing. Someone poisoned me.”
Bayati told the Iowa Capital Dispatch he doesn’t drink and believed someone, probably his dental assistant, tampered with his cup of coffee by pouring isopropyl alcohol into it after he arrived at the prison that morning.
In December 2024, six months after his license suspension took effect, Bayati sought early reinstatement of his license. After the board indicated it intended to deny that request, Bayati sought a hearing before the board.
As part of his request, Bayati provided the board with a substance abuse evaluation that didn’t recommend treatment and didn’t include a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Bayati also informed the board that he is subject to some form of additional substance-use monitoring by virtue of his holding a commercial pilot’s license and a commercial driver’s license as part of his trucking business.
Last month, the board concluded that Bayati had demonstrated it was in the public’s best interest to have his license reinstated, subject either to enrollment in the Iowa Professional Health Program or to three years of substance monitoring by the board.
Other Iowa dentists sanctioned
Other Iowa dentists whose disciplinary cases recently came before the board include:
Deborah Cassill of Cedar Rapids – According to the board, Cassill was alleged to have allowed uncertified dental assistant trainees to take patient radiographs and perform dental work without supervision by a dentist. It was also alleged that Cassill had “rushed a patient’s dental work” and that the patient was one of her own employees.
The board, which has not disclosed when the alleged conduct took place, charged Cassill with encouraging, assisting, or enabling the unauthorized practice of dentistry, and with unprofessional conduct. To resolve the case, Cassill agreed to pay a $2,000 civil penalty and complete an “ethics program” of undefined duration.
It is the second time the board has sanctioned Cassill for improper use of staff to perform dental work.
In 1999, the board charged Cassill, then known as Deborah Trimble, with assisting or enabling the unauthorized practice of dentistry and with willfully or repeatedly violating a board rule in that she failed to protect the health of her patients by assigning unlicensed auxiliary staff duties that could not be legally delegated to them.
In that case, the board alleged Cassill regularly employed “unlicensed auxiliary staff” as dental assistants, and on many occasions allowed a dental assistant to perform procedures – including the placement and removal of temporary crowns — that constituted the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene. The case was resolved with Cassill’s license being placed on probation for five years, with the understanding that she’d complete a course on dental ethics and pay a $1,500 civil penalty.
Maria Nosworthy of Ottumwa – According to the board, it fielded a complaint about Nosworthy that expressed several areas of concern with her practice of dentistry, including “using force with patients,” an allegation on which the board didn’t elaborate.
The board alleges the complaint also expressed concern with regard to Nosworthy’s failure to meet infection-control standards, working on patients after they have asked her to stop, improper use of local anesthesia, failure to perform comprehensive patient examinations, poor communication with patients, failure to meet the expected standard of care, and unprofessionalism.
The available board documents don’t indicate when any of the alleged conduct took place.
The board charged Nosworthy with practicing dentistry in a manner that is harmful or detrimental to the public, unprofessional or unethical conduct, and failure to maintain a satisfactory standard of competency.
Without agreeing to any wrongdoing, Nosworthy recently agreed to settlement that calls for her to complete a remedial education program that deals with restorative care, ethics and recordkeeping.
No civil penalties or restrictions on Nosworthy’s license were imposed.

,California,2025-12-24 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Even more Cal State campuses will automatically admit eligible students under a new state law,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/12/cal-state-admission/,California State University last year launched a pilot program to attract more students to the university system and to steer some to campuses that have been struggling with enrollment declines.,"In summary
California State University last year launched a pilot program to attract more students to the university system and to steer some to campuses that have been struggling with enrollment declines. 


What’s good for Riverside County is good for the whole state: After a pilot to automatically admit high school students into the California State University system in the Inland Empire county took off last fall, lawmakers this year passed a law to greenlight a similar program statewide next fall. 
Leaders at the California State University last year launched the pilot to attract more students to the university system and to steer some to campuses that have been struggling with enrollment declines.
The pilot worked like this: University officials and high schools in Riverside County pored over student course completion and grade data to identify every county high school senior who was eligible for admission to the 10 of 22 Cal State campuses chosen for the pilot. Then the students received a brochure in the mail last fall before the Nov. 30 submission deadline, plus digital correspondence, telling them they were provisionally admitted as long as they submitted an application to one or more Cal State campuses, even those not in the pilot, and maintained their high school grades.Starting next fall, all students in California will be eligible for the automatic admissions program, which will expand the roster of participating Cal State campuses to 16. Cal State will release more information on the program’s implementation in February, its website says.
In justifying the expanded program during a legislative hearing, bill author Sen. Christopher Cabaldon, a Democrat from Napa, said college should be as seamless a transition from high school as it is for students finishing one grade and advancing to the next. “It’s entirely an invention of us, the gap between 12th grade and college. … The same gap does not exist between elementary school and junior high or junior high and high school.”The legislation, Senate Bill 640, passed without any opposition and was signed into law by the governor. The program doesn’t mean students can enter any major at the campuses they pick. Some majors may require students to show higher high school grades or tougher courses if those programs have fewer openings than student demand. For Californians, the standard minimum GPA for entry is 2.5 in a series of college-preperatory courses.Students will also be free to apply to the six other  over-enrolled Cal State campuses, though admission isn’t guaranteed. Those are Fullerton, Long Beach, Pomona, San Diego, San Jose and San Luis Obispo.
What the Riverside pilot did
High school counselors told CalMatters that the Riverside County pilot encouraged students who never considered attending a university to follow through with the automatic admissions process. Counselors also reached out to some students who were a class or two short of meeting the requirements for Cal State admission to take those, encouraging more students to apply to college who otherwise wouldn’t have. Younger students who were off the college-course taking track might be emboldened to enroll in those tougher high school courses knowing automatic admission is in the cards, the counselors said.
Silvia Morales, a senior at Heritage High School, a public Riverside County high school, got an automatic admissions letter last fall. “I was pretty set on going to community college and then transferring, because I felt like I wasn’t ready for the four-year commitment to a college,” she said. She eventually submitted her forms, encouraged by her high school counselor. 
Following the Riverside pilot, Cal State campuses saw roughly 1,500 more applicants and 1,400 more admitted students in 2025 compared to 2024, though just 136 more students enrolled. 
The data for Riverside County reviewed by CalMatters suggests that more applicants and admitted students through an automatic admissions policy doesn’t translate into more enrolled students. Colleges closely follow their “yield rates” — the percentage of admitted students who ultimately enroll. In 2024, the Cal State yield rate for Riverside County was about a third. But in 2025, it declined by a few percentage points, meaning a lower share of admitted students selected any Cal State campus.  
This suggests that the system will have to work harder to convert admitted students into ones who actually enroll, said Iwunze Ugo, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, particularly with students who would not have applied were it not for the automatic admissions program.
Automatic admissions doesn’t mean automatic enrollment
While admission to a college overcomes a major hurdle to eventually enrolling, there are numerous steps necessary before students sit down for their first college course. Accepted students must submit additional grades, put down a deposit, complete registration forms and actually show up for the fall term. Students who were less engaged in the college-going culture are more likely to “melt” during the process between acceptance and enrollment, some studies show, though researchers say this can be reversed with additional outreach to students at risk of not enrolling. 
And even with an automatic admissions program, students must still register online and complete the application, which many students under the Riverside pilot didn’t do. Cal State sent out more than 17,000 automatic admissions notices to students, and just under 12,000 formally applied to at least one Cal State campus. Those who didn’t apply may have chosen another option, such as the often more selective University of California, private campuses, community colleges, or no college at all.“I think that’ll be incumbent on the CSU to pick up some of that slack and encourage students admitted through this path to go through the rest of the process and ultimately end up at a CSU campus,” Ugo said.Cal State officials also recognize this. “Students who apply independently tend to have stronger self-directed interest, and therefore stronger intent to enroll,” said April Grommo, a senior Cal State official who oversees enrollment management. More direct engagement with students admitted through this program will be necessary, she said.
Some campuses with a recent history of declining enrollment got a tiny pick-up from the pilot. San Francisco State saw 311 more applications from Riverside County in 2025 than in 2024. That translated to 11 more enrolled students, a review of Cal State data shows.
A statewide program may steer more students to attend campuses with enrollment woes, even if the “yield rate” declines. That’s because if the rate of new students enrolling doesn’t rise as quickly as the number of students admitted, the yield rate drops.Under the expanded statewide program, Grommo said the system anticipates “enrollment growth as well, but not necessarily at the same rate as applications and admits,” she added.And as the economy shows signs of decay, the prospect of a college degree may compel more high schoolers on the fence to attend Cal State; System data show students from there earn a typical salary of $71,000 five years after graduating with a bachelor’s degree. Postsecondary enrollment tends to rise as the number of available jobs decreases, a social science phenomenon in which employers are more selective about who they hire, compelling many job-seekers to hit the books to show they’re more trained.Of course, souring economies often result in less public funding for colleges as state budgets are beleaguered, which may lead to fewer professors and staff for a growing cadre of students. “But I think generally, having more students is not a problem,” Ugo said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/050625_CSU-San-Marcos_AH_CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 08:56:35.940534

State and local governments became more aggressive in sweeping homeless encampments in 2025, among other measures. 


In 2025, we started to see the effects of a more punitive approach to homelessness from the state and local governments.
A CalMatters investigation found that the number of people arrested or cited for homelessness-related offenses soared in cities around the state. At least 50 California cities passed new ordinances targeting homeless encampments, according to an analysis by UC Berkeley Law students. That all came after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year in Grants Pass v. Johnson, which gave cities more freedom to punish people for sleeping in public spaces.
Gov. Gavin Newsom doubled down in encouraging cities to crack down on people living outdoors. In May, he urged every local government in the state to adopt ordinances that restrict public camping. In August, he launched a new state taskforce dedicated to clearing encampments.
2025 was also the year that some California counties finally started to make progress on homelessness, which experts attributed to an influx over the past few years in state, federal and local funds for housing and services. Of the 29 places in California that reported an official homeless census, more than half saw fewer unhoused people compared to 2024, according to an analysis of point-in-time counts by the Hub for Urban Initiatives. Contra Costa, Sonoma, Santa Cruz, Ventura, San Diego and Los Angeles were among the counties that saw their numbers go down.
2026 outlook
Cuts, cuts and more cuts. Proposed federal cuts to housing and homelessness funds, as well as a shift in federal funding away from permanent housing, could derail the progress California has made in fighting homelessness. The state also is reducing the money it contributes to homeless housing and services.
At the same time, the federal administration is signalling that it will divert funds away from states, cities and organizations that support undocumented immigrants, diversity and inclusion efforts and the transgender community. Some California homeless service providers worry that could put them at risk of losing federal dollars.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/111524_Anatomy-Of-A-Sweep-JK_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 08:56:35.940534

Maybe it was the surprise success of a book about permitting reform among liberal elites. Maybe it was just the cumulative crush of California’s unaffordability. 
Whatever the cause, 2025 was the year that California’s Democratic lawmakers finally got serious about building. 
In the summer, state lawmakers passed a law exempting most urban apartment developments from the threat of environmental litigation. A few months later, they passed a bill green-lighting apartment buildings near major public transit stops over local objections. Both bills are aimed at pushing the state to build its way out of a chronic housing shortage, both are longtime items on the “Yes in my backyard” movement’s wishlist and both were gleefully signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Other, less high-profile legislation aimed at speeding up construction also sailed through both chambers this year.
Let the era of abundant housing begin? Probably not. This year’s historic policy shift may push in that direction, but high interest rates, unpredictable tariffs and lofty labor costs are pushing in the other. Plus, it just takes a long time to build stuff.
Despite the boom year in pro-construction bills, it was a bit of a legislative bust for those seeking immediate help with the cost of housing. The legislative year didn’t offer much for existing renters. Nor did it take up a proposed bond measure meant to top-up one of the state’s affordable housing funds. Though affordable housing producers secured a long-sought-after boost in federal support from President Trump’s signature spending bill, the administration also aims to slash spending on permanent housing for the homeless. 
2026 outlook 
That all gives lawmakers plenty to pick back up in 2026. The question of whether to take the bond back up in time for the November election is likely to dominate the debate in January. YIMBYs aim to push forward more cost-cutting measures for development and tenant rights group will likely call again for tighter rent caps and tenant protections. But as Election Day nears, the appetite for controversial votes tends to wane.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/020624_No-Place-Like-Home_CC_CM_25.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 08:56:35.940534

A new law aims to help change that.,"In summary
In vitro fertilization costs thousands of dollars and is often too expensive for many people struggling to conceive. A new law aims to help change that. 


When Megan Meo, 36, and her husband decided to start a family, they knew they wanted two kids. They didn’t know they would have to endure multiple rounds of fertility treatment, causing much heartache and draining away thousands of dollars.
“It’s strange when my body isn’t working to do a thing it was made for,” Meo said. ”It hurts me at my core.”
Meo is among roughly 9 million Californians who will benefit from a new law requiring some insurers to pay for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility. On Jan. 1, large group health insurers in California — from employers with at least 100 workers — will be required to begin covering fertility preservation and in vitro fertilization services.
The law also redefines infertility in state statute, eliminating an exemption that prevented same-sex couples or single people from receiving fertility benefits.
The law does not apply to people who get their insurance through religious employers, federally regulated plans or Medi-Cal. Last month, a settlement in a class action lawsuit led by a Santa Clara couple required Aetna to extend fertility benefits to LGBTQ couples nationwide.
Advocates expect small group insurers will soon be required to offer the same coverage through a separate regulatory process that awaits federal approval. Once federal officials approve that process, most Californians with employer-sponsored health insurance should receive the benefit, said Sen. Caroline Menjivar, the law’s author and a Democrat from Van Nuys.
“I am so proud of this bill. I want this bill on my tombstone,” Menjivar said. “This impacts so many people from single people to heterosexual couples.”
Menjivar, who is lesbian, said the new law strikes a personal chord. For her to have children, she would have to rely on fertility treatments – and insurance companies have often excluded LGBTQ individuals from coverage for these services. One of her friends spent more than $20,000 on fertility treatments to have three children, she said.
“This brings into the fold a lot of people,” Menjivar said, tearing up. “I get emotional because I know these people. I know what this looked like for my friends.”
High cost prevents people from using IVF
In vitro fertilization, or IVF, commonly helps people struggling to conceive. About 9% of men and 11% of women of reproductive age struggle with infertility in the U.S. During a cycle of IVF, doctors retrieve eggs from the ovaries and fertilize them with sperm in a lab. The resultant embryos can then be transferred to the uterus.
The process, while simple sounding, can take months or even years before a successful pregnancy. It is also expensive. A 2010 survey on the cost for infertility treatment among 400 Northern California women found the average payment for one cycle of IVF was $24,000. The average cost for a successful pregnancy, which can take multiple cycles, was $61,000. Health care costs have grown since then. 
Before insurance coverage kicked in, Meo’s fertility clinic told her one round of IVF would cost between $30,000 and $39,000.
“The idea of spending $40,000 on something that might not work was really scary,” she said. She and her husband have been trying to start a family for two years. Her infertility is partially related to uterine scarring left by a previous miscarriage. Insurance coverage lessens the emotional and financial burden for them, Meo said. 
Alise Powell, director of government affairs with RESOLVE: The National Fertility Association, said cost is the No.1 barrier preventing people from accessing care. Congress has on multiple occasions shot down legislative efforts to require health insurers to cover fertility services, most recently in 2024. California is the 15th state to mandate coverage for state-regulated plans.
“Infertility is a disease and it should be covered by insurance like any other disease or ailment people have,” Powell said.
Jamie Falls, 44, has been trying to get pregnant for 11 years. She and her husband, who had an unsuccessful vasectomy reversal, took out a loan to afford the $13,000 it cost for one round of IVF in 2020. The procedure didn’t work. They’ve been saving since then to try another round. 
Insurance coverage offers some relief, Falls said, but after trying for so long it almost seems too good to be true. 
“I wouldn’t wish this journey on anybody. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through (but) I can’t picture myself not being a mom,” Falls said.
Health insurers who opposed the law before it was enacted have said it will raise overall insurance costs, pinching small businesses and people who buy individual policies.
Infertility often unexplained
Many people who struggle to conceive don’t know why they are unable to do so. Studies indicate around 30% are diagnosed with unexplained infertility. 
It’s a frustrating diagnosis, said Sarah Jolly, 39, who has been trying to conceive with her husband for five years. Tests to check her ovarian reserve, hormone levels and ensure there were no blockages came back normal. The couple even sought out a urologist who specializes in male infertility to run tests on Jolly’s husband only for everything to return clean.
The couple has tried intrauterine insemination — a process where sperm is inserted directly into the uterus while a woman is ovulating — three times without a pregnancy.
Jolly said she and her husband are keeping IVF on the table as a last resort, but she doesn’t want to go through with a procedure without knowing what it’s treating. 
Recently, after seeking out another specialist, Jolly learned that she had endometriosis, a chronic condition that can cause adhesions, scarring and inflammation around the reproductive organs. Multiple doctors had previously told Jolly endometriosis had nothing to do with her infertility, she said, but the specialist told her it was a common – and treatable – reason. 
Studies suggest between 30% to 50% of women with endometriosis are infertile, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 
Jolly said throughout this process she has felt unheard and undervalued, constantly having to advocate for more testing and more answers. Insurance also refused to pay for any of her fertility tests or appointments, but covered her husband’s visit to the urologist. 
“I’ve gotten a lot of comments societally, even from a lot of men, like ‘You should have kids. It’s the biggest privilege.’ But our society also doesn’t support women and getting the health care they need to be able to achieve that,” Jolly said. “It feels like a punch in the face that I wasn’t expecting. I really thought it would be a much more supportive process medically.”

Each year is the same in that our photographers and visual journalists spend it traversing the state to bring you those moments. 
We were on the ground in Los Angeles during the Palisades and Eaton Fires and our reporters warned of the ensuing mudslide risks. We reported on the immigration raids in the Los Angeles area and other parts of the state, as well as the deployment of the national guard and related protests.
We illustrated complex issues such as the use of AI chatbots for counseling at schools, insurance denials related to mental health and life without parole. We reported on the limits of state’s abortion protections and visited Paradise seven years after the fire to speak to young students. 
We took you inside a therapeutic preschool in San Diego serving children affected by domestic violence and into the Central Valley where migrants are avoiding health clinics out of fear of immigration raids. We traveled to Modoc County to hear from residents about Proposition 50 and followed the issue through the statewide vote.
This year also marked CalMatters’ 10th anniversary as a nonpartisan, nonprofit newsroom. Our visual essay reflected on a decade of visual journalism that has helped tell California’s stories with depth and clarity.
Whatever 2026 holds, we look forward to sharing it with you.

The Salt Lake Valley broke a record high Monday of 67 degrees and on Tuesday with 61 degrees, which surpassed the 59 degrees recorded on that date in 1933, according to the National Weather Service. On Dec. 17, the office also registered a high of 67 degrees, the warmest on record.

“We have reached 67 degrees on more than one occasion already this month in Salt Lake City,” said Alex DeSmet, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, “and that ties for the second-warmest December and also second-warmest winter temperature ever recorded.”
Monday’s minimum temperature was 59 degrees as well, DeSmet said “which broke the previous warmest overnight temperature in the winter by 7 degrees. So quite, quite significant there.”
And, the odds of having a typical snow-filled Christmas Day in the Salt Lake Valley is “basically 0%,” according to DeSmet. But, 6 to 12 inches of snow are expected on the mountains above 8,500 feet Wednesday through Thursday night.
Wednesday night through Friday night, the National Weather Service is also expecting high winds with gusts up to 50 miles per hour in western Utah and Tooele Valley, potentially impacting holiday travel, since high winds may blow dust. 
However, temperatures are expected to stop breaking records by Friday, DeSmet said.
Great Salt Lake is rising again, but it’s going to need a ‘really big’ winter to avoid concerns

The state’s ski resorts have experienced slow season beginnings, with skiers reporting soft, spring-like snow, according to ABC4. Tourists in town hoping for a powder day have also been dismayed.
The lack of snow has Utahns worried about potentially seeing worse drought levels, since about 95% of the state’s water supply comes from snowpack. Concern is especially high after a dry summer that left Great Salt Lake managers hoping for a strong winter for the basin. 
But, “there’s a lot of winter left, fortunately,” DeSmet said, and there’s time to build the snowpack on the mountains until April, which is what’s typical for the season.
While the National Weather Service estimates temperatures will remain warmer than normal through the rest of the winter, that won’t necessarily be reflected in the snowpack.
“As far as the precipitation is concerned, it’s kind of a weaker signal. It can go either way for most of the rest of the winter,” DeSmet said.

According to the KFF report, 39% of Alabama Medicaid enrollees get contraceptives at public health departments, much higher than the national average of 6%.

“In general, states in the southeastern U.S. provided contraceptive care to larger shares of female Medicaid enrollees through health departments than in other parts of the country,” the report read.
The usage of public health departments for contraceptives, the report said, is due to Alabama’s network of Title X clinics being all public health departments. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Title X clinics are federally funded family planning clinics.
The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) offers family planning services like counseling for contraceptives, pap smears for women, testing for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases and infections, according to its website. Every county has a public health department where these services are offered.
“Depending on how small the county is or the population, we might not have those services available every day in every county, but every week or every month,” Harris said.
Alabama State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said in a recent interview that public health departments help fill the gap, especially in rural areas.
“Many of our rural areas are health care deserts, and we’re one of the few providers there, along with community health centers,” Harris said. “I think those are the ones who are plugging most of the gaps.”
The county health departments are not always equipped to handle every need that comes to them, Harris said, but that is where community health centers, or federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), come in. 
According to the KFF report, 8% of Alabama Medicaid enrollees got contraceptives from community health centers in 2023. The national average for this category is 18%, according to the report. 
“Community health centers have historically served much smaller volumes of contraceptive clients, and it is estimated they would have to increase their contraceptive client caseloads by 56% to make up for the loss of Planned Parenthood clinics as a site of care for Medicaid enrollees,” the report reads. 
Those centers are operated by the federal government and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Harris said. 
Harris said he was not surprised by the make up of resources Alabama Medicaid enrollees use.
“It’s clearly a core priority for us to make sure those services are available so we have family planning programs in every county,” Harris said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Birth-control-blister-pack-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-24 08:11:41.069591

The Department of the Interior eliminated almost all the existing free-pass days listed for 2025, only keeping one of the eight designated days: Veterans Day (Nov. 11).
Instead, the Department of the Interior said that the new round of days will be “resident-only patriotic fee-free days.”
The newest line-up of fee-free days include Flag Day, June 14, which is also President Donald Trump’s birthday. It also includes former President Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday on Oct. 27.
Another change will be an increased fee system for out-of-country tourists. The fee-free days will not apply to out-of-country visitors.
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum explained the changes:
“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” Burgum said in a news release. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”
Earlier this month, a public lands group sued the Trump administration for removing a photograph of Montana’s Glacier National Park on an annual pass as it was swapped for a collage portrait of George Washington and Trump.
The Trump administration pushed back saying that the Glacier Park photograph would be used on national park passes for non-U.S. citizens, while the more common resident passes would contain Washington and Trump.

Over the last century, the business has worn a number of hats: restaurant, gas station, post office, gift shop. The store also boasts a claim to fame most Mississippians are familiar with.

Just down the road, in 1902, then-president Theodore Roosevelt ventured on a bear hunt with Holt Collier, an esteemed marksman and former slave. After the president had little to show for the outing, Collier cornered a bear to give Roosevelt an easy shot. But, as the legend goes, Roosevelt considered the maneuver “unsportsmanlike,” and instead let the bear run free. News of the trip reached a toymaker in New York, and the popular Teddy Bear spread from there. 
Bowden retired in 2021 from her job of nearly 20 years, teaching theater to middle and high schoolers in Maryland. When the COVID-19 pandemic shrunk her usual classroom into a computer screen, her joy quickly faded, she said. 
She originally moved to Mississippi in 2023 to take care of the 320-acre farm her great grandfather bought years and years ago, located just south of Mayersville in the south Delta – or, as she described, “in the middle of nowhere.” 
But about a year later, Bowden drove past the Onward Store and saw a “for sale” sign posted outside. Right there and then, she found her new calling. 
In a rural area with scant economic growth and where it can take hours of driving to find groceries, the store is much more than a historical maker. It’s a nexus for locals and travelers to refresh, replenish and reunite.

Even more crucial for Bowden, reviving the business – which has been closed since January, 2024 – means reconnecting herself with a community her family left its mark on. 
On the same farm where her mother, aunts and uncles grew up, her grandfather, Henry Sias, hosted Civil Rights icons Fannie Lou Hamer and Stokely Carmichael, Bowden said. Sias also headed the local “colored” school. Her family, she added, took part in the 1960s Freedom Rides, and even joined Hamer when she gave her famous speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Bowden’s cousin, she said, had to drive Hamer around because she couldn’t drive herself. 
“That’s part of my family history as far as I’m concerned,” she said.   
While it wasn’t the case when her family bought the property, the land is now one of the few Black-owned farms in the heavily agricultural area, Bowden added. 
The journey to reopen the Onward Store hasn’t been cheap. Even with the help of a couple of loans, buying and renovating the shop, including tearing up rotted floors, have drained her entire savings.
“I would say that I’ve bet my future on this store,” said Bowden, now 62.

Unsure how soon she’ll have her full vision of the store ready, Bowden is hoping to at least have the deli open by the end of 2025. There, she plans to serve a variety of lunch staples, especially local classics: hoop cheese, crawfish salad, egg salad, bologna salad, hogshead cheese and pimento loaf. 
But she also wants to transform the Onward Store, which she said had become somewhat of a tourist trap over the years, into something new. Bowden wants to add books and photographs showcasing the local blues culture, for instance. After all, she said, Muddy Waters grew up just around the corner. 
And in addition to selling hunting supplies and retro toys – yes, including the Teddy Bear – Bowden wants the Onward Store to serve as a vehicle for local goods, like vegetables and crafts. In an area with few jobs, she hopes her investment in the space can encourage and support other local business owners. 
Since she started repairs on the store a few months ago, visitors have constantly walked in, hoping it was finally open. Not yet, Bowden would tell them, but she would take their phone number down to let them know when it’s time to return. 
“ The community really wants to see it happen, and I want to make it happen for them,” she said. “Ever since I first started looking at this place, it’s been like a mission, and I think of it as my sacred duty to have this place where people can gather and have good food and conversation and everything. That is important.”

While it’s taken some acclimating to the rural lifestyle, Bowden said she’s found her happiness in Mississippi that went away during the pandemic. 
“We (up North) have some pretty bad opinions about (Mississippi), some of them are real, but a lot of them are not,” she said. “Beyond the notorious things about here, there is absolute beauty. I have found peace since I’ve been down here living on the family farm. That has been awesome.
“I can go out on my porch and look up in the sky and see the Milky Way at night. I could never do that in Washington, D.C. There’s such beauty here and there’s peace and there’s some good people here.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/28040314/Onward-Store-1.jpg,,,2025-12-24 08:11:41.069591

Republicans have lost all of them.
Yes, Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei was reelected every time over those years. But this is a look at competitive federal races. The Nevada 2nd congressional district Amodei represents is so safely red the Democrats didn’t even bother to run a candidate against him last year.
Nevada’s 1st congressional district, home of the fabulous Las Vegas Strip, was the mirror opposite of CD2 in 2016, 2018, and 2020, when Nevada Democratic Rep. Dina Titus easily defeated what amounted to token opposition.
But in 2022 and 2024, after Democratic legislators redistricted CD1 to buck up Democratic strength in CD3 and CD4, Titus’ district became competitive as well.
Upshot: In the last five campaign cycles from 2016 through 2024, there have been 16 competitive federal races,  four for the U.S. Senate (in 2016, 2018, 2022, and 2024) and a dozen for U.S. House seats. Republicans lost all of them.

 
One of the most formidable of those losing Republican candidates was Joe Heck, a three-term member of the U.S. House who ran against a former Nevada attorney general, Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, to succeed U.S. Sen. Harry Reid in 2016.
Heck had endorsed, if only perfunctorily, his party’s nominee for president that year, Trump. After the Access Hollywood tape, Heck, like many Republicans, recoiled in disgust, and he unendorsed Trump. It then appeared that Trump’s base was rejecting Heck because Heck had rejected Trump. Late in the campaign Heck started going wobbly on his un-endorsement of Trump, and wouldn’t say who he was voting for. In the end, Heck and Trump both lost Nevada.
Perhaps the most dramatic of all the Trump-era Republican losses for federal office in Nevada came two years later in 2018. Early in Trump’s first term, when Trump was trying to repeal Obamacare, Nevada Republican U.S. Sen. Dean Heller balked, then dithered. That led to Trump publicly humiliating him. Heller began sucking up to Trump, and voted for a so-called “skinny repeal” of Obamacare after all. And that in turn led to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen running ads casting Heller as an inflatable tube man blowing whichever way the wind took him (one of the best political ads of 21st century Nevada, by the way). 
Over the years, the more Trump has consolidated his command and control of the Republican Party nationally and in Nevada, the weaker and less accomplished have been the Republican candidates for federal office in the state.
And in all the competitive races for federal office that Republicans have lost, Nevada Democrats have tied those Republicans to Trump early and often.
Because it works. Nevada Democrats have a pristine track record spanning the last five campaign cycles to prove it.
Past performance, future results, etc.
An NPR/Newshour/Marist poll released last week found Trump’s approval rating on the economy is 36%, the lowest that particular poll has ever found in either of his madcap occupations of the White House. 
And that’s actually better, for Trump, than an AP/NORC poll earlier this month that found only 31% of respondents approve of his handling of the economy, similarly an all-time low for that poll. 
Those two polls echo a slew of other polls lately that find majorities of voters having roughly the same opinion of Trump that South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed on the Senate floor in the wee hours of January 7, 2021: “Count me out. Enough is enough.”
Starting with  the 2016 campaign cycle, Trump’s first, Democratic candidates for federal office have benefited greatly not only by the offensiveness of Trump’s general Trumpyness. They’ve also successfully run against him, er, Nevada Republican candidates, by focusing on issues where Trump has polled poorly, usually health care.
In 2026, they’ll have health care again, as well as the infuriating cost of living. They’ll be counting on the electorate’s dissatisfaction with Trump to do much of their work for them, allowing them to navigate their way to victories running as the lesser of two evils. 
This year, Nevada Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate have responded to the threat posed by Trump’s assaults on democracy, the Constitution, and the rule of law mostly by hunkering down in mushy centrism and saying “bipartisan” a lot. That suggests the Democratic campaign playbook in 2026 will be much the same as it’s been for the last decade: try not to offend anyone (including of course donors), play it safe, and let their Republican opponents sink under the weight of the Trump’s endorsements.
In other words, Nevada Democrats, and their fellow Democrats running for Congress nationwide, might win an election about the economy in 2026 while saying nothing particularly significant about the economy except that Trump blew it. 
By letting the electorate’s dissatisfaction with Trump do their work for them, Democrats would yet again be absolving themselves of confronting a warped marketplace and K-shaped economy that, over decades and thanks in very large part to to all that aforementioned bipartisanship, has grown more unapologetically harsh and unforgivingly predatory.
In thrall to centrism, Democrats seem to believe a normalcy of some sort will eventually be restored, so their most prudent course is cautious incrementalism, despite its failure in 2024 to to energize portions of a hitherto reliable base and a Democratic Party approval rating “lower than the Dead Sea.”
And in that string of Nevada Democratic victories in federal races since Trump came down his escalator, some of those victories have been by only the slimmest of margins over patently weak Republican candidates.
What might be Democratic wishful thinking notwithstanding, the forces that coughed up Trump and Trumpism aren’t going away any time soon. The more Democrats stiff-arm ambitious reforms, the more risk that voters will embrace the wild-eyed right, or just stop voting, and the more fragile the republic’s defense against authoritarian lawlessness.
Trump may sink Republican congressional candidates in Nevada yet again in 2026. But in addition to pointing at something obvious for voters to be against, Democrats have an opportunity, even an obligation, to articulate meaningful systemic change that voters can be for.
If past performance is any indication of future results, they’ll take a pass.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/trump-in-minden-campaign-video.jpg,,,2025-12-24 08:11:41.069591

Wes Moore signed an executive order protecting gender-affirming care in Maryland on June 5, 2023. (Photo courtesy the Governor's Office)Maryland joined 18 states and the District of Columbia Tuesday in a lawsuit challenging a Health and Human Services declaration last week that health care facilities offering gender-affirming care to minors would be barred from Medicare and Medicaid.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Oregon, claims that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. exceeded his authority with the Dec. 18 declaration, which would “effectively ban, by fiat, an entire caregory of healthcare.” It also failed to follow proper procedures for promulgating new rules, would  interfere with states’ rights to run their Medicaid programs and regulate health care and deny care to youth that need it.
“Healthcare decisions should be made by doctors and patients – not by politicians in Washington threatening to destroy providers’ careers and spreading fear among transgender youth and their families,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement late Tuesday night.
“This isn’t just about following the law – though HHS is clearly violating it. This is about protecting vulnerable young people who deserve the same dignity, respect, and access to medical care as anyone else,” Brown’s statement said.
For many of the 20 Democrat-led jurisdictions on Tuesday’s lawsuit, like Maryland, it was the second day in a row they had gone to an Oregon federal court to challenge Trump administration policy: A total of 22 jurisdictions sued Monday in an attempt to block the administration’s attempt to defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Brown compiles ‘voluminous’ record of legal challenges to Trump administration policies

Many of the states are now veterans of lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his administration. For Brown, this week’s lawsuits were the 47th and 48th against the administration and its policies since January, when Trump returned to office.
The latest lawsuit is a response to Kennedy’s declaration on the “Safety, Effectiveness, and Professional Standards of Care for Sex-Rejecting Procedures on Children and Adolescents.” That document declared that health care facilities would be barred from participating in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs if they provided gender-affirming care — including puberty blockers, hormonal treatments or surgery — to anyone under age 18.
Part of the declaration states that the methods “for children and adolescents are neither safe nor effective as a treatment modality for gender dysphoria, gender incongruence, or other related disorders in minors.” The declaration also says it supersedes “statewide or national standards of care.”
In a news release with the announcement, Kennedy said it was made in line with Trump’s Jan. 28 executive order “protecting children from chemical and surgical mutilation.” The release also notes that the Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to 12 manufacturers and retailers it says are marketing breast binders to children for treatment of gender dysphoria, and that HHS’ Office for Civil Rights is working to reverse a Biden administration policy that categorized gender dysphoria as a disability.
Tuesday’s suit claims that Kennedy’s declaration would negatively impact transgender youth, affect thousands of hospitals that offer Medicare and Medicaid programs and harm medical profession that provide necessary health care.
“The Kennedy Declaration also purports to establish a standard of care and supersede other standards of care, despite the Medicare statute’s clear prohibition against any Federal interference,” according to the suit.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The 41-page suit also discusses policies and protections for transgender youth in each of the state suing. In Maryland, it noted, the Trans Health Equity Act became law in 2023, stating that the state’s Medicaid program “shall” cover gender-affirming care that grants lower-income residents access to those procedures. The law also ensures the state provides the care with or without federal funding.
The state Department of Health reports that in 2024, Maryland Medicaid spent $1.7 million to fund more than 1,600 unique office visits for gender-affirming care services. That figure currently includes about $900,000 in federal funding.
“We’re standing up against this cruel and unlawful action because every Marylander, regardless of who they are, deserves compassionate, evidence-based healthcare from providers who won’t be punished for doing what’s right,” Brown said in his statement.
Besides the District and Maryland, other states in Tuesday’s suit include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvanis, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/moore_genderaffirmingcare_execorder-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-24 07:57:46.854950

Scott’s silence fuels immigration chaos — and harms Vermonters.","This commentary is by Jill Martin Diaz, executive director of Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, director of Legal Services for Connecting Cultures/New England Survivors of Torture and Trauma and a lecturer in the University of Vermont’s social work department.



This Thanksgiving, President Trump had us primed to panic when news broke of a Winooski second grader’s violent detention by ICE.
Vermont Asylum Assistance Project (VAAP) advocates were already being inundated with new calls for legal help when tragedy struck, following Trump’s latest half-baked and blatantly illegal policy pronouncements suspending asylum, threatening extrajudicial residency revocations, and promising retraumatizing re-processing for already highly vetted refugees.

Governor Scott could have coordinated Vermont’s first response. Instead, state silence and community chaos ensued. Unsure of who to call, neighbors inundated VAAP and partners until corrective coordination precluded meaningful legal intervention. Media requests jammed channels to a halt. Attorneys scrambled. ICE benefited.
This is a pattern. Misleading United States Citizenship and Immigration Services notices pushed two students to announce their self-deportation before consulting counsel. Scott’s silence invited manufactured chaos and, again, civil society gridlock ensued.
This year brought baseless threats to birthright citizenship; status revocations threatening work permits overnight; skyrocketing filing fees pricing working people out of status renewals; and lightspeed procedural shifts obscuring process due. 
Trump knows many policies won’t survive judicial review. That’s not careless error — it’s strategy: sow chaos that states worsen into legal access gridlock and lasting fear.
In a rare written statement, Scott called it “reasonable and prudent” for Trump to investigate immigration “security concerns or vulnerabilities” after a lone Afghan national’s gun violence. In doing so, he validated Trump’s spurious premise that one person’s actions can implicate entire classes of people. Settled law rejects collective suspicion based on race, religion or nationality. Trump’s policymaking isn’t reasonable or prudent — it’s enforcement theater and unlawful discrimination that Scott just affirmed.
Scott further described gun violence as “inexplicable.” But it is also well-settled social science, recognized by Vermont law, that what drives violence is trauma. Hurt people hurt people. A federal trauma campaign does not ameliorate security concerns. It compounds community harm.
Scott’s acquiescence — and more often, his silence — worsened legal access for the roughly 850 noncitizens held in Department of Corrections (DOC) custody on ICE detainers this year.
The DOC has a documented pattern of repeatedly disrupting pro bono legal access: protracted, ultimately fruitless operations negotiations; withheld practice policies, contradictory guidance, and rule changes mid-clinic; inconsistent meeting space for confidential client interviews; excluded interpreter and paralegal volunteers; and barred language access devices.
Most recently, DOC filed a bad-faith professional responsibility complaint against an attorney who hired a paid interpreter related to their detained client, diverting her time and attention away from client-focused deportation defense.
Vermont rejected Trump by the widest margin but went on to exacerbate lawyer scarcity and hand ICE senseless victories in the vain hope of limiting fiscal fallout. But look at Vermont’s Congressional Delegation, many of our agency leaders, our history: no amount of SNAP data divulgence, “sanctuary” wordsmithing, or civil society obstruction will hide the bluest state from Trump’s violence.
Scott’s silence and acquiescence are also violence. For 2026, it’s time for a new, proactive strategy.
In the first eight weeks of our first Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund (VILDF) grant, VAAP screened 43 detained people over six legal visits to Northwest State and Chittenden Regional facilities. Timely legal interventions secured decisive judicial orders checking ICE overreach and securing client safety. We restored access to basic health and safety for medically vulnerable detainees. We secured virtual hearing access and prevented “failure to appear” removal orders when DOC could not or would not bring detainees to court. We helped people walk free to fight their removal cases from home.
VAAP was ready to ramp up detention defense back in May, buoyed by donations, state House success and the Vermont Lawyers’ March. But Scott’s DOC obstructed efforts, delayed implementation and perpetuated ICE transfer churn, needlessly increasing self-deportation pressure for hundreds of detained people.
Vermont is not acting in “the best interest of those detained” by undermining legal access, nor by selectively condemning policies targeting “vetted” Afghan “friends and neighbors” while staying silent as Haitian and Venezuelan Vermonters lose Temporary Protected Status, Somali Vermonters face racist attacks, and a Latine second grader disappears to Texas.
Vermont must stop treating human rights and due process as anything other than constitutional guarantees. Legal access to enforce those guarantees do more than mitigate irreparable harm to individuals; they hold the line on rule of law and secure decisive checks on Executive overreach.
The Mahdawi and Öztürk cases exposed how Trump’s ICE can circumvent courts and undermine state sovereignty. Public scrutiny cultivated VAAP-supported wins for Nacho and Heidi, Mohammed, Esther, Nafiou, Vilma, Alexi, Jose, Max, and others, detained people who asserted their rights in court and preserved the rule of law for all.
We celebrate these victories and mourn what we lost. Vermont could have done more, sooner, if Scott had delivered the Vermont Constitution’s Art. 7 promise of instituting state government for the “common benefit,” rather than for the “advantage of any single person” or “sets of persons.”
In 2026, Vermont needs systemic solutions for systemic problems.
Governor Scott can lead proactive myth-busting, coordinated legal referral pathways, operational DOC legal access agreements and protocols to ensure effective—not chaotic—first response. Lawmakers can advance VAAP’s legislative recommendations. Agencies can document barriers through the Act 29 Study—rather than relying on media coverage alone.
We, the people, can demand accountability from state leaders. There are no rights without remedies, and no remedies in gridlock.
We can and will take care of ourselves and each other, Vermont. Remember: there is no justice. There is just us.

(Photo by Daniella Heminghaus/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s steep decline in medical marijuana patients continued with another 20% drop since the beginning of 2025. 
Between January and December, roughly 14,000 people let their medical marijuana registration lapse, a trend that has continued since the recreational market launched in April 2022.  
As of mid-December, 51,776 people are registered medical marijuana patients, according to the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission. In June 2022, that figure was nearly 130,000.
Medical marijuana cardholders get some benefits. Dispensaries hold patient-only hours, give patients special parking, and let them skip ahead of recreational users in line. Patients also avoid paying cannabis taxes and can purchase up to 3 ounces of cannabis per day. Before the recreational market opened, patients were the only New Jerseyans who could legally buy marijuana. 
In recent years, officials have attempted to attract people back to the medical program by dropping the price of a registration card from $200 to $10 (there’s also a free digital option). People must also obtain a card from doctors who qualify to write medical cannabis prescriptions for treatment of conditions like epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, cancer, and more. 
The drop in enrollment has reflected the trends other states have seen when launching adult-use weed. But most other states allow people to grow their own marijuana at home, particularly medical marijuana users, while New Jersey still fully bans it.

Manger scenes displayed around Christmastime usually feature an ox and an ass beside the infant Jesus. According to the Gospel of Luke, Mary placed her child in a manger – an animal feeding bin – “because there was no room for them in the inn.”
No mere babysitters, the ox and ass harken back to the Book of Isaiah 1:3, a verse early Christians interpreted as a prophecy of the birth of Christ. In some early artwork, these beasts of burden kneel to show their reverence – recognizing this swaddled babe, who entered the world in humble circumstances, as lordly.
The canonical Gospels, the accounts of Jesus’ life included in the Bible’s New Testament, make no mention of those animals welcoming the newborn. Yet the motif was already seen in art from the fourth century. It was further popularized by the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, an apocryphal text – that is, one not included in the canon of Scripture. Pseudo-Matthew was composed by an anonymous monk, probably in the seventh century, and includes many tales about Jesus growing up.
After its account of Jesus’ birth, the Bible is almost entirely silent on his childhood. Yet legends about Jesus’ early years circulated widely in the Middle Ages – the focus of my 2017 book. While the detail of the ox and ass is quite familiar to many Christians today, few are aware of the other striking tales transmitted by the apocrypha.
 Wonder-worker


‘Christ Discovered in the Temple,’ by Simone Martini (1342). Google Cultural Institute/Walker Art Gallery via Wikimedia Commons

The Bible does include one famous scene from Jesus’ youth: the incident when 12-year-old Jesus stayed behind at the Jewish temple in Jerusalem, unbeknownst to his parents. Searching for him with great anxiety, they find him conversing with religious teachers, both asking questions and astounding them with his answers. Fourteenth-century painter Simone Martini’s “Christ Discovered in the Temple” portrays him standing before his parents with crossed arms – a stubborn youth, apparently unapologetic about making them worry for days.
The apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew – especially versions that incorporate material from an even earlier apocryphal gospel, the Infancy Gospel of Thomas – focuses on the years of Jesus’ childhood. Like the temple story, they show the boy Jesus as sometimes difficult and having preternatural wisdom that amazes and even offends his would-be teachers. More dramatically, the apocryphal legends depict Jesus exercising divine power from a very young age.

Like the adult Jesus of the New Testament, this apocryphal Christ child often works wonders to help others in need. According to the biblical Gospel of Matthew, Mary and Joseph take the infant Jesus to Egypt after an angel warns in a dream that Herod, King of Judea, would kill the child. In Pseudo-Matthew’s elaboration of this episode, we see Jesus, not yet 2 years old, bravely stand on his feet before dragons emanating from a cave, where his family has stopped to rest.
The terrifying dragons worship him and then depart, while Jesus boldly assures those around him that he is the “perfect man” and can “tame every kind of wild beast.” He later commands a palm tree to bend down so that a weary Mary can partake of its fruits, and he miraculously shortens their journey in the desert.
At times, the Jesus of these legends is largely to blame for the troubles around him. The 14th-century Tring Tiles, now in the British Museum, depict one of Jesus’ friends imprisoned by his father in a tower. Christ pulls him out of a tiny hole, like a gallant medieval knight rescuing a maiden in distress. The father had tried to insulate his son from Jesus’ influence – understandable, considering that many legends show Jesus causing the death of his playmates or other boys who somehow irked him.
In a story summarized by one scholar as “death for a bump,” a boy runs into Jesus. He curses the child, who instantly drops down dead – though Jesus brings him back to life after a brief reprimand from Joseph.

In another tale, included in an Anglo-Norman narrative that survives in an illustrated manuscript, Jesus takes off his coat, places it upon a sunbeam and sits upon it. When the other children see this, they “thought they would do the same …. But they were too eager, and they all fell down at once. One and another jumped up quickly onto the sunbeam, but it turned out badly for them, since each one broke his neck.” Jesus heals the boys at his parents’ prompting.
Joseph admits to his neighbors that Jesus “was indeed too wild” and sends him away. The 7-year-old Jesus becomes apprenticed to a dyer, who gives him very precise directions about dyeing three pieces of cloth in three different vats. Once his master has left, Jesus ignores his instructions, throwing all the cloth into one vat – yet still achieves the desired outcome. When the master returns, he at first thinks he has been “ruined by this little rascal,” but then realizes that a wonder has occurred.

 Bond with animals

These apocryphal legends also show the boy Jesus having power over the animal world. When he enters a dreaded lion’s cave, cubs “ran about around his feet, fawning and playing with him,” while “the older lions … stood at a distance and worshipped him, and wagged their tails before him.” Jesus tells bystanders that the beasts are better than they are, because the animals “recognize and glorify their Lord.”
Indeed, these tales characterize Jesus as a rather haughty boy, conscious of his divinity and not happy with those who treat him as a mere child. At the same time, they depict him as a real child who likes to play. The boy Jesus is childlike in the way he often acts on impulse, not paying much attention to the admonitions of his elders.

His affinity for animals, too, makes him seem childlike. Strikingly, beasts in the apocrypha, beginning with the ox and ass, often seem to realize that Jesus is no ordinary child before human characters do.
The legends’ insidious insinuation that many of the Jews around Jesus were not as perceptive as the animals is part of medieval Europe’s widespread antisemitism. In one fifth-century sermon, Quodvultdeus, the bishop of Carthage, asks why the animals’ recognition of Jesus in the manger was not a sufficient sign for the Jews.

In the Bible, Jesus works his first miracle as an adult, at a wedding feast in Cana. The apocryphal tales, however, toy with the idea of the God-man revealing his power early on. The legends suggest that the childishness of Christ distracted many of those around him, preventing them from concluding that he was the Messiah. This allows the apocrypha to avoid contradicting the Bible’s reference to Jesus as simply “the carpenter’s son,” the opposite of a wonder child.
Each Christmas, modern Christians in the Western world tend to celebrate Jesus’ birthday, then quickly drop the theme of the Christ child. Medieval Christians, in contrast, were fascinated by tales about the Son of God growing up. Despite acting as a dragon tamer, physician and magician, the young Jesus of the apocrypha largely flies under the radar, cloaking his divinity with “little rascal” boyishness.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)2025 was the year that Minnesota was on the national stage for all the wrong reasons: political assassinations, a school shooting, massive fraud in public programs, the political scapegoating of Somali immigrants.
I was on the ground at several standoffs between protesters and federal immigration agents, documenting arrests and the cops’ use of force against demonstrators. (A first for me in 2025: dealing with pepper spray on the job!)
One raid, at Bro-Tex in St. Paul, wasn’t far from my home. After the agents and protesters dispersed, Nicole Neri and I decided to return to my house to file our story and photos, pepper spray still lingering on our clothes. Nicole, who has much more experience with protest coverage than I do, walked me through the process of cleaning irritants off of clothes and skin. 
Take off your outer layer of clothing before entering the home to avoid triggering your wife’s asthma. Throw everything straight into the washing machine — yes, even your coat. Wash your face, then take a shower with cold water as soon as you can — this will probably cause you to cough and gag, but it’s important. Eat once your stomach settles.
I expect to get this process down to a science in 2026, because the pushback to the Trump administration’s immigration agenda is showing no signs of slowing down.
Immigration has been front and center for me recently, but it’s just one of many impacts of the Trump administration I’ve covered this year. Here are some of the other themes from my reporting this year. 
Hunger and the government shutdown
A record-breaking federal government shutdown delayed food assistance to thousands of Minnesotans who depend on it to feed themselves and their families. 
The state pitched in $4 million to food shelves to help them meet the need, but it was a drop in the bucket. When I was visiting a food shelf in St. Paul in early November, volunteers turned away people in need for the first time.
The shutdown highlighted the importance of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is facing cuts in coming years because of the Republican mega-law passed by Congress over the summer. 
The 2026 U.S. Senate race
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith announced early this year that she will not seek re-election when her term ends, setting off a Democratic primary that will be a national signal for Democrats seeking to map out the party’s future following the disaster at the top of the ticket in 2024. 
I profiled Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig, who offer two distinct paths for the party. Flanagan is presenting herself as a candidate with a strong ideological backbone who is willing to take on Republicans and corporations head-on. Craig to replicate her success in the 2nd District by being more of a bridge-builder and win back voters who are put off by polarization in Congress. 
A consequential legislative session
Michelle Griffith is our point person at the Capitol, but I followed a handful of important issues through the session. 
Bipartisan negotiations resulted in cuts to health care programs; the repeal of MinnesotaCare eligibility for undocumented people; and a budget that took steps towards resolving a future deficit. 
Next session is unlikely to be quite as dramatic, though the speaker of the House is running for governor.

WESTON — In the New England state that grows the most Christmas trees, the Vermont Country Store offers a seeming galaxy of ornaments and add-ons, from floor-hugging skirts to ceiling-grazing stars.
“Evergreen trees are a universal symbol of the season,” the third generation of Orton family storekeepers writes on its website.
So why has the $100 million-a-year business seen a 2-foot-tall boxed alternative become a surprise bestseller?
“When things in the world seem a little chaotic, it brings back great memories and puts a smile on your face,” merchandising manager Julie Noyes said of the Charlie Brown Christmas Tree, which debuted six decades ago and has drawn new interest from people starting up or downsizing in a chilly economy.
When Charles Schulz introduced “Peanuts” 75 years ago, the late cartoonist didn’t envision the comic strip would lead to global syndication and a series of television specials, beginning with 1965’s “A Charlie Brown Christmas.”
In that show, the title character searches for the perfect Christmas tree, only to come home with a straggly sapling.
“Gee, do they still make wooden Christmas trees?” his friend Linus asks. “Maybe it just needs a little love.”
And with the addition of a blanket around its base, the conifer is soon warming hearts.
Sixty years later, $21.95 official replicas can be found at Vermont Country Stores in Weston and Rockingham, in their mail-order catalog and on their website — and in customer homes from Connecticut to California.
“It’s precious, just precious,” Jill Charbonneau said in a call from the Rockport, Maine, home she and her husband, Paul, have shared for a half-century. “It’s so simple and says everything it’s supposed to say.”
She’s not alone in her appreciation. The tree has an average customer rating of 4.9 out of 5, according to its webpage, with nearly 100 rave reviews about its simple cost, scale and upkeep from people coast to coast.
Take the Illinois couple settling into their first home. The traveling nurse on the road. The Colorado widow living alone. The Florida shopper rebuilding after a hurricane. All agree with the comment from the North Carolina woman facing mobility issues: “This little tree is my solution.” 
“It’s neat to have an old memory right in front of ya,” a Texas man adds in his review. “Takes me back to a time when life seemed so easy.”
The Vermont Country Store, with 450 year-round workers, almost doubles its staff each December to maintain its retail shops, Manchester offices and Clarendon distribution center during the busy holiday season, Noyes says. But the merchandising manager won’t specify how many Charlie Brown Christmas Trees are sold.
“Lots,” she says. “Lots and lots.”
All embodying something small and simple.
“Less is more,” one California reviewer summed up the tree. “It is a little ray of hope.”

Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway has cast news that she is being sued by the Chinese government as a badge of honor, pointing to the lawsuit as proof that her aggressive push to collect on a roughly $25 billion court judgment tied to the COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact.
But experts in international law say the lawsuit, filed in China earlier this year and announced last week by Hanaway, is more likely to do the opposite — making an already remote chance that Missouri will ever collect that money even slimmer, while potentially exposing U.S. assets abroad to retaliation.
Hanaway said last week in a news release that China is demanding a public apology from the state in a complaint filed in the Intermediate People’s Court of Wuhan, along with damages equivalent to $50.5 billion, legal fees and the right to seek additional compensation.
“This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,” Hanaway said.
The suit was filed after Missouri secured a default judgment earlier this year in a federal case alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic. A judge ruled for Missouri after China declined to participate in the trial, awarding the state roughly $25 billion in damages.
Hanaway has since asked the U.S. State Department to notify China that Missouri intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgment. Her office is also assembling a list of Chinese properties that could be targeted, focusing on assets owned outright by the Chinese government or by companies in which it has a stake.
Legal scholars say those efforts face steep, and likely insurmountable, obstacles.
Chimène Keitner, director of the U.C. Davis Center for International Law & Policy, said government-owned property is generally protected by sovereign immunity — meaning Chinese government assets in the United States are shielded from seizure, just as U.S. government property is protected abroad.
China’s countersuit, she said, also appears unlikely to result in any recovery. But it carries legal and diplomatic implications that could further complicate Missouri’s case.
International law recognizes a doctrine known as “countermeasures,” Keitner said, which allows a country to take actions it otherwise could not as a way of pressuring another country to comply with international law.
If the U.S. government were to authorize Missouri’s efforts to seize Chinese assets, she said, it could expose American property in China to reciprocal action.
“So if Missouri violates China’s sovereign immunity,” Keitner said, “China could have a good argument for doing the same thing — not just against Missouri, but against the United States as a whole.”
Missouri wants to seize Chinese assets to recover $24 billion judgment in COVID case

William Dodge, a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in international law, said neither lawsuit “has a prayer of being enforced.”
Even if Missouri were allowed to pursue assets, Dodge said, the scope would be narrow. Only property owned by the defendants named in the lawsuit — including the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China, several national agencies, provincial and local governments around Wuhan and the Wuhan Institute of Virology — could potentially be targeted.
And the state would still have to show that those specific entities were involved in hoarding personal protective equipment, he said.
Dodge agreed that China’s lawsuit further reduces the already slim likelihood that Missouri will be able to collect because it raises the risk of retaliation.
“China’s law has a reciprocity provision,” he said. “It basically says that if a foreign country gives China less immunity than Chinese law provides, China can respond by giving that foreign country less immunity. In other words: whatever the U.S. does to us, we can do to them.”
U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh initially dismissed Missouri’s lawsuit in 2022, ruling that the state could not sue China. An appeals court later allowed one claim to proceed — the allegation that China hoarded items such as respirator masks, medical gowns and gloves.
After Chinese officials failed to respond, Limbaugh accepted Missouri’s estimate of past and future damages of more than $8 billion, tripled it as federal law allows, and added 3.91% interest until the judgment is paid.
In an emailed statement last month, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said China’s pandemic response involved “acts of national sovereignty” that are not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.
China will not pay, Liu said, and “will retaliate if necessary.”
The lawsuit filed in China accuses Missouri of “fabricating enormous disinformation” and spreading “stigmatizing and discriminating slanders” that it says have damaged China’s reputation.
Hanaway scoffed at China’s criticism.
“We stand undeterred in our mission to collect on our $24 billion judgment that was lawfully handed down in federal court,” she said.
Neither side’s claims are likely to result in any tangible recovery, Keitner said, leaving the dispute largely symbolic.
“Unfortunately, this all seems to be a lot of unhelpful political theater,” she said, “with no clear off-ramp for either side to save face.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54921771475_e3916f919a_c.jpg,,,2025-12-24 06:57:54.242719

The Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations announced that the minimum wage is set to increase by $1.25 beginning in 2026. The minimum wage rate will be in effect for all non-exempt employers.
Missouri’s HB 567, signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe into law on July 10, repealed statewide earned paid sick time while simultaneously modifying the state’s minimum wage law.
It eliminated the automatic inflation adjustments that were set to begin in 2027 and kept the $15 per hour rate for public employers. However, it is also removing voter-approved worker protections for businesses as of Aug. 28.
Lily Roberts is the managing director of economic policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan economic policy institute. She said conversations about adjusting the minimum wage reflect rising prices that have increased in recent years.
“Everybody can tell you about inflation, and everybody can tell you about the cost of rent or groceries or childcare being really expensive, but the flip side of that is wages,” Roberts said. “There are many folks who are worse off and less able to keep up with those raising prices because a major pillar of how we make wage policy hasn’t been changed since 2009.”
The federal minimum wage is $7.25 and it hasn’t been adjusted since 2009, which Roberts said is the longest it’s gone unchanged since the introduction of minimum wage in 1938.
“$7.25 is so unbelievably low that many people don’t even believe that it’s still that low,” Roberts said.
In Missouri, employers who are involved in retail or service businesses and have an annual gross income less than $500,000 are exempt from having to pay the state minimum wage rate. Instead, those employers can pay their workers any wage at their discretion, according to the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.
Roberts said Missouri is unique in the fact that it raised its minimum wage to reflect inflation numbers, but when the state implements a $15 an hour minimum wage, it is no longer required to factor in inflation.
Between 2015 and 2019, Missouri’s minimum wage rose just under a dollar, from $7.65 to $8.60. Since 2019, the increase has been at least $0.75 annually every year except for 2023. The $1.25 jump will be the second straight year that the minimum wage has increased by more than a dollar.
Missouri is one of 34 U.S. states, territories and districts that has a higher minimum wage than the federal requirement.
Roberts said Missouri is in line with nearby states, such as South Dakota, Nebraska and Arkansas. All of those states, plus Missouri, have consistently been working on increasing their respective minimum wages.
“Some of them are doing it gradually over time to get to ($15 an hour) and others are passing individual laws,” Roberts said. “These longer-term predictable changes are really the trend right now, where you give businesses and employees a sense of how their wages will grow over time, and it means that it’s easier to predict and easier for employers to budget for.”
She said business owners are often fighting for higher wages, contrary to popular belief, because they need to be able to compete.
“The higher your wages that you pay, in general, the lower your turnover is,” Roberts said. “So businesses that pay really small dollars tend to have a lot of turnover. It actually gets really counterproductive and expensive very quickly because the business owner has to spend all of their time hiring, training and trying to retain folks.”

A judge ruled Tuesday that 37 untabulated ballots in Hamtramck’s disputed municipal election should not be counted, affirming Adam Alharbi’s controversial and narrow victory in the race for mayor.
However, the decision is likely only the starting gun for a legal race against the clock before the city’s new mayor is sworn in at the beginning of January.
In her written decision Tuesday, Judge Patricia Perez Fresard of the Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan said that the Wayne County Board of Canvassers “exercised its discretion” when declining to count the 37 ballots after the city clerk “failed to comply with mandatory requirements imposed to protect the integrity of ballots.”
Fresard had initially ordered the parties to meet to see if they could come to a resolution. That failed, attorneys said, leading to just over 20 minutes of courtroom debate Tuesday, primarily between lawyers for Alharbi and his opponent in the mayoral race, City Council member Muhith Mahmood, who finished 11 votes behind.
Mark Brewer, representing Mahmood as well as the 37 disenfranchised voters, said that to not count the votes would be to violate a number of election-related constitutional protections. Nabih Ayad, representing Alharbi, argued that there was “absolutely no viable path” to count the ballots, and that doing so would effectively disenfranchise other voters.
“The arguments of both counsel are that the court should protect voter rights,” Fresard said Tuesday morning at the end of the hearing. “In some circumstances, it’s very difficult to protect the rights of every single individual voter.”
The dispute has brought weeks of uncertainty to Hamtramck and its nearly 28,000 residents. It all started when, due to human error, 37 absentee ballots were left in their envelopes and went uncounted on election night. Election officials discovered them a few days later and immediately delivered them to Wayne County officials.
But at some point between the end of election night and when the ballots were discovered, a number of unauthorized city officials had walked into the office where the ballots had been, breaking the chain of custody. That led county officials to question whether they should be counted, and the Wayne County Board of Canvassers ultimately deadlocked on whether to include them in the final tally. That meant that the ballots would not be counted, and Alharbi was certified as the winner by just six votes; a recount later determined his actual winning margin was 11 votes.
Mahmood then sued to have the 37 mishandled ballots counted. Brewer argued Tuesday that, otherwise, the 37 unnamed voters’ constitutional right to vote was being invalidated.
“Plaintiffs have no other remedy, other than to have their votes counted, as is their right,” he told the court. Allowing those voters to cast a new ballot would also be sufficient, he said.
But Fresard disagreed. Michigan law “does not support … that the City had a clear legal duty to tabulate the 37 votes,” she wrote. State law requires absentee votes to be tabulated according to the law, she wrote, but the board has the discretion to not count ballots it has questions about.
Brewer, in an email before the decision came down Tuesday, said he would be appealing “immediately” to the Michigan Court of Appeals “and on to the Michigan Supreme Court if necessary.”
Tuesday evening, he confirmed they had already appealed.
Hamtramck has been embroiled in election-related scandals for much of 2025. City Clerk Rana Faraj was put on leave shortly after the election, which Amer Ghalib, the city’s outgoing mayor, said was partially because her office mishandled the 37 ballots. Earlier this month, Faraj sued the city and several of its officials, alleging she was being retaliated against for reporting election fraud.
Two City Council members were charged in August with forging signatures on absentee ballots during the 2023 council race. Four others, including two other council members and an incoming council member, were named in an April document from Attorney General Dana Nessel seeking a special prosecutor for the case. No one else has been charged.

Senate Bill 235 took effect this year to offer 50% matching funds for Grow Your Own Educator initiatives, which provide tuition or loan repayment assistance for school district employees pursuing an undergraduate teaching degree.
“These matching funds are really important because they’re going to allow the schools to market this to a wider audience, increase their pipeline, and the ultimate goal is to turn existing support staff and (paraprofessionals) and teachers’ aides into certified classroom teachers once they matriculate through this process,” the bill’s author, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said. “And so, there is an urgency to this for our schools.”

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

The Oklahoma State Department of Education opened a portal in late November for districts or their affiliated nonprofits to apply for the matching funds, Pugh said.

The Education Department was slow to launch the program in the months after the bill was signed into law in May, Pugh said, but progress started to accelerate once new state Superintendent Lindel Fields took over the agency in October.
The agency has had contact with 25 districts about the program and held meetings with the Oklahoma City Public Schools Foundation, representatives of Altus schools and Tulsa Public Schools’ Tulsa Teacher Corps program, department spokesperson Bailey Woolsey said. Seven other districts have applied, but none met the required criteria.
Once an application is approved, it should take about two to three weeks for a district to receive its funds, Woolsey said.
Pugh estimated 40 districts have some version of a Grow Your Own Educator program. 
The law matches closely with the Teacher Pipeline Program at the OKCPS Foundation. President and CEO Kendra Horn said the foundation has started the process of submitting documents to apply for state Grow Your Own funds.
State funding will match half of what districts or their foundations spend for school support staff to attend state-accredited teacher preparation programs at colleges and universities.
Horn estimated the OKCPS Foundation would qualify for $80,000 to $90,000 a year in state support. That’s half the amount the foundation pays to send district paraprofessionals to the University of Central Oklahoma.
The foundation also helps program participants complete initial credits at Oklahoma City Community College and Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City before they finish their degrees at UCO.
Now in its 10th year, the OKCPS Foundation program is the “largest and most proven” of its kind in Oklahoma, Horn said.

By this spring, the program will have helped 50 classroom paraprofessionals graduate with a teaching degree, she said. Each candidate has to work as a classroom aide while completing their college credits, and they must pledge to teach in the Oklahoma City district for three years after graduation.
The foundation covers the full cost of their college tuition, fees and books. Horn said the paraprofessionals effectively double their income once they start earning a teacher’s salary.
“It’s changing their future and their kids’ future,” she said. “That’s what it’s doing. I could be really practical and talk to you about the numbers, but ultimately this is changing lives and they’re going on to change the lives of hundreds and maybe eventually thousands of kids.”
Extra funding from the state could enable the program to expand in the future, and it frees up money for the foundation to better support the current candidates, like providing them transportation to their classes, Horn said.
Along with combatting Oklahoma’s decade-long teacher shortage, the pipeline program initially was designed to bring more bilingual and racially diverse teachers into OKCPS, a district where the vast majority of students are non-white and where 46% are learning English as their non-native language. Now, it’s open to district paraprofessionals of any background, Horn said.
“I think this is the most established and successful Grow Your Own program in the state of Oklahoma right now,” she said. “I hope that more come along and that we continue to get support because education is the one thing that can determine whether or not we attract more people to this state, whether there are quality jobs and whether we all have a chance to succeed.”

The post Year in review: Wyoming’s top political stories for 2025 appeared first on WyoFile .","It may not have been an election year in Wyoming, but 2025 still had plenty of standout political moments and events. 
From rowdy town halls to a new group of Republicans rising to power in the statehouse to legal battles over election laws and abortion restrictions, here’s a look back at some of those stories. 
Wyoming Freedom Caucus takes the wheel
In January, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus pitched a new legislative era of “bold policies” guided by “godly principles.”
The group of hard-line Republicans won control of the House in 2024 and this year’s general session marked their first time at the statehouse helm.

The caucus wielded that power in Cheyenne by prioritizing certain bills, pushing back on gubernatorial budget vetoes from the year prior, accusing the governor and other lawmakers of breaking the law and using the House speaker’s “drawer” to unilaterally squash 95 bills.
Meantime, other lawmakers pushed back against the caucus, perhaps most notably when the Senate announced it would not pass a supplemental budget — an unprecedented action in Wyoming. 
In the legislative off-season, known as the interim, the Freedom Caucus announced its plans to take inspiration from the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal jobs and spending by “DOGE-ing” the state budget. 
From there, the caucus used the Management Audit Committee to subpoena several local officials and formed a subcommittee to scrutinize the Department of Health, which regularly has the largest budget of any state agency. 
More recently, the caucus has pledged to cut spending, citing “pre-pandemic spending levels” as a general target. 
Election laws and litigation 
Lawmakers filed a whopping 45 bills to remake Wyoming’s elections, accounting for about 8% of all legislation in both the House and the Senate this year. 
Just eight of those bills survived to Gov. Mark Gordon’s desk, including one to require residents to provide proof of citizenship and residency when registering to vote. That particular bill, which became law with Gordon’s signature, spurred a federal lawsuit that drew in high-profile attorneys, the Republican National Committee, a coalition of 25 states and Guam and the Trump administration. 
A federal court dismissed the case in July, siding with Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who was named as a defendant in his official capacity alongside the state’s 23 county clerks.

In August, Gray and the Freedom Caucus backed the Trump administration’s plans to stop states from using voting machines and mail-in ballots. The exact details of Trump’s plans remain to be seen since no executive order has been issued yet. 
In the meantime, lawmakers charged ahead — again — with election reform. Between two committees, legislators voted to sponsor 14 bills tied to elections. Some of those bills were inspired by the upheaval surrounding the Weston County clerk and an initial miscount and subsequent audit in the 2024 general election. 
Abortion
Early in the year, lawmakers passed new abortion laws, including one to require a transvaginal ultrasound before taking abortion medication, another to restrict the state’s sole facility that provides in-clinic abortions. 
Gordon vetoed the ultrasound bill before lawmakers doubled down and voted to override his veto. However, a state judge halted enforcement of the two new laws in April. Two months later, another judge blocked a third new law that dealt with off-label medications. 
At the crux of each of those legal challenges is a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution, which protects people’s rights to make their own health care decisions. 
Whether that amendment makes banning abortion unconstitutional is the central question in litigation related to the state’s two abortion bans, which the Wyoming Supreme Court considered in April. Justices grilled attorneys, but a decision in the case has yet to be published.

Chief Justice Lynne Boomgaarden told WyoFile in October that a ruling would not be expected until the year’s end. 
Property taxes
It was another big year for lawmakers seeking to cut residential property taxes. But the House and the Senate didn’t always see eye to eye. 
While firefighters, sheriffs, community colleges and special districts appeared at the Capitol in protest of blanket property tax cuts during the legislative session, the two chambers squared off. 
First, the Senate rejected House amendments to a proposal to create a two-year tax break for homeowners, partly on account of confusion over what exactly the lower chamber’s changes did to the bill. And after a deal was allegedly struck, it fell apart with Senate leadership accusing their House counterparts of backing out of an agreement. 
Lawmakers ultimately settled on a deal to cut residential property taxes by 25%, resulting in reduced local services in certain parts of the state. Separately, it will be up to voters in next year’s election to decide whether to approve an additional 50% cut. 
In June, Sen. Bob Ide, R-Casper, asked legislators to consider an even more sweeping proposal — to amend the Wyoming Constitution to abolish property taxes altogether. 
That prompted about two dozen Casper homeowners to attend a legislative committee meeting in August urging lawmakers against further cuts.

In November, the Joint Revenue Committee voted to sponsor one bill to eliminate residential property taxes, another to raise sales taxes to replace the resulting revenue loss. 
The measures will be up for consideration by the entire Legislature next year. 
In memoriam
In September, the assassination of Charlie Kirk shocked the state, including those in Wyoming who helped the commentator get his start and those who credit him with inspiring their political lives. Kirk’s death also sparked disputes about free speech. 
Wyoming also mourned the passing of many who served in elected office, including former U.S. Senator Alan Simpson, former Secretary of State Kathy Karpan, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, state Rep. John Eklund and former Superintendent of Public Instruction Judy Catchpole.

The heavily redacted tranche of documents violates the public's right to know, writes columnist Rod Miller. 
The post Opaque transparency, the Epstein files and you appeared first on WyoFile .","Bad stuff always happens when our government cloaks itself in secrecy and doesn’t tell us what it is doing in our name. We get into wars and people die. Our money is stolen from us and assholes get rich. Our elected leaders break our laws with impunity, violate our trust and we are left with an impotent system. Bad stuff.

Opinion

A democratic society such as ours can only thrive in the bright sunlight of transparency. It only works as intended when the citizens know what their government is doing on their behalf.
When government keeps secrets from the people, that system cannot be called free. It is by definition something else entirely.
Take the Epstein files, for instance. The seedy nexus between a convicted sex offender and powerful politicians and celebrities has been fertile ground for conjecture for years. Our Department of Justice has investigated that nexus thoroughly and compiled hundreds of thousands of documents and photographs as evidence. But the DOJ has long kept those files embargoed from the public, leaving us to assume that powerful politicians are being protected by government secrecy.
Conspiracy theories have sprouted like mushrooms in all that darkness.
The burning question is not which rich, powerful men were canoodling with teenage girls on Epstein’s private seraglio island, but rather why our government, particularly the DOJ, refuses to release the information. This issue is best viewed not through a lens of titillating scandal among elites or partisan one-upsmanship, but rather through the clear lens of the public’s right to know.
To quell the supposition over the files and quench the conspiracy theories, Congress passed a bespoke law to force the DOJ to release the information by a certain date. House Resolution 4405, “The Epstein Files Transparency Act,” was passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on Nov. 19. It mandated that ALL Epstein files be released within 30 days.
The law also strictly limited what information could be redacted from the files. It specified that no information contained in the files could be withheld or redacted to protect politicians or other powerful people from embarrassment. Here is the pertinent section of the law: “No record shall be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”
The only redactions allowed by law are to protect the privacy of victims or for purposes of national security. I think we can all agree that Epstein and his cronies were not on the island to discuss our military order of battle in the Mideast, the names of our spies on foreign soil or our plans to annex Greenland. National security was not the reason they were cavorting with middle school cheerleaders.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)

Yet, despite the specificity of the law, the DOJ barely beat the deadline and released only a fraction of the Epstein files to the public. And the tranche that was released was heavily redacted.
That means the U.S. Department of Justice, the nation’s highest law enforcement organization, defied both the president and Congress and broke the law. And they did so to keep hidden from the American people information that the executive and legislative branches of government ordered to be revealed.
Think, for a moment, about the lawlessness of that behavior by the DOJ. About the cynicism and hubris. If the top law enforcement agency in our government breaks the law to protect powerful elites, how can we call ourselves a nation under law?
It doesn’t matter one rat’s ass whose names are in the Epstein files, or to what party they belong. The law states that those names must be revealed to the public as a matter of transparency.
For DOJ bureaucrats to defy the law and keep secrets from us should piss us all off!
Trump can provide that transparency, if he wants to, with a phone call or the stroke of his pen. He can order Attorney General Pam Bondi to comply with the law. If she refuses, he can fire her and replace her with someone who will follow orders. Nixon proved, with his Saturday Night Massacre, that a president has that power.
The ball is in Trump’s court.
Among all the gripes we have about government — taxes, immigration, woke policies, ICE, National Guardsmen in our streets, blowing up Venezuelan “drug” boats, DEI and so many other legitimate complaints — government not trusting citizens enough to tell us the truth should outweigh them all.
Telling citizens the truth is, in my estimation, the most important job of government. Without that, we cannot be a free people. As Jesus said, in John 8:32, “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”

Contractors recently completed a 29-acre fuels reduction project in Virgil Phillips Farm Park, near Moscow, that should make the park more resilient to wildfires.
The project is a partnership between the Latah Soil and Water Conservation District and Latah County. The farm and park, donated to the City of Moscow many years ago, is managed by Latah County. It’s located about five miles north of town on the northwest shoulder of Moscow Mountain, west of U.S. Highway 95.


For more information, go to https://www.latahswcd.org/.


“The conservation district got us moving on the project,” said Tom Lamar, a Latah County commissioner. “It seems like it turned out really well.”
The 160-acre park is popular with locals. It features a number of hiking trails that lead through a variety habitats including forested lands, open fields and wetlands. The park includes several intermittent streams and two ponds. It is home to a variety of wildlife species such as moose, elk, deer, black bear, birds and amphibians. Visitors can enjoy historic and newly planted orchards in the park as well.
Latah County recently completed an updated Community Wildfire Protection Plan in 2023, which identified high fire risk areas in the county and strategies to improve resilience. Forested areas in the Urban-Rural Interface were identified as being especially vulnerable to wildfires. With recent population growth, more people are interested in finding rural homes in the Moscow Mountain area. 
“Recent relatively large fire events clearly illustrate the mounting urban-interface issue facing Latah County,” the Community Wildfire Protection Plan said. “Population growth rates have been greatest in the western part of the County around Moscow, Viola, and Potlatch. Agricultural land is being subdivided and people are moving to the more rural parts of the County.
“The growing appreciation for seclusion has led to significant development in many of the lower elevation forests. Frequently, this development is in the dry ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir, forest types where grass, needles, and brush surface litter create forest fuel conditions that are at a high propensity for fire occurrence,” the Community Wildfire Protection Plan report said.

That type of forest eco-type is exactly the kind of environment found at the Virgil Phillips Farm Park.
“Wildfires are always a concern,” said Ryan Lawrence, district manager of the Latah Soil and Water Conservation District. “The Clearwater Complex fires were really a wake-up call. Our summers are getting hotter and drier. You always wonder, where will the next fire be?” 
The Clearwater complex fires in 2015 were lightning-caused events that destroyed 48 homes and 70 outbuildings and consumed 68,127 acres of private, state and federal land. A number of other fires have occurred between 2015 and 2021 in the county, according to the Community Wildfire Protection Plan report.
There were two fires that occurred in Latah County in 2025 – the 80-acre Lamb Fire near Troy and the White Pine Fire near the Giant White Pine campground in September. 
Out of the recent fires that have occurred, most were caused by either humans or lightning, the report said. The historical frequency of fires in the local area ranges from once every 35 years to 200 years, depending on elevation. 
By completing the Community Wildfire Protection Plan report, Latah County became eligible for grant funding for fuel-reduction projects, said Mauri Knott, senior planner for the county. “It’s been years since we got funding for fire prevention projects,” she said. “The Phillips Farm project created an opportunity to do some fuel-reduction work, education outreach and create some momentum for future projects.”
The Latah SWCD applied for $70,000 in funding from Avista Corporation and Title 3 federal funds to cover the project costs. With the money in hand, Latah County hired Northwest Management to create a detailed forest management plan for the park. The fuels-reduction work was completed in Fall 2025. 
In a fact sheet about the project, the Latah District said, “The Virgil Phillips Farm has been designated as a priority area for fuels-reduction treatment due to the timbered borders along the wildlife-urban interface, where small acreage developments and public access significantly elevate the threat of wildfires. 
“Phillips Farm and adjacent private lands will be treated through vegetation removal to slow the spread of a fire, create fire breaks to improve access for firefighters to respond, improve forest health and protect homes.”
The following practices were implemented: 

Forest thinning by removing trees of poor quality, those infested with insects or disease, and small-diameter conifer trees to maintain an open forest structure and avoid crown fires. 
Removing ladder fuels through limbing lower branches to reduce the spread of ground fire into the canopy.
Masticate understory growth and slash resulting from tree and limb removal. 

Officials with Northwest Management said they thought the project went well. 
“I think we hit the objectives,” said Tucker Flaten, a forester for Northwest Management, based in Moscow. “Our main concern was the fuel conditions. We wanted to create opportunities for fire crews to break up fuel continuity.”
They also looked at the spacing between trees to ensure that if there were a fire in the area and a tanker plane was flying overhead to drop retardant on the blaze, the retardant could reach the ground,” he said. 
The treatments mainly took out trees less than 10” in diameter and a lot of brush, he said.

Latah Commissioner Lamar was worried that too much brush and ground vegetation would be removed, potentially harming smaller critters that depend on that habitat for survival. But after touring the property, he thought things looked A-OK. 
“My biggest question was about the impact to the ecosystem that relies on the understory for survival – the habitat on the forest floor,” he said. “But in touring the property, I realized that they weren’t doing 100 percent of the brushing treatment and mastication across the landscape. They were leaving some of that low-lying habitat for edge effect for wildlife.
“They did a good job. Tucker was great – he understood how to do the fuels-reduction treatments so they would reduce the fire hazard keep doing more projects,” Lawrence said. 
He sees the Virgil Phillips Farm Park project as a “demonstration” project that will help educate the local community about the need for fuels-reduction projects. Two public tours of the farm project have given local residents a chance to see the results. Information signage will be placed in the park to inform visitors about the benefits of fuels reduction work and forest health.

Ahmed Jallow: “I’m selecting the piece on mental health support in Black churches and barbershops as my story of the year. It’s a favorite of mine because it’s truly solutions-oriented, showcasing how these community-run spaces are creating their own networks of support where they’re needed most.”
On a Tuesday afternoon in July, inside The Bar Ber Shop in Raleigh, Reggie Winston, 41, talks about a subject many of his young clients rarely discuss anywhere else: mental health. 
Winston, who is trained in mental health first aid and suicide prevention, remembers battling depression in high school without realizing it. “I had no clue what I was experiencing was depression,” he said. It wasn’t until he heard someone else’s story that he recognized his own, a realization that led him to therapy and, eventually, a mission.  
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Winston expanded the community work he’d started years earlier with free blood pressure screenings in his shop. This time, he turned to mental health, founding Grooming Resources and Opportunities, a nonprofit that trains barbers to spot signs of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. 
His method begins with seemingly casual questions when someone climbs into his barber chair. Instead “How are you?” he’ll ask, “What time did you wake up? What are your plans today?” As he snips and shapes, his clients reveal pieces of their lives they rarely share anywhere else.
Slowly, in the safety of his barber chair, these simple inquiries allow clients to reveal what’s really happening in their lives, Winston said.  
“Once they get comfortable and start trusting you with their haircut,” Winston said, “they start trusting you with their mind and their heart.” 
From 2013 to 2022, 377 Black North Carolinians ages 10 to 24 died by suicide, according to data. Nearly 17% of Black high school students said they had seriously considered suicide. Among middle schoolers, more than a third reported the same. The numbers peak at age 24 — and are especially stark for Black girls questioning their sexual orientation, who now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide. 
“The myth that Black people don’t die by suicide has been dangerous,” said Bettie Murchison, a longtime advocate who runs the Village of C.A.R.E. in Wake County. “We’ve had to fight against that in our families, in our churches, and in our schools.”

Winston’s effort is a key part of North Carolina’s response to rising suicide rates among Black youth. This year, the state health department launched the Black Youth Suicide Prevention Action Plan, a five-year initiative that leans on trusted community spaces, including barbershops and churches, to expand support and prevent suicide among Black youth and young adults. Unlike the state’s broader suicide-prevention strategy, this plan focuses on the unique needs of Black youth.  
Dr. Sonyia Richardson, a UNC Chapel Hill researcher and one of the plan’s architects, said it was built on listening sessions with young people and their communities. “This is not a top-down plan,” she said. “It’s community-led, community-driven, community-implemented.” 
One of its guiding principles: young people in crisis often turn not to doctors, but to trusted adults in familiar places — coaches, pastors, aunties, barbers. 
“We’re meeting the needs of communities where youth are more likely to seek support. From local YMCAs, churches, and community centers rather than traditional mental health providers,” Richardson said. 
Barbershops and churches 
That’s where Winston and his longtime friend, counselor Rodney Harris, come in. This year alone, he and Harris have trained more than a dozen barbers in mental health first aid training. These programs teach them to spot warning signs of mental distress and suicide, as well as how to safely talk with clients about limiting access to firearms and other deadly means. They’ve trained barbers across Raleigh, Wake Forest and Durham. Soon they’ll be in Rocky Mount. 
“Barbers often know more about their clients’ lives than anyone else,” Harris said. “When a clinician approaches, youth might be skeptical. But when a barber speaks, they listen.” 
Barbershops have become hubs for this work well beyond North Carolina. The Confess Project, for example, has trained barbers across the country in mental health advocacy. 
What’s different with GRO is that they train barbers to become community leaders themselves, Harris said. “What we saw as a gap in the research is to make the barbers trainers and then have them go into the community, offer additional trainings, and then they can also offer recruitment,” Harris said. That work, he added, includes expanding mental health first aid and counseling on access to lethal means, known as CALM.
The same approach is playing out in churches. Through Murchison’s Village of C.A.R.E. program, she trains pastors and faith leaders to act as first responders. “If we can get them to understand this is as much a part of their ministry as teaching the Bible,” she said, “we can reach a generation of youth who don’t see a therapist as their first line of defense.”

 Building trust beyond the shop

State officials have identified 17 counties in North Carolina that are in urgent need of suicide prevention efforts. These counties, which range from major metropolitan areas like Durham, Wake, and Mecklenburg to smaller, rural communities such as Edgecombe, Halifax and Hoke, have the highest rates of Black youth suicides and the highest volume of 988 crisis calls. In each of these communities, Black residents make up at least 25% of the population. 
Still, many young people don’t trust the 988 Lifeline. Black youth are underrepresented among callers, even though they show up disproportionately in emergency room visits for self-injury. Officials say building confidence in the hotline is essential to reaching young people before a crisis escalates.  
Kelly Crosbie, director of the state’s Division of Mental Health, said fear and mistrust keep many from using the hotline. “There’s just personal shame, not knowing who’s on the other end, and what’s going to happen,” she said. Some families worry that calling could trigger involuntary hospitalization or even police involvement. “Some of these young folks, their families have already experienced trauma when they’ve tried to engage with treatment systems or government systems,” she added. 










Once they get comfortable and start trusting you with their haircut,” Winston said, “they start trusting you with their mind and their heart.


– Reggie Winston


Mistrust can run even deeper for LGBTQ youth. In North Carolina, Black girls who are questioning their sexual orientation now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide. At the same time, the federal government eliminated funding for the 988 “Press 3” option, which connected LGBTQ and transgender callers to specialized counselors. Advocates warn the loss strips away a culturally competent lifeline that has reached more than a million young people nationwide. 
State officials say they have begun training local crisis counselors to handle calls from that population and are working with communities to ensure that 988 operators are equipped with inclusive, culturally aware training. “We’re losing that specialized national line,” Crosbie told NC Health News last month, “but we are making sure our 988 here is well-trained and ready.” 
The state has also launched a youth-led awareness campaign, called “Stronger Together” initiative. Messaging, visuals, and formats are being created by Black youth themselves to make the hotline feel credible and relatable. “We need to get the messaging straight from young people,” Crosbie said. The effort includes training peers and trusted community figures—like pastors, coaches, and barbers—to recognize warning signs and encourage youth to seek help. 
Current data shows texting and chat are the most utilized 988 services among North Carolina youth. Crosbie said that makes it even more important to meet young people where they are—whether that’s on their phones, in churches, or in barbershops. “We need to make sure the help is in places and spaces that people trust,” she said. 
In addition to breaking cultural stigmas surrounding mental health discussions, other strategies include reducing access to lethal means and providing gun locks, and hosting community trainings. 
The first Black youth suicide prevention conference is scheduled for September in Rocky Mount, which is one of the high need areas. Richardson hopes the plan will serve as a national model for suicide prevention among diverse populations. “We are focusing on those populations most impacted in our state… and I think this also provides a blueprint for how to create [prevention strategies] across the state.”
Back at The Bar Ber Shop, Winston says he sees that trust forming every day. Kids sit in his chair for a haircut and end up sharing the things they don’t tell teachers or parents. 
“Barbers are the bridge for people to get the help they need,” Winston said. “We are the trusted few.”

After Karlene Ferrante broke her femur, she underwent major surgery and was transferred to a skilled nursing facility to recover. She spent a little over two months at the county-owned Portage County Health Care Center in Stevens Point, Wisconsin.
“​​I lucked out and got sent to the Portage County Healthcare Center. They took wonderful care of me for that whole summer and until I was able to go home,” Ferrante said. “Because of that great care that I got, I am able to walk. I have my leg. I didn’t get an infection and I didn’t fall. They were adequately staffed and they provided really good care.”
There are only two skilled nursing facilities in Stevens Point. The publicly-owned Portage County Health Care Center, which has served the community for nearly a century and has a five-star rating from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the privately-owned Stevens Points Health Services, which has a one-star rating from CMS. Ferrante was relieved to get into the county-owned facility, but the relief faded when she returned home and learned that the county was considering selling Portage County Health Care Center to a private company.
“When I found out that they were trying to privatize it, I decided then that I’m going to work on this,” Ferrante said. “I’m not going to let that happen, because other people should be able to get the same kind of care that I got.”
Across Wisconsin, County Boards have been voting to sell their skilled nursing facilities as local communities fight the sales, especially in rural counties. In Portage County, retired professor Ferrante, a two-time patient at the Portage County Health Care Center, has joined the Save the Portage County Health Care Center group, which opposes the privatization of the county facility.
“We are the only five-star skilled nursing facility in Portage County,” said Nancy Roppe, a lifelong resident of Portage County and one of the group’s organizers. “The quality of care is stellar… people clamor to get their care here, because they know when they press the call button, somebody will respond.”
In 2018, Portage County residents approved a four-year, $5.6 million referendum to support the facility’s operations. Then, in 2022, they passed another measure authorizing tax increases to fund the construction of a new facility.
Roppe said the referendums signaled public strong support for Portage County Health Care Center, but Portage County is trying to sell the health care center to The Ensign Group, a private company which has purchased other nursing facilities in the state.

In Lincoln County, Wisconsin, the County Board voted over the summer to sell the county-owned Pine Crest Nursing Home, which had been serving the county for over 70 years, to Ensign. Just a few months after the transition from county to corporate ownership, members of the Lincoln County community have seen noticeable changes in the quality of care.
“We are already seeing the changes,” said Pastor Mike Southcombe, the senior pastor at St. Stephen’s United Church of Christ in Merrill, the county seat of Lincoln County. “The staffing is less than it was when the county ran it.”
Research consistently shows that publicly-owned facilities not only maintain higher staffing and care standards but also serve as essential safety nets for vulnerable populations, ensuring access to long-term care for residents who might otherwise be turned away by for-profit operators.
A 2022 report by the Center for Medicare Advocacy warned that privatizing county-owned nursing homes often led to lower staffing levels and diminished quality of care, as for-profit operators prioritized revenue over residents’ needs. The report found that promised cost savings rarely materialized, while accountability and public oversight were significantly reduced.
An academic study also found that privatizing county-owned nursing homes increased regulatory violations and reduced residents’ quality of care and quality of life, while failing to improve access for Medicaid recipients.
Working Class Storytelling reported that during a February town hall in Lincoln County, data presented by LeadingAge Wisconsin indicated that publicly-owned nursing homes in the state provide higher-quality care than private or nonprofit facilities.
While some Lincoln County officials said that the county did not have adequate funding to continue the operation of Pine Crest, Eileen Guthrie, a retired accountant who lives in Lincoln County and regularly volunteered at Pine Crest, crunched the numbers and found that Pine Crest was bringing in a profit.
“I started looking at all of the public records, whether they were from the finance committee or the county board, or online… I kept digging and digging,” said Guthrie, who was an active member with People for Pine Crest. When she looked through all the 2023 and 2024 financial statements, she found that Pine Crest had a positive balance upwards of $400,000 in 2023 and a positive balance above $550,000 in 2024. Guthrie said part of this positive balance was due to the state’s Medicaid reimbursement policies.

Lincoln County officials said the sale of Pine Crest would help relieve the county’s deficit, though they did not clarify what expenses were driving that deficit.
“I know not everybody’s happy about it. I understand that all of us, most of us, have people in Pine Crest, and I understand that, but I’m comfortable with Ensign, that they’ll be here and they’re going to serve the community properly,” said County Supervisor Greg Hartwig at a July County Board meeting, according to WXPR.
As the county pushed forward with the sale, many residents felt their voices were ignored. Among them was Scott Doerr, a Lincoln County resident who had worked in local factories for more than 30 years before retiring. Frustrated by the way local officials handled the Pine Crest sale, he filed paperwork to run for County Board Supervisor.
“I just felt that the county board wasn’t listening to the citizens,” Doerr said. “I’m probably going to be campaigning on giving the voice back to the people.”
The sale has raised deeper concerns about the future of the facility.
“Being county-owned was a comfort and now we have to wonder, year to year, if they’re going to sell it for profit and make things worse instead of better.” Doerr said.
That concern about the future of nursing care is shared by others who see the facility as more than just a business, but as a vital community resource.
“People have been paying taxes on [Pine Crest], volunteering at it, supporting it, all those years, with the expectation that it would be around for them when they needed it, or be around for family members when they needed it,” Southcombe said. “The population up here, as it is everywhere, is aging. The elementary schools are shrinking. The need for nursing homes in home care and just general health services is just going to increase. And we’re also going to need people to work at those places.”

For Guthrie, the sale of Pine Crest is not necessarily the end of the fight for better community services.
“The loss was significant, but there is a win in there,” Guthrie said. “All of these people worked together for the good of the community, for the good of the employees and the residents. And maybe that’ll be enough to say, okay, yeah, we lost, but there are other things that we can do, so I’m hoping that there will be more to come.”
As the Save the Portage County Health Care Center group has watched other sales, like those in Lincoln County, happen, they are working to get creative about spreading the word across the county ahead of deciding votes. They have started sharing information in newspaper ads, billboards, and online videos.
“We’ve had to go and reinvent the wheel. We’ve come up with new ways to reach the public. And how does the public react when they know? They are angry,” Ferrante said. “They’re surprised. After voting twice to support the referendums and paying the taxes to have the nursing home continue and be rebuilt, people have been shocked to learn that the current administration in the county is just selling it.”
With the county’s vote looming this week, local community advocates said the stakes feel like a matter of life and death, and they aren’t slowing down.
“Where do we find the energy to fight [for Portage County Health Care Center]? For me, I feel like I owe them,” Ferrante said. “They kind of saved my life.”

(Getty Images)People without health insurance are human, and they still get sick. When they get very sick, they go to emergency rooms, like everyone else. Without Medicaid expansion, the cost of their care falls on the hospitals. 
Doctors make lots of money, so that’s fine, right? Wrong. Most hospitals are nonprofits, and rural hospitals are running on a shoestring budget. It’s no secret that Idaho is experiencing significant health care worker shortages. When funding for health care gets cut, Idaho loses medical professionals. 
 The Medicaid expansion issue

The Idaho Legislature may consider ending Medicaid expansion in 2026, which covers roughly 90,000 people in Idaho. This is despite legislation that was passed as a compromise to ending the program — legislation that hasn’t even taken effect yet. 
When Medicaid expansion started, the Legislature did away with the old way of funding indigent medical care through the county and state programs. If cut, there are no options for Idahoans who lose their coverage. 
If Medicaid expansion ends, it would recreate a coverage gap. Meaning Idahoans that make up to 100% of the federal poverty line ($15,650 for an individual) would not qualify for Medicaid or a tax credit on the state-based exchange that makes health insurance affordable for low-income families. 
Who pays their medical bills when they get sick? The rural hospitals that cannot legally nor morally deny an ill person care. Until that rural hospital is so overwhelmed that it’s forced to close its doors. Ultimately resulting in longer drives to get an emergency room in Idaho’s massive state, that covers 44 counties and stretches across more than 83,000 square miles. 
How far do you want to drive to get to an ER doctor?
 The return on investment

Why else should we keep Medicaid expansion? The return on investment is indisputable. For every $1 of state investment, Idaho receives $9 in federal investment. By keeping Medicaid expansion in place, Idaho sees approximately $1 billion invested into the health care economy. 
In state fiscal year 2025, Medicaid expansion only accounted for 1.6% of general fund expenditures.
Medicaid is also the largest payer for behavioral health services in Idaho with one in three on Medicaid expansion having a mental illness. 
Because of Medicaid expansion, we can receive a 90/10 match from the federal government to cover new moms who qualify for Medicaid during the 12 months postpartum, saving state dollars. Idaho currently covers approximately 30% of births through Medicaid.
 Economic benefits

Let’s talk money. Medicaid expansion has created a massive benefit to our economy.

For every federal dollar invested in Medicaid, Idaho sees an increase in $1.82 in gross economic activity. For fiscal year 2025, that equates to approximately $1.587 billion dollars invested in our economy.
Medicaid expansion produces an additional 9,362 jobs throughout the state.
Over $35 million in general fund revenue and $12 million in property taxes generated annually as a result of expansion.

It’s time we acknowledged the role that Medicaid plays in our health care infrastructure and economy. In no other industry would we consider taking away $1 billion out of our infrastructure that provides this level of economic benefit. 
Report: Federal funds for Idaho Medicaid expansion spurs $1.5 billion in economic output

Repealing Medicaid expansion is a step backward that leaves Idahoans in a worse place than they were in 2018, when Idaho voters initially passed the initiative by a ballot measure with 61% of the vote. 
At least then there were indigent funds available, that while imperfect, helped prevent shifting the cost burden to hospitals and taxpayers’ private insurance company premiums. 
Medicaid expansion is simply something Idaho cannot afford to lose.

BRUCETON MILLS, W.Va. — A fierce gust of wind whips through the trees in Bruceton Mills on a chilly fall morning. Three energetic dogs run through the gravel and fading blades of grass despite the cold weather. The front door to a miniature cabin swings open and out steps James Prutilapac, the owner of more than 40 acres of relatively untouched Preston County natural beauty.
The West Virginian observes his property on the frosty mountain morning of Nov. 5, 2025, and there are no power lines to be seen in the skies. Instead, the occasional bird or falling leaf. That view will change if the proposed route of NextEra’s MARL transmission lines comes to fruition, which may impact Prutilapac’s view, as well as land in four other counties.

“No one I have talked to has been in favor of the project,” Prutilapac said. “There are different levels of antagonism toward [MARL], but I haven’t spoken to any locals who are in support of it.”
NextEra Energy Transmission proposed the MidAtlantic Resiliency Link (MARL) transmission line, a 500-kilovolt entity that would run more than 107 miles from Pennsylvania to Virginia. The primary purpose of the line, according to NextEra’s website, is to “strengthen the power grid, and help power what matters most — our homes, our businesses and our way of life.”
NextEra’s MARL transmission line project has not yet been approved by the state’s public service commission, as of Nov. 17, 2025. A decision on the final route is expected by spring 2027, according to NextEra.


Prutilapac is one of more than a thousand members of the Facebook group “WATI — West Virginians Against Transmission Line Injustice,” a grassroots organization fighting against the addition of transmission lines such as MARL. The organization is based in Fort Ashby, a town roughly an hour east of Bruceton Mills.
The sentiment remains relatively the same among the group despite the miles and mountains between its members: The proposed lines would benefit surrounding states, but not the state most impacted by their presence.
“It’s a project going from a power station in Pennsylvania to feed data centers in Northern Virginia,” Prutilapac said of the proposed MARL project. “It’s not as though it’s a project that they’re adding the lines because there are underserved communities 10 minutes down the road.”
WATI Secretary Sara Evans shared a similar sentiment.
“Electricity is nice, but I don’t want [transmission lines] destroying the view and the memories just to give electricity through to someplace else,” Evans said.
The addition of transmission lines is partly due to the rapidly growing need for more power in the age of artificial intelligence and increased data use.
“We have a lot of demand growth in the region and across the country,” said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies. “Power demand was flat for 25 years, and now, suddenly, it’s like 3% per year, which is a lot in terms of the gigawatts of power that we need to add.”
Internet use among adults steadily increased between 2000 and 2024, rising from 52% to 96% during that period, according to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center. That statistic combined with the rise of AI shows how much power is needed to fuel the country’s demand.
Prutilapac is more focused on conserving the wildlife and nature on his land as well as the quiet life it provides him and less on the frenetic pace of power growth.
“Environmentally, the [proposed transmission line] is going to be taking out a lot of trees, which I don’t want to see that happen,” Prutilapac said. “There’s a lot of wildlife up here. We regularly have black bear, red and grey fox, fisher, coyote, and then obviously deer, raccoon, opossum, things that are everywhere in West Virginia.”
The transmission company has land agents in contact with potentially impacted residents to sign easements as the process moves forward. These transmission routes are not set in stone and according to Rob Gramlich, they often deal with rerouted plans.
“Reroutes are a normal part of a transmission line’s life and there are a lot of factors,” said Gramlich, the president of Grid Strategies. “Looking at land issues and river and creek crossings, and how many people are going to actually see [lines] and what the communities actually think, so it is a normal part of the [routing] process.”
WVU engineering professor and energy expert Professor Anurag Srivastava said routes that directly impact people are only approved when there is a great need.
“If [the transmission route] is going through a part of the town, or especially if it will impact the people that are living there, well I guess in most cases, then it does not happen,” Srivastava said. “Unless the benefit is a lot, then they have to compensate people to move from that land to other land, and so it will cost the transmission line builder more money.”
The proposed MARL plan, if successful, would require compensation to residents like Prutilapac due to the invasive nature of the route. Agents have already made offers, according to the Bruceton Mills landowner.

“We’ve had a guy from NextEra that has contacted us, and he’s kind of been in regular contact; he’s obviously trying to get us to sign contracts and whatnot, but no one has contacted us from any state agency or anything,” Prutilapac said.
Those opposed to the transmission line say the fight will continue despite potential monetary compensation.

(Photo: Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent.) A new state audit has identified flaws in the way the Department of Human Services investigates complaints against child care centers in Tennessee, potentially placing children at risk.
The department investigates approximately 6,000 allegations of child abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation made each year against legally and illegally operating childcare providers across the state.
The Tennessee Comptroller found some of these investigations lacked required documentation, including proof inspectors had visited the childcare center, incomplete “action plans” holding child care operators responsible for improvements and misclassified forms.
Some investigations into allegations of misconduct inside childcare centers weren’t initiated or concluded in the legally required timeframe, the audit found. 
One complaint against an illegal child care operator lacked a temporary restraining order to shut it down that was “essential when conditions present an immediate threat to children’s health or safety,” the audit found.

“Without stronger oversight and accountability measures, the department cannot fully assure the public that it consistently protects children in Tennessee’s childcare system,” the audit said.
Commissioner Clarence Carter acknowledged the ongoing problems with child care center investigations to lawmakers last week. 
Carter pledged to “strengthen our processes to ensure our investigation process is timely and properly documented at DHS.” 
“We are committed to promoting early childhood environments that are safe, healthy and developmentally rich and appropriate,” he told lawmakers sitting on a legislative subcommittee reviewing the audit on Dec. 16. 
The department has also provided more training to staff and updated its child care licensing technology systems, he said. 
The audit did not note any child had been directly harmed as a result of the investigation lapses it identified.
The Department of Human Services oversees approximately 2,000 licensed agencies that serve 200,000 children statewide. It also oversees 354 childcare centers that aren’t required to get a license because they serve fewer than five unrelated children. 
The audit reviewed the department’s operations between  2021 and 2025. Failures to properly investigate child care center complaints were also identified in a prior audit.

(Photo provided, Santos Port Authority)From the docks of the Port of Santos, a 58-terminal complex covering an area the size of 1,500 American football fields, ships loaded with soybeans prepare to set sail for China. 
Less than 45 miles from São Paulo, the port services nearly a quarter of Brazil’s soybean exports. For decades, U.S. agribusiness giants like Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill have operated facilities at the port. 
Today, they share space with COFCO International, China’s state-owned food conglomerate, which has invested around $285 million in recent years. The expansion will make it the port’s largest dry bulk terminal.

And Santos isn’t alone. In the west, the Port of Chancay is rising on Peru’s central coast.
COSCO Shipping, a state-owned Chinese company, is investing at least $3.5 billion to construct 15 berths, logistics facilities, and a 1.1-mile tunnel, enabling cargo to be channelled directly from the port to nearby highways.
Once fully operational, Chancay will function as a regional redistribution hub for exports from Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Colombia: from copper and lithium to soybeans and other agricultural products. Upon completion around 2035, it is expected to become the region’s third-largest port.
These and other recent investments across the region have positioned China to source more agricultural products from Latin America as it pivots away from U.S. farmers in response to President Trump’s higher tariffs. 
China first began that pivot in 2018, when Trump’s first-term tariff hikes ignited a global trade war. But since returning to office, the president has renewed that strategy, and China’s investments signal a generational shift that may not reverse if and when the trade war subsides. 
“What are the signs that China’s here to stay [in Latin America]? Really, the infrastructure,” said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a U.S. nonprofit policy research organization that reports 23 ports across Latin America have some degree of Chinese investment.  
“Ports, railways, roads, bridges, metro lines, energy, power plants are probably the best signs that China has a long-term commitment … These are long-term projects.”
Daniel Munch, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation, said that when a country gains control over ports that make trade faster, cheaper and more reliable, such as the Port of Chancay, trade flows tend to “lock in.” Reversing that trend, he warned, would require the United States to narrow its efficiency gap, noting that none of its container ports rank among the world’s top 50.
“It could entrench patterns,” Munch said.
This is bad news for American farmers, particularly soybean growers. 
Soybeans are a cornerstone of American agriculture, particularly in the Midwest. Nationwide, more than 270,000 farms grow the crop, according to the latest Census of Agriculture. In Illinois, nearly half of all farms depend on soybean production, and in Iowa and Minnesota, about four in 10 do.

In 2024, more than 40% of U.S. soybean production was exported, with about half going to China.
But tensions between the United States and China have risen this year – Trump has increased tariffs and recently threatened a 157% tax on all Chinese imports, while China responded by reducing U.S. soybean imports to near zero for six months. 
A trade deal announced in November ends the suspension and includes commitments for China to buy 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the final two months of 2025 and at least 25 million metric tons annually through 2028, according to Purdue University and farmdoc Daily. 
Brazil has stepped in as China’s biggest supplier of soybeans, which are used to feed livestock to support protein demand. 
China has become one of the two main export markets for at least 10 nations, most of them in South America, according to the International Trade Outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean 2023 report by the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).
From 2010 to 2022, the region accounted for nearly one-third of China’s food imports. Brazil alone supplied about 21% of those imports over the same period.

“In recent years, there has been significant growth in telecommunications projects and across all areas of transportation – including airports, ports, roads, railways, and subways – as well as in sanitation and urban mobility. These sectors account for nearly 60% of the total number of projects,” said José Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs, executive secretary of ECLAC, who highlighted the scale of China’s involvement during the 2024 International Seminar on Contemporary China Studies in Costa Rica.
China has viewed Brazil as a strategic partner for several years, primarily because of its soybean supply, and has responded with infrastructure investments, according to Fernando Bastiani, a researcher with ESALQ-LOG, the Group of Research and Extension in Agroindustrial Logistics at the University of São Paulo.
“Today, COFCO has direct access to farmers, purchases soybeans, and oversees the entire commercialization chain, including storage and transport to China,” Bastiani said. “In recent years, [COFCO] has also realized it needs to control logistics systems and infrastructure, because that’s a key part.”
In Brazil, Bastiani explained, logistics costs account for 20% to 25% of the final soybean price, mainly due to the long distances between farms and ports and the high cost of trucking. “China understood that by investing in infrastructure, it could help make Brazil more competitive,” he said.
In May, the two countries signed new agreements to deepen their agricultural trade ties, granting Brazil authorization to export meat and ethanol byproducts. 
“Amid the changing and turbulent international landscape, China and Brazil should remain committed to the original aspiration of contributing to human progress and global development,” said President Xi Jinping during the meeting.
China’s pullback squeezes U.S. port volumes  
While Latin America has seen growth, many U.S. ports have experienced a significant decline in business.
At the New Orleans District — a dominant grain corridor — soybean exports grew by less than 3% between September 2024 and September 2025, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Shipments through the Los Angeles District fell almost 15%, while the steepest drop came in the Seattle District, where exports plunged 81%.
Nearly half of all U.S. corn, soybean and wheat exports move through the Mississippi River system, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s Market Intel report.

This major inland trade artery connects the Midwest’s farming regions to the Gulf of Mexico, carrying an average of 65 million metric tons annually of bulk agricultural products by barge over the past five years to export terminals near New Orleans, where shipments depart for international markets.
“The facilities that purchase soybeans from farmers extend to our freight railroads, where they don’t have as much volume that they’ve been moving, at least for soybeans,” said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition. 
Steenhoek noted that corn exports have remained strong, which has helped sustain some port activity — but it hasn’t solved the underlying problem: “China imports more U.S. soybeans than all of our other international customers combined,” he said.
At the Port of Los Angeles, the largest container port in the Western Hemisphere, agricultural exports have also weakened as trade with China cools.
“Exports in general have been very soft and we attributed it to the retaliatory tariffs that have been put in place by China,” said Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles. “Our single biggest export sector is agriculture … of that, soybeans are the number one export commodity.”
Before the first tariffs were introduced in 2018, China accounted for about 60% of the port’s business. Today, it’s closer to 40% and falling, as trade flows and sourcing shift toward countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. 
“We’ve been very aggressive in finding cargo out of other countries,” Seroka said. “But there is no doubt in my mind that we are concerned every day that these policies could impact the amount of cargo that comes to Los Angeles.”
The decrease in exports is not just a hit to farmers, but also to port workers; each four containers handled at the port generates one job, according to Seroka.
“In Southern California, one in nine people has a job related to this port,” said Seroka, referring to dockworkers, truck drivers, brokers and warehouse employees. “It truly is a conversation of national significance.”
U.S. port traffic isn’t poised for a quick rebound despite a recent trade agreement that ends China’s suspension of U.S. soybean imports. After six months of near-zero shipments due to retaliatory trade measures, Beijing in November agreed to purchase 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the final two months of 2025 and to commit to annual purchases of at least 25 million tons through 2028.

A recent analysis from Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture and farmdoc Daily said the announcement offered some relief to U.S. farmers at the tail end of harvest, but overall exports to China this year are still on track to be the weakest since 2018, when trade tensions during the first Trump administration slashed volumes to 8 million tons.
“It is very difficult to take a market [China] of over a billion people and replace that,” said John Bartman, a soybean farmer from Marengo, Illinois.
By October, Brazil had exported a record 79 million metric tons of soybeans to China, nearly 80% of its total soybean shipments during the period, according to a farmdoc Daily analysis of data from Brazil’s Foreign Trade Secretariat. Brazil’s total soybean exports reached about 100 million tons between January and October, already surpassing the country’s full-year total for 2024, which was just under 99 million tons.
“U.S. soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice,” Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association, wrote in a statement. 
US trade strategy remains unsettled as China moves ahead
While China builds long-term infrastructure to secure its supply chains, Washington is still struggling to define its trade strategy and to contain the political fallout of renewed tariffs.
In mid-September, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives moved to block Congress from influencing Trump’s tariff policy, even as Senate Democrats prepared to force votes challenging his trade war, The New York Times reported. The maneuver effectively stripped lawmakers of the ability to advance measures to lift tariffs until March 31, 2026, extending a prohibition first imposed in the spring to spare members from taking a politically difficult vote.
“Tariffs not only cause farmers to pay more for their inputs, but they have also seen tariffs reduce markets for U.S. farm products,” said U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, during an October session.

If the November soybean agreement between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping holds, Beijing’s purchases would still fall short of recent norms. Even if China buys at least 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually over the next three years, that volume would remain about 14% below the five-year average shipped to China from 2020 to 2024, according to an analysis from Purdue University’s Center for Commercial Agriculture and farmdoc daily.
Some purchases have started rolling in. But April Hemmes, an Iowa soybean farmer who has promoted increased trade with China, said the agreement would be difficult to fulfill, noting that delivering 12 million metric tons of soybeans by early next year is “not very realistic.”  
As China establishes new trade routes across Latin America, every new port or shipping lane makes a future recovery for U.S. farmers more challenging.
Despite the tensions, Hemmes still views China as an essential market. 
“I don’t think our relationship with China has been damaged,” the Iowa soybean farmer said. “China is a low-cost buyer and will need soybeans from the U.S. for a long time. But we will never be their number one source.”
For her, the changing politics and policies have made the United States an “unreliable trading partner.”
“The only way that we become their top choice would be if our soybeans were far cheaper than South America’s.”

Tennessee House Republican leaders will push forward a plan in 2026 to install a Memphis-Shelby County schools oversight panel that would seize significant decision-making authority from the locally elected school board.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton and education committee Chairman Mark White confirmed this month they are committed to working with the Senate to pass a form of takeover legislation in the 2026 legislative session.
Republicans in the two chambers failed to find a compromise after passing differing versions of the bill earlier this year amid ongoing frustrations with school board governance and academic performance issues. If lawmakers can agree this year, change could come quickly to Memphis-Shelby County schools, which is already primed for major upheaval in 2026.
White’s plan would essentially install a governing oversight board with the authority to veto part or all of the local school board’s budget, the largest single decision the school board is responsible for.
White argued the oversight board must have the “teeth” to make significant district decisions, compared to the 2025 Senate version of the plan that would operate as an advisory board.










I don’t believe an elected school board can fix decades of bureaucracy.


– Rep. Mark White, R-Memphis


The oversight board under White’s plan would also have approval authority for any contracts or expenses larger than $50,000 and essentially control final charter decisions in the district. White’s proposal would institute the board for three years, with the potential for another three-year extension.
“Putting a board in place that has no authority to do anything is a waste of time,” Sexton said. “It does nothing. If you’re going to put it in, then you’ve got to trust them to make the decisions.”
Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican carrying the Senate version of the bill, did not respond to a request for comment.
The Senate and House passed differing versions of the legislation in 2025, with the two chambers at odds over details of oversight board authority.
If Senate and House leaders can come to a compromise on the legislation when the General Assembly reconvenes in mid-January, it could quickly be passed into law. Because the bills are still live, the chambers could hash out any changes in conference without reverting back to a lengthy legislative committee process.
Potential oversight changes would be one of several significant changes on the horizon for Memphis schools.
The early 2025 firing of former Superintendent Marie Feagins ignited long-simmering dissatisfaction with the school board and triggered both local and state backlash. Now, all nine seats on the board are up for election in 2026, meaning Memphis voters may go to the primary ballot box this spring to vote for a board whose governing power could soon be greatly diminished under the legislative plan.
The board must also make a decision on the interim superintendent’s contract sometime in 2026.
White said he will move “full speed ahead” to enact “drastic” changes.
“I don’t believe an elected school board can fix decades of bureaucracy. I’m not putting blame on any past or present school board,” White said.
Legislative Democrats and Memphis-Shelby County school leaders have sharply criticized the takeover effort as political overreach, pointing to previous state takeover failures in the Achievement School District and incremental progress the district has made recently.
“State intervention in Memphis schools has historically failed to improve outcomes,” Memphis-Shelby County schools interim Superintendent Roderick Richmond said during a fall community meeting.
Launched a decade ago, the Achievement School District took control of low-performing schools and often turned them over to the charter operators. But the state intervention model led to no meaningful long-term improvements for students, research showed, and often sparked community backlash for takeovers in low-income neighborhoods.
Memphis schools have had some growth in recent years. This year, MSCS students outpaced the state average for academic growth in reading and math. More Memphis schools also earned top marks in Tennessee’s report card system for the 2024-2025 school year.
Tennessee lawmakers file Memphis Shelby Schools “hostile takeover” at last minute

Yet the district continues to lag significantly in academic achievement, with less than 25% of MSCS students meeting grade level benchmarks in reading and math on state tests.
Sexton suggested any improvement is too little, too late after decades of underperformance in the state’s largest school district.
Republicans are also eyeing an ongoing state financial audit of the district, though both Sexton and White said the takeover legislation would move ahead regardless of those findings.
White has denied that the legislation amounts to a state takeover, given that members of the governing board must be residents of Shelby County. White says he, along with other Memphis natives, believe “we have to have local intervention.”
But under White’s 2025 bill, the appointing power for the oversight board would sit in state government and, by extension, give the Republican Party governing authority of local schools in a majority Democratic county.
Under the House bill, the Tennessee governor would appoint five members, and the House and Senate speakers would receive two appointments each.
Critics of the legislation have also warned the measure could have ripple effects beyond Memphis and encroach on local control in other areas of the state, though the legislation currently only applies to Shelby County. White’s 2025 legislation could trigger an oversight board in a local district if:

50% or more of enrolled students did not meet state testing grade level expectations.
30% or more of schools in a district receive a D or F state letter grade.
25% or more of students enrolled were chronically absent in the most recent school year.
One or more schools have been identified as a priority school by the state education department.
And the local legislative body of the county approves a resolution of no confidence in the local school board.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin are pushing for the release of Jaciel Cirrus Rojas, who has been held in immigration detention since June. Rojas, a Mexican-born man who has lived in the U.S. since 2018, has no criminal record, Urban Milwaukee reported, and was arrested by immigration officers despite not being the target of their operation. 
An immigration judge ordered  Cirrus Rojas  released on  bond in July. But the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appealed his release and Cirrus Rojas remains in the Dodge County Jail. 
The judge’s order was vacated by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), followed by the denial of a federal court petition challenging the legality of Cirrus Rojas’ detention. Cirrus Rojas has had no contact with his wife and infant daughter for the 200 days during  which he has been detained. 
ACLU attorneys working for his release, say  Cirrus Rojas has a pending asylum claim and is  at risk of being tortured if deported to his home country. The hearing for Cirrus Rojas’ asylum claim has been rescheduled. Earlier this month, ACLU attorney Jennifer Bizzotto filed an emergency motion in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals pushing to overturn previous denials to release Rojas. 
“We have seen hundreds of cases nationwide in which federal judges have ruled that [immigration enforcement] cannot hold people in Cirrus Rojas’ position without bond hearings, and that has not deterred [immigration enforcement] from continuing to lock up people while flagrantly violating the law,” ACLU staff attorney Hannah Schwarz said in a statement.

An ever larger portion of ICE arrests involve people like Cirrus Rojas  who have no   criminal record

This year, with some help from anonymous elves, we start in Frankfort and move on to Washington.
Gov. Andy Beshear: Two weeks in California, to better understand Gov. Gavin Newsom, perhaps his leading rival for Democrats’ 2028 presidential nomination. I always thought a smart-ass such as Newsom couldn’t be elected president, but Donald Trump has lowered the bar for presidential behavior.
Secretary of State Michael Adams: In rejecting Justice Department demands for private data on Kentucky voters, the Republican qualified for a JFK Profile in Courage Award, but he got that one for real last year, so he gets a knock-off of the Heisman Trophy for giving Trumpers a stiff arm.
Former attorney general Daniel Cameron, U.S. Senate candidate: A copy of “Fundraising for Dummies.” Cameron’s no dummy, and has led in polls, but has had trouble raising money.
Businessman Nate Morris: A Trump Casino Hotel bag, to signify baggage that he (or any winner of the Republican Senate primary) may carry if the president keeps spiraling downward in so many ways.
U.S. Rep. Andy Barr of the 6th District, the primary’s betting favorite: A bottle of Canadian whiskey, which seems to have overtaken bourbon as Canadians’ drink of choice due to Trump’s tariffs, which Barr supported “100%” in April.
Fifth District Rep. Hal Rogers, who is running for a 24th term, will turn 88 Dec. 31, and votes pretty much the way his Trumpy district wants though he’s long been in the Chowder and Marching Club of Republican traditionalists: A framed photo of the late Sen. John Sherman Cooper, his fellow Somerset townsman, to remind him of his roots.
Fourth District Rep. Thomas Massie: A good-luck charm in his primary race with Trump-endorsed Ed Gallrein of Shelbyville. Massie gives voters of all stripes plenty to disagree with, but is perhaps the greatest example of independence from the executive branch that we need in Congress to maintain our democratic republic. His libertarian soulmate, Sen. Rand Paul, has done much of that, too.
Third District Rep. Morgan McGarvey: A holiday gift basket to pass along to his former colleagues in the state legislature, who seem to have resisted pressure from the Trump White House to carve up the Louisville district of the only Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation, like Tennessee gerrymandered Nashville.
Second District Rep. Brett Guthrie: A model of a Ford F-150 Lightning, which the company will stop making as it cuts its losses on electric vehicles and its huge new battery plant in Guthrie’s district. Beshear, looking to shift blame for a bad bet, pointed at Guthrie and Trump, citing Guthrie’s vote for the Trump bill that passed the House by one vote and cut EV subsidies. Guthrie replied, “Mandating everybody buy an electric car is not what the American people want.” That was a mandate in Europe, not the U.S.; Joe Biden did allow such a mandate in California, which has great market influence.
First District Rep. James Comer: An Autopen signature machine, like the one he accused the Biden White House of misusing, so he can get more familiar with the device as he aims toward his 2027 goal of becoming governor — an office in which the Autopen is frequently used.
Sen. Mitch McConnell: As he and wife Elaine Chao contemplate retirement, a cannabis sativa plant to practice the horticulture needed to keep it under 0.3 percent THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. That’s the limit set for hemp products by his 2018 legislation, which opened a loophole for producers of concentrated cannabinoid products — which McConnell and others closed recently, while delaying the change for a year to allow the issue to be fully lobbied and negotiated.
All members of Kentucky’s delegation: A district-by-district, county-by-county list of the numbers of Kentuckians (more than 100,000 overall) who have used extra Biden-era premium subsidies to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and the impact of their expiration. Comer, whose district would be hit hardest, has said the subsidies should be extended a year or two, but Guthrie, chairman of the House committee that handles health care, has been quiet.

(Photo by Gary Cifers/Getty Images)It’s late afternoon, the last workday before Christmas break at the headquarters of Virginia’s Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Its chairman and head honcho, Tim Hugo, is tidying up his office and about to grab his coat and head home when the intercom on his desk phone buzzes.
“Mr. Hugo, a Mr. Schneiderman from Dewey, Screwum & Howe on line two for you,” says a woman’s voice with a sweet Southside lilt.
Not the start to the holiday season the chairman hoped for. There were parties to attend. Celebrations to be had. The boss was ready to start a jolly, relaxing winter respite. This call from a notorious litigation firm could not bring good tidings of great joy. It would be a total buzzkill after a buoyant month for Virginia’s state-run distilled spirits monopoly.
A couple of days after Thanksgiving, a masked bandit had broken into the ABC’s Ashland store one night and ransacked it, treating himself to a legendary bender before passing out next to the store’s commode from the booze he had plundered. Because the burglar was a cuddly, furry raccoon, pictures and videos of the crime and its adorable perpetrator went viral online and generated global press coverage, giving the ABC an unprecedented marketing bonanza that money couldn’t buy.
Or could it?
“Can this wait?” Hugo asked the receptionist.
“He says it’s a pressing matter concerning the misappropriation of someone’s likeness, Tim.”
Hugo sighs and rolls his eyes. Lawyers, am I right? He lifted the receiver and pressed the blinking button for line two.
“Season’s greetings, Mr. Hugo, and here’s wishing us all a prosperous new year,” Schneiderman said.
“Us?” Hugo said.
“Sure. You. Me. The ABC. The state treasury. And, as of a couple of hours ago, my client — Mr. Rupert D. Raccoon, whose name, image and likeness you and/or your designees, among others, have gratuitously exploited for crass commercial gain without Mr. Raccoon’s knowledge or consent,” Schneiderman sneered. “And then, he’s given this defamatory nickname: ‘Trashed Panda!’ Do you know how offensive it is to raccoons to be called pandas?”
Hugo muttered something unprintable under his breath. How, he wondered, had something so perfect turned so rancid so fast? There would be no merry neighborhood wassailing this frosty night.
In a hollow tree in a wooded buffer abutting an affluent residential subdivision in the Richmond suburb of Hanover County, Rupert D. Raccoon was regaling a gaze of his closest masked, ring-tailed friends and kin with tales of his late Ashland adventure.
“Y’all brag about your legendary college parties, but answer me this: How many of you broke into a liquor store — Mission Impossible-style! — drank half its inventory and passed out on the concrete floor inches from the commode?” Rupert said.
It was no rhetorical question. Rupert was serious. Newly enrolled in a 12-step program, yes, but darn serious! They looked at him, spellbound and wide-eyed.
“So, you dropped in from the ceiling, then what? — just started chugging bottles of Patron tequila? Glenlivet scotch? Blanton’s bourbon?” asked Oscar, Rupert’s first cousin.
“Nah. That’s top-shelf stuff. Not that I didn’t try. In my advanced inebriation, the only bottles I could knock over, break and slurp off the floor were lower-shelf brands — rail liquor at a bar,” Rupert said. “Couldn’t beat the price, though.”
That evoked a round of snickers and titters.
“How’d you like the drunk tank, rookie?” scoffed Karla, a tattooed, hard-partying sow who called herself “the Godzilla of Tequila Shots.” All the boars knew better than to challenge her.
“I woke up behind bars starving, my head’s pounding, and everybody in there was howling or barking super loud,” Rupert said. “One of my captors sees me looking like death warmed over, snatches me up and stuffs me in a county truck. I’m begging him for a chalupa and Diet Coke from the Taco Bell drive-thru, but no! A few miles later, he pulls over, turns me loose on the side of the road and warns me to stay out of Ashland.”
Felix, one of the more youthful and inquisitive of Rupert’s crew, had scaled a five-foot wooden privacy fence and nestled himself on one of the support posts to see what was playing on the 75-inch flat screen that covered most of one wall in some suburban family’s Florida room. It was tuned to “Inside Edition,” and what Felix saw stunned him.
“Rupe!” Felix yelled over his shoulder. “You’re gonna wanna see this.”
Rupert joined Felix on the fence line in time to glimpse a photo of himself passed out belly-down on a restroom floor between a toilet and a waste can, his four legs splayed helplessly in varied directions. Grainy, monochrome security camera footage showed Rupert reeling and lurching, hither and yon, after hours in the ABC store amid $250 or more worth of spilled hootch from shattered bottles. 
Then the image shifted to a winsome AI rendering of Rupert’s face hawking various ABC liquor deals and cocktail recipes. They were selling T-shirts and other swag bearing his caricature. The chyron in the screen’s bottom third read “‘Trashed Panda’ Nets $180K for Va. Animal Shelter.”
“What the (censored)?” Rupert said. “Where’s my cut?”

Harvey Schneiderman had been browbeating and trying to intimidate Hugo for nearly 30 minutes. He told Hugo that his client, Rupert, had rights! He would not be involuntarily used as some monopoly agency’s unpaid marketing pitchcritter!
“He’s a freakin’ raccoon, Harvey! A small, carnivorous, largely nocturnal creature of the wild!” Chairman Hugo said, his patience wearing thin.
“Yeah and just a few years ago, colleges and the NCAA told ballplayers they had no right to share in the hundreds of millions of bucks EA Sports and Nintendo raked in from depicting those players in video games, right down to their jersey numbers and tattoos, until a unanimous Supreme Court saw it differently,” Schneiderman countered.
“You can’t plausibly compare a wild animal to Heisman Trophy candidates,” Hugo protested, his face reddening.
“Let’s see what a jury says,” Schneiderman shot back. “Mr. Raccoon may be a small woodland dweller who feeds largely on frogs, freshwater crustaceans, the occasional discarded chalupa or whatever he can scavenge from trash cans, but look at that sweet little face splashed all over your merch and advertising. It’s a face a jury would love, Mr. Hugo. Maybe a face worth six or even seven figures if we go to court.”
“OK, Harvey,” an exasperated Chairman Hugo said. “Fax me your settlement offer. We’ll be in touch early next year.”
“No, you’ll be in touch now or we file tomorrow because I know that after January 17th, the Republican governor who appointed you leaves office, a Democrat takes over, and … well, I don’t have to tell you about political spoils,” Schneiderman said.
Hugo tried to speak calmly through his clenched teeth. “OK, your client gets a handle of Ancient Age whiskey a month and free chalupas for life — our best and final.”
“Toss in a subscription to Animal Planet and we’ve got a deal,” the wily litigator said.
Hugo grunted his grudging assent and hung up. Lawyers! Bah! Humbug!

Whitney Downard came to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star from our sister outlet in Indiana, starting the day before the November election. 
I thought with only two months of Whitney’s work to choose from, picking a favorite would be simple. That’s not the case, but I settled on this great article about an Allegheny County couple, Jaime and Carrie Wright, who are already juggling copays and debt to pay for Jaime’s cancer treatment regimen.
Juggling will turn into struggling next year when the Wrights’ health insurance premium increases by 265% as a result of Congress not renewing Affordable Care Act tax credits that reduce the cost of health insurance purchased through the state exchange, Pennie.
The Wrights’ story is one that shows how political and policy decisions at the highest levels of government affect people that we as journalists strive to tell. In this case, the Washington, D.C., lawmakers’ decision not to extend the tax credits will upend the personal finances of 500,000 people across the commonwealth who rely on Pennie to afford health insurance.

Congressional health insurance tug-o-war puts Pennsylvanians in a lurch


Emily Previti also joined the Capital-Star this year, bringing years of experience as a journalist for print and public media organizations.
In this article, Emily examines the state of the decades-long effort by Pennsylvania advocates and lawmakers to establish a system to compensate people who have been released from prison after being wrongfully convicted of a crime. 
While many states have a mechanism to provide monetary compensation for lost years behind bars, Pennsylvania does not. But the proposal introduced this year contains a phrase that could present an insurmountable legal barrier for those entitled to compensation.
While a conviction can be reversed on the basis of new evidence that creates reasonable doubt about a person’s culpability for a crime, the compensation bill now under consideration requires proof of actual innocence, which would put redress beyond the reach of many exonerees.
This is an issue that I’ve covered in the past and Emily’s story shows that more work needs to be done by lawmakers’ to reach a workable solution. 
Emily’s audio version was one of the first pieces produced for radio, and she has worked with the rest of the Capital-Star staff to bring their stories to a different audience. Listen for us on your favorite Pennsylvania public radio station.

Pennsylvania’s wrongful conviction bill could leave many behind


Ian Karbal wrote about a $5 million Easter egg in the state budget for William Penn School District in Delaware County, which is represented in the state House by Democratic Speaker Joanna McClinton.
By asking questions, Ian revealed that the extra money was a result of direct advocacy by members of the school board. 
William Penn was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against the state that led to the historic court ruling that Pennsylvania’s reliance on real estate tax to fund schools unconstitutionally deprives students in the least wealthy districts of educational opportunities.
The district was among those forced to borrow money to sustain operations as a result of this year’s five-month budget impasse. 
It was also reeling from the discovery of a $9.2 million bookkeeping error that forced district officials to consider cutting staff, including administrators and academic interventionists who work one-on-one with struggling students.
The story shows how the budget process sometimes comes down to asking the right person for money and that the state’s least funded school districts are still fighting to stabilize their finances two years after winning a judgment against the commonwealth.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)The conservation group Wild Virginia has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, alleging the agency failed to protect Virginia’s rivers and streams from PFAS, commonly known as “forever chemicals.”
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are harmful chemicals linked to manufacturing runoff, fire fighting materials, and everyday consumer products such as water resistant clothing and nonstick cookware. Exposure to PFAS has been associated with serious health risks, including cancer and reduced fertility in women.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Eastern District Court of Virginia, challenges the EPA’s approval of the state’s 2024 water quality report. Wild Virginia argues that the federal agency should have intervened after concluding that Virginia did not do enough to address contaminated waterways. State data shows that several rivers and streams are polluted with PFAS, including the Middle Chickahominy River, which has been under PFAS investigation since 2021. 
The EPA has kept National Primary Drinking Water Regulations in place for several PFAS chemicals, establishing limits for what is considered safe in drinking water. However, there are thousands of different PFAS compounds, and regulations often lag behind emerging contamination, leaving many chemicals unregulated. 
The complaint points to six years of PFAS data collected by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality that identified multiple streams with elevated levels of the chemicals. Despite those findings, the lawsuit alleges, some waterways were not classified as “impaired” in the state’s water quality report. 
In one case, PFAS levels were so high in the Chichahominy River and White Oak Swamp that DEQ issued a fish tissue consumption advisory in May 2025. The lawsuit claims that despite those warnings, the waters were not listed as impaired in the final report submitted to the EPA.
“There are many other waters around the state where they have data showing PFAS contamination in the surface waters themselves,” said David Sligh, the water quality program director for Wild Virginia. “They mentioned PFAs in their report, they really didn’t do any analysis as to what that means or how those are related to their own water quality standards.”
The EPA finalized its rule on PFAS exposure in drinking water in April 2024.
In its report, the Virginia DEQ wrote: “In December 2024, EPA published draft recommended water quality criteria protective of human health for PFOA, PFOS, and PFBS. These criteria are designed specifically to protect public water supplies and fish consumption and reflect a lifetime exposure duration of 70 years. These criteria will not be considered for adoption in Virginia’s water quality standards regulation until they are finalized by EPA. Once effective they would be used to assess waters in subsequent integrated reports.”
Sligh said that the EPA was “required to acknowledge, assess and designate waters that are impaired if their narrative water quality criteria are violated, those criteria say if there are pollutants that are causing toxic or harmful conditions for humans or wildlife, then they’re supposed to count those as standards violations. And so that hasn’t changed, and they didn’t need to wait on anything from the EPA.” 
The EPA approved Virginia’s water quality report in July 2025. According to Wild Virginia, the agency acknowledged the state’s PFAS contamination but declined to take enforcement action. 
The group argues in its lawsuit that the decision will delay required pollution controls while residents of the commonwealth will continue to be exposed to the chemicals. 
The complaint further alleges that the EPA’s inaction violates the federal Clean Water Act. The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the agency to identify the PFAS-impaired waters so that pollution reduction plans can be developed and implemented.
In 2024, the Virginia General Assembly passed a law intended to create a statewide plan to  address elevated PFAS levels in waterways and identify pollution sources through self reporting requirements.

For years, a team of experts has traveled from tiny town to tiny town in New Hampshire, helping the communities plan and execute clean energy strategies. Now the idea has secured federal funding to expand nationwide — a notable win as the Trump administration claws back billions of dollars for decarbonization policy.






The $3 million in funding was included in the fiscal 2026 agriculture spending package that President Donald Trump signed into law last month as part of the bill that reopened the government after the shutdown this fall. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from the Granite State, led the push for the pilots, which could help municipalities not only cut greenhouse gas emissions but save money as energy costs rise nationwide.


“It’s very exciting to us that Sen. Shaheen saw what we were doing and saw the potential,” said Sarah Brock, director of the New Hampshire program, dubbed Energy Circuit Rider. ​“It would be amazing to have versions of this program scattered across the country to help communities understand and find solutions to whatever their energy challenges are.”


Shaheen’s office hopes to get the program — which will be administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service — up and running within the next year. Because it is a pilot, it does not have to go through the same extensive regulatory processes as other programs, which should allow a relatively timely implementation, a Senate aide said.


Shaheen originally proposed a national version of the program with an annual budget of $25 million in standalone legislation in 2023, and again in June 2025, before pushing to include the smaller pilot in November’s spending bill.


“The commonsense energy circuit riders pilot is an important and effective way for communities to get the tools they need to take on clean energy and energy efficiency projects that lower costs,” Shaheen said in a statement to Canary Media.


The seeds of New Hampshire’s program were planted roughly a decade ago, as towns and cities across the state formed energy committees tasked with lowering power bills and emissions, Brock said. Clean energy advocates began talking about how to support these groups, which were made up of volunteers with widely varying levels of expertise, and which often served small towns without the resources to hire staff focused on energy issues.


The conversation turned to the idea of hiring a ​“circuit rider,” a position modeled on the traveling preachers, judges, and doctors of centuries past, who provided their services to communities along their route. In 2018, the Neil and Louise Tillotson Fund, a foundation that supports causes in New Hampshire’s rural north, funded a position for a full-time clean energy expert who would provide knowledge and support to any town in the region at no cost. Nonprofit Clean Energy New Hampshire agreed to host the new hire.







The first energy circuit rider, Melissa Elander, had a mission statement but no real guidance on how to do her new job. She spent her first year introducing herself to towns throughout the region, offering her services as a researcher, consultant, and grant writer, and she slowly began to rack up some wins, Brock said. The first initiative she supported was an energy-efficient lighting project for the town of Whitefield, population 2,500.














“As word of those successes spread, more and more communities were interested,” Brock said. ​“It was clear to us there was something here.”


Today, the program has six energy circuit riders on staff, including Elander. It has expanded to cover all of the state’s 234 municipalities — 138 of which the program has provided support for — as well as small businesses. The team has helped towns navigate a wide range of projects, including weatherization of public buildings, solar installations, and planning for fleet electrification. Clean Energy New Hampshire does not have complete data, but estimates that just 41% of completed projects have yielded $4.26 million in total savings for municipalities.


The program was vital to the successful completion of an all-electric, solar-powered library in the community of Barrington, said Cynthia Hoisington, chair of the town’s energy committee. The municipality worked with an energy circuit rider to manage the process of accepting bids and choosing a vendor for the solar installation.


“You need a trusted expert in these special-knowledge situations when you want to make sure you’re doing what’s right for your town,” Hoisington said. ​“The bottom line is a lot of this never would’ve gotten done without their help.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)GOP reversals in this year’s elections, especially in some urban and immigrant communities, are setting off alarm bells for Republicans using redistricting to try to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterms.
Redistricting plans demanded by President Donald Trump in states such as Texas and Missouri — meant to capitalize on his stronger showing among certain urban voters in the 2024 election — could backfire, as cities in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia returned to Democratic voting patterns in off-year elections this past November.
Experts see the shift as a sign of possible souring on the administration’s immigration enforcement agenda, combined with disappointment in economic conditions.
An ever-larger share of ICE’s arrested immigrants have no criminal record

Paul Brace, an emeritus political science professor of legal studies at Rice University in Houston, said Texas Republicans are likely to gain less than they imagine from new maps designed to pick up five additional seats for the party. He said minority voters’ interest in Trump was “temporary” and that he had underperformed on the economy.
“Trump’s redistricting efforts are facing headwinds and, even in Texas, may not yield all he had hoped,” Brace said.
Redistricting efforts in Texas spawned a retaliatory plan in California aimed at getting five more Democratic seats. Other states have leapt into the fray, with Republicans claiming an overall edge of three potential seats in proposed maps.
Cuban-born Jose Arango, chair of the Hudson County Republican Party in New Jersey, said immigration enforcement has gone too far and caused a backlash at the polls.
“There are people in the administration who frankly don’t know what the hell is going on,” Arango said. “If you arrest criminals, God bless you. We don’t want criminals in our streets. But then you deport people who have been here 30 years, 20 years, and have contributed to society, have been good people for the United States. You go into any business in agriculture, the hospitality business, even the guy who cuts the grass — they’re all undocumented. Who’s going to pick our tomatoes?”
As immigration arrests increase this year, a growing share of those detained have no criminal convictions.
New Jersey’s 9th Congressional District, which includes urban Paterson, went from a surprising Trump win last year to a lopsided victory this year for Democratic Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill. Trump won the district last year by 3 percentage points and Sherrill won by 16 points. The district is majority-minority and 39% immigrant.
There was a similar turnaround in Miami, a majority-immigrant city that elected a Democratic mayor for the first time in almost 30 years. Parts of immigrant-rich Northern Virginia also shifted in the governor’s race there.











There is an element of Trump-curious minority voters staying home this year.


– J. Miles Coleman, an associate editor at the University of Virginia Center for Politics



In the New Jersey district, Billy Prempeh, a Republican whose parents emigrated from Ghana, lost a surprisingly close 2024 race for U.S. House to Democrat Nellie Pou, of Puerto Rican descent, who became the first Latina from New Jersey to serve in Congress.
Prempeh this year launched another campaign for the seat, but withdrew after Sherrill won the governor’s race, telling Stateline that any Republican who runs for that seat “is going to get slaughtered.”
Prempeh doesn’t blame Trump or more aggressive immigration enforcement for the shift. He said his parents and their family waited years to get here legally, and he objects to people being allowed to stay for court dates after they crossed the border with Mexico.
“We aren’t deporting enough people. Not everybody agrees with me on that,” Prempeh said.
Parts of Virginia saw similar voting pattern changes. Prince William County, south of Washington, D.C., saw support for Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger jump to 67% compared with 57% for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris last year. The county is about 26% immigrant and 27% Hispanic.
Asian American and Hispanic voters shifted more Democratic this year in both New Jersey and Virginia, said J. Miles Coleman, an associate editor at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, expanding on a November post on the subject.
However, some of those Virginia voters might have sat out the governor’s race, Coleman said.
“I do think there is an element of Trump-curious minority voters staying home this year,” Coleman said. “There were many heavily Asian and Hispanic precincts in Northern Virginia that saw this huge percentage swing from Harris to Spanberger, but also saw relatively weak turnout.”
The pattern is “hard to extrapolate” to Texas or other states with new maps, Coleman said, “but Democrats are probably liking what they saw in this year’s elections.”
He said one of the redrawn districts in Texas is now likely to go to Democrats: the majority-Hispanic 28th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Antonio and South Texas. And the nearby 34th Congressional District is now a tossup instead of leaning Republican, according to new Center for Politics projections.
More industries want Trump’s help hiring immigrant labor after farms get a break

The pattern in New Jersey’s 9th Congressional District this year was consistent in Hispanic areas statewide, according to an analysis provided to Stateline by Michael Foley, elections coordinator of State Navigate, a Virginia-based nonprofit that analyzes state election data.
New Jersey Hispanic precincts “swung heavily” toward Sherrill compared with their 2024 vote for Harris, Foley said in an email. He noted that New Jersey and Florida Hispanic populations are largely from the Caribbean and may not reflect patterns elsewhere, such as Texas where the Hispanic population is heavily Mexican American.
Pou, who won the New Jersey seat, said economics played a part in this year’s electoral shift.
“The President made a promise to my constituents that he’d lower costs and instead he’s made the problem worse with his tariffs that raised costs across the board,” Pou said in a statement to Stateline.
Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said immigration and pocketbook issues both played a role in places like the 9th District, as did an influx of Democratic campaign money.
“The biggest reason is a sense of letdown in President Trump,” Rasmussen said. “There were many urban voters who decided they liked what Trump was saying, they liked the Hispanic outreach, they bought into his economic message. And just one year later, they’re equally disillusioned.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderState officials have introduced a $1.4 billion plan to improve rural health outcomes over the next five years under the federal Rural Health Transformation Program created as part of this summer’s budget reconciliation bill.
In a 96-page application, officials from the state’s Department of Community Health requested funds to improve access to primary and specialty care in rural areas, strengthen telehealth infrastructure and recruit more health care providers across the state’s dozens of rural counties.
“Our broader vision is that rural populations are healthier, live longer, have an improved quality of life, and can both live and work in the communities they love,” said Stuart Portman, Georgia’s Medicaid director, during the Board of Community Health meeting this month.
Georgia’s rural counties face higher rates of poverty, heart disease and cancer than their urban counterparts, according to the state’s application for the program. Rural counties are also less likely to have pediatricians or OB/GYNs, and have lower rates of employee-sponsored health insurance.
There are limits to how Georgia can use the money, however. Funding must be allocated according to the program’s guidelines and will be subject to strict oversight by the federal government, Portman explained to the committee. The portion of money that goes to payments for health care providers, for instance, cannot exceed 15% of the total funds.
“We could not do things that created ongoing obligations for the state or the federal government,” Portman said. “Importantly, there’s a strong desire to not include things that create a [financial] cliff.”
There were also a few rules that echo larger priorities of President Donald Trump and his administration. Funds cannot be used toward gender-affirming care for children or adults and largely cannot be used to cover abortion care. Hospitals may also be required to collect information on patients’ immigration status to be eligible for reimbursement under the program.
All 50 states submitted applications for the program, which were due in early November. Half of the annual $10 billion in federal funding will be divided evenly among states with approved plans across a five-year period, and the rest will be awarded based on need, program design and federal scoring criteria. 
Officials at the Georgia Department of Community Health said the funds for the first year could be delivered by the end of the year.
How would Georgia’s rural health funding be allocated?
Georgia’s program, which state officials have named Georgia Rural Enhancement And Transformation of Health, or GREAT Health, would invest funds from the Rural Health Transformation Program across 29 separate projects, which fall into five major categories.


If approved, the largest bucket of funding, encompassing over $428 million, will be used to help up to 86 eligible hospitals transition to a program known as Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design, or the AHEAD Model. The program, which was created by the federal CMS Innovation Center, is designed to limit the growth of health care spending, in part by emphasizing primary and preventative care.
The program would also allocate $175 million toward improving hospital infrastructure in rural areas. The proposal would help fund electrical grid improvements, water and air quality assessments and other upgrades to ensure that facilities can weather severe storms and natural disasters without endangering patients or disrupting their care.
A proposed $148 million would go toward recruiting and retaining health care providers in rural areas by establishing 75 new residency slots each year in fields like family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics, as well as establishing a new rural recruitment incentive grant program for certain providers who agree to practice in rural areas for at least five years.
A few private organizations, including the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals and the Georgia Hospital Association, also submitted letters as part of the state’s application for the program, alongside letters from state officials like Gov. Brian Kemp and Department of Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey.
HomeTown Health CEO Jimmy Lewis, who also signed onto the state’s application for the program, said he was glad to see such a comprehensive interest in rural health at the state and federal levels.
The funds, he added, “could help us offset some of the years-ago losses” that some of the rural hospitals in his network are facing.
H.R. 1 fallout
For proponents of the Rural Health Transformation Program, the estimated $1.4 billion in rural health funding comes as a much-needed reprieve for struggling providers.
But critics say the program won’t make up for drastic Medicaid funding cuts enshrined in the “one big, beautiful bill” that Trump signed into law over the summer. According to a new report from the Georgia Health Initiative, the state will lose an estimated $5.4 billion in Medicaid funding over the next 10 years as a result of the legislation, and 460,000 people will become uninsured.
Leah Chan, director of health justice at Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said that higher rates of uninsured Georgians could spell disaster for rural hospitals, many of which receive the vast majority of their funding from Medicaid payments. If that Medicaid funding is diminished, hospitals may be required to provide emergency care without any compensation.
“We know that many of those rural safety net hospitals are already under substantial pressure due in part to high uncompensated care costs,” Chan said. “The loss of the supplementary federal funds basically adds fuel to what is already a smoldering fire for us in terms of our health care system.”
Though some congressional Republicans billed the Rural Health Transformation Program as a solution to Medicaid funding cuts, Chan argued that the funds will not address the biggest issue facing rural hospitals.
“What we can see from the application is, in fact, these rural health transformation funds do not address the loss of these federal provider payments,” she said. “So essentially, our state is left to pick up the tab.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hospital-sign.jpg,,,2025-12-24 05:12:06.188775

For members of the diaspora, each piece is personal.","An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things

Lubow Wolynetz has served as a curator with the Ukrainian Museum and Library in Stamford for over four decades. Many of the items in the collection were passed down, over generations and across continents, and they hold deep meaning, she said.
They are bits of the national identity Ukrainians are fighting to keep alive.
“We have duplicates and triplicates, but we save them so that when Ukraine — when they’re finally free — [we can] send it there,” she said.
Wolynetz said she believes the current war, and the hardships that have come with it, has elevated the art’s significance.

Among the variety of folk art showcased in the museum is row after row of colorful vyshyvankas — embroidered shirts made by artisans across Ukraine, from the Carpathian Mountains in the west to the rivers in the east, each with distinct patterns and styles.
“The Ukrainians were always a nation that was overpowered by a stronger nation. So most of the populace had to learn how to survive within the oppression of the powers,” Wolynetz said. “The way they did it is that they would stick to their traditions. And one of these traditions would be their outfits and the way they dress, the way they created things around them.”

Oleksandra Storchai, a senior research associate at the Ivan Honchar Museum in Kyiv, said Ukrainian history “has many tragic pages,” when it was taken over by outside interests. “Traditional folk culture was the only thing that helped to keep the identity,” she said.
Vyshyvankas have held a particular strength in that regard. According to the tradition, the embroidered patterns and designs serve as amulets meant to protect the wearer. 
“It has an inner meaning,” Storchai said. 
“It’s a much wider picture than just stitching,” Wolynetz said. “It’s one of the basic identities that we have.”

Threading old and new worlds
In West Hartford, retiree and artist Yelena Kirshon is working on curating her 12th Ukrainian art exhibition, set to take place in April. Kirshon, who grew up in Ukraine, also teaches folk art classes — focused on the Eastern painting style of Petrykivka — and sells handmade jewelry. 
Proceeds from those endeavors have been supporting the Fastiv School of Folk Crafts, in Fastiv, Ukraine — a town about 40 miles southwest of Kyiv, where Kirshon’s niece, Oksana Zuienko, is the director.

The school seeks to revive Ukrainian folk craft traditions, ranging from woodwork to embroidery, Zuienko said. Over 500 children attend its afterschool classes, and several former students have been recognized nationally for their work. (Kirshon is one of those former students — the school is where she learned Petrykivka painting.)
“Children delve into the roots of our past,” Zuienko said. “They know our customs and rituals. They know our symbolism.”
Of the school’s 18 teachers, most have a partner or relative on the frontline. The war’s impact on the school, however, doesn’t end there.

In early December, Fastiv suffered three consecutive nights of drone strikes. Explosions ripped through the approximately 45,000-person town, decimating the train station and train depot. At the Fastiv School of Folk Crafts, just half a mile from the impact, the blasts knocked canvases down from the walls. 
But the sleepless nights and the threat of more attacks failed to deter the school’s staff or students. On the day following the three-day strike, students dutifully filed into their classes after school. 
In one room, 7-year-old Nadiia honed her beading technique. In another, two young boys worked with clay, surrounded by the ceramic creations of their predecessors.
The money that Kirshon has raised in Connecticut made it possible for the school to add a toilet, which allowed younger children to enroll.

In the school’s main room, which doubles as a museum, sisters Alisa and Diana watched in a corner as their teachers assembled wheat in a typical holiday sheaf known as didukh. Around them, nearly every surface was adorned with embroidery, traditional easter eggs and paintings in the Petrykivka style.
Around 5 p.m., Fastiv went dark. Power cuts have become a daily occurrence in Ukraine, as Russia has targeted the nation’s energy infrastructure during cold months. Unable to continue teaching in the darkness, teachers sent the students home early. 
The neighborhood was submerged in darkness. Car headlights lit the streets, which were suffused with the hum of generators and the faint smell of gas.

Stitching together a community
Driving through the east side of Stamford, the grandeur of the stone manor at 161 Glenbrook Road stands out amidst rows of multi-family homes. The ornately decorated Stamford estate, which now serves as home to the Ukrainian Museum and Library, was purchased by Bishop Constantine Bohachevsky in 1933 with the intention of establishing a cultural institution. 
The collection sits beyond iron gates, down a winding driveway and through a heavy wooden door. Dozens of models and cases dispersed through wood-paneled rooms display colorful stitching from across Ukraine.
For Wolynetz, the vyshyvankas, in particular, hold deep personal significance. 
She first encountered embroidery as a displaced person living in Germany in the 1940s after fleeing her hometown in Western Ukraine during the Dnieper-Carpathian offensive. Growing up in a camp for displaced people, she observed as her mother and other women would gather to stitch clothing with distinct patterns from their hometowns. 
She recalled that her embroidery teacher in Germany would “pull up an old suitcase” to show the class examples of the craft. “And when I saw that, I just said, ‘When I grow up, I’m going to have the same kind of [suitcase.]”
Now in her 80s, Wolynetz teaches workshops in Ukrainian embroidery techniques in Connecticut and New York. And she proudly carries her own suitcase to class.
One series of those workshops recently took place this autumn at the Ukrainian Museum in New York, on the lower level of a building where traditional Ukrainian easter eggs, paintings and other art adorn the halls. Every week, over a dozen students gather to learn embroidery from Wolynetz. 

Patterns and colored threads spilled onto the table as she unzipped her suitcase at the start of the session. She was met with a mix of friendly chatter and technical questions from the students. Mostly women, with backgrounds ranging from Puerto Rican to Italian-American to Ukrainian, the students shared bits of their personal lives with each other amidst their triumphs and struggles with the craft.
“It’s one of those social groups that you wish was around more,” Wolynetz said.
One student, Jo Ann Radioli, said she found the class after joining an initiative to embroider amulets for soldiers fighting on the Ukrainian frontline. 
The samples that were mailed to her to replicate seemed daunting. “It was like jumping off the end of a diving board,” Radioli said. “Because I found Lubow, I felt I could do it.”
In the past, soldiers would go to war, return, and stop wearing embroidery. This practice was especially common after the first and second World Wars, where Ukrainians were forbidden from wearing vyshyvanka, and embroidered items were seized or destroyed. 
Storchai, of Kyiv’s Ivan Honchar Museum, said today’s war is different. Some Ukrainian soldiers are wearing embroidery under their military uniforms and even off the battlefield, she said. “It’s like spiritual armor.”

(Paramount)Along with millions of others, I’ll soon be taking 2 hours and 10 minutes out of my busy holiday schedule to sit down and watch a movie I’ve seen countless times before: Frank Capra’s “It’s a Wonderful Life,” which tells the story of a man’s existential crisis one Christmas Eve in the fictional town of Bedford Falls.

There are lots of reasons why this eight-decade-old film still resonates, from its nostalgic pleasures to its cultural critiques.
But when I watch it this year, the sequence where Bedford Falls transforms into the dark and dystopian “Pottersville” will resonate the most.
In the film, protagonist George Bailey, who’s played by Jimmy Stewart, is on the brink of suicide. He seems to have achieved the hallmarks of the American dream: He’s taken over his father’s loan business, married the love of his life and fathered four excessively adorable children. But George feels stifled and beaten down. His Uncle Billy has misplaced US$8,000 of the company’s money, and the town’s resident tyrant, Mr. Potter, is using the mishap to try to ruin George, who’s his last remaining business competitor.
An angel named Clarence is tasked with pulling George back from the brink. To stop him from attempting suicide, Clarence decides to show George what life would have been like if he’d never been born. In this alternate reality, Bedford Falls is called Pottersville, a place Mr. Potter runs as a ruthless banker and slumlord.
Pottersville, the dark, dystopian version of Bedford Falls, is a place characterized by vice and moral decay. (Paramount)
Having previously written about “It’s a Wonderful Life” in my book on literary and film censorship, I can’t help but see parallels between Pottersville and the U.S. today.
Think about it:
In Pottersville, one man hoards all the financial profits and political power.
In Pottersville, greed, corruption, and cynicism reign supreme.
In Pottersville, hard-working immigrants like Giuseppe Martini who were able to build a life and run a business in Bedford Falls have vanished.
In Pottersville, homeless addicts like Mr. Gower and nonconformist “pixies” like Clarence are scorned and ostracized, then booted out of the local watering hole.
In Pottersville, cops arrest people like Violet Bick while they’re at work and haul them away, kicking and screaming.
Violet Bick gets dragged away by the Pottersville police as George looks on. (Paramount)
But what horrifies George the most about Pottersville is how desensitized the people living in it seem to be to its harshness and cruelty – how they treat him like he’s the crazy, deranged one for wanting and expecting things to be different and better.
This is what the current political moment feels like to me. There are days when the latest headlines feel so jarringly unprecedented that I find myself thinking, “Can this be happening? Can this be real?”
If you think these comparisons are a bit of a stretch, consider when “It’s a Wonderful Life” was made, and the frame of mind Capra was in when he made it.
Frank Capra, anti-fascist
In 1946, Capra was just returning to Hollywood filmmaking after serving for four years in the U.S. Army, where the Office of War Information had tasked him with producing a series of documentary films about World War II and the lead-up to it. Even though Capra hadn’t been on the front lines, he’d been immersed in the sounds and images of war for years on end, and he had become acutely familiar with Germany, Italy and Japan’s respective rises to fascism.

When deciding on his first postwar film, Capra recalled in his autobiography that he specifically “knew one thing – it would not be about war.” Instead, he chose to adapt a short story by Philip Van Doren Stern, “The Greatest Gift,” that Stern had originally sent to friends and family as a Christmas card in 1943.
Stern’s story is certainly not about war. But it’s not exactly about Christmas, either.
As Stern writes in his opening lines:
“The little town straggling up the hill was bright with colored Christmas lights. But George Pratt did not see them. He was leaning over the railing of the iron bridge, staring down moodily at the black water.”
The protagonist contemplates suicide because he’s “sick of everything” in the small-town “mudhole” he’s stuck in – until, that is, a “strange little man” gives him the chance to see what life would be like if he’d never been born.
It was Capra and his team of screenwriters who added the sinister Henry F. Potter to Stern’s short, simple tale. The Potter subplot encapsulates the film’s most trenchant, still-resonant themes: the unfairness of socioeconomic injustices; the pervasiveness of corporate and political corruption; the threat of monopolized power; the need for affordable housing.
These themes had, of course, run through many of Capra’s prewar films as well: “Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,” “You Can’t Take It with You,” “Meet John Doe” and “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” the last of which also starred Jimmy Stewart.
But they take on a different kind of weight in “It’s a Wonderful Life” – a weight that’s especially visible on the weathered face of Stewart, who himself had just returned from a harrowing four-year tour of duty as a bomber pilot in Europe.
The idealistic vigor with which Stewart had fought crooked politicians and oligarchs as Mr. Smith is replaced by the bitterness, exhaustion, frustration and desperation with which he battles against Mr. Potter as George Bailey.

Life after Pottersville
By the time George has begged and pleaded his way out of Pottersville, the lost $8,000 is no longer top of mind. He’s mainly just relieved to find Bedford Falls as he had left it, warts and all.
And yet, the Bedford Falls that George returns to isn’t quite the same as the one he left behind.
In this Bedford Falls, the community rallies together to figure out a way to recoup George’s missing money. Their pre-digital version of a GoFundMe page saves George from what he’d feared most: bankruptcy, scandal and prison.
And even though his wife, Mary, tries to attribute this sudden wave of collectivist, activist energy to some sort of divine intervention – “George, it’s a miracle; it’s a miracle!” – Uncle Billy points out that it really came about through more earthly organizing means: “Mary did it, George; Mary did it! She told some people you were in trouble, and they scattered all over town collecting money!”
The residents of Bedford Falls come together to save George from financial ruin. (Paramount)
But the question of whether George actually wins his battle against Potter is a murky one.
While the typical Capra protagonist triumphs by defeating vice and exposing subterfuge, George never even realizes that Potter is the one who got hold of his money and tried to ruin his life. Potter is never held accountable for his crimes.
On the other hand, George is able to learn, from his time in Pottersville, what a crucial role he plays in his community. George’s victory over Potter, then, lies not in some grand final act of retribution, but in the incremental ways he has stood up to Potter throughout his life: not capitulating to Potter’s bullying or intimidation tactics; speaking truth to power; and running a community-centered business rather than one guided by greed and exploitation.
In recent months, there have been similar acts of protest, large and small, in the form of rallies, boycotts, immigrant aid efforts, subscription cancellations, food bank donations and more.
That doesn’t mean the U.S. has made it out of Pottersville, however.
Each day, more head-spinning headlines appear, whether they’re about masked agents terrorizing immigrant communities, the dismantling of anti-corruption oversights, the consolidation of executive power or the naked display of political grift.
Zuzu’s petals are still missing. Clarence still hasn’t gotten his wings.
But this holiday season, I’m hoping it will feel helpfully cathartic to go with George Bailey, for the umpteenth time, through the dark abyss of his dystopian nightmare – and come out with him, stronger and wiser, on the other side.

Little things

One drawback of working in the word business is that reading becomes just another part of the job. If you spend eight hours a day reading other people‘s writing, editing other people’s writing, or creating and editing your own writing, you might find it difficult to rouse yourself for other types of literature. Maybe you just want to watch “The Golden Girls.”
In essence, I read news and commentary pieces seven days a week, 365 days a year. Some of that writing amuses and diverts me. Some of it enrages me. A relatively small amount carries lasting aesthetic qualities.
I want to read other things. Yet even a nonfiction book can look like a daunting obstacle when the onrush of daily content piles up outside your door, a snowdrift of content that you then have to dig out with your eyes.
The struggle continues.
When I lived in New Hampshire, I was part of a book club that read an array of interesting modern fiction and nonfiction. We worked through “The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle” by Haruki Murakami, “Pale Fire” by Vladimir Nabokov, “Special Topics in Calamity Physics” by Marisha Pessl, “Dune” by Frank Herbert and many others.
More recently, my work on a volume for the University Press of Kansas about historic opinion writers has required leafing through dozens of old volumes. However, most of the time I use indexes and skimming to find useful nuggets.
After I finished writing the book, more or less, in September, I turned once again to reading fiction. I’ve stocked up on books I want to read but haven’t managed yet — “Catch-22” by Joseph Heller, “Beloved” by Toni Morrison, “The Sound and the Fury” by William Faulkner, “The Talented Mr. Ripley” by Patricia Highsmith.
Sure, I own the books now. But am I reading them?
Partially! My challenge can be illustrated by an even earlier weekend when I began with the best of intentions to read Faulkner — but ended up tearing through Ramin Setoodeh’s gossipy “Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of “The View.”
I mean, you can read the work of a Nobel Prize winner in literature, or you can read about how Barbara Walters battled Rosie O’Donnell.
That’s the joy and terror of reading, when separated from work. So many books tower on all sides of us, important, silly, smart, ludicrous and just plain incomprehensible. Picking one means ignoring all those others, at least for the time being. We only enjoy so much time, and only so much of that time can be spent tracing our eyes through the letters and sentences and paragraphs that adorn a page.
We can never read all the books, despite our hopes to the contrary. So we pick up one volume after another, reading into the future.
Or we consume another think piece about Bari Weiss and “60 Minutes.”

Officials warn: ""Get out of the way."" Evacuations are underway.","In summary
Atmospheric river threatens to unleash deadly debris flows through LA’s wildfire scars. Officials warn: “Get out of the way.” Evacuations are underway.


This story originally published Nov. 14 has been updated after Governor Gavin Newsom announced the state would mobilize resources in advance of winter storms. A dangerous atmospheric river is poised to deliver “excessive rainfall” across Southern California, raising fears that the rain could unleash a threat that has been lingering in the burn scars of wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles communities in recent years.
Called debris flows, these fast-moving slurries of floodwater and sediment can hurtle down slopes carrying cars, trees and even boulders with them.
They’re like “a flood on steroids,” said Jason Kean, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey’s landslide hazards program. “It’s really hard to stop these things. The best thing to do is get out of the way.” 
Northern California is already reeling from the atmospheric river that unleashed catastrophic flash flooding in Redding over the weekend, killing a 74-year-old man who became trapped in his pickup truck on a flooded roadway. 
Now, another storm is expected to reach coastal Northern California this evening, with strong winds and especially heavy rainfall expected to push into southern California by Wednesday. 
Forecasters warn that the rain “will cause life-threatening flash flooding, along with landslides, rockfalls, and/or mudslides,” particularly for areas along Southern California’s Transverse Ranges, including the San Bernardino, San Gabriel, and Sierra Madre mountains. “Urban flooding in the greater Los Angeles metro area is likely.” 
Burn scars — slicked by fire and stripped of plants — are especially dangerous during heavy rains. A storm after the Thomas Fire in 2018 spurred debris flows in Montecito that killed 23 people. And in February, a debris flow in the Palisades Fire burn zone swept a Los Angeles Fire Department member and his SUV into the Pacific Ocean. 
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works warns that there’s a risk of moderate debris and mudflows capable of blocking roadways and endangering some structures in the burn scars of more than a dozen fires — including January’s Eaton, Hurst and Palisades fires. 
The county has issued evacuation warnings in and around recent burn scars, and urged those who may take longer to evacuate to consider leaving now. Officials also announced some targeted evacuation orders for specific properties “at higher risk for mud and debris flows impacts.”
“Recent burn areas, including those impacted by the January wildfires, remain highly susceptible to mud and debris flows,” county officials warned Monday. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that more than 225 personnel and resources including 45 fire engines, 10 swiftwater rescue teams, helicopters and more have been pre-deployed to a dozen northern and southern California counties. 
Meteorologists are discussing it as a “one in every five years type of storm,” said Lisa Phillips with the National Weather Service. “There’s going to be problems everywhere. We have a lot of canyon roads and mountain roads, and things will fall down.” 
Phillips said she expects to see mudslides, landslides, sinkholes – even after the rains have ended, and urged people to stay off the roads if they can. 
“There’s going to be issues outside of the burn scars too, and flooding,” Phillips said. “We want everyone to stay at home, stay safe and don’t get yourself into any trouble unnecessarily.” 
We spoke with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kean, an expert on debris flows after wildfires, last month about what to expect when storms strike burn scars. This conversation has been edited and condensed.
As this storm really takes hold in LA and Southern California, I’m hearing a lot of concern about it hitting areas that burned this past year, including in the Eaton and Palisades fires. Why is this such a big concern? What could happen?
Last January those fires removed much of the vegetation on really steep slopes, and that made those slopes really vulnerable to erosion during intense rainfall. That protective blanket of vegetation is gone, and heavy rain can rapidly make a flash flood. And that flood, in some cases, can pick up material and turn into what we call a debris flow — which is like a flood on steroids.

These burn areas are still vulnerable, even though it’s now many months after the fire and there have been flows already. There’s still plenty of material that could be mobilized. So the threat’s still there. And so we know they’re bad actors, and we’re concerned they could be bad actors again. 
I’m hearing a lot of different terms: mudslide, debris flows, landslide. What are the differences, and which ones are the burn scars at risk for? 
Landslide is an umbrella term that captures all kinds of mass movements, from rock falls to debris flows — these floods on steroids — to big, slow movers. The type of flow that we’re most concerned about in a recent burn area is a debris flow. It’s also called a mudslide. But geologists don’t like to use the word mudslide as much because it sounds like there’s some mud on your driveway — not a big issue, not something that could kill you. And these things, if you’re in the wrong spot at the wrong time, they can cause serious damage.
You called it a flood on steroids. What happens in a debris flow? 
Flash floods are bad, and they can cause lots of problems, too. They can get even worse if they pick up enough sediment to turn into the consistency of wet concrete. But it’s worse than just concrete, because it can contain boulders the size of cars. And, very close to the mountain front, it can move very quickly — faster than you can run. And when it gets all bulked up with debris, the rocks, the gravel, the mud, trees, the flow can be a lot bigger. It just turns into a different animal. 
Now, debris flows pack a bigger punch than floods, but thankfully, they don’t have as long of reach. So usually, the debris flows are confined really close to the mountain fronts. That’s where they put those debris basins to catch them. But if there isn’t one protection like that, then they can travel downslope and impact neighborhoods, and then flooding can extend even further down. 
Is there something about Southern California that makes it higher risk?
Southern California’s kind of the world capital for these kinds of events. It’s got this combination of very steep topography, like the San Gabriel Mountains that just shoot right up, Santa Monica mountains, Santa Ynez — very steep topography. It burns fairly frequently. And then there are a lot of people living very close to the mountain front, so that’s what puts the risk up. 
The thing about a burn area is it takes much less rainfall to cause a problem than it would in unburned conditions. So we’ve now made the slopes really vulnerable. They’re extra steep. There’s a lot of people there. That’s why the risk is so high. 
We’ve seen debris flows in Northern California burn areas as well. It’s not just a Southern California problem, and it’s not just a California problem. 
Is there anything that could have been done to reduce this risk? Anything that should be done now? 
Not long after the fires, in particular the Palisades Fire, (there were) a number of fairly widespread debris flows that disrupted the roads. There were also, in the Eaton fire, floods and debris flows there. Thankfully there’s a dense network of LA County debris basins, which are designed to catch the material before it enters neighborhoods, and those largely saved the day. 
Planners have planned ahead and put in these debris basins — these big, giant holes in the ground — designed to catch the material. That’s the best defense against these. They’re not everywhere, but there is a good network of protection. Other than that, it’s really hard to stop these things. 
What should people who live near the recent burn scars know? What should they do now, as the rain starts? 
The best thing you could do is, if you’re really close to a drainage in one of these burn areas, is to get out of the way. You’re going to get a heads up from the National Weather Service, who’s closely monitoring the rainstorms. They know how much rain it’s going to take to cause a problem, and they’ll get out warnings, and local authorities will reach out to get people out of the way. So there’s a lot of eyes on the situation. And so at this point, the best thing to do is listen to the weather service, listen to local authorities. 
If they ask you to get out of the way, take their advice. These things can happen really fast if there is an intense burst of rain, a flash flood, where debris flow can start within minutes. 
So there is no escaping a debris flow once it starts? 
It’s pretty difficult. If you have a two-story home and you happen to be there at the wrong time, get up to that second floor for sure. Fight like heck if you get trapped in one. But best to be out of the way.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021425-EatonFireMudslides-JAJ-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-24 02:56:39.944165

San Marcos residents celebrated the holiday tradition of posadas together while navigating fear and tension caused by increased ICE enforcement.


On Friday night, organizers of a community holiday festival in San Marcos were busy planning a neighborhood procession and readying trays of tamales for guests.
At the same time, they were preparing security to watch for ICE activity in the largely low-income, Latino area of North County San Diego.
“We rely on the community,” said San Marcos Councilmember Maria Nuñez, who represents San Marcos’ District 1, where 55% of the voting age population is Hispanic. “People are on high alert. If they see anything, hear anything, if ICE is in the area, they’ll let us know.”
Universidad Popular, a civic organization in North County San Diego, sponsored the event, called the Posada Comunitaria, with a local church, Restoration Abbey. It’s the third time they’ve held the event in San Marcos, but this year the festivities took place against a backdrop of apprehension as immigration enforcement has ramped up under the Trump administration.
The procession, or posada, traditionally reenacts the pilgrimage of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem before the birth of Christ. In San Marcos, residents and organizers filed through the neighborhood, where affordable housing complexes are home to many immigrant families.
The event places the advent story in a modern context, said Alex Aguas, a priest with Restoration Abbey, which assists asylum seekers.
“The practice of the Posada really invites people to think about ‘what does it mean to be rejected?’” he said. “Or ‘what does it mean to be on the margins and looking for sanctuary and shelter at this time?’ We also just get to have the opportunity to celebrate.”
As guests arrived and sipped cups of coffee and apple cider, security volunteers in hot pink vests huddled to discuss how to manage traffic control and watch for immigration agents.

“All of our teams, all of our pink vests here, have been trained in immigration response,” said Arcela Nuñez, co-director of Universidad Popular, and Maria Nuñez’ sister.  “We have people watching all points in this neighborhood.”
San Marcos, a city of 94,000 in North County San Diego, appears to account for just a few of the immigration arrests in the San Diego area. But government data suggests the numbers have ticked up this year, and organizers said they have seen more immigration activity recently.
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has arrested at least 38 people in San Marcos since September 2023, with 20 of those arrests between June and October of this year, according to federal data provided by ICE in response to a FOIA request, processed by the Deportation Data Project, and analyzed by CalMatters. CalMatters contacted ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to confirm the numbers, and has not heard back. 
The escalating enforcement, and a change in policy that permits immigration enforcement at areas such as churches and schools that were previously off limits, has created a chilling effect on some community activities. Arcela Nuñez said her organization debated whether to hold the event this year in light of those concerns. They decided to go ahead, but to proceed with caution.

Organizers were particularly attuned to possible reports of ICE activity at the San Marcos Home Depot, less than a mile away, where other immigration raids have taken place this year. Home Depot stores where immigrant day laborers gather to seek work, have been a target for enforcement in Pomona, Los Angeles and Sacramento this year. 
In October U.S. Customs and Border Patrol arrested 22 people with criminal records at Home Depot locations in San Marcos and Encinitas, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Jason Givens said.
“If anything happens, look for experienced security,” Flower Alvarez-Lopez, co-director of Universidad Popular, told about two dozen volunteers gathered in a circle. “We will be able to help you.”
Volunteers distributed candles to participants, who lined up to march through the courtyard of a neighboring apartment building.  Musicians strummed guitars as several hundred singers serenaded residents with songs such as “Noche de Paz” and “Letania para pedir posada,” which translates to a litany requesting lodging.
Their next stop was El Palenque Taco Shop around the corner on San Marcos Boulevard. Organizers waved flashlights to direct the marchers, and steered cars around the crowd in the parking lot, before leading the group a few doors down to La Michoacana Ice Cream.
Carolers made one more stop at an apartment complex before returning to the church, where families lined up for plates heaped with rice and beans, tamales, pizza slices and conchas, a Mexican sweet bread.
The San Marcos event  proceeded without incident, but illustrates the tension that community leaders face trying to plan cultural celebrations while maintaining vigilance about potential immigration operations.
Ines Delgado, an immigration advocate with the North County LGBTQ Resource Center in neighboring Oceanside, volunteered at the posada, after hosting a celebration for International Migrants Day a day earlier, on Thursday evening. On Friday morning she said some clients showed up for a food distribution at the center, but confided that they had been too nervous to attend festivities the night before. 
“Many said they were afraid to come out,” she said. “It might be the focus on immigration, but also being out at night.”

At the Universidad Popular offices in San Marcos, a sign on the door states “Notice: private property and establishment,” warning immigration agents or other law enforcement officers that a judicial warrant is required to enter non-public areas.
Inside, pink signs embellished with flowers remind clients of their rights to remain silent in the case of arrest, and to ask officers if they are being detained.
“A lot of our community partners are doing signage like this,” Arcela Nuñez said. “So if ICE were to show up, we don’t want them to come in and we want people to feel safe.”
Behind their office, the group wrapped up the night with a pair of industrial-strength, star-shaped pinatas. Dozens of children labored to smack them open and then scrambled to collect the candy after they burst. 
Although the organization and church host the posada and other community festivals annually, this year’s neighborhood pilgrimage particularly highlighted the plight of “strangers seeking welcome,” Aguas said. 
“Based on the changing political climate, that work takes on different meaning and resonance.”

“We’re at a critical time in Maryland when we have an administration in Washington that has made it their mission to go after the public services millions rely on,” said Council 3 President Patrick Moran. backed by more than two dozen state workers at a Baltimore news conference.
“We need a state government and state leadership that are standing up to those threats and charting a different course. Standing with public employees means not committing unfair labor practices,” he said.
A spokesperson for the governor said Tuesday afternoon that the Moore administration has continued to support public servants while also managing a “historic budget crisis as Maryland continues to face unprecedented attacks from the federal administration.”
“From day one, Gov. Moore has consistently stood up for Maryland’s workers, making clear that supporting labor and protecting our workforce are central to this administration’s work,” said Rhyan Lake, the spokesperson.

“Each year, he has reaffirmed that commitment to public servants and organized labor, despite ongoing budget constraints, the state and the union have reached agreements to continue annual increases. The governor will continue to work with our labor partners to ensure our workers are protected,” Lake said.
But in separate filings with the state’s Public Employee Labor Relations Board filed Tuesday, the union said the administration has fallen short in several areas.
The first complaint claims the Department of Budget and Management violated shift differential language in the the union’s current collective bargaining agreement, which runs through Dec. 31, 2026. The union said that agreement requires the state to pay an additional $1 an hour to any union member who works an overnight shift, but that the department last week that it had developed a list of job classifications that would qualify for the differential.
“The announcement reveals DBM’s intention to – contrary to the agreement – selectively award shift differential pay to only certain classifications and employees in its discretion,” read the complaint.
The second complaint, also filed against DBM, claims the department is refusing to provide a list of union members wh0 are eligible for telework — as it has in the past — or track those who are taking it, making it impossible for the union to continue to negotiate the issue. The agency also said telework “agreements are a management right,” according to the complaint and the existing telework agreement”only requires OPSB [the Office of Personnel Services and Benefits] meet and discuss telework designations” with the union.
Finally, the union complained that the collective bargaining agreement makes clear that video surveillance in the workplace may be used “solely for security purposes,” but that the Maryland Department of Health is using it to track “employees in the moment-to-moment performance of their duties.”
The complaint cites cases where nurses and other workers at the Thomas B. Finan Center in Cumberland were monitored as they prepared and delivered medications, to see how long they washed their hands or if they were using personal protective equipment. In one case, a supervisor texted workers to shift their positions in a room so the camera could better see their performance.

Such monitoring also “pervades” at Springfield Hospital Center in Eldersburg, Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center in Jessup, Eastern Shore Hospital Center in Cambridge, the RICA-Baltimore in the city and Spring Grove Hospital Center in Catonsville, the complaint said.
All three complaints were filed with the state’s Public Employees Relations Board. Union members said these types of filings are “very rare.”
The charges come at a time when “state services are in crisis,” according to union members, who pointed to a lack of beds at local hospitals, assaults on staff at correctional facilities and staffing shortages that affect the overall quality of work.
Moran said average turnover in state government reached 409 employees per month in August. And the state’s “voluntary separation program” announced this summer exacerbated staffing and public service challenges.
Union members have expressed concerns about working conditions at least since last year, after Legionella bacteria were discovered in the water at State Center. Earlier this year, AFSCME and other labor unions, along with family and friends of slain Parole Officer Davis Martinez pushed for stronger worker protections, which were enacted in May in the Davis Martinez Public Employee Safety and Health Act.
On Tuesday, union members called on state officials to work with the union to assess cost-saving measures that will not only hire and retain workers, but also keep them and the public safe.
“We are ready, and we have been ready, to partner with the state on how to cut costs in a real, sustainable way that doesn’t harm state employees, state services and Maryland’s working families,” said Cherrish Vick, a family services case worker for 17 years and AFSCME Maryland’s secretary treasurer. “We cannot do our work if our government does not have our back, and that looks like acting as a partner, working with us on cost savings and paying state workers what we deserve.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Patrick-Moran-with-AFSCME-Council-3-12-23-2025-1024x665.jpg,,,2025-12-24 00:11:56.984869

Yet federal research funding bears almost no relationship to that burden.,"A disease that may cost the United States as much as $362 billion a year in medical expenses and lost productivity receives about $13 million in annual research funding from the National Institutes of Health. I am one of the millions of Americans living in that gap.
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, is a complex disease that attacks multiple systems in the body. Because of the overlap with Long Covid —studies estimate that about half of Long COVID patients meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS— researchers now believe as many as 9 million Americans may now be living with it. Roughly a quarter are housebound or bedbound.

Elizabeth Ansell

For patients, daily life is ruled by a cruel equation: spend too much energy, pay later. A shower, a phone call, or walking to the mailbox can trigger what’s known as a “crash” —a delayed collapse of symptoms that can last for days, weeks, or months. In those stretches, people can become unable to sit upright, tolerate light or sound, or even speak more than a few words at a time. There is no diagnostic test, no FDA-approved treatment, and far too few clinicians who know how to recognize or manage the disease.
The economic consequences are enormous. Many people with ME/CFS can no longer work at all; others can work only a few hours a week. Researchers estimate that lost productivity alone costs the U.S. tens of billions of dollars each year, on top of billions more in medical spending. For individuals, the average combined hit from lost income and out-of-pocket costs has been estimated at $20,000 to $23,000 per year. Families often lose a second income when a spouse or parent becomes a full-time caregiver.
Yet federal research funding bears almost no relationship to that burden. NIH spends roughly $13 million a year on ME/CFS —far less than it devotes to other serious chronic illnesses with comparable or lower estimated costs, such as HIV/AIDS and breast cancer. Experts have suggested that ME/CFS funding would need to rise roughly fortyfold to match the disease’s impact.
In 2024, NIH approved the first-ever ME/CFS Research Roadmap, a plan developed with scientists, clinicians, and people living with the disease. It lays out a clear sequence: first, give doctors reliable tools to diagnose ME/CFS early and consistently, especially its hallmark delayed crash after exertion. Second, build the core infrastructure modern research depends on —a national patient registry, shared biobanks, and a data hub so researchers can compare results and identify subgroups. Third, create a trial network built around the realities of this disease, with home-based or low-burden participation and the ability to test promising therapies in small, careful studies and then quickly scale up what works.
This isn’t an open-ended wish list. It’s a practical blueprint for unlocking treatments in a disease that has been ignored for decades, and for building tools that can also serve Long COVID and other infection-related conditions. But a roadmap without fuel goes nowhere. The plan does not yet have dedicated funding, specific timelines, or clear benchmarks for success.
Congress has started to stir. A recent Senate spending report recognized the urgency of ME/CFS, praised NIH for approving the roadmap, and asked the agency to explain how it will carry it out. That is better than silence. But patients have learned that report language and memos do not, by themselves, build registries, run trials, or bring new therapies into clinics.
I know the cost of delay in my own life. Ten years ago, I was an active professional, building a career and a future. ME/CFS stripped away my job, my independence, and many of the small rituals that make a life feel like it’s mine. At my worst, I would lay in a dark room unable to speak or move, saving up what little energy I had for four days just so I could whisper “help.”
Even now, talking too long on the phone, brushing my hair, or transferring to a wheelchair can trigger a crash that sets me back for days or weeks. My family has become my care team. My friends have become advocates. Their dedication keeps me afloat, but it cannot substitute for a functioning research system.
Congress can change this. Lawmakers should direct NIH to dedicate a multi-year funding stream to the ME/CFS Roadmap, require clear milestones and annual progress reports, and ensure that the new research infrastructure also serves Long Covid and related conditions.
This is not only a moral question. It is a fiscal one. Every year that ME/CFS remains under- researched, more people fall out of the workforce, more families burn through savings, and more costs quietly accrue to disability programs and health systems. For a fraction of what the disease already costs the country, we could build the scientific foundation needed to prevent some of that loss.
Millions of Americans are waiting. I am one of them. We do not need another decade of hearings or essays documenting neglect. We need Congress to give NIH a funded, accountable mandate to follow the map it has already drawn—and to judge success by whether fewer people are forced out of work and out of their lives.
NIH has the roadmap. It’s up to Congress to decide whether it leads anywhere.

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Specia to the SC Daily Gazette)Three Republican candidates sailed to victory in special elections two days before Christmas, winning two seats in the South Carolina state House and one in the Senate.
In the only contested race, Midlands pastor John Lastinger won 62% of the vote; he will now represent the House district formerly held by the former leader of the ultra-right Freedom Caucus, RJ May. 
May resigned in August after a federal grand jury indicted him on child sexual material charges. He has since pleaded guilty to five counts for distributing videos of children being sexually abused.
A judge is scheduled to sentence May on Jan. 14, 2026. He faces up to 20 years in prison.
Lastinger’s opponent for the state House seat spanning the area between Cayce, Red Bank and Gaston, Democrat and retired Army colonel J. Chuck Hightower, took just 38% of the 2,683 total votes cast in the low-turnout election Tuesday, according to unofficial results from the South Carolina Election Commission. 
Lastinger could not be reached for comment.
In the last general election for that seat, May, the only candidate on the ballot, won 92% of 14,124 votes cast. Republicans have held the ruby-red district since former state Rep. Lenoir Sturkie took office in February 1984. 
Ahead of the Tuesday elections, state Democratic Party Chair Christale Spain in an email blast called the contests a chance for Democrats to “show real power,” but the callout to voters made little difference.
The other two elections had only one candidate on the ballot. 
Firebrand Republican Lee Bright will return to a Senate district that spans parts of Greenville and Spartanburg counties. He held the seat for two previous terms before losing a primary runoff in 2016. He handily beat a write-in candidate supported by state Democratic Party leaders, earning 67% percent of 5,249 votes.
Dianne Mitchell, a former teacher with the backing of the state’s House Freedom Caucus, easily won her district in Greenville county with 70% percent of 2,124 votes against a write-in candidate. 
Lastinger and Mitchell will take office in time for the start of the Legislative Session in January and serve until the seats are up for re-election in November. 
Bright will finish out the second half of his predecessors’ term in the Senate. The seat will be on the ballot again in 2028. 
One more special election, for a state House district representing Dorchester County, will pit two Air Force veterans against each other: Republican Greg Ford and Democrat Sonja Ogletree-Satani. 
A week after that race, the 2026 session is set to open with all 170 Statehouse seats filled.

(Getty Images)The new $900 billion military spending law signed by President Donald Trump last week includes special benefits for soldiers and Coast Guardsmen in Alaska, hundreds of millions in new construction within the state, and a continued push to reactivate the U.S. Navy base at Adak.
“It’s safe to say that this is the biggest bill that Congress does every year,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, in an interview this week.
The National Defense Authorization Act, as it is formally known, is normally a must-pass piece of legislation for members of Congress, and despite deadlocks on other key issues, it sailed through the U.S. House on a 312-112 bipartisan vote and through the Senate on a 77-20 vote.
Before final passage, the bill picked up plenty of additions, including the annual Coast Guard funding measure. 
“It’s a train leaving the station, and a lot of people want to jump on,” Sullivan said.
The bill raises military base pay by 3.8% nationwide, but soldiers and active-duty members of the Coast Guard in Alaska will receive a special bonus: A round-trip flight home each year.
“That’s not going to change the world. That’s not going to change the balance of power between the Russians and Chinese and America. But these are the kind of things that you can get in this bill that matter if you care and take it seriously,” Sullivan said.
Murkowski said the flight program was inspired by surveys conducted after a wave of deaths by suicide at Alaska military bases.
“We asked some of the enlisted: ‘What would make a difference to you?’ And we heard really simple things like, ‘I would love to be able to fly back home as a single enlisted just once a year, to go see my mom, be there for Christmas, be there for my nephew’s birthday,’” she said.
In a written statement, Begich said the pay increase provisions, “as well as the Commander-in-Chief’s announced year-end military pay bonus” demonstrate “sustained investment and support for our men and women in uniform.”
Sitting in her office in Anchorage and looking out at the snow-covered mountains, Murkowski noted that the bill contains millions for additional cold-weather gear and vehicles for soldiers deployed in Alaska. 
For years, Sullivan has pushed the Department of Defense to reactivate the U.S. Navy’s base at Adak, which formally closed in 1997. The land has since been transferred to the Aleut Corporation.
In July, Sullivan briefly blocked a confirmation vote for the U.S. Navy’s top officer. That got him a meeting with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who committed to creating a task force that would look at reopening Adak, Sullivan said.
“This task force was set up. They were actually supposed to have their recommendations to the Secretary of War mid-December. That deadline slipped, and trust me, I am conducting — I would call it vigorous oversight of this issue,” Sullivan said, using the title proposed by the Trump administration that would replace “secretary of defense,” which has not yet been approved by Congress.
Earlier this year, the Republican-backed Big Beautiful Bill Act included $115 million for “exploration and development of existing Arctic infrastructure.”
The new military spending law requires reports every 90 days on how that money is being spent and “an assessment of the feasibility of any viable infrastructure options in the Arctic region.”
That’s targeted language for Adak, Sullivan said.
“I hope we are getting Adak reopened,” he said. “That is going to be hugely strategic.”
Murkowski has a different vision.
“I think Sen. Sullivan has made it very, very clear from the hearings where he’s brought military leadership in, that Adak is what he’s focusing on. But you also have other other infrastructure in what is defined as the Alaska Arctic. You’ve got Eareckson out there in Shemya. You’ve got Nome, where we’re trying to build out a port. So it’s a little bit nuanced,” she said.
The law also instructs the military’s industrial office to boost Alaska mining and energy projects to the extent possible. Its text says the office should prioritize “the clearance of mining and energy project applications … likely to experience significant temporal impact due to seasonal Arctic climate conditions.”
That office has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on mines and factories in the United States and Canada.
Statistics provided by Sullivan’s office show $284 million in construction at Fort Wainwright, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and Eielson Air Force Base combined. There’s also millions for new missile defense construction at Fort Greely and elsewhere, and the bill includes instructions to develop a Coast Guard base on St. Paul Island to cover the Bering Sea.
The Coast Guard will also have to analyze the risks of increased shipping traffic through the Bering Strait and come up with a plan to address those risks.
Between the Big Beautiful Bill Act, the law to reopen the government after the extended shutdown and now the military spending law, “Alaska is getting well north of $1 billion in military and Coast Guard infrastructure,” Sullivan said. “I’m not sure we’ve ever done that.”
That matters because military construction means work for Alaskans in the construction industry and Alaskans who sell things to support construction.
“North of a billion — that’s really good for national security for America, but that’s also going to be really good for jobs,” Sullivan said. “That is a big stimulus to our economy.”

Bob Ferguson made a splash Tuesday with his full-throated endorsement of taxing the earnings of millionaires.
The surprise declaration from the first-term Democratic governor nearly drowned out his newly released plan to erase a multibillion-dollar shortfall in the current state budget.
He made “super clear” that if Washington taxes millionaires, the money won’t start flowing into state coffers until 2029 at the earliest. In the meantime, he said, the state must deal with the immediate problem of the $2.3 billion budget hole.
Ferguson proposes to patch it by trimming $800 million in spending, withdrawing $1 billion from the state’s rainy day fund, and making an unprecedented use of nearly $600 million in revenues from the state’s auctions of air pollution allowances.
The proposal also contains $1.2 billion of increased spending to cover costs of inflation in existing programs, greater demand for public services and complying with new federal requirements under Republicans’ so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.”
The budget plan is balanced through June 30, 2027 and does not raise taxes, keeping a pledge Ferguson made earlier this month. The plan does eliminate tax breaks related to data centers and prescription drug wholesalers.
“We are facing falling revenue, rising costs, and budget cuts and chaos coming from the Trump administration,” he said. “I’m providing a road map for the Legislature. This is, of course, the first step in a conversation about how best to balance our budget.”
Nitty gritty
The spending plan released Tuesday makes adjustments to the two-year budget Ferguson signed in May and that took effect July 1.
It is the third and final piece of the budget package Ferguson will send to lawmakers for their consideration in the 60-day session that begins Jan. 12.
Last week, he proposed pumping an additional $244 million into housing development programs through the capital budget, and $3 billion into preserving highways and bridges and building three new ferries through the transportation budget. Those sums would largely come from borrowing money through the bond market.
The current operating budget called for $77.8 billion in spending over two years across government. It relied on about $4 billion from new taxes and transfers from other accounts into the general fund, the central pot of money used to pay for most state spending. It projected the state would end the fiscal cycle with $225 million in cash reserves and $2 billion in its emergency, or rainy day, fund.

What Ferguson proposed Tuesday lifts total spending to nearly $79 billion while leaving the state with $140 million in cash reserves and $1 billion in emergency savings at the end of the budget cycle in mid-2027.
While Ferguson’s embrace of a millionaire’s tax will please progressives, his avoidance of new revenue streams to close the current gap will not, as some are pressing ahead with legislation to impose new and higher taxes on large corporations.
Overall, Ferguson’s plan does boost state spending. Of the total, $165 million is to deal with the effects of H.R. 1, the major federal legislation, which imposes new and stricter eligibility rules for food assistance and Medicaid programs.
For example, nearly $50 million will be spent to provide an estimated 30,000 refugees, asylees, and other immigrants with state-funded food assistance after they were cut from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
The single largest new sum in Ferguson’s plan confronts the state’s growing lawsuit payouts. The premiums state agencies pay into a liability account haven’t kept pace with these legal expenses. 
Without a permanent fix, the state Department of Enterprise Services, which oversees the self-insurance fund, has warned the gap could grow to more than $1.3 billion by mid-2027, and increase further from there.
Ferguson commits $955 million to resolving the problem, with a portion penciled in for use in the next budget. 
In other areas, the budget would invest $55 million to maintain subsidies for health care premiums for the Cascade Care program. It would also restore $2.9 million in funding for Capitol Campus Security and $8.5 million pared from the Abortion Access Project.
And Ferguson funds new contracts for 5,300 general government and higher education workers represented by the Washington Public Employees Association. These workers did not ratify a contract in time to be included in the budget approved this year. 
State government employees would get a 3% pay hike retroactive to July 1, 2025 and a 2% increase on July 1, 2026. Under their deal, community college employees working on July 1, 2026 would receive both increases.
Erasing the shortfall
One of the biggest — and controversial — maneuvers is Ferguson’s redirecting of $569 million of proceeds from carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act into the Working Families Tax Credit program, an idea first pushed by Senate Republicans last session.
The program provides credits ranging from $325 to $1,290 to low- to moderate-income families.  It has historically been funded out of the general fund. Ferguson said this one-time move would free up general fund dollars for other uses. 
This move is explicitly allowed under the 2021 law.
House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, an architect of the Climate Commitment Act, said the state needs to spend the money to make the state more resilient to climate damage.
“He had difficult choices in drafting this budget,” he said. “We have difficult choices ahead of us to pass a budget.”
Meanwhile, the governor’s budget slices spending throughout the state government.
For example, he calls for across-the-board cuts of 3% to the University of Washington and Washington State University, and 1.5% to the other regional universities and community and technical colleges.
He also halts a planned increase in per-pupil funding for school districts that struggle to raise money from local levies due to lower property values. And he proposes capping signups for the Working Connections child care program and removing 1,816 slots for the Transition to Kindergarten program starting in the 2026-27 school year.
The hits to education drew fire from Larry Delaney, president of the Washington Education Association, which is the state’s largest union for public school employees, and Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal.
“Schools and colleges are currently underfunded; our students have extensive unmet needs and additional cuts to the Local Assistance Program, Transition to Kindergarten, and more exacerbate the situation,” Delaney said.
Republican alternative
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, the lead Republican budget writer in the House, said he thought Ferguson’s proposal was a “prank.”
“Instead of fixing the problem, this budget relies on accounting tricks, raids dedicated accounts, shifts school construction money to paper over holes, and keeps using one-time cash to pay for permanent programs. Meanwhile, it cuts back child care help, delays care for seniors, shortchanges schools, caps support for working families, and ends tax breaks,” he said
Last week, Couture put out his own plan that he says will trim state spending by $3.7 billion over the next three years while protecting core services and avoiding cuts to public schools.
He said his “Affordability First” plan would restore funding for programs cut or underfunded in the current budget, including Medicaid services, hospitals, food assistance, wildfire prevention, medical care for drug-exposed newborns, and law enforcement hiring.
It would also reimpose voter-backed spending limits tied to inflation and population growth and require what’s known as zero-based budgeting for agencies. To save money, it would end free health care for immigrants in the country without legal status, trim management payrolls in community colleges and universities and require public employees to pay a greater share of their benefits.
The budget problem is a result of the state spending more than it collects, Couture said. Democrats’ passage of $12 billion of new and higher taxes last session between the operating and transportation budgets “didn’t solve it, so we’re right back where we were,” he said.

William Lindstedt will move to the state Senate to take the seat formerly occupied by Colorado state Sen. Faith Winter, who died in a car crash in November. 
Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, won a vote during a vacancy committee election Tuesday. The committee comprised Democratic voters from Senate District 25. Lindstedt beat one other candidate, Tom Klenow. Senate District 25 covers north Westminster, part of Broomfield, and Northglenn. 
“These are not the circumstances I anticipated pursuing a seat in the state Senate, and I know this loss has been devastating for our community, and for many of us very personally,” Lindstedt said about Winter’s death. “At the same time, with the legislative session rapidly approaching, the work of serving our community in the state Senate has to continue.”

Lindstedt filed paperwork with the secretary of state’s office in June declaring his intent to run for the Senate District 25 seat in 2026. Klenow also filed paperwork declaring his intent to run for the seat in 2026. 
In the House this year, Lindstedt chaired the House Finance Committee and the Legislative Audit Committee. He said he has worked on “some of the toughest fiscal and oversight decisions facing our state” on those committees. He served as a member of Broomfield City Council before he was elected to the Legislature. 
Lindstedt said he would work to prioritize protecting public benefits like Medicaid and Colorado’s paid family leave, clean air and water, and funding for K-12 education.
U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, a Lafayette Democrat, nominated Lindstedt in the vacancy committee meeting. 
“No one can fill Faith’s incredibly large shoes, but I am convinced that William Lindstedt will be an incredible, incredible public servant for the people of Colorado Senate District 25,” Neguse said. 
Lindstedt is subject to a state ethics complaint alleging he and other moderate Democrats in the Colorado Legislature accepted payment for luxury resort expenses at an October gathering with lobbyists in Vail. 
Winter, a Broomfield Democrat, died during a multi-vehicle car crash on Interstate 25 south of Denver on Nov. 26. Winter was the only one in her car, and her blood alcohol level was above the legal limit when she died. 
Another vacancy committee will need to convene to select a replacement for Lindstedt in House District 33, which is centered in Broomfield.

(Photo courtesy Lanny Hartmann)Maryland is delaying a new inspection fee for electric vehicle chargers that was set to take effect next week, amid concerns that the payments could slow chargers’ rollout in the state.
The Maryland Department of Agriculture, which is planning to inspect public chargers for functionality and accuracy, announced Tuesday that it won’t require charger owners to pay the fee of $150 per port until July 1 — as opposed to Jan. 1 was originally planned.
Electric vehicle advocates have argued that the fee could compel Maryland businesses to install fewer chargers — or even rip out existing chargers to avoid incurring the fees. They worry in particular about chargers installed at housing complexes around the state, which are mainly intended for residents’ use and often do not generate anywhere near the same profit as a fast charger installed along a busy highway corridor.
The Agriculture Department has argued that because the chargers are public, and charge consumers a fee, they ought to be regulated just like any others. And the state says the fee is set at $150 per port because testing EV chargers comes at a fairly high cost: Inspectors plan to use an expensive piece of equipment called a “standard,” and they have to pay for the power they consume during testing.
Maryland’s EV charger inspection program rolls on, despite consumer, industry pushback

But the department issued a number of clarifications in its news release Tuesday, adding that multi-unit dwellings can receive exemptions if they meet a number of conditions. Equipment, for example, must be exclusively designated for residents of the complex, and cannot be accessible to members of the public. It must have signage stating as such, and it cannot be advertised on public websites as an available charging location.
Chargers located at workplaces can also be exempt if they are designated only for employees and located in areas restricted to employees. Chargers at private residences and free chargers are automatically exempt.
“The decision to extend the registration deadline to July 1, 2026, will allow the department to facilitate more extensive and meaningful dialogue with the electric vehicle charging industry, local governments, and the community at large,” Maryland Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks said in a news release.
“This extended timeline will allow us to incorporate critical feedback and make the necessary formal amendments to the program’s structure and regulations, ensuring the program is effective, fair, and supportive of the state’s electric vehicle adoption goals while meeting the practical needs of all stakeholders,” his statement said.
Some in the EV charging industry, though, remain concerned that the new fee will be prohibitive, and stymie the state’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through greater use of electric vehicles.
Robert Borkowski, owner of Plug IO, an EV-charging company focused on installations at housing and condo complexes, said he recently received an exemption for chargers he is installing in Frederick. But he’s concerned that many multi-unit dwellings won’t be able to meet the requirements to become exempt. It may be difficult for the complexes to prevent members of the public from using their chargers, for example.
“The requirements are extremely restrictive,” Borkowski said in an email.
Borkowski also argued that complexes should be allowed to list chargers on their websites.
“How else would potential residents learn about the property’s EV charging infrastructure?” Borkowski said. “Why penalize MUDs [multi-unit dwellings] for promoting their forward-thinking properties and supporting Maryland’s goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?”

The imperiled bird has been “screwed over” in the last decade, critics say, but Wyoming’s grouse leader says conservation remains intact despite feds' changes.
The post Greater sage grouse advocates blast new federal plan endorsed by Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Conservationists blasted a federal rewrite of a sage grouse protection plan endorsed by Wyoming, saying it strips safeguards from Wyoming’s fabled Golden Triangle, site of the world’s largest breeding ground for the imperiled bird.
The Bureau of Land Management on Monday released its rewrite of plans governing the use and development of about 50 million acres of public land in eight Western states, including 26.6 million acres in Wyoming. The framework for Equality State management spans 66 pages, not counting maps and appendices, and applies to an area larger than Kentucky.
Conservationists criticized the rewrite as “reckless” and “a holiday gift to private industry,” while promising to sue the Trump administration.
“We’re not letting these dancing birds go without a fight, so we’ll see Trump in court.” Randi Spivak
“Every president starting with Obama has screwed over these iconic Western birds,” Randi Spivak, public lands policy director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “We’ll keep fighting until these beautiful dancing birds and the places they live get the protection they deserve.”
The new plan for Wyoming reflects updated scientific information, changing land uses and local habitat, Wyoming’s acting BLM director Kristina Kirby wrote in the document’s introduction. The regulations meet the BLM’s multiple-use mandate, conserve grouse, avoid endangered-species listing and minimize regulatory burdens, she wrote.
Bob Budd, chairman of Wyoming’s Sage Grouse Implementation Team, said he feels good about the federal plan and Wyoming’s own gubernatorial sage grouse core-area order. “Protections are still there,” Budd said. “The commitment to manage [for conservation] is as strong as it’s ever been.”
In revising the plans, the BLM deferred to states, including Wyoming, which started addressing grouse conservation decades ago. “The BLM accepted the State of Wyoming’s recommendation to use their existing adaptive management approach,” she wrote.
The state with the most
Wyoming possesses the highest concentrations of greater sage grouse in the world. It is home to almost 40% of the bird’s population. Because of long-term declines — down nearly 80% between 1968 and 2023, according to the Center for Biological Diversity — the grouse were eligible for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act in the early 2010s.
To save the species, the government employed BLM management plans instead of a more sweeping ESA listing. But, “many protective measures from the 2015 plans were never implemented and the plans were again revised and further weakened in 2018 and in 2024,” the Center for Biological Diversity said in a statement.

Conservation groups say safeguards are now further undermined. “Endangered Species Act protection for the bird will probably be necessary,” Eric Molvar, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, said in a statement.
The groups say reductions in required “hiding cover” — standards that require seven inches of grass in nesting areas — is one shortcoming.
“Science-based grass-height standards for grazing management have been eliminated, potentially allowing livestock to remove the tall grasses and shrubs that provide essential concealment during nesting season,” WildEarth Guardians’ Endangered Species Advocate Joanna Zhang said in a statement.
Under the new plan, the Golden Triangle would no longer be designated as an “area of critical environmental concern.” That swath of sagebrush sea northeast of Farson that’s about 40 miles on each side is home to the largest sage grouse breeding ground or lek in the world.
BLM protections in the previous management plan covering the Golden Triangle were one factor that led the agency last week to reject a nomination to develop a 2,194-acre parcel there. An oil and gas prospector sought rights to lease the plot that’s within two miles of the Divide Lek.
The plan also removes a development prohibition called “no surface occupancy” from key sage grouse habitat, critics say. That opens the landscape to potential “surface disturbance” — the bulldozing of sagebrush for roads, pipelines and drilling rigs.
“This will result in emptying public lands of sage grouse and other sensitive wildlife,” Molvar said.
“We’re not letting these dancing birds go without a fight,” Spivak added. “So we’ll see Trump in court.”
Core-area strategy remains
Gov. Mark Gordon said the plan acknowledges six decades of Wyoming conservation — leadership spanning three gubernatorial terms. “We will continue to invest in sage-grouse conservation alongside responsible development,” he said in a statement.
Budd further defined Wyoming’s protections and how they will conserve greater sage grouse. Regarding the 7-inch hiding cover, he said that’s not something that can be attained everywhere every year.
The 7-inch standard creates “a false narrative that can’t be met,” Budd said.
Instead, “what you manage for is healthy ecosystems,” he said. “That’s now what we have in the new version.”
The Golden Triangle remains protected as part of Wyoming’s core-area strategy, Budd said. Removing “no-surface occupancy” restrictions doesn’t mean drilling rigs will move in, he said. The new plan “still allows an NSO, if that’s the best way to protect grouse.”
He couldn’t say whether the new plan would prohibit leasing the recently rejected Golden Triangle parcel. Wyoming’s executive order and core area strategy would not allow a drilling rig “right on top” of the potential lease site, he said.
Directional drilling technology has advanced so it’s possible to access oil and gas from miles away, he said. Drilling remotely might be permitted with various seasonal restrictions, he suggested.
“We wanted to be strategic, surgical and correct things,” Budd said of the state’s involvement in the new rewrite. The adopted changes “addressed the reality that’s out there.”

Delbert Hosemann asked the state Board of Election Commissioners on Friday to file for a stay on a federal judge’s ruling that would lead to special elections for two seats on the Mississippi Supreme Court next year. 
Hosemann, a Republican, made the request in a letter to Gov. Tate Reeves, Attorney General Lynn Fitch and Secretary of State Michael Watson, fellow Republicans who comprise the election board. The request follows a Dec. 19 ruling by Mississippi Northern District federal Judge Sharion Aycock, which gave the Republican-controlled state Legislature until the end of its 2026 regular session to draw new Supreme Court district boundaries.
The ruling should be challenged, Hosemann said, because it could allow the federal court to redraw the boundaries to the court’s “liking,” an outcome that could favor candidates supported by Democrats. 
That’s what happened after a federal three-judge panel last year ordered lawmakers to redraw their districts in three areas of the state to give Black voters a fairer shot at electing candidates of their choice, Hosemann said. He said that was a mistake he doesn’t want repeated 
“Previously, this Board did not request a stay of a similar order to redistrict the Senate and the House districts, allowing the Senate and the House to effectively be redrawn by unconstitutional federal mandates on issues currently before the U.S. Supreme Court brought by other states,” Hosemann said in his letter. “But here we are again.”
Fitch’s office also appealed that ruling and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to sharply curtail the federal Voting Rights Act by declaring private voters cannot sue to prevent discrimination at the ballot box. 
If the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Mississippi’s favor, it would mean only the Department of Justice could sue to enforce the Voting Rights Act. 
With respect to the the ongoing legal battle over the state Supreme Court, the matter stems from a 2022 lawsuit filed by a group of Black voters and candidates. The group in 2022 sued state officials, alleging that Black candidates face unfair difficulties getting elected to the state’s high court.
 In a 105-page ruling in August, Aycock, a President George W. Bush appointee, found that the three Supreme Court districts were drawn in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. Aycock asked the Legislature to redraw those districts in the future to give Black voters a fair shot at electing candidates of their choice.   
The plaintiffs had requested special elections for seats held by Justice Kenny Griffis and Justice Jenifer Branning. Griffis’s term ends in Jan. 2030, while Branning’s runs through Jan. 2033.
Last year, Branning, a white candidate who described herself as a “constitutional conservative” and was backed by the Republican Party, defeated longtime Justice Jim Kitchens, a white man widely viewed as a candidate supported by Black voters. 
No Black person has ever been elected to the Mississippi Supreme Court without first obtaining an interim appointment from the governor, and no Black person from either of the two other districts has ever served on the state’s high court. 
Hosemann said the federal court ruling could have far-reaching consequences for several elected offices beyond the state Supreme Court. 
“Even ignoring the facts of the ballot box and the inherent constitutional right for the Legislature to draw districts, this case goes even further,” Hosemann said. “It refused to restrict any potential special elections to the two Mississippi Supreme Court districts at issue in favor of ordering the Legislature to redistrict and then the federal court will review the Legislature’s efforts.”
The federal court under this tack could also compel special elections for the Public Service and Mississippi Department of Transportation commissions, Hosemann said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30121809/Mississippi-Economic-Council-annual-Hobnob16A.jpg,,,2025-12-23 18:58:23.587422

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A Rusk County community that more than two years ago rejected the use of electronic voting machines has agreed to provide them so people with disabilities can vote in federal elections.
The agreement, signed in federal court in Madison earlier this month, ends a lingering legal dispute over voter access in the northern Wisconsin town of Thornapple that prompted a federal investigation.
The case underscores the importance of provisions in the federal Help America Vote Act, enacted in 2002, which includes voting rights guarantees for people with disabilities, according to Lisa Hasenstab, public policy manager for Disability Rights Wisconsin.
“Access to accessible voting is something that is not always a top priority in the mix of everything that has to happen for elections,” Hasenstab told the Wisconsin Examiner on Tuesday. “But it is the law. It’s federal law. and state law as well, that accessible means of voting be provided at every polling place. If at even one polling place that option is not provided, that is a violation of voters’ rights.”
Hasenstab said a variety of voting machine systems include provisions tailored to people with disabilities who have difficulty marking paper ballots. Systems also include headphones for voters who can’t see, so they can  listen to the names of candidates on their ballots.
The Help America Vote Act requires every polling place to include such machines for people who need them, and any voter is able to use them, Hasenstab said.
Thornapple Town Chairman Tom Zelm declined to tell the Wisconsin Examiner in a phone conversation Tuesday why the town had stopped using voting machines and said he would have no comment on the settlement that the town and the U.S. Department of Justice signed in federal court on Dec. 12.
According to a May 13, 2024, report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the  Thornapple town board voted in June 2023 to stop using electronic voting machines and use only paper ballots.
That same summer, Douglas Frank — profiled in the Los Angeles Times as a purveyor of “baseless claims about suspicious voting trends and secret algorithms used to steal elections” — visited the area, giving talks that stoked conspiracy theories about voting machines, according to several published reports.
After the April 2024 Wisconsin presidential preference primary, a local Democratic Party activist called another town board member to complain about the absence of voting machines that could be used by some people with disabilities. She recorded the call, in which the board member repeated false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump and blamed voting machines. The activist then posted the recording on YouTube.
DOJ lawyers wrote to the town’s chief election officer on May 7, 2024, referring to reports received by the department that the town board “may have voted to remove all electronic voting machines in all elections,” including presidential primary.
The DOJ letter stated that some voters with disabilities had reported their requests to use accessible voting machines in the primary election were not granted. It quoted the Help America Vote Act’s requirement for all polling places to include systems that enable voters with disabilities to cast their ballots.
The Lawrence Town Board in Brown County also passed a measure in 2023 to stop using voting machines. Lawrence reversed its decision Sept. 9, 2024, according to DOJ, and signed an agreement with the feds to comply with HAVA.
Thornapple did not reverse its voting machine ban, and DOJ sued the town. That October a federal judge issued an injunction, requiring the town to use accessible voting machines in the November 2024 election.
Separately, the Wisconsin Elections Commission ordered the town and its elections clerk to “take affirmative steps” and comply with Wisconsin’s law that also requires accessible electronic voting equipment at polling places to accommodate people with disabilities.
The town appealed the federal court injunction, losing before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in July.
Under the Dec. 12 settlement, Thornapple and the town’s election officials “will ensure their voting systems are accessible to people with disabilities as required by HAVA.” The deal requires the town to use an electronic voting system “or other voting system equipped for individuals with disabilities at each polling place in the state, for each election for federal office.”
Town officials are also required to be trained on how to implement accessible voting systems that comply with HAVA, to keep the equipment in working order and provide all software and other updates. The deal also requires them to certify after every federal primary and general election that they have complied with the agreement.
Because the cases was originally pursued by the DOJ in the last year of President Joe Biden’s term, Hasenstab acknowledged that voting rights advocates watched the progress of the case with some concern after President Donald Trump took office and began reversing many Biden administration policies.
“We did have some nervousness that they wouldn’t pursue a final resolution to the case,” Hasenstab said Tuesday. “We’re pleasantly surprised that an agreement ended up being reached and that the Department of Justice stuck with that case.”

(Getty Images)A former nursing home owner pardoned by President Donald Trump asked a judge Tuesday for a delay before he has to report to an Arkansas prison to serve his state sentence, citing concerns that the state would be unable to meet his religious dietary needs.
Attorneys for Joseph Schwartz asked a judge for an extension to her order that he report to the Arkansas Department of Corrections by December 29. 
Schwartz, of New York, was three months into a three-year federal sentence for tax fraud when President Donald Trump pardoned him in November. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Karen Whatley last week ordered Schwartz to report to the Ouachita River Correctional Unit to serve out the remainder of his one-year sentence for his state conviction on Medicaid fraud and tax evasion charges.
Attorney General Tim Griffin earlier this month filed a petition seeking that Schwartz serve out the rest of his state sentence. 
Schwartz’s one-year Arkansas sentence was to run concurrently with his federal sentence, according to his plea deal with the state. Whatley had rejected Schwartz’s argument that the three months he served in federal prison made him immediately eligible for state parole.
In Tuesday’s filing, Schwartz’s attorneys said as a rabbi, he must adhere to a strict kosher diet. 
He’s restricted to a stricter form of kosher meat, not just from eating pork, according to the court filing.
“Schwartz does not believe the Arkansas Department of Corrections is sufficiently prepared to care for him and meet his religious and dietary needs while in custody,” Schwartz’s attorneys said in the filing.
Griffin’s office dismissed the motion as a delay tactic and said they would oppose the motion.
“Joseph Schwartz’s motion is a baseless attempt to delay completing his sentence,” spokesman Jeff LeMaster said in an email. “We have confirmed that the Department of Corrections has a kosher kitchen ready to meet Schwartz’s dietary needs.”
Schwartz pleaded guilty last year in federal court for his role in a $38 million tax fraud scheme involving nursing homes he owned across the country. He was pardoned by Trump in November.

Officials will also start using the map to assess fees on property owners in high-risk areas to help conduct assessments meant to minimize risk. 
Statewide, about 60,000 structures in Utah have been deemed “high risk” for wildfires. That’s according to a new online map the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands released last week. 
By plugging in their addresses to the tool called the Utah Wildfire Risk Explorer, Utahns can generate a report on how likely it is that their homes could be impacted by a wildfire. The site also suggests actions homeowners can take to better protect their property.

“Our goal is to empower homeowners, communities, fire departments, and municipalities to act in reducing their vulnerability to wildfire by giving them the necessary tools to identify and understand their wildfire risk,” the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands says on the website. 
State officials were required to build the tool after the 2025 Utah Legislature passed HB48, a law meant to increase wildfire risk awareness and encourage property owners to “share the responsibility of reducing that risk” in wildland urban interface areas, or areas where homes or other structures border or mingle with undeveloped wildlands. 
The Utah Legislature passed the law as wildfires in the West have increased in frequency and severity. Insurers have also raised premiums and created stricter eligibility requirements. 
Utah’s record-breaking fire year, in numbers

“Insurance availability and affordability are concerns for property owners in Utah, and many are already experiencing increased premiums or losing coverage as insurers respond to wildfire risk,” the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire & State Lands says on its website.
Under the law, which takes effect Jan. 1, property insurers are required to use the map to determine a property’s wildfire risk. 
“If an insurer raises rates by 20% or more, or drops coverage due to wildfire risk, it must provide notice and justification based on the facts underlying the decision, if requested by the property owner,” according to the division.
The new law also requires the state to assess property fees within the high-risk wildland urban interface boundary to help support risk assessments. Utahns will only be charged a fee if they own a taxable structure within the map’s High Risk Wildland Urban Interface boundary. 
Starting in 2026 and 2027, the fee will range from $20 to $100 per structure, based on square footage of taxable structures on the property, according to the division’s frequently asked questions page on HB48. 
If property owners take actions to reduce their wildfire risk, the fee may be reduced, the website says.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday threw his support behind a proposed income tax on residents earning more than $1 million annually, and said he’s prepared to sign the policy into law next year. 
Some legislative Democrats are eyeing a 9.9% “millionaires tax” on adjusted annual gross income over $1 million. Ferguson endorsed this version of the proposal. Less than 0.5% of Washingtonians would be subject to the tax, and it’s expected to raise $3 billion per year. 
The revenue wouldn’t hit state coffers until 2029, Ferguson said. On Tuesday, the governor also released a spending proposal for the remainder of the current two-year budget cycle, which seeks to address a shortfall his office pegs at $2.3 billion through mid-2027. 
To have Ferguson’s support, he said the new tax must be used to increase eligibility and payments under the state’s Working Families Tax Credit, which is open to low- and middle-income households. It also has to allow for tax relief for the state’s small businesses. And he wants it to bolster K-12 education and reduce sales taxes.
Ferguson, a Democrat, said it’s too soon to know if adding the income tax would put the state on a sustainable budget path that diminishes the need for further cuts or tax hikes like those approved earlier this year.
He said he is “optimistic” the Legislature will approve the tax next year. 
But the work won’t be done at that point. 
“When we’re here for a bill signing, hopefully here in a couple months, it’s inevitable that two things will happen,” he said in a press conference at the state Capitol. “There will be a court challenge, for sure, right? And ultimately it’ll go before the voters.”
Ferguson, a former three-term state attorney general, said he’s confident courts would uphold the new levy, even though the state Supreme Court has ruled that income taxes are unconstitutional. 
Less than two years ago, the Legislature approved an initiative to prohibit an income tax. And voters have repeatedly rejected income taxes over the years.
Republicans are opposed. 
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, called the income tax idea a “nonstarter” given legal precedent and the 2024 initiative. He also said the proposal avoids “doing the hard work of stopping the spending addiction in Olympia.” And he fears lawmakers would later apply the tax more widely.
“People don’t want an income tax,” said Couture, the lead budget voice among House Republicans.
Ferguson said he’s open to an amendment to the state constitution codifying the $1 million threshold for the income tax, while setting it to rise with inflation.
“I want to be clear that I will not support an income tax for people who make less than $1 million in a year,” he added.
Progressives have been clamoring for an income tax on higher earners. They see it as a way to reduce the tax burden on lower-income households and to avoid further cuts to services.
“He’s looking at the same numbers we are and realizes we have to do something,” said House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle.
Ferguson’s position is a shift from a couple months ago when he said he was “skeptical” of additional revenue measures after signing off on billions of dollars in new taxes in May to fill a budget shortfall. 
If the tax is adopted, Ferguson said he wants to explore limiting sales taxes on personal hygiene products, like shampoo, deodorant and toothpaste, as well as eliminating the levies on baby products, like formula and diapers, and “essential and affordable clothing items.”
“Progressive tax reform cannot just mean increasing contributions from those who can afford it,” Ferguson said. “We must use the gains from the millionaires tax to return money directly to working families and small business owners who have been hit hard by the affordability crisis.”
Fitzgibbon said while his caucus has “a lot of enthusiasm” for the tax, he doesn’t think his colleagues would confine the tax to the uses the governor outlined.
Couture has filed a bill ahead of the legislative session that would require the state to reduce its sales tax commensurate with any tax on income.

Ferguson also said his position hasn’t changed on the so-called wealth tax that progressives have pushed for. Earlier this year, he rejected the idea when legislative Democrats backed it to balance their budget proposals. The governor warned it was untested and could get held up in court without delivering needed revenue. 
At the time, he left the door open to a scaled-back version bringing in no more than $100 million per year to see if it would survive challenges. 
He also said Tuesday he’s “not a big fan” of a statewide tax modeled on the city of Seattle’s payroll levy on companies. Progressives have identified that as another option for raising more state revenue and reducing financial pressures on lower earners. 
Lawmakers will convene for a 60-day legislative session beginning Jan. 12.

Eagle Nest Lake State Park’s Polar Bear Plunge is a free annual event sponsored by the volunteers at Friends of Eagle Nest Lake and Cimarron Canyon State Parks that invites people to brave the freezing temperatures and jump into the lake. The event is part of America’s State Parks First Day Hikes, an event that encourages people to kick off the new year by spending time outdoors enjoying the various landscapes. 
According to the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, all 35 New Mexico state parks participate in the First Day Hikes with various activities. For example, Storrie Lake State Park in Las Vegas also hosts a Polar Bear Plunge and the Rio Grande Nature Center State Park offers a New Year’s Day Nature Walk.

Gail Tate has plunged into Eagle Nest Lake two years in a row and was preparing to take her third plunge in just a few days. However, she told Source New Mexico that because the season has been warmer than usual, there’s no ice in the water. Still, she’s looking forward to taking part in the tradition, calling it a “polar run” this year.
“I had always wanted to do [a plunge]. It was on my bucket list,” Tate said. “But I had envisioned jumping into a swimming pool…. I thought one of those days I would do it, and then finding out that Eagle Nest does it every year, I thought, ‘I’m going to do that, I’m going to take the plunge, no pun intended.’”
Participants register the day of and must wear shoes as they prepare to hop in two-at-a-time into the popular fishing lake. Tate said the water comes up to about her shoulders. Plungers are quickly directed to a nearby ladder by safety personnel so they can climb out and step into towels and robes to warm back up. Participants can also bring a partner or make a friend while they’re there to hold their belongings while they’re in the water.
As a seasoned plunger and now a member of the Friends board, Tate encourages everyone she comes across to try it out for themselves and join in the “jovial” mood.
“It’s just the courage and the willingness to go out there and do it,” she said. “[The first time] was such a spiritual experience. I came out and I stood around and watched all the other plungers and cheered them on. I was totally warm because again, I got my robe on, I put my towel around my neck. It was so exhilarating. I can’t describe it, I mean, it’s just beyond.”

People of all ages take the plunge year-to-year, with some traveling to the scenic village from around the state. Tate said about 50 people participate each year, but there are many more locals and visitors who join to cheer on the plungers and enjoy hot cocoa and treats by the park’s wood-burning fireplace.
“These events bring people together and remind us why our state parks matter,” New Mexico State Parks Director Toby Velásquez said in a statement. “New Mexico’s landscapes inspire resilience and adventure, and there’s no better way to begin the year than by experiencing them firsthand.”
People can also join in a Polar Stomp hike near Eagle Nest Lake State Park earlier in the day, before taking a plunge. Other events can be found on the EMNRD event calendar.
“These traditions remind us that our parks are more than destinations,” Velásquez said. “They’re part of who we are as New Mexicans, nuestra gente, nuestras familias, y nuestra historia. We invite everyone to join us, take care of these places and make new memories for the new year ahead.

,DC,2025-12-23 22:48:01+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Supreme Court in defeat for Trump blocks deployment of National Guard in Chicago,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-defeat-trump-blocks-deployment-national-guard-chicago,,"President Donald Trump for now has not met the requirements to send National Guard troops to Chicago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday afternoon in a major setback for the president.The court’s majority rejected the Trump administration’s request to stay, or halt, a lower court’s order barring federalization of National Guard troops to assist federal immigration enforcement officers in Chicago. The president is only empowered to federalize National Guard units when the troops are enforcing laws that regular military forces are legally allowed to enforce, the court said in a ruling from its emergency docket that will apply while the merits of the case are argued.The Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 1878, generally prevents the military from participating in civilian law enforcement.The decision on the eve of a five-day holiday weekend for the federal government appeared to be 6-3, with three conservative justices, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, dissenting. The ruling represented the first time the high court has weighed in on Trump’s use of the guard in several cities, though other legal fights continue.The administration had not shown why the situation in Chicago, in which residents have protested aggressive immigration enforcement, should present an exception to the law, the court majority said.“At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the majority opinion said.In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the ruling would not detract from Trump’s “core agenda.”“The President promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,” Jackson wrote. “He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property.”Protecting federal officersIn a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whom Trump appointed during his first term, wrote that he agreed with the decision to deny the motion for a stay, but would have done so on narrower grounds.The majority opinion was overly restrictive and would block the president from using National Guard forces to protect federal property and personnel, Kavanaugh said.Alito wrote in a dissent, joined by Thomas, that their interpretation of the majority’s order could have far-reaching consequences that undermine the traditional role of the guard.It would free National Guard members to enforce immigration law, but not to provide protection to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are assigned that function, Alito wrote. “Whatever one may think about the current administration’s enforcement of the immigration laws or the way ICE has conducted its operations, the protection of federal officers from potentially lethal attacks should not be thwarted,” Alito wrote. “I therefore respectfully dissent.”Implications for other citiesThe ruling is only in effect while the case, in which Illinois is challenging the administration’s deployment there, proceeds. But it marks a rebuke, including from a Trump appointee, of the administration’s strategy of deploying National Guard troops to assist in its aggressive immigration enforcement.Trump has ordered troops to Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon, to either counter crime generally or assist federal immigration officials. Governors of Democratic-led states have strenuously pushed back against those deployments. Republican attorneys general have argued their states are harmed by the protests in Chicago and other cities that impede federal ICE officers from doing their jobs.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzer in a statement praised the ruling. “Today is a big win for Illinois and American democracy,” he said. “I am glad the Supreme Court has ruled that Donald Trump did not have the authority to deploy the federalized guard in Illinois. This is an important step in curbing the Trump Administration's consistent abuse of power and slowing Trump’s march toward authoritarianism.”",,,,2025-12-23 17:57:53.776358

Wages could be garnished as early as 30 days after borrowers receive notice.The agency noted that collections activities would be conducted only after borrowers were given sufficient notice and the opportunity to pay back their loans.Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel for the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, blasted the decision as “cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible” in a Tuesday statement. “As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers’ wages instead of defending borrowers’ right to affordable payments,” Yu added. The agency resumed collections for defaulted federal student loans in May, following a pause that started during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of defaulting on one’s student loans, a borrower can have their wages garnished, and the “loan holder can order your employer to withhold up to 15% of your disposable pay to collect your defaulted debt” without being taken to court, according to Federal Student Aid, an office of the Education Department. With wage garnishment, borrowers have the right to “be sent a notice that explains ED’s intention to garnish your wages in 30 days, the nature and amount of your debt, your opportunity to inspect and copy records relating to your debt, your right to object to garnishment, and your option to avoid garnishment by voluntary repayments,” according to FSA.",,,,2025-12-23 17:57:53.776358

(Provided by Montana State University)Montana State University will be the site of a new U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
The new Community Engagement Office will support workforce development in the state and region, especially in advanced manufacturing and computing, according to a news release from Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office.
The federal Patent and Trademark Office announced the selection of Montana this month as the first of “several” new Community Engagement Offices formerly served by the Rocky Mountain Regional Outreach Office.
The regional office in Denver is set to close. In a news release announcing the closure in October, the Patent and Trademark Office said physical space had become less necessary for the work.
A recent announcement from MSU said the flagship was selected based on its “robust research activity,” its graduate level programs in areas that lead to innovations, and its ability to commercialize technology and develop businesses.
MSU spokesperson Mike Becker said Monday the timeline for the opening wasn’t firm yet, nor was a specific location on campus, but he anticipated the office would be running within a year or so.
Once it opens, MSU said the Bozeman office will join Dallas and San Francisco as the largest hubs west of the Mississippi providing patent and trademark services to inventors and startups.
“We’re just thrilled to be the first announced for sure,” Becker said.
In a statement, MSU President Brock Tessman said the office will be a resource to entrepreneurs and innovators across the Rocky Mountain West.
“It will provide access to opportunity for first-time inventors, small business owners and students throughout the region, leading to the kind of growth and innovation that drives our region’s prosperity,” Tessman said.
MSU, the largest university in the state, reported in 2025 a new record level of research expenditures with $288.7 million, most from federal funders, such as the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture.
In a September letter, Gianforte encouraged U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to consider Bozeman as a potential location for a community outreach or satellite office.
Gianforte cited MSU as an anchor research institution as part of the rationale and described the region as a “growing tech hub corridor.”
The governor noted support for a Montana location also came from U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, The Montana Photonics & Quantum Alliance, Montana Chamber of Commerce, the Montana Retail Association, and the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education.
In a statement following the selection of MSU, the governor said the choice to locate the office at the Bozeman flagship “rightfully recognizes Montana’s growing advanced manufacturing and tech sectors.”
Gianforte, Daines and Sheehy have residences in or near Bozeman, and the Gianforte Family Foundation is a major donor to MSU.
“This new USPTO office will play a strategic role in expanding opportunity for all Montanans, providing innovators with the tools to protect their inventions and grow their operations, while ensuring Montana remains at the cutting edge of technology, security, and economic growth,” Gianforte said in a statement.
MSU said its scientists perform “cutting-edge research” in engineering, national security, cybersecurity, bioscience, energy, agriculture, optics and quantum computing, among many other fields.
Alison Harmon, vice president of research and economic development at MSU, said the new office will help accelerate commercialization and connect innovation with societal impact.
The MSU office will serve Montana, Colorado, Idaho, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, according to the federal agency’s announcement.



Research at MSU
In the news release about the patent and trademark office, MSU highlighted some of its current research:
Through a National Science Foundation-funded program called Accelerating Research Translation, MSU has supported what are known as seed translational research projects, or STRPs, providing funding and mentorship to directly advance promising research toward public benefit. The ART program at MSU has supported work that includes:

A digital learning platform to help middle and high school students explore the college experience to prepare for their futures
An innovative wearable medical device to help patients from rural and tribal communities take part in clinical trials
Technology related to CRISPR gene-editing, which has applications ranging from vaccine development to the treatment of genetic diseases
Tools to detect algal blooms in rivers and other waterways
Genetic research to increase yield in durum wheat, which is used for making pasta and other grains
Computers designed to function in space and resist cyberattacks, one of which was recently sent to the moon on a NASA mission

MSU is also home to units and partnerships that promote connections among researchers, industry and federal agencies to bring technologies to market. Those include:

The Institute for National Security Research and Education, which strengthens national security by delivering technologies, supporting researchers and preparing leaders to safeguard the future of Montana and the United States.
MSU’s TechLink Center, which is the Department of Defense’s only national partnership intermediary for technology transfer. Since 1999, TechLink has helped companies around the country license DOD inventions to create new products and services, transferring more than 1,000 DOD inventions to industry. The center facilitates approximately 60% of all DOD license agreements nationwide.
MilTech is an authorized National Government Partnership Intermediary that helps bring innovative technology to the U.S. government quickly, reliably and cost-effectively, MSU said. Established in 2004, MilTech has more than 300 active and completed projects with DOD and Department of Homeland Security.
In 2025, the DOD named MSU a Defense Innovation Unit OnRamp Hub, which will bring the university’s cutting-edge facilities and trained researchers together with companies to scale up and rapidly field technologies for use in defense projects. MSU said the hub will lead to more connections between MSU and Montana’s business and technology communities and DIU funding opportunities.

Melissa H. Ziobron announced her candidacy to regain the 34th House District seat that she gave up in 2018.","With her successor retiring, former state Rep. Melissa H. Ziobron, R-East Haddam, is running to regain the 34th House District seat that she gave up to unsuccessfully run for state Senate in 2018.
If she wins, her immediate reward will be about an $84,000 pay cut.
Ziobron is currently a senior staffer at the General Assembly, overseeing fiscal policy for the House Republican minority, a full time job that pays about $132,000. It keeps her close to the fray, but not a participant.
“The last few years, I’ve been extremely frustrated to watch taxpayer funds spent without true accountability,” Ziobron said.
She lost a close race for the open 33rd Senate District seat in 2018, a brutal year for Republicans in the midterm election during President Donald Trump’s first term. Democrats won huge majorities, ending what had been a closely divided state legislature.
Her House seat remained in Republican hands, won by Irene Haines, who would simultaneously serve as selectwoman in East Haddam. Haines is exiting politics: She didn’t run for the local office last month, and she is not running for the House next year.
Ziobron said she is a fan of the famous Teddy Roosevelt quote:
“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena…”
Ziobron was elected to the House in 2012, flipping an open Democratic seat. Over the next two cycles, Republicans made steady gains in 2014 and 2016, growing from 52 seats to 71 — just five short of a majority in her last two-year term.
Combined with an 18-18 tie in the Senate, the close margins gave Republicans a greater voice in budget negotiations of which she was a part, producing the fiscal guardrails that still limit spending today. But Democrats since have won twice as many seats as Republicans.
Still, Ziobron wants a seat in the House, not on the sidelines.
“I’ve done what I can as staff, but I know I can do more with a microphone in my hand,” she said. “I want to be able to put my head on the pillow at night.”
Ziobron said she has not been happy watching the General Assembly change. She said lawmakers have stepped away from accountability-based budgeting, and she disapproves of the limited remote voting allowed since COVID.
“I’ve watched the legislative process in Connecticut lose its seriousness,” she said “I watch legislators vote from their cars.”
Her district also has changed since the redistricting after the 2020 census: It now includes East Haddam, East Hampton and Salem, with Salem replacing Colchester from her time in the House.
Ziobron said the decision to run again, giving up a full time job and salary, was made with her husband.
“This was certainly a family decision,” she said. “He has watched me be very unhappy.”
She filed papers creating a campaign committee last week. An hour after the Connecticut Mirror called her Tuesday for this story, she formally announced her candidacy.
“I was planning on waiting to announce this until after Christmas, but it seems the news will break sooner than I had planned,” she wrote on Facebook.
In her announcement statement, she said her core values have not changed.
“What has changed is my depth of knowledge and understanding of our state budget system, still in need of reform and increased transparency,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2060-e1525293090445.jpg,,,2025-12-23 17:57:53.776358

LaMonica McIver faces assault charges related to her last visit to the jail on May 9. She toured it again Tuesday, spurred by an inmate's death.","Rep. LaMonica McIver speaks outside of Delaney Hall after she, Rep. Rob Menendez, and New York Rep. Yvette Clarke visited the Newark migrant jail for an oversight visit on Dec. 23, 2025. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK — Days after immigration officials announced the death of a detainee at Newark migrant jail Delaney Hall, Rep. LaMonica McIver visited the facility for the first time since prosecutors allege she assaulted federal agents there during a melee in May.
McIver’s visit coincided with a new filing in the Newark Democrat’s criminal case in which her attorneys accuse prosecutors of failing to produce key evidence that they say shows bias among the agents involved in the scuffle, including one agent’s use of a racial slur in a group text the morning of the incident that led to McIver’s indictment.
“It is very traumatic to be back here personally,” McIver told reporters after Tuesday’s visit. “But at the same time, I have a responsibility to serve the people and protect the people of the 10th Congressional District, and that is why I had to put aside my traumatic experience here and come back here and represent them and see what is happening inside of this awful detention center.”
Reps. Rob Menendez (D-08) and Yvette Clarke (D-New York) joined McIver for the three-hour visit to Delaney Hall. They said there were no incidents involving staff of prison owner Geo Group, but they left with major concerns about inmates’ medical care, their access to food and water, and prison officials’ transparency.
They said dozens of detainees they met with are sick and coughing, are housed in overcrowded units, don’t have access to proper food, and are forced to wait weeks for medical attention. Detainees compared the jail to a slaughterhouse, Menendez said, “because they know they will hit a dead end no matter what they try to do.”
“These are human beings. These are people who are taken out of our communities and are being held here — on your dime, on the American taxpayer’s dime, while Geo Group makes more money than they ever have in their entire history,” Menendez said. “That’s what’s happening inside there.”
More than 950 people are being held at Delaney Hall, double the number from when Menendez last visited. Lawmakers said many of the detainees don’t have criminal records, and some were arrested in courthouses and legal offices while working on their immigration status. Other detainees are in the country legally on student visas, and one man inside is married to a U.S. military service member, they said.
As they have in the past, the Democratic lawmakers condemned the escalating detention tactics of the Trump administration and called on the jail to close. McIver said they’ll continue to conduct oversight regularly until it shutters.

Menendez was also with McIver on May 9, when the two, along with Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), visited the jail for an unannounced inspection. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, was also there, and federal agents arrested him and accused him of trespassing (they quickly dropped the charge when video surfaced of a prison guard inviting Baraka onto the property).
During the scuffle that ensued when agents moved to detain Baraka, prosecutors allege, McIver shoved two guards, and they later charged her with assault. McIver has pleaded not guilty and has argued that agents caused the chaos that erupted when Baraka was arrested.
One of her attorneys, Lee Cortes, demanded in a Tuesday filing in her case that the government release more communications between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents the day of Baraka’s arrest. They said a “paltry” 54 text messages were ultimately produced after U.S. District Court Judge Jamel K. Semper in October ordered their release.
Those text messages, Cortes says, are material and favorable to McIver’s defense. In a May 10 text message sent in a group chat, an ICE officer who witnessed Baraka’s arrest says they doubt any Congress members present would be arrested because their conduct “wasn’t enough like a swing or anything,” according to Cortes. One of the agents McIver is accused of assaulting was in that group chat and did not dispute that characterization, the letter reads.
Cortez also alleges that an ICE agent accused of shoving McIver that day used a racial slur in a Signal group chat with other agents. Another officer responded to say a Black officer included in the chat “is having a stroke right now,” and other agents responded with laughing emojis, Cortes’ letter says.
“That type of behavior is material impeachment evidence for any of the officers who participated in the Signal group, particularly given the group’s later aggressive treatment of Mayor Baraka and Congresswoman McIver,” wrote Cortes.
Semper rejected McIver’s bid to throw out two of three counts she faces. He is still deciding on the third.

Some of the heat is coming from Connecticut lawmakers.
The segment was about the conditions at a notoriously harsh El Salvadoran prison where migrants are being detained after being deported from the United States. Hours before it was supposed to air, CBS editor-in-chief Bari Weiss made multiple change requests, and then the segment was ultimately pulled before airing in the U.S.
Sharyn Alfonsi, who reported the story, said in a message to colleagues obtained by The New York Times that it had been cleared by rigorous internal reviews and was pulled for political reasons.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) agreed.
“The segment didn’t air because Trump has effectively taken editorial control of CBS,” Murphy said. “What happened a few months ago is that CBS’s parent company got bought. It got bought in a sale in which Trump basically said to the company that was buying it, if you want CBS, you’ve got to make CBS be more conservative. And you’ve essentially got to answer to me.”
In a three-minute social media video, Murphy went on to say media company mergers were making it more difficult for news organizations to report fairly.
“It previews what’s coming in American media as more and more networks get bought up by these giant, billion-dollar corporations that care only about profit and are willing to give Donald Trump editorial control in order for their CEOs and investors to make billions off of these sales,” Murphy said. “This is how democracy dies.”
In a statement, Weiss said the piece would air at a later date after more reporting was done.
“Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom,” Weiss said in a statement.
The piece aired in Canada and has since circulated online.

Clay Yarborough, R-Jacksonville. (Photo by Colin Hackley)There may be yet another legislative tussle in 2026 over cultural flashpoints dealing with parental rights and gender-affirming care.
A Jacksonville Republican filed a bill Tuesday to broaden the power of Florida’s attorney general to investigate health care providers who allegedly violate Florida’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors as well as state and local government employees who violate the state’s “Parents’ Bill of Rights.”
Sen. Clay Yarborough’s bill, SB 1010, would amend the 2023 transgender care statute to make it illegal for a health care provider to aid or abet a minor in search of the care. Providers who help minors could face a third-degree felony. The draft doesn’t define “aid and abet.”
If the attorney general determines a health care provider violated the ban, the state’s top law enforcement officer could file a a civil suit against the practitioner, seeking penalties of up to $100,000 per violation. Any damages recovered would accrue to the benefit of the minor.
The attorney general would have to file the suit within two years of the investigation’s launch.
There is no companion measure in the House to date.
The bill empowers Florida’s attorney general — now James Uthmeier — to investigate alleged violations of the 2021 law establishing a “Parents’ Bill of Rights.”
Uthmeier, appointed to the position earlier this year by Gov. Ron DeSantis, has already made parental rights a focus. In April, Uthmeier announced creation of an Office of Parental Rights.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The 2021 law bans political subdivisions and other governmental entities from infringing upon the fundamental right of a parent to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health of his or her minor child without demonstrating a compelling state interest.
SB 1010 amends the 2021 statute to allow the attorney general to investigate alleged violations and, within two years of the findings, file civil suits seeking penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation. 
The bill creates a specific cause of action against health care practitioners and state and local government employees who violate the Parents’ Bill of Rights.
Specific to health care, the Parents’ Bill of Rights guarantees, unless prohibited by law, the right of parents to make health care decisions, to access and review all medical records of the minor child, and to consent in writing before any record of their child’s blood or DNA is created, stored, or shared.
Health care practitioners who violate the existing law now only face disciplinary action.
Protections for political and ideological beliefs in school
Another Yarborough bill filed Tuesday would amend state law protecting religious liberty in school to include students who express political or ideological beliefs and the school clubs they belong to.
The bill would allow a school district to prohibit, limit, and restrict expression that the First Amendment does not protect. The districts also could limit expression that is “unwelcome, and so severe, pervasive, and subjectively and objectively offensive, that  a student is  effectively denied equal access to educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.”
Any student group or club or student whose rights are violated could sue the school district for declaratory and injunctive relief, statutory punitive damages, reasonable attorney fees, and costs. The bill would provide punitive damages between $15,000 and $25,000 for the student or student club if they prevail.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City nonprofit is aiming to reduce homelessness among teens aging out of the foster care system, one tiny home at a time. 
Pivot, a program that offers teens aging out of fostercare food, shelter, and therapy, began building tiny homes in 2015. Multiple tiny homes have been built over the past decade on Pivot’s property as a long-term transitional living solution for at-risk youth, or those who are homeless are lack access to permanent housing.
Janeal Jones, Pivot’s director of transitional living, said that the tiny homes have been a “huge success.” They offer teens in crisis a fresh start. 
“We used to house teens at an apartment complex, but we later navigated the same concept to be on the property of Pivot by building tiny homes, so that teens can have closer access to food, therapy, and other resources,” Jones said.
Currently, there are 41 tiny homes on Pivot’s property, which are supervised 24 hours a day throughout the week. 
It costs $100 a month to live in a tiny home, and occupants usually range in age from 16 to 24 years. Each home contains a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and dining room.
Occupants have to remain out of trouble, continue to finish school, and have a job to pay for the rent of a tiny home. They also have access to a food pantry, a medical clinic, therapy, life skills, and professional development classes, according to Pivot’s website. Occupants are chosen to live in the tiny homes based on their financial, parental, and shelter needs. 
There is no wait list for the tiny homes.
According to the National Youth Foster Initiative, which focuses on transforming the nation’s child welfare systems, about 20% of foster children become homeless when they turn 18 and are emancipated from the system. 
Nationally, about 1 in 4 will be homeless within four years of aging out of foster care, the group found.
The Oklahoma Department of Human Services has embraced the tiny home model as a way to help shelter some of its teens aging out of foster care. 
In July 2024, the nonprofit celebrated the opening of 15 new tiny homes and a community center that were funded by a $3 million grant from the Oklahoma Department of Human Services. 
“The tiny homes and community center will give young people much-needed stability and support while they work with our Oklahoma Successful Adulthood Program to implement longer-term housing plans and design their own future,” said then-Director Deborah Shropshire in a statement. “We are grateful for the many ways the community has embraced foster care and for the additional pathways this partnership will create for the young people we serve.”
Carrie Snodgrass, a spokesperson for the Department of Human Services, said recently that the agency does not have any plans to fund any additional homes at this time.

Gov. Burt Jones. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia’s State Election Board will see at least one new member in 2026. 
Lt. Gov. Burt Jones appointed Salleigh Grubbs, a top Georgia GOP official and elections activist, to the panel. Her appointment is not expected to alter the partisan balance on the board, which has a strong Republican majority that has been aligned with President Donald Trump. 
Grubbs is the former head of the Cobb County Republican Party, and currently serves as the first vice chair of the Georgia Republican Party. 
“It was my pleasure to appoint Salleigh Grubbs to the State Election Board,” Jones said in a statement. “I have no doubt she will bring significant passion and expertise to overseeing Georgia’s elections.”
She will replace former state Sen. Rick Jeffares, who has served on the board since the start of 2024. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the AJC reported that he was resigning for personal reasons.
Grubbs said Tuesday that she is grateful for the appointment.
“I look forward to serving in a bipartisan way to help the other members on the State Election Board and will serve with integrity and character,” she said in a statement.
The five-member State Election Board is tasked with overseeing cases involving potential violations of election laws and issuing guidance to help elections run more smoothly. However, in recent years members of the board have been accused of acting beyond their authority, including approving a series of last-minute election rule changes ahead of the 2024 general election that could have made it easier to delay certifying the results, and embarking on a yearslong endeavor to prove wrongdoing in the 2020 presidential election. That year, former President Joe Biden won in Georgia by nearly 12,000 votes.
State election panel recommends ending no-excuse absentee voting in Georgia

In 2024, Grubbs was one of the key supporters of an election rule proposal allowing county election board members to request a virtually unlimited amount of records and documents relating to voting machines and vote tabulation before certifying the results of an election. She also advocated for a rule requiring election workers to hand-count ballots to ensure that the total number of ballots cast is not greater than the total number of voters who submitted ballots. Those changes were passed by the board but invalidated ahead of the 2024 election by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Cox Jr.
The Georgia Supreme Court permanently struck down four of the rules in June, concluding that members of the board exceeded their authority in attempting to implement guidelines that went beyond the scope of Georgia’s election laws.
This year, Grubbs co-authored a failed proposal seeking to clarify the circumstances under which voters can switch to paper ballots rather than using ballot-marking devices. Opponents of the proposal worried that the rule would go beyond the scope of the board’s authority.
Grubbs also established a fundraising campaign earlier this year for the board’s vice chair, Janice Johnston, after she was sued by the watchdog nonprofit organization American Oversight for refusing to turn over her emails in response to an open records request. The campaign raised over $29,000, including one anonymous donation of $10,000, according to The Guardian. The webpage for the fundraiser has since been taken down, and the board later settled the lawsuit for $50,000.
Georgia GOP chair Josh McKoon celebrated Grubbs’ appointment.
“Salleigh Grubbs brings a strong record of leadership and a deep commitment to election integrity,” McKoon said in a statement. “Her experience and dedication to fair, transparent elections will serve Georgians well.”

(Photo by wera Rodsawang/Getty Stock Photo)You wouldn’t know it from daily news across the nation, state and city, but many schools are beating the odds and achieving outstanding results. They are all a gift to our schoolchildren.
It’s not easy to single one out, but I am particularly in touch with the Hampstead Hill Academy, a neighborhood K-8 school up the street from where I lived in the Canton area of Baltimore City. It’s a shiny holiday ornament: Proof that a school predominantly serving students from low-income backgrounds and students of color can succeed at high rates.
Here are some facts and figures.
Student achievement. Hampstead Hill is the only city school to earn a 5-star (highest) ranking in the 2025 state report cards. It ranks 16th in middle schools and top 25 in elementary schools statewide.
It has the highest test scores overall in  the city, with 63.9% of  students achieving proficiency on at least one of the state tests. It topped second place Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (my alma mater) with 60.7%.
On the Maryland State Department of Education school report cards.  Hampstead Hill is the highest performing city elementary or middle school based on academic, school quality and student success measures.

Views of writers are their own.




On absenteeism. Hampstead Hill’s chronic absentee rate of around 9% is well below the state  average of around 30% and city schools’ average of around 49%.   Its daily attendance rate of 95% substantially exceeds the overall rates for both the city and state.
On measures of family satisfaction. An unpublished report indicates overall family satisfaction was 96% compared to 83% for all city schools
So what is Hampstead Hill’s secret sauce? There are many tangible and intangible factors but here are a top five.

Leadership. The principal Matt Hornbeck has great relationships with teachers and parents. He’s a self-starter — aggressive in his goals while being collaborative. An outside unpublished national report on leadership of school principals ranked him in the top 99.4 percentile nationwide. Another measure of his leadership is the over $12 million that he raised to build a second facility on the school site which houses students, a gym and community events.
Smart and relentless focus on teacher recruitment and retention. Hornbeck told a reporter, “If there is a non-negotiable, it’s finding and keeping the very best teachers. Teachers are the whole game.” Hampstead Hill’s retention rate beats city and statewide averages.
Longevity and continuity. Hornbeck has served over 20 years as the Hampstead Hill principal. Before that, he was immersed in city schools as a student, teacher and parent. The average tenure for city superintendents nationwide is around five years.
Charter school status. Hampstead Hill is a charter school which is part of the six-school network under the Baltimore Curriculum Project. Charter school status offers more flexibility and BCP provides valuable support.
It runs in the family. Hornbeck’s father, David Hornbeck, was Maryland state and Philadelphia superintendent and a notable national presence, and his brother Mark is the accomplished principal of nearby Wolfe Street Academy.

Many other schools have some or all of these ingredients (except the family roots). So, if we know a secret sauce, how do we get it cooking in other schools in the city and elsewhere?
Not easily. My overriding impression is that the success factors at Hampstead Hill are not all that dramatically different from familiar school improvement strategies; rather, it’s that they’re executed at a higher level. One lesson is that school systems must pay more attention to effective implementation of instructional and school climate best practices.
Hornbeck says we’re “doing what works well,” with some innovative add-ons. In particular, he cites their “restorative practices” program which builds relationships and healthy communication among students, teachers and parents.
Whatever the exact Hampstead Hill gift package, we should celebrate the extraordinary dedication of all public school educators. They are year-in and year-out blessings.

Tim Walz speculated Tuesday that an influx of federal immigration officials will be present in Minnesota during the next few weeks and suggested that the Trump administration will want to make more arrests during the holidays because that would be “especially cruel” and “especially mean-spirited.”
Walz, surrounded by faith leaders and elected officials, said his administration isn’t made aware of the details of immigration raids, but Minnesotans stand by their immigrant neighbors and won’t be intimidated by President Donald Trump’s targeted campaign to increase arrests in the state.
Though unconfirmed, the governor said Minnesotans should expect more federal agents in the streets in the coming days, as soon as Christmas Eve.
“If I were a betting person, they will do it over these holiday seasons, because it makes it especially cruel, makes it especially mean-spirited. It makes it especially traumatizing for communities that wish to gather and celebrate in their faith,” said Walz, who is running for a third, four-year term.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said that if tensions between federal officials and Minnesota protesters continue to intensify, violence could ensue.
“I am gravely concerned that if we continue on this present trajectory, somebody is going to get killed,” Frey said.
On Sunday, a federal immigration officer fired a weapon after he was struck by the vehicle of a fleeing suspect in St. Paul, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Last week, the ACLU of Minnesota sued federal immigration authorities, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and their leaders are routinely violating the constitutional rights of people protesting their actions.
DHS says it has made over 670 arrests since “Operation Metro Surge” began, the Star Tribune reported, but the paper hasn’t been able to independently verify that number.
Walz on Tuesday said that Trump is targeting Democratic states and cities with immigration raids and suggested Trump is sending an influx of agents to Minnesota to distract from negative press coverage.

For years the National Insurance Crime Bureau ranked Albuquerque as the worst city in the nation for car theft. Officials blamed Hyundai and Kia, in particular, and said viral videos showed how easy it is to steal those compared to other vehicles. 
As part of the recent settlement, Hyundai and Kia will pay up to $4.5 million to customers whose cars were recently stolen or damaged and will pay an additional $4.5 million in penalties to states across the U.S. 
Both manufacturers will equip all vehicles sold in the U.S. with industry standard anti-theft technology and offer free ignition cylinder protectors to people who drive eligible models. 
“Consumers should never have to worry that their vehicle is an easy target because manufacturers failed to include basic, industry-standard safeguards,” Torrez said in a statement. “New Mexicans rely on their cars every day, and when companies cut corners, it puts families and public safety at risk.” 
Residents who previously downloaded software updates but still had their cars stolen on or after April 29 are eligible to file a restitution claim, Torrez’s office said. Hyundai drivers can do so online at HKMultistateimmobilizersettlement.com and Kia users can do so online at customercare.kiausa.com/SWLD or by phone at 1-800-333-4542.
Torrez first signed on to a letter to Kia and Hyundai in 2023 and urged the manufacturers to immediately remedy the problem. Torrez and 22 other attorneys general characterized the companies’ recent moves — which included software updates on affected vehicles and ignition cylinder protectors for the cars that couldn’t download the software patch — as insufficient. 
“The recent announcement of a customer service campaign – not a recall – which combines warning stickers, longer alarms and a software upgrade, is positive news but less than is called for under the circumstances. Our concerns with the adequacy of the newly-announced measures are informed by your companies’ slow response and lack of acceptance of responsibility for the crisis over the past few years,” they wrote. “Your companies’ decisions not to install anti-theft immobilizers as standard equipment on certain vehicles sold in the United States has caused ongoing consumer harm and undermined public safety in communities across the country. It is well past time that you acknowledge your companies’ role and take swift and comprehensive action to remedy it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Raul.jpg,,,2025-12-23 16:12:12.822151

But the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said […]","A black tarp flaps during the afternoon on the playground of Broadwater Elementary School in Billings, Montana on Aug. 29, 2023 (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan)When the Montana Legislature set out to relax gun laws in 2021, the Republican-led effort wasn’t about eliminating gun-free school zones, it was to make it easier for residents to carry concealed weapons — something lawmakers believed aligned with the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
But the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in a case involving a Billings man who was patrolling a neighborhood next to an elementary school that the Legislature may have created a legal loophole in the state that narrows gun-free school zones to the school properties themselves, which fall under the control of local school boards.
The concealed-carry law has become a sort of a law of unintended consequences: It effectually nullifies the gun-free zone around the schools, and it affects law enforcement officers as much as civilians.
The federal appeals court reasoned that the Montana Legislature uniquely created this loophole when it rewrote guns laws in such a way that all citizens, unless they have been otherwise convicted of certain crimes or deemed ineligible to own a gun, have the right to carry a concealed weapon. Concealed weapons are only barred in certain places, or if the property owners expressly prohibit them. Otherwise, the federal court ruled that most residents have a “presumptive” right to carry, rather than needing a concealed-carry permit issued by a state or local authority. This is often called “permitless carry,” or “constitutional carry,” because the courts and legislature have said the right to carry weapons is ensured by the Second Amendment and no further paperwork or permission is needed.
And it was because Gabriel Metcalf had this right that he routinely patrolled the busy neighborhood in central Billings, directly across from Broadwater Elementary, with a firearm, including a 20-gauge shotgun, worrying community members, teachers and parents. Billings Police were called dozens of times to the area on reports of a man with a gun wandering around or near the elementary school. And dozen of times, police spoke with Metcalf, but were unable to do much more than that, even when parents spoke out.
Metcalf told the police that he was patrolling his house and neighborhood because of an abusive former neighbor who had stalked him and his mother. Meanwhile, school officials put up a black tarp that covered a fence and the view of Metcalf’s house, and moved the students to a part of the playground area farthest away.
After dozens of calls, federal law enforcement officers were able to arrest Metcalf, alleging he had broken federal laws guaranteeing a gun-free school zone, usually a 1,000-foot area around a school prohibiting carrying firearms.
But the law grants exceptions for authorized school staff, law enforcement officers and those with concealed carry permits. And it’s for that reason that the Ninth Circuit says that because Montana grants every citizen the right, it must also mean that every citizen is authorized to carry within that buffer zone.
“Our decision is a narrow one,” the ruling said. “Metcalf was the first, and to our knowledge, only person in Montana to have raised the license exception in response to a charge for violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act.”
The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court dismissed charges against Metcalf, exonerating him as he challenged his arrest and prosecution. The court overturned the federal district court decision, saying that while it understood the concerns of the community, the Montana Legislature had created the loophole, and it would be Montana’s lawmakers who would have to close it, according to the ruling.
“The Montana Legislature has made clear that it enacted its state license to comply with federal law, and it did so by directly licensing individuals by statute, rather than by delegating authority to separate state or local agencies,” the ruling said. “Because Congress did not make a clear statement prohibiting Montana’s decision to act, the legislature, rather than through delegated authority other than state officials, Metcalf’s proffered interpretation finds support.”
Attorneys and lawmakers say the case, and the Montana Legislature, may have figured out how to essentially nullify gun-free school zones, a law that many Second Amendment enthusiasts have targeted for years, with mixed results.
The Daily Montanan spoke with several Billings school officials who acknowledged the loophole, but said they feared speaking publicly about the situation for fear of restarting the problem. They said since Metcalf was released, there hasn’t been any neighborhood patrolling with guns.
Still, attorneys and lawmakers say the issue remains, and in Montana, gun-free school zones have now shrunk to school property itself.
Jeffrey Weldon, a Billings attorney who specializes in school and education law, said that the ruling does change the buffer zone around the schools, but he stressed that control of school property hasn’t changed — that’s up to the local school boards, which are given latitude to set their own rules that must be obeyed, with or without a concealed-carry permit.
He said the gun-free school zones have had a number of challenges, including what a nearby property owner can do on their own property. He also said that many people who pass by schools with firearms locked in their cars could have also tripped over the technicality of the law.
“So the law has been limited already,” Weldon explained in an interview.
He said the new court ruling will have the biggest effect on law enforcement. That is, law enforcement won’t be able to do much if the same situation happens, worrying parents, teachers and neighbors.
For now, given the political climate in Montana, Weldon said that a fix would have to come from the Legislature, something that’s unlikely.
“The court said that the remedy is legislative,” Weldon said.
In Montana, the Legislature will not meet again till 2027 — a little more than a year. Even now, there seems to be little appetite to revisit the concealed carry laws, even with the ruling.
Rep. James Reavis, a Democrat whose district includes Broadwater Elementary in Billings, declined an interview request when contacted by the Daily Montanan. However, he did release a statement:


“I do not want to comment on the individual facts of the case, which involve some legally complex issues. But I will say that someone openly brandishing a gun outside of their private property to walk around the sidewalk and the alley in such a way that frightens the neighbors is not responsible gun ownership. Police should have the power to do something when the open carry of firearms outside of private property is frightening the neighbors. It doesn’t even have to be a criminal remedy.”
 
Sen. Mike Yakawich, a Billings Republican whose district also includes Broadwater Elementary, said he spoke with teachers, parents and administrators about the issue.
“They’re more skittish than a politician when it comes to this,” Yakawich said. “They do not see this as a problem.”
He said in Montana, seeing someone carry a firearm is normal. And he said he knows many people who carry a concealed firearm.
“This issue is not guns,” Yakawich said.
Yakawich said he knows first hand about gun violence. “South Side Mike,” a nickname he’s given himself, has been shot at twice while working on the city’s South Side as both an activist and city council member before moving to the Legislature. Both times, Yakawich noted a bullet nearly missed him. Both times, he said the gunfire was retribution for organizing marches against drug dealers and crime in a movement meant for neighbors to reclaim their neighborhoods.
“I do not advocate a change in the gun laws, but I advocate greater education about gun laws,” he said. “We have to accentuate the educational part of firearms.”
Yakawich suggested that concerned neighborhood residents around elementary schools organize, go door to door, and speak with residents about rights, but also about being more sensitive around schools.
“The problem is complex, and people who carry firearms are generally very respectable,” Yakawich said. “Then we look at behavioral health and a person who shoots another person has massive mental health issues. That person is an exception.
“If there is concern among parents, the question should be: How are we addressing mental health? It’s not just a man with a gun. It’s behavioral health issue, and there is no magic wand. It’s easier to pass a law than make people well.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG-7188-scaled-e1733786147380-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-12-23 15:58:21.778403

“I’m not going to play coy and say ‘No, I’ve never thought about it,’ — of course I think about it,” Balint told NOTUS’ Reese Gorman.

This story was produced in partnership with NOTUS, a publication from the nonprofit, nonpartisan Allbritton Journalism Institute. VTDigger has partnered with NOTUS to cover federal actions affecting Vermont.



U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt, said she would consider running for independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ seat should he decide not to run for reelection in 2030.
“I’m not going to play coy and say ‘No, I’ve never thought about it,’ — of course I think about it,” Balint told NOTUS’ Reese Gorman on the latest episode of the On NOTUS podcast.
“If it happens, it happens,” she said. “Vermonters love people who are doing a great job and are competent. And we love our incumbents. … So if there comes a time when a Senate seat opens up, I will seriously think about it.”
Balint recalled a conversation she had with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Ma, about the opportunities in the Senate versus the House.
“She said it’s just a different level of power than you have in the House to affect positive change on your constituents,” Balint recalled of the conversation.
“(I) would love to be part of that if the timing is right and if it fits what Vermonters need,” she added.
Balint quickly rose through the ranks of the state Senate and was first elected to the U.S. House in 2022. Her election was historic in multiple ways: She is the first woman and first openly gay person to represent Vermont in Congress. And before her election, Vermont was the last state to have never elected a woman to Congress.
The lawmaker discussed how she lacked political role models who were openly gay, but pointed to Harvey Milk as an early example.
“Milk was one of the first openly gay politicians in the country, and he was assassinated,” Balint said. “And so the messages early on were definitely (that) it’s not safe to be out as a politician.”
However, she said it was watching the events of Jan. 6, 2021, unfold at the Capitol from her office at the Vermont statehouse that she felt a call to run for Congress.
“I’ll just be very candid with you, my grandfather was killed in the Holocaust,” Balint told Reese. “I know what authoritarian tendencies look like. I know how the story ends. It doesn’t end well.”
“It was just this deep, deep feeling of like, democracy itself is in danger because of the way that Trump showed up in his role,” she continued. “And I knew it would take a long, long time to undo the damage.”
In each weekly episode of On NOTUS, host Reese Gorman sits down with lawmakers to talk about what inspired them to come to Washington. In recent episodes, House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La, said he wants to take the feelings out of politics, Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer,  R-Mn, described the ideal congressional candidate, and U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wa, explained how she navigates a hyperpartisan Congress.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Two Democratic members of Congress from Michigan are calling for a thorough federal investigation into the death of a man who died while detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In a letter sent Tuesday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, U.S. Reps. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) said Nenko Gantchev’s Dec. 15 death at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, is part of a “deeply troubling pattern of deaths in ICE custody.” 
They noted that ICE has reported at least 30 detainee deaths this year — the highest total since 2004 — including Gantchev’s, which was the fourth reported detainee death in a four-day period in December.
Gantchev, a Bulgarian national arrested by ICE on Sept. 23 and held pending removal proceedings, was found unresponsive in his cell and pronounced dead at about 9:54 p.m., according to ICE. 
The agency has described the cause as “suspected natural causes” while the official cause remains under investigation.
In their letter, the lawmakers outlined specific questions they wanted answers to, including whether ICE conducted all required medical screening, care and supervision of Gantchev; whether staff followed required procedures after finding him unresponsive; and whether complaints about his treatment or conditions at North Lake were logged and addressed.

They also asked for details on current staffing, medical screening policies, and conditions at the facility, which reopened this year and has seen rapid population growth.
“Since reopening in June of this year, reports indicate that North Lake’s detainee population has swelled in recent months due to escalated immigration enforcement activities under this Administration,” Stevens and Scholten wrote, adding that the detainee population growth at the facility has coincided with complaints of inhumane conditions and inadequate medical care.
“We all believe in a secure border, but securing our border does not require abandoning our commitment to the rule of law and protecting and honoring human dignity,” the lawmakers concluded, requesting a preliminary response from DHS and ICE by Friday, Jan. 9, 2026, “to ensure justice for those who have died in custody already, and safety of those currently detained.”
The GEO Group, a federally contracted private company, operates the North Lake facility which shut down in 2022 before reopening in June of this year under a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract. 
The facility, which has drawn numerous protests from activists, is now the largest ICE detention center in the Midwest and one of the largest in the nation.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 15:58:21.778403

Similar proposals had previously been proposed in the legislature with bipartisan support, but never received a final vote in the Senate until earlier this month.
The efforts were intended to help people who are threatened at work or may need to relocate, because of domestic abuse.
The law will work by essentially providing a fast lane for people claiming unemployment due to domestic violence.

Victims voluntarily leaving their jobs will have to provide what the bill calls “reasonable” proof of violence against them, such as a recent protective order, medical records, or a statement from a qualified professional like a counselor or shelter worker.
If a victim has no documentation, they can still apply for fast-tracked unemployment under the law, but will be asked to provide another form of evidence that “reasonably proves domestic violence” within 150 days. But, the state Department of Labor may waive the requirement.
Documentation of domestic violence will remain confidential under the law.

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Montana U.S. Sen. Steve Daines has restarted his efforts to rollback federal designations from some of Montana’s Wilderness Study Areas, seeking to turn them back to general public land management and increase access by sportsmen. 
But conservation organizations say the move would lead to a slippery slope that could strip protections from roughly a million acres of key wildlife habitat and recreational lands. 
The Montana Sportsmen Conservation Act, which Daines originally introduced in 2022, would remove WSA designations from three areas in Montana — the Middle Fork Judith, Hoodoo Mountain, and Wales Creek Wilderness Study Areas. 
Middle Fork Judith WSA is approximately 81,000 acres and located on the Lewis and Clark National Forest across the Little Belt Mountains southeast of Great Falls.
The Hoodoo Mountain and Wales Creek WSAs each comprise just over 11,000 acres of BLM land near Ovando and Lincoln.
They are part of 44 sections of public land designated under two federal acts. 
Montana’s WSAs on U.S. Forest Service land stem from a 1977 bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. Lee Metcalf, a Montana Democrat, who set aside nine landscapes totaling more than 700,000 acres to protect until Congress could officially determine whether to designate them as wilderness. 
In 1976, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act instructed the BLM to inventory and assess its lands and in 2000, an Interior Secretarial order set aside 38 WSAs on BLM land in Montana for evaluation. 
Both federal acts had timelines for land management agencies to make a determination over whether to incorporate the WSAs into federal Wilderness. While a majority of WSAs didn’t make the cut, no federal action was taken to reclassify them. 
More recently, the Forest Service determined in 2021 that the Middle Fork Judith WSA is “unsuitable for inclusion in the Wilderness Preservation System,” according to Daines’ bill, while the BLM made the same recommendation for Hoodoo Mountain and Wales Creek in 2020.
“As a lifelong sportsman, increasing access to Montana’s great outdoors is one of my top priorities,” Daines said in a statement. “The ‘Montana Sportsmen Conservation Act’ promotes our outdoor way of life by returning restrictive WSA’s to general public land management, which will improve wildlife habitat restoration, reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, and unlock better access to public lands.”
Wilderness Study Areas are managed as de facto wilderness, but with some key differences. 
Motorized and mechanized recreation, including snowmobiling and biking, are prohibited in wilderness areas, but are allowed in some WSAs along existing roads. 
According to a 2020 report to the Montana Environmental Quality Council, Middle Fork Judith allows winter and nonwinter motorized access along with mountain biking.
Another big management difference is resource extraction.
On BLM land, logging is permitted, while some logging can be allowed on Forest Service land with extensive public input. Removing WSA designations could bolster management agencies’ ability to greenlight logging to thin old and dense timber, which proponents say is key to helping prevent wildfires and bolster economic activity. 
Opponents to Daines’ legislation include many conservation groups that say a top-down decision made in Congress leaves out voices on the ground. 
“Montanans want a seat at the table in shaping the future of our public lands. This deeply flawed bill is not locally driven or balanced,” Montana state director of The Wilderness Society Barb Cestero said in a statement. “Instead, it represents the kind of top-down, one-size-fits-all approach Montanans have consistently rejected. We invite Senator Daines to join the many Montanans who are rolling up their sleeves to develop local, collaborative and balanced solutions for these public lands so that our kids and grandkids can enjoy the same freedom to explore wild places as we do today.”
The debate over Wilderness Study Areas has been ongoing for decades, and routinely arises within the state legislature as well. 
During the 2025 Legislature, Republican Sen. Tony Tezak of Ennis introduced a joint resolution urging Congress to release all of Montana’s 44 WSAs. The bill, Senate Resolution 14, died in committee on a bipartisan vote. 
“Sen. Daines knows this approach has been rejected — by Montanans, by conservation groups, and by lawmakers from both parties — and he chose to bring it back anyway,” Ben Super, executive director of the Montana Conservation Voters Education Fund, said in a statement. “That’s not leadership. It’s a deliberate decision to override local voices and weaken safeguards for irreplaceable public lands without public support or a credible alternative.”
But the federal delegation has its own coalition of broad supporters as well, ranging from local government officials to outdoor groups and even Republican Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, who sponsored bills while in Congress to remove WSA designations. A spokesperson from the Governor’s Office did not immediately respond to a question about his support for the federal legislation. 
The Judith Basin and Powell county commissioners signed letters of support for the legislation, as did Montana Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife, the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association, Montana Farm Bureau Federation and the Great Falls Bicycle Club. 
If Hoodoo Mountain and Wales Creek changed designations, “both would retain critical wildlife habitat protections while providing the land management agencies the flexibility to do needed work to manage and improve habitat,” Jeff Darrah, executive director of Montana Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife wrote in a letter. A different designation “would help support wildlife-dependent recreation and hunting opportunities, and facilitate the long-term viability of big game wildlife populations.”
Montana’s U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy is listed as a co-sponsor to Daines’ bill, while U.S. Rep. Troy Downing is leading the companion effort in the House. 
“Land management must be fit for purpose, and the science shows that the Hoodoo Mountain, Wales Creek, and Middle Fork Judith Wilderness Study Areas would be better served without their WSA designations,” Downing said in a statement. “I’m proud to lead the effort in the House to return these lands to general management, unlocking public access and breaking down barriers preventing effective stewardship.”
Montana’s western U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke did not release a statement of support with the rest of the federal delegation, but Daines said he was looking forward to working with Zinke to get the bill passed. Zinke did not respond to a question about supporting the bill by publication time.
Zinke was a former Interior Secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term, and under his tenure the BLM supported releasing WSAs.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20211002_1646142-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-12-23 15:58:21.778403

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch),"The Iowa Utilities Commission listened to public comments at its monthly public meeting Wednesday from landowners opposed to a carbon sequestration pipeline. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Utilities Commission will have to decide whether Summit Carbon Solutions can change the ending destination for its carbon sequestration pipeline before a case against the company’s permit can proceed, an Iowa court ruled. 
The Iowa District Court for Polk County ruled in favor of Summit’s motion to pause the case that landowners, counties and the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter filed in 2024. 
Opponents of the proposed carbon capture pipeline sued over the IUC decision to issue a conditional permit to Summit in June 2024. The permit allowed the company to use eminent domain to build a pipeline that would connect to biorefineries across the state and transport carbon dioxide to North Dakota for underground storage.

Per the IUC permit decision, Summit was required to obtain permission for its pipeline in North Dakota and South Dakota before it could begin construction in Iowa. 
Since the permit was issued, however, South Dakota enacted a law prohibiting the use of eminent domain for CO2 pipelines, which complicated Summit’s plans to transport the captured CO2 to an underground storage site in North Dakota. Eminent domain forces unwilling property owners to accept easements on their land for projects considered in the public interest, for payment determined by a county commission.
In light of these developments along with ongoing legal battles in North Dakota, Summit filed for an amendment to its permit with the IUC in September 2025 to remove the requirement that the company receive approval from the Dakotas. Instead of specifying a state, Summit asked for the permit to prohibit construction until the company has “secured access to one or more sequestration sites and permits or agreements to allow it to reach such storage.” 
Summit also requested the court stop proceedings on the lawsuit pertaining to the original permit until the IUC rules on the newly filed amendment. Polk County District Court Judge Scott Beattie sided with the company and remanded the case back to the IUC. 
In the decision Beattie, wrote that the South Dakota ban is “influential” to the decision. 
“Not only does the S.D. CO2 pipeline ban render the IUC’s Final Order void, but it also requires Summit to reroute its pipeline in order to get to North Dakota without going through South Dakota,” the decision said. 
During oral arguments, opponents said Summit’s requested permit amendment did not change the basis of their argument that Summit did not meet the definition of a common carrier and should not be granted eminent domain capabilities.  
The groups also argued, as described in Beattie’s decision, that it was unfair to pause judicial review based on “the mere possibility that a permit might be amended.”
Beattie wrote, however, that a pause in judicial proceedings while the permit amendment is evaluated is “warranted” as the court would otherwise be evaluating “outdated” facts. 
“Adjudicating the merits of a permit that is actively being amended serves no useful purpose,” the decision reads.
Emma Schmit, an organizing director with the pipeline fighter group Bold Alliance, said in a statement the ruling did “not come as a surprise.”
“After years of working to protect property rights from hazardous carbon pipelines, we know not every judge, regulator, or legislator will stand by us the first time around,” Schmit said in the statement. “But, we know the people of Iowa stand with us. So, we’ll continue to explore property rights protections through every possible avenue, including through the courts, the Iowa Utilities Commission, and the legislature.” 
Summit Carbon Solutions did not respond to a request for comment on the decision.

Sponsors of the ballot measure have one year to submit 31,164 signatures of qualified North Dakota electors to the secretary of state to be considered for the ballot, according to Howe’s office.
If the signatures are submitted by July 6, and are validated, the measure will appear on the general election ballot Nov. 3. 
Robin Nelson, chair of the ballot measure sponsoring committee, said the committee hopes to have the measure be decided on that November ballot.
“It’s go time,” Nelson said on Tuesday. “Once we get everything printed, we’ll start collecting signatures in early January.”
North Dakota lawmakers weigh impact of free school meal proposal

The organization, Together for School Meals, is heading up the informational campaign for the ballot measure, she said.
The ballot measure would require public schools to provide free breakfast and lunch to students. Private schools, Bureau of Indian Education schools and other tribal schools could opt in to participate in the program.
During a recent legislative committee meeting, Lynelle Johnson, director of child nutrition and food distribution for the Department of Public Instruction, told lawmakers the estimated cost to provide free school meals for the 2027-29 biennium is $134 million. She also said the figure is preliminary and may change as she continues to evaluate the measure.
The measure says if the Legislature is unable to identify funding, the dollars should come from the earnings of the state Legacy Fund.

(Photo by James Brooks / Alaska Beacon)It’s the season of warm wishes, goodwill, families and friends. It’s a time for sharing old memories and making new memories with the new year. It’s a break in everyday life to remember the past and think about the future.
Too bad Alaskans need to be thinking about how the state will come up with enough money in 2026 to fully fund schools, highway projects, the ferry system, public services, repairs to aging facilities — and a politically acceptable Permanent Fund dividend that will help pay for residents’ holiday presents next year.
Santa carries a lot of weight, literally and figuratively, but the jolly guy can’t do anything to gift the state higher oil prices. Yet that’s exactly what the Alaska treasury needs under its Christmas tree this week.
Though oil revenues ain’t what they used to be when Alaska’s North Slope was putting 2 million barrels a day into the pipeline at its peak in 1988, this year’s average of almost 460,000 barrels a day still is expected to provide about one-quarter of the treasury’s general-purpose revenues, more than $1.4 billion.
But that is a forecast number, dependent on the price of oil — which is down. North Slope crude has dropped from $80 a barrel on Jan. 15 to just under $61 on Dec. 18. This year’s budget about breaks even at an average price of just over $65.
The difference between $60 and $65 oil equals about $150 million less for the treasury over a full year, which is lot of money when legislators — and the public — think about what they want to see in the next state budget.
It’s not like Santa has anything against Alaska, and there’s nothing the state can do about oil prices. North Slope oil is worth whatever the market will pay, and right now the market is flush with oil. So much so that at last count more than 1.3 billion barrels of crude was at sea, parked off to the side of sea lanes or aboard tankers moving real slow in hopes of finding buyers or at least better prices.
That 1.3 billion barrels at sea is the highest number since the worst of the pandemic shutdowns in April 2020.
It’s not looking to get better for sellers anytime soon. The International Energy Agency forecasts oil producers will be pumping 3.8 million barrels a day more than the world needs next year, at least until companies scale back their production or economic growth and demand get stronger.
All that oil is coming from seemingly everywhere. From OPEC+ producers, which spent most of this year boosting production to win back market share; from the U.S., which set a record this year for oil production; Canada, also a new record holder; from the South American nation of Guyana, which reached almost 1 million barrels a day, a sixfold increase since 2021; and Brazil, which broke 5 million barrels a day this year, a record.
Producers planned all the new oil years ago, looking at higher prices and planning on rising demand. But the best laid plans of mice and men and oil company executives don’t always turn out as expected.
“What I can say with absolute certainty is this: An excess of oil affects the country and affects prices,” Angola’s Minister of Mineral Resources Diamantino Pedro was quoted by Bloomberg news service last week. Angola pumps more than a million barrels a day. “This country depends heavily on oil — I don’t say that with pleasure, but it’s the reality.”
He could have said the same thing about Alaska.

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders released another $100,000 Tuesday to go toward the response to floods, storms and tornadoes that hit the state in April.
Sanders signed an executive order authorizing the release of money from the Governor’s Disaster Response and Recovery Fund. 
The money will be used to defray the administrative and program costs of the storms’ response and will be used at the discretion of the state emergency management director, according to the order.
The early April severe weather was part of a deadly storm pattern that hit the Central Mississippi River Valley region and brought historic rainfall. Heavy rains hit northeast Arkansas during the weather pattern. 
A report from an international coalition of climate researchers said the “generational” storms were made 40% more likely because of the warming climate.

Free.,Trump appears in several files of latest Epstein release,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-appears-several-files-latest-epstein-release,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Justice early Tuesday released thousands more files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with several referencing President Donald Trump. The latest trove — which features nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Epstein — includes a note referring to Trump that Epstein appears to have sent the same month he died by suicide in a New York City jail cell and an email from a prosecutor claiming Trump flew on Epstein’s private jet more times than previously reported. (edited)In a social media post announcing the Tuesday release, the department issued a blanket denial that Trump was involved in Epstein’s crimes, saying the evidence included in the files were discredited.“Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the post said.The agency added “the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”The department has faced backlash for its piecemeal rollout of the files beginning Dec. 19, despite a legal mandate to release the full set on that date. Trump had a well-documented friendship with Epstein, but has maintained he had a falling out with the disgraced financier and was never involved in any alleged crimes. Flight records, letter to Nassar A 2020 email from an assistant U.S. attorney in New York says flight records indicate that Trump “traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than previously has been reported.” The email notes that Trump was “listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996” and that this includes “at least four flights” on which Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell “was also present.” The files also include a letter Epstein purportedly sent to convicted serial sex offender Larry Nassar in 2019. “We shared one thing ... our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential,” Epstein allegedly wrote to Nassar, a disgraced former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor. “Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls,” Epstein appears to have continued. Trump was president at the time. “When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system,” Epstein purportedly wrote. “Life is unfair.”The letter was postmarked Aug. 13, 2019, just three days after Epstein died in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. The Justice Department said in a social media post Tuesday afternoon it was “currently looking into the validity of this alleged letter from Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar and we will follow up as soon as possible,” pointing to multiple discrepancies.Another email in the Tuesday release references more potential co-conspirators, according to U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.Schumer called on the Justice Department to release more information on a note he said indicates the DOJ “was looking into at least ten potential Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirators.”  The New York Democrat said the department “needs to shed more light on who was on the list, how they were involved, and why they chose not to prosecute.” He added: “Protecting possible co-conspirators is not the transparency the American people and Congress are demanding.”DOJ takes heat The Justice Department has faced heat for opting to release the files in batches instead of adhering to the congressionally mandated full release of the files by mid-December. The requirement comes from a bill Trump signed into law in November, which requires the agency to make publicly available “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in DOJ’s possession that relate to the investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein,” including materials related to Maxwell.The measure — co-sponsored by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California — gave the department 30 days after the bill was enacted into law to release the files, or Dec. 19.",,,,2025-12-23 14:12:36.609804

(Courtesy Michele Williams)Threatened cuts to federal homelessness funding next year will have ripple effects across a state overwhelmed with a rising unhoused population, including at an emergency shelter in Santa Fe that already has a long wait list, according to the shelter’s head.
Consuelo’s Place Executive Director Michele Williams told Source NM that she expects the wait list at her shelter to at least double if the federal Housing and Urban Development agency carries out plans to drastically cut its main anti-homelessness program known as Continuum of Care. 
NM homelessness coalition will ask Legislature to fill in federal funding gaps

HUD first announced that possibility in mid-November when it released an unexpected “Notice of Funding Opportunity” for the Continuum of Care program that suggested it was seeking to slash funding by 70%, including major cuts to “permanent supportive housing,” which is long-term housing for formerly unhoused people who also receive services for mental illness or drug addiction.
HUD removed the notice in early December, potentially in response to a pair of lawsuits, but Williams and other nonprofit directors say they are heading into the new year with increasing uncertainty about the program that usually provides the state about $14 million a year. The state received $17 million in the latest funding round.
Williams is anxious about the Continuum of Care cuts even though her shelter doesn’t receive any of its funding, she told Source, because she relies on organizations that do, including nonprofits that place people in permanent supportive housing after staying in emergency shelters like Consuelo’s Place. The shelter currently has a waitlist of between 30 and 40 individuals and families for a shelter that usually houses between 60 and 90 families a year, she said. 
“It is one of the financial mechanisms that support how our clients leave emergency shelter and go into housing,” she said. “So if they are cut, clients will be stuck in shelter; families will be stuck in shelter; seniors will be stuck in shelter; in our shelter and certainly around the state and probably around the country.”
Rural, unhoused people statewide cite deposit, application fees as greatest barrier to housing

People being stuck for longer in her shelter will mean the wait list will grow longer, she said. Meanwhile, cutting funds for permanent housing will result in more people ending up living on the streets, she said. Those people will also end up on her wait list, she predicted.
“There may be some people that are housed in their programs that will become unhoused if they lose their funding, so that also may be where the need will increase to our shelter,” she said.
Unsheltered homelessness in Santa Fe increased over the course of the year, as well as the rest of the state, according to results of a recent Point-in-Time Count. 
Monet Silva, director of the New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness, which coordinates Continuum of Care funding applications from nonprofits across the state, previously told Source New Mexico she is hoping the Legislature will pay for the expected HUD funding cuts during the upcoming legislative session.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s proposed budget released Monday contains more than $110 million for housing, including $45 million for “homelessness initiatives,” though it’s unclear from the budget proposal how much of that funding is intended to offset Continuum of Care funding cuts. The Legislature will meet in January with its own funding priorities to approve the budget.  
The threat of HUD cuts capped off a year at Consuelo’s Place marked by federal cuts to programs on which her clients rely, including the abrupt halt of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during a federal government shutdown. During that period, Williams said  she was heartened to see community members increase food donations, as well as the state spending $30 million of its own funding to pay for partial November SNAP benefits. 
As she gears up to celebrate Christmas, with the help of a donated tree and donated gifts for children in her care, Williams said she is optimistic that the state and the community she lives in will show up again to help her clients even if the HUD cuts happen.
“I think it’s all we can do,” she said. “We have strong local leaders. I look forward to working with them and feel comfortable about the community that is Santa Fe and how we are going to support one another in the short term as this hopefully gets resolved on the national level.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/JPEG-image-4D86-9C73-EC-0-e1766443430256-1024x937.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 14:12:36.609804

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers is ending his lawsuit against the Omaha Public Power District, for now, after the public utility board delayed plans to modify power production in North Omaha until 2028.
Hilgers, on Tuesday, announced his office would voluntarily dismiss his lawsuit filed Oct. 9, but that it could be brought again “if circumstances change.” The OPPD board on Dec. 18 voted 6-2 for a resolution that puts off plans to “modernize” North Omaha Station and end coal production at the site until at least 2028, rather than 2026. OPPD Directors Eric Williams and Sara Howard opposed the resolution.

OPPD’s vote introduced new requirements before the North Omaha transition could occur. In a separate vote, OPPD approved average rate increases of 6.3%, effective Jan. 1. Williams and Howard also opposed the increase.
“We brought this lawsuit because public power providers should not achieve their self-imposed environmental goals by raising prices for Nebraska consumers,” Hilgers said in a Tuesday statement. “After last week’s vote, OPPD’s plans for the North Omaha Station now align with their twin mandates of affordability and reliability in delivering electricity to Nebraskans.”
Craig Moody, an OPPD member who voted in favor of the Dec. 18 resolution, said in a recent social media post that whether board directors supported or opposed the resolution would have still delayed changes at North Omaha Station until the end of 2028, if not later. 
Moody said voting in favor of the resolution locked in a “clear and transparent timeline” and that voting could have furthered Hilgers’ lawsuit. Moody said OPPD staff recommended indefinitely extending coal burning, which he described as a “no-go proposition.”
“The closure was already delayed by two years,” Moody wrote Dec. 20 on Facebook. “No matter which way the board voted, the timelines were the same and … we do not know what, if any, grid improvements are necessary in order to move forward.”
Nebraska is the only state with exclusively publicly owned utilities providing power.
OPPD serves about 1 million Nebraskans across 13 eastern Nebraska counties, including much of the Omaha area. OPPD had no immediate comment on Hilgers’ dismissal.

Hilgers had accused OPPD of drifting from state law he says requires public power providers to prioritize affordability and reliability above all else, such as “environmental justice.” The lawsuit also challenged OPPD’s greener-energy goal of “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, which the board adopted in 2019.
Ten state senators from Omaha, Lincoln and Bellevue sparred with Hilgers over the lawsuit. They argued energy rates would increase regardless of how the North Omaha Station produces electricity.
“This lawsuit sends a chilling message to every Nebraskan fighting for healthy communities that when a community finally compels action from public institutions, the state’s top lawyer may step in to stop it,” the letter said.
OPPD first pledged to “modernize” North Omaha Station and its five power-producing units in 2014. The plan has been to retire three natural gas units built in the 1950s, which switched from coal in 2016, and transition two 1960s-era coal units to natural gas. 
OPPD also delayed moving forward with the plan in 2022, pushing it then to 2026.
“The new schedule outlined in the resolution is the fastest, most responsible path forward to the refueling and retirement of NOS [North Omaha Station],” OPPD President and CEO Javier Fernandez said last week. “We will continue to work closely with SPP [Southwest Power Pool] and other stakeholders to enable a responsible transition while maintaining service for our customers.” 
North Omaha residents have fought to get OPPD to modify the plant near the local neighborhood, citing health concerns. Douglas County Health Director Lindsay Huse had also urged OPPD to stay the course. 
Hilgers, OPPD and Gov. Jim Pillen have repeatedly challenged those concerns. Pillen last week praised OPPD’s delay and said it showed “common sense — and hard science — prevailed.”

DemasThis story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Dozens of Michigan school districts and officials are appealing a judge’s ruling that upholds state budget language putting conditions on the distribution of funding for school safety and mental health.
The lawsuit stemmed from a new rule in the budget stating that in order to receive that funding from the state, districts must agree to waive privilege, which means they must disclose information that would otherwise be legally protected if there is a mass casualty event. Districts must also agree to a comprehensive investigation of such an event.
Judge Sima Patel granted the state’s motion for a summary disposition, essentially ending the case in the Michigan Court of Claims. But the plaintiffs are appealing Patel’s ruling to the Michigan Court of Appeals.
Patel, who listened to oral arguments during a hearing earlier this month, issued her ruling Dec. 17 rejecting the plaintiffs’ arguments. Here is what she had to say about two of the key claims in the school districts’ lawsuit.
 Districts claimed budget language violates Michigan Constitution

The budget says that to receive the $321 million in safety and mental health funds, districts “must agree to be subject to a comprehensive investigation, must affirmatively agree to waive any privilege that may otherwise protect information from disclosure in the event of a mass casualty event, and must agree to comply with a comprehensive investigation.”
A mass casualty event is defined in the state budget in part as an incident “resulting in significant injuries to not fewer than 3 individuals” or an incident resulting in fatalities.
But the plaintiffs’ attorney, Scott Eldridge, argued in court that some of the budget language violates the Michigan Constitution because it is “exceedingly vague.” Specifically, Eldridge said the “waive any privilege” language is overly broad. He also said the definitions of a mass casualty event are too broad and vague.
“Vagueness means it’s limitless and unbound because it gives zero guideposts or direction as to what’s legal versus what’s illegal conduct,” Eldridge said.
Eldridge urged Patel to “use a scalpel instead of a machete” and declare those phrases unconstitutional.
But Patel noted in her ruling that the plaintiffs faced an “extremely steep hurdle” in proving those claims.
The “waive any privilege,” language, she said, “is clear and not vague,” and means what it says.
“Any and all privileges that may otherwise protect information from disclosure by the district are included,” Patel said in the ruling. “The breadth of the phrase does not render it ambiguous.”
At the hearing earlier this month, Eldridge questioned whether incidents like a bus accident on the way to school, concussions on a football field, a fight in the stands of an athletic event, food poisoning in the cafeteria, or a gas leak would be considered a mass casualty event.
“A significant injury is one that is severe enough to be noticed and have an effect on the injured person,” Patel responded in her ruling. She also said that the budget’s definition of a mass casualty event “may be broad, but it is understandable.”
Districts had until Dec. 4 to agree to waive their privilege. They have until Dec. 30 to rescind that agreement. The plaintiffs sought to extend that deadline to rescind even longer, asking Patel that if she rules against them in the lawsuit, that she set that deadline to 30 days after the appeals process is resolved. Patel said no in her ruling.
“There is no way for this Court or the interested parties to know how long the appellate process will take,” Patel said. “The distribution of funds cannot be delayed that long.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s Republican attorney general asked a judge Tuesday for a court order to stop an abortion-rights ad campaign.
The request in Hughes County court comes after Attorney General Marty Jackley issued a cease-and-desist to Mayday Health, a New York-based nonprofit. The organization, which did not comply with the cease-and-desist, is running a gas-station advertising campaign that provides links to information about abortion pills with the tagline “Pregnant? Don’t want to be?”
Mayday Health is dedicated to educating people about the safety and effectiveness of abortion pills. The organization did not grant South Dakota Searchlight an interview, but referred to an Instagram post from Executive Director Liv Raisner.
In the post, Raisner said the advertisements are constitutionally protected. Mayday Health provides links to information, but does not sell abortion pills directly from its website.
“We’re not taking the signs down,” Raisner said in the Instagram post. “It’s First Amendment-protected free speech, and information is not illegal.”

South Dakota lawmakers adopted an abortion trigger ban in 2005 that took effect in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Abortions are prohibited in the state, unless the mother’s life is threatened by a pregnancy. State lawmakers also passed legislation in 2022 banning “medical abortion by telemedicine.”
Jackley said the Mayday Health advertisements are illegally deceptive because the website leads consumers to believe that elective abortions and receiving abortion pills by mail are legal in the state. He also alleged that the ads are dangerous.
“These ads are targeting women — including teenagers — encouraging them to take these pills while misleading them about the potential physical risks,” Jackley said in a news release. “At the same time, they promote secrecy by urging women not to inform their doctors and children not to tell their parents.”
The campaign of gas-pump placards was set to launch at 30 gas stations around South Dakota on Dec. 8 and stay up for six weeks, according to Mayday. There were 14 locations that had the advertisements up as of Dec. 10, as confirmed by Mayday.
Several gas station owners have removed the advertisements voluntarily, according to the Attorney General’s Office. The attorney general’s lawsuit says only two locations still have the gas-station advertisements, in Brookings and Vermillion.
In its original news release, Mayday pledged a digital advertising campaign alongside the gas station ads. The group didn’t specify how the digital ads would appear, but said they would include “real people in South Dakota sharing their perspectives on what it’s like to live in a state with an abortion ban.”
In 2023, medication abortions accounted for 63% of abortions in the country, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute. The drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, commonly used in medication abortions, are also listed on the World Health Organizations’ list of essential medicines. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an attempt by anti-abortion medical organizations to overturn the Food and Drug Administration’s prescribing guidelines for mifepristone.
There is no date scheduled yet for a hearing on South Dakota’s lawsuit. The state lists an advertising company, Minnesota-based AllOver Media, doing business as Momentara, as a defendant alongside Mayday.

Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected the General Assembly’s actions all but twice (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Missouri is trying to illegally enact a gerrymandered congressional map in violation of a century of constitutional precedent, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges. 
The ACLU of Missouri filed the lawsuit in Cole County on behalf of two Jackson County residents against Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins. At the heart of the litigation is the state’s decision to allow the congressional map approved by lawmakers in September to take effect despite a referendum campaign turning in 305,000 signatures to place it on the ballot. 
The decision runs contrary to how the process has worked for more than 100 years, said Tori Schafer, director of policy and campaigns at the ACLU of Missouri.
In a statement released before the lawsuit was filed, Hanaway defended the move, saying the map will only be suspended if and when Hoskins verifies enough signatures have been submitted — a process that could take until July. 
“Our office will continue to defend the Constitution and ensure that Missouri’s laws are strictly adhered to during this process,” Hanaway said.
Missouri set to enact gerrymandered map despite 300K signatures for repeal referendum

If the map is allowed to go into effect, county clerks and local election boards will be asked to update voter rolls to show which district includes each voter. And it means the new map would be used for candidate filing that begins in February.
By the time signatures are verified in July, it would be too late to change the ballot for the August 2026 primaries. 
“Given that the filing period for congressional candidates begins on Feb. 24, 2026, this is a transparent ploy to force the use of (the) new congressional map by delaying certification of the referendum’s signatures until it is too late to change the congressional map for the 2026 midterms,” the lawsuit states. 
Historically, when a referendum campaign has submitted signatures to put a law on the ballot, that law has been immediately suspended pending a vote of the people. 
That’s what happened in 2017, when then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft suspended a right-to-work law after a coalition of labor unions submitted 300,000 signatures. The law never ended up going into effect because it was defeated by voters a year later. 
But the precedent goes back much further. 
In 1914, the Missouri Supreme Court held that once citizens submit signatures, the challenged law is automatically suspended until voters decide its fate. The court warned that allowing a law to take effect while under referendum would gut the people’s constitutional power and turn the process into a sham.
Half a century later, the court explicitly said the purpose of a referendum is to suspend or annul a law before it has gone into effect. Allowing a law to take effect and then later be suspended, the court warned, would invite instability and confusion.
Prior to 2017, the last time the referendum was deployed was 1982. Then-Secretary of State James Kirkpatrick put a new trucking law on hold after signatures were submitted for a referendum. A lawsuit demanding immediate implementation was dismissed, and the law was repealed by voters.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Referendum-security-20251209-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 12:59:01.509255

Over the two-month period, it would have allowed Smitty’s Supply to get rid of as much as 12 million gallons of potentially harmful stormwater that has pooled at the site and mixed with oil and chemicals. 
That would be nearly double the amount of waste materials and fluids authorities have already recovered from the surrounding environment since the Smitty Supply’s petroleum products facility in Roseland was destroyed in an Aug. 22 fire and explosion. The fire that burned for two weeks decimated the 20-acre facility, causing several large oil tanks to explode and spread pollutants for miles across Tangipahoa Parish. 
The Department of Environmental Quality denied the Smitty’s Supply permit request Dec. 5, with records pointing out the collected stormwater was still too contaminated despite it being run through a commercial filtration and treatment process.    
The company has been exploring multiple disposal options for various wastes accumulating at the site, including stormwater and washwater contaminated with various oils, solvents and chemicals strewn into the air, surrounding land and waterways during and after the August disaster. 
In an email Tuesday to the Illuminator, a Smitty’s Supply spokesperson said the company is grateful for community support, remains focused on cleanup operations and remains dedicated to supplying products that “keep industries operating and communities moving.”
“The company has replaced personal property lost during the fire, cleaned homes, vehicles, and yards, and helped former employees connect with new job opportunities through local career fairs — continuing to invest in the well-being of its neighbors as remediation progresses,” the statement read. “Smitty’s Supply will continue working closely with state and federal agencies to ensure the cleanup remains comprehensive, safe, and transparent for the community.”
After leading the initial recovery of spilled materials from surrounding land and water bodies, the state Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have largely removed their personnel and equipment from the area. On Dec. 8, Smitty’s Supply took over cleanup operations at its facility site with continued monitoring from state and federal officials.
The company has recovered an unspecified volume of contaminated stormwater mixed with ash, residues and chemicals. It has settled into various sumps and containment areas at the site, according to reports EPA officials compiled and filed with the state. 
In their statement, Smitty’s Supply said cleanup teams this month have processed liquids from modular storage tanks, transported ash and excavated soil for proper disposal, vacuumed oil and other residues, and continued equipment decontamination. Demolition of steel structures remains on track for completion by the end of 2025, with full cleaning of paved areas expected by the end of January, the email stated.
“To date, the company has removed 2,644 tons of debris and recycled 3,725 tons of scrap metal from the site, reflecting measurable progress in safely reducing impacts and preparing the facility for further remediation steps,” the statement read, in part.
After crews collected the stormwater in temporary storage tanks, Smitty’s Supply hired a business to treat and filter the wastewater in an effort to make it clean enough to return to the environment, records show. 
However, when Smitty’s Supply had it tested, the recovered water was still too contaminated to be discharged, records show. The Department of Environmental Quality rejected the company’s permit application, noting lab reports showed pollution was “above the permissible limits” contained within the emergency general permit rules.
The recent lab results indicated elevated levels of organic waste, carbon and dissolved solids. The organic waste was particularly high, at more than five times the maximum threshold allowed under state regulations. Ethanol was also present in the sampled water at 25 parts per million, though the state didn’t mention this in its denial letter.  
Smitty’s Supply also wants permission to discharge water contaminated during cleanup operations at the facility. Cleanup crews have been using the local water supply to pressure wash concrete slabs at the facility, creating another stream of wastewater in addition to the rainfall. When the company included this in its Dec. 3 notice to the Department of Environmental Quality, it didn’t clarify whether the 200,000 gallons per day rate applied to wash water, stormwater or both. The agency seemed surprised by the company’s request. 
In a phone interview last week, LDEQ spokesman Greg Langley said the agency was initially unaware that Smitty’s Supply had plans to discharge its wash water along with the stormwater.
“[In] initial discussions with Smitty’s Supply, Inc., it was this Office’s understanding that the proposed … clean up discharges consisted only of contaminated stormwater collected from within the bermed areas of the site,” the agency’s denial letter states.

Smitty’s Supply indicated in its notice that it plans to adjust the stormwater treatment process and retest the effluent, though it’s unclear when those lab results will be released. As of Friday, they were not yet publicly available, and the Department of Environmental Quality confirmed it had still not granted the company any emergency permits.
The state can approve the discharge of stormwater and water used to clean pavement and buildings, but the Department of Environmental Quality can deny a permit if a facility has “previously been in violation of state water quality regulations” or it is in an “environmentally sensitive area.”
In its denial letter, the agency told Smitty’s Supply it might need a more permanent discharge permit in order to move forward with its planned discharges.
Some neighbors of the facility are urging state officials not to grant the company permission to release its wastewater into the drainage system. As of Monday, six residents filed written objections with the state to the company’s permit application even though the matter is not open for public comment. 
“That’s one of the problems,” Matthew Allen said in a phone interview. “They file under a general permit so the public doesn’t hear about it and get to comment on it.”
Allen, a retired science teacher who lives in Folsom, started the environmental nonprofit Northshore Riverwatch about three years ago to protect the rivers that run through the parishes north of Lake Pontchartrain.
“Relying on the Tangipahoa River as a de facto disposal mechanism to ‘carry away’ hazardous compounds is fundamentally incompatible with the purpose, scope and legal constraints of a general permit,” Allen wrote in his objection letter. 
Other residents have been surveilling the Smitty’s Supply facility, taking photos and videos of nearby public ditches containing discolored water and then posting them on social media. The posts typically draw criticisms of the company and government agencies, and they often raise questions about what health and environmental problems might persist. 
“Everybody’s just scared to death,” Allen said. “They don’t know what they’ve been exposed to, so everything’s just a big reaction.”
Some residents are collecting their own water, soil and material samples for lab analysis. 
Evan Wooten, who lives on a small farm within a half-mile of the Smitty’s facility, said he found several shards of mangled metal on his land that appeared to come from an exploded storage tank. A basic metals analysis showed the shards to be mostly iron, he said in a phone interview. 
Wooten said his goats were eating leaves and vegetation on his property that were contaminated with black oily residue, so he relocated them to a different farm. Two ultimately died, though he believes they contracted a parasite from the other farm, he said.   
Wooten said he wants to test some of his other animals for chemical toxins, but he can’t find any local veterinarians willing or able to do it, he said.
“They don’t want to get involved,” Wooten said. “We’re not getting any real help from anybody.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Senate lawmakers approved legislation that would expand family leave and temporary disability benefits to workers at smaller companies in a party-line vote Monday.
The legislation, approved in a 24-12 vote, would allow workers at firms with as few as 15 employees to take job-protected paid family leave.
“This bill would ensure that the vast majority of New Jersey workers are entitled to family leave protections, whether they work for a huge corporation or a small business,” said bill sponsor Sen. Paul Moriarty (D-Gloucester).
NJ lawmakers cancel votes on bill to ban pet stores from selling dogs, cats

Existing New Jersey law permits workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to bond with new children or care for a sick or injured loved one. Workers on family leave can earn up to 85% of their weekly pay, to a cap of $1,081 per week in 2025, or $1,119 in 2026.
To be eligible under current law, an employee must have worked at a given employer for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,000 hours in the preceding 12 months.
The bill would halve both those qualifications, requiring workers to be with their employer for at least six months and cutting the hours requirement to 500.
“It’s time we close the gap and guarantee that those working at smaller businesses, which more frequently include low-wage, part-time, and caregiving workers, have the same protections as those working at larger companies,” said bill sponsor Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex).
The benefits are funded by a 0.28% payroll tax on worker income, to a wage cap of $138,200.
Existing law bars employers from retaliating against workers for using family leave benefits. Text added by the bill would clarify that workers are entitled to be restored to their previous position or one with equivalent pay, benefits, and seniority upon returning from family leave.
It would also explicitly allow workers to use family leave, temporary disability benefits, and earned sick leave in the order of their choosing.
Business groups had opposed the bill, warning that expanding family leave eligibility could make New Jersey small businesses less competitive.
Chris Emigholz, chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, in a letter to Senators last week noted only seven states offered job protections to workers at firms with as few as 15 employees.
“In other words, New Jersey would be placing its smallest employers into a narrow national category — an outlier beyond most states we directly compete with for jobs and investment,” he said in the letter.
The Assembly earlier this year approved a version of the bill that would extend the benefits to workers at businesses with as few as five employees.
 Intoxicating hemp ban

Lawmakers in both chambers on Monday approved in bipartisan votes legislation that would require retailers to phase out the sale of certain intoxicating hemp products ahead of new federal regulations that become effective next November.
The new regulations, approved as part of the spending bill that ended the federal government shutdown last month, would ban hemp products with a total THC concentration of more than 0.4%. THC is the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana.
The state measure, which awaits the governor’s signature, would allow New Jersey retailers to continue selling products that would be barred by the bill or federal regulations until April 13, 2026.
After that date, intoxicating hemp beverages would be limited to no more than 5 milligrams of THC per serving, or 10 milligrams per container, and other hemp products would be limited to a 0.3% THC concentration.
It would also impose a $3.75-per-gallon excise tax on the wholesale sale of intoxicating hemp beverages, effective April 13.
The movement comes more than a year after Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation that criminalized the sale of intoxicating hemp products to people below the age of 21.
“By acting now, we can close gaps in oversight, reduce confusion for businesses and regulators, and ensure these products are safe, transparent, and kept out of the hands of children, protecting New Jersey families and public health,” said bill sponsor Teresa Ruiz (D-Newark).

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota law that prevents drug companies from restricting federal drug discounts for hospitals and other providers will remain in effect for now, a judge has decided.
Chicago-based AbbVie Inc., whose products include the wrinkle-remover Botox and the arthritis drug Humira, sued the state earlier this year in the U.S. District Court of South Dakota. The lawsuit challenges the legality of Senate Bill 154, which lawmakers and Gov. Larry Rhoden approved in March. It blocks drugmakers from deciding which pharmacies hospitals can use to access discounted medication.
Judge Roberto Lange did not dismiss AbbVie’s case against the state of South Dakota, but declined to issue a preliminary injunction that would have barred the new law from taking effect while the case plays out. 
Drugmaker sues SD over law preserving broad access to discounts for hospitals, pharmacies

The dispute centers on a provision in federal law known as 340B, which requires drugmakers who want to participate in Medicare and Medicaid to give steep discounts to providers like hospitals or clinics that serve low-income patients. Those health care providers, in turn, mark up the cost of those discounted drugs to make up the difference between their operating costs and the low reimbursement rates the Medicare and Medicaid programs pay for medical care. 
Initially, only providers whose primary clientele were Medicare and Medicaid patients were eligible for the discounts, but the discounts were later extended to places dubbed “sole community providers,” such as hospitals serving rural areas. 
That dramatically expanded the number of providers who got the discounts, and spurred drug companies to limit the number of pharmacies from which hospitals and clinics could access the discounted drugs. 
The drug company argues in the South Dakota case that the state overstepped its authority by passing a law that regulates interstate commerce, in this instance commerce involving pharmaceuticals.
It also argues that the new state law interferes with a federal pilot program meant to address some of the issues surrounding 340B payments by offering rebates to program participants, rather than upfront discounts.
In his ruling this week, Judge Lange said the state law will not prevent the drug company from participating in the federal pilot program, and that questions surrounding interstate commerce can be sorted out as the case proceeds.

Before Robert Clark Jr. broke barriers as Mississippi’s first Black legislator since Reconstruction in 1968, he spent two decades in classrooms.
From 1953 to 1973 he taught in secondary and postsecondary schools across the state, cultivating a reputation as a principled educator before turning full-time to politics.
Clark often spoke of his ambition to lead the House Education Committee – a goal realized in 1977 when House Speaker C.B. “Buddie’ Newman appointed him after George Rogers left to join President Jimmy Carter’s administration.
But Clark’s early years in the Mississippi Legislature were marked not by influence, but by isolation.
He frequently stood as the lone dissenting vote on major legislation, a solitary figure challenging the prevailing political order. That isolation reached a defining moment in January 1970 as Mississippi braced for federally mandated school desegregation.
In his statewide address that month, Gov. John Bell Williams acknowledged the end of the segregated system but urged parents to embrace “freedom of choice” between public and private schools. His somber words reflected a region still resisting change.
The governor framed the proposal as empowering parents, but critics warned it masked efforts to preserve segregation through state-supported private academies.
Clark was blunt in his rebuttal. Williams’ plan, he argued, would “only weaken the already poor educational system we have in Mississippi” by funneling public dollars into private institutions.
On March 20, when the House overwhelmingly endorsed the governor’s proposal for freedom of choice, Clark cast the lone vote against it. “How

long are we in Mississippi going to keep on ignoring the mandates of the Constitution?” he asked, warning that the bill would only deepen public unrest.
His solitary stand highlighted the fault lines of an education system caught between progress and preservation.
In the early months of 1970, Clark was vocal in his criticism of both local and national leadership.
That January, President Richard Nixon’s domestic advisers floated the idea of forming a “blue ribbon Southern group” to address school desegregation.
Although Nixon publicly supported the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision to desegregate the public schools, calling it both constitutionally and morally correct, he remained careful not to interfere with ongoing court cases. His administration drew a strategic line: address only de jure segregation, dismiss de facto concerns.
“Call it de facto and drop it,” Nixon instructed his officials, aiming to avoid broader federal enforcement of integration policies.
While Nixon’s statements gave some Black leaders reason for cautious optimism, they did little to sway Clark. He continued to push for grassroots solutions to empower the Black community.
On Jan. 11, 1970,  Clark convened a coalition of civil rights and education leaders at the Mississippi Teachers Association office in Jackson. Representing organizations like the NAACP, the National Education Association and the Freedom Democratic Party, the group laid the groundwork for the Educational Resources Center (ERC). The initiative aimed to ensure Black Mississippians could engage in a unitary school system with “dignity and integrity,” contributing meaningfully to community education.
Still, legislative battles raged on. In early February, two measures aimed at bolstering private schools passed through the Mississippi House. One reduced licensing costs for private school buses. The other bill allowed individuals aged 16 and above to take out loans for private education. Clark condemned the bills as unconstitutional, calling them indirect tax subsidies that favored segregationist academies. He predicted they would not survive judicial scrutiny.
The tension escalated further when Williams vetoed $5 million in funding for four Head Start programs, affecting roughly 4,000 children.
Clark wrote directly to President Nixon, denouncing the move as racially charged and harmful to efforts at voluntary school integration. The veto, he argued, deepened distrust and discouraged white participation in the programs.
In a rare federal intervention, the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare responded to Clark’s appeal. On March 21, Secretary Robert Finch overrode the governor’s decision, approving over $2 million in grants to sustain the Head Start programs. The move highlighted the federal government’s growing role in supporting early childhood education in underserved communities.
As court-ordered integration took effect across the South, Mississippi saw a sharp rise in the establishment of private “segregation academies.” Many white families fled public schools, seeking what they framed as “quality” education. Clark remained a fierce critic of this exodus and the state’s continued financial support for private institutions, calling instead for full investment in public education.
A quarter-century later, the issue of school choice has returned to the forefront.
President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called school choice “the civil rights issue of our time,” secured a provision in his signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act creating the nation’s first federal school choice program.
The program, built on tax credit scholarships, allows taxpayers to donate up to $1,700 annually to nonprofits supporting private education, receiving a dollar-for-dollar credit in return. Unlike traditional deductions, which reduce taxable income, the program provides a full match – an unprecedented shift in education funding. In August 2025, Mississippi’s House Select Committee on Education Freedom heard testimony from two Trump administration officials, who argued the program could transform educational opportunities in the state.
Still, echoes of 1970 remain. Some lawmakers questioned whether school choice could erode public education or clash with constitutional provisions, just as Clark once argued decades earlier. Lindsey Burke, the Trump administration’s deputy chief of staff fo policy and programs, insisted the plan does not violate the Mississippi Constitution.
“The funds are not directly funding a school,” she said. “They are funding the family who then chooses a school.”
Mississippi once again finds itself at the center of debates over educational freedom.
The state has embraced modern versions of school choice—charter schools, vouchers, education savings accounts and open enrollment.
Supporters argue these programs empower parents and give children trapped in failing schools a way out. Critics warn they echo the old “freedom-of-choice” system, draining money from public schools and worsening racial and economic divides.
Legally, these programs are constitutional—for now. Courts have generally upheld vouchers and charters, even when public money flows to religious schools, as in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Carson v. Makin.
But Mississippi’s Constitution also requires lawmakers to maintain a system of free public schools. If funding shifts too heavily toward private or religious institutions, the state could face lawsuits challenging whether it is meeting that obligation.
The real test may not be in the courtroom, but in classrooms across Mississippi. If “choice” results in further segregation or starves public schools of resources, it risks repeating history – reviving the very inequalities the courts once declared unconstitutional.
In a press release regarding the establishment of a select committee, Mississippi House Speaker Jason White, a Republican from West, emphasized that “education freedom” will be the foremost priority as lawmakers prepare for the upcoming legislative session.
The committee met several more times in the following months to gather testimony from both supporters and critics. Lawmakers will use these findings to draft legislation for the 2026 session, ensuring the debate over who controls Mississipp’s classrooms—and how they receive funding—will continue to be unresolved.

The vigil comes after an extraordinary year of ICE presence in Connecticut and around the country as agents, often wearing masks, have detained residents everywhere from their places of work to courthouses. According to the organizers of Monday’s event, more than 900 people have been detained by ICE in Connecticut since 2023.
Holding candles and signs and wearing butterfly wings to symbolize free migration, attendees walked from the ice skating rink in the park to a roundabout where they placed pairs of empty shoes. As they walked, they sang the protest anthem “We Shall Not be Moved.“
“I decided to come out tonight because I feel for those who have been kidnapped,” said Saira Valencia, a Hartford resident. Valencia said that she has concerns for the safety of her own family members who have green cards but are not naturalized citizens. “Even though we may seem OK, we’re not always OK. The government, the state — they have every power to change everything for us.”
Speaking at the vigil, Vilma Aparicio-Deras, who was detained by ICE at a Newington car wash in August, told the crowd about her experience. Aparicio-Deras, who is from Guatemala, said that she was detained just days after having surgery for kidney stones. While in detention, she didn’t receive medical care and her condition worsened.
“Since I left detention, I’ve had a lot of limitations,” on what she can do, Aparicio-Deras told the crowd.
At the event, Leticia Cotto read the anonymous testimony of a person whose mother was detained by ICE. It read, in part, “I have PTSD from the trauma to my family by the constant churn of deportation. This has been catastrophic for all of us, with consequences. We’re not ever going to not think about this.”
In November, during a special legislative session, lawmakers voted to limit the actions ICE agents can take in courthouses, barring them from making arrests without a judicial warrant, or wearing masks there “unless medically necessary.” Lawmakers also approved legislation to prevent personal information, like residents’ locations and schedules, from being shared. While the new law protects residents’ data held by Connecticut agencies, it doesn’t have the power to stop federal agencies from sharing data with ICE.
Monday’s vigil was the latest effort by Hartford Deportation Defense, Jewish Voice for Peace and others to draw attention to the issue of ICE detentions. That effort can prove challenging, since many residents affected are concerned about government retribution for speaking to the media.
Len Virula, one of the speakers and organizers of the Monday night vigil, said she was glad to see Aparicio-Deras stand up in front of the crowd and tell her story. While organizers had asked others to speak, they had declined. Virula was also “shocked” at the large turnout on such a cold night. Seeing the crowd gathered in Hartford, “I feel like my heart grew bigger,” Virula said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_90A9173E5428-1-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 11:59:50.388372

“Advanced pancreatic is nasty stuff; it’s a death sentence. But I already had a death sentence before last week too — we all do,” Sasse wrote.
Most of the political world knows Sasse from his time tussling with President Donald Trump over the direction of the Republican Party, including being one of seven Republicans who voted to convict the president following his impeachment in 2021. 
Sasse has been, in many ways, a traditional small-government conservative with an intellectual bent. He often critiqued the GOP’s turn toward populism under Trump and paid a price in public.
He made waves as a candidate running from academia, as then-president of Midland University in Fremont before being elected to the Senate in 2014. His friends describe him as an intense and philosophical thinker.
His foes describe him as a man who likes to prove he is the smartest person in the room. He and his family had discussed moving back to Nebraska, to the lakes, from Florida.

Advanced pancreatic is nasty stuff; it’s a death sentence.…

In the early days, he pressed his fellow Republicans to offer solutions to issues like health care instead of just talking about what they were against.
In practice, he told reporters he found the Senate and its politically limiting ways stifling to the sort of committee work and legislative progress he sought.
He did not ever repeal and replace Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, nor did he muster support for a clear legislative alternative.
But he found his legislative niche pushing back against the rise of China and the malfeasance of Russia online and in the real world, the changing face of war.
He told Americans early and often about the societal and economic disruption artificial intelligence would bring, calling it the next industrial revolution.
Much of his late Senate work focused on what he called “the future of work,” and he spoke often about the need to change education and training to meet new needs.
He left the Senate in early 2023 to lead the University of Florida until mid-2024, when he resigned to help care for his wife, Melissa, who had been ill.
Sasse typically dealt with her epilepsy and other ailments quietly, telling friends that his teens would be fine because they were a family that would work together.
He celebrated his closeness with Melissa since stepping back in the 185-word statement he posted, calling her “the best friend a man could ever have.”
“This is hard for someone wired to work and build, but harder still as a husband and a dad,” he wrote. “I can’t begin to describe how great my people are.” 
Sasse has three children, two daughters and a son. His post referenced his joy in their successes — one in the Air Force, one teaching and one learning to drive.
In it, he spoke about the situation his health would put his family through, not getting to walk his daughter down the aisle, burying him.
But he layered his message as he did in some of his speeches, with themes and reflections on the faith that buttressed him during difficult times with his wife and kids.
Sasse said he wouldn’t go down without a fight. He said he finds comfort in the idea of Christmas. And “gallows humor.” He said death and dying are not the same.
“We hope in a real Deliverer — a rescuing God, born at a real time, in a real place,” he said.”But the eternal city — with foundations and without cancer — is not yet.”

New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez announced this week the state had joined a coalition of nearly two dozen state attorneys general in a lawsuit against the Trump administration over defunding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

CFPB, the suit argues, has helped the AGs since its inception in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, “in their zealous advocacy for and protection of consumers in their respective
jurisdictions” and has returned $21 billion “improperly taken from over 205 million Americans,” a news release states.

However, CFPB Acting Director Russel Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, is “attempting to completely defund the agency by refusing to request any funding from the Federal Reserve,” the news release continues, “which will virtually guarantee the agency runs out of money in January 2026.”


The AGs argue that defunding the CFPB will have “devastating impacts” on consumers and on states’ consumer protection capabilities, given their reliance CFPB data, as well as the consumer complaints received by the agency.




“The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is one of the most effective tools we have to hold powerful financial institutions accountable and to put money back in the pockets of working families,” Torrez said in a statement. “Attempting to defund CFPB is not just reckless—it is unlawful, and it would leave millions of consumers without a critical line of defense against fraud, abuse, and predatory practices. New Mexico families deserve a federal government that enforces the law and protects consumers, not one that undermines the very agencies created to do that work.”




The AGs’ lawsuit argue not seeking funding for CFPB is both “unlawful and unconstitutional,” because the agency will be unable to provide its legally obligated information to states without funding. Moreover, not funding the CFPB, they say, violates the separation of powers principle, given that Congress created the agency.

The AG coalition seeks a court order requiring CFPB to request funding through the Federal Reserve, as established.




The other states in the suit include: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AGTorrezJan.28-1024x555.jpg,,,2025-12-23 11:59:50.388372

WILMINGTON, Del. — The Trump administration has ordered an immediate suspension of several major projects along the East Coast, citing national security concerns raised by the Pentagon — a move that could significantly affect the future of development in the Mid-Atlantic, including projects tied to Delaware.
The decision, announced by the U.S. Department of the Interior, pauses federal leases for five large offshore wind projects already under construction or in advanced stages: Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts; Revolution Wind off Rhode Island and Connecticut; Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York; and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind.
According to the administration, turbine towers and rotating blades interfere with military radar systems, potentially obscuring real targets or creating false signals — a risk the Pentagon said could compromise national security.
Delaware project not named — but not insulated
While the Maryland-Delaware project proposed by US Wind was not among the five projects specifically halted, energy and legal experts say the federal action sends a clear signal that all projects now face heightened scrutiny.
During Monday’s A Better Discussion webcast, former Delaware Attorney General M. Jane Brady said the federal move underscores why state-level approvals alone may not be enough to advance offshore wind development.  Brady is also the lead attorney of several offshore wind-related cases in Delaware.
“The further along projects get, the more permits that have been granted, the more they can rely upon those in an expenditure of funds,” Brady said. “That’s why we need to continue to challenge these issues at every step.”
US Wind’s project still requires federal approvals to proceed, even after Delaware lawmakers recently passed legislation overriding Sussex County’s denial of a proposed substation tied to the project.
“If federal agencies freeze or revoke leases,” Brady said, “state approval becomes irrelevant.”
National security concerns long debated
Energy executive Ken Reuter, a former Siemens Energy vice president who worked on projects earlier in his career, said the federal government’s concerns mirror longstanding issues within the defense and maritime communities.
“Onshore wind and offshore wind are like an apple and a prime rib roast,” Reuter said during the webcast. “They’re nowhere similar, except for the name of wind.”
Reuter cited the complexity of offshore construction, reliance on specialized vessels, and maintenance challenges at sea, noting that offshore wind requires constant marine operations that introduce additional costs and logistical risks.
“You’re burning diesel fuel, putting workers on boats, running them out to platforms,” he said. “It’s totally different.”
Financial and economic ripple effects
The suspension has already sent shockwaves through the industry. Stocks of major developers fell sharply following the announcement, raising concerns about financing and investor confidence across the East Coast market.
That uncertainty could affect promised economic benefits tied to the Maryland-Delaware project, including construction jobs, port investments and community benefit agreements that have been cited by supporters.
Reuter said broader energy policy decisions must account for reliability and economic competitiveness, particularly as states compete to attract data centers and other power-intensive industries.
“If we let the whole data-center market slip by us because we’re not able to produce electricity,” he said, “we are losing a huge opportunity.”
A turning point for offshore wind?
The administration’s move is part of a broader pattern of skepticism toward offshore wind development, particularly when weighed against defense readiness and grid reliability.
Brady said the pause may mark a turning point — but warned that legal and regulatory battles are far from over.
“That does not mean we don’t have to keep fighting at the local level,” she said. “The more invested a project becomes, the harder it is to stop.”
For Delaware, the decision places development in a more uncertain federal environment — one that could delay, reshape or ultimately halt projects that have already triggered years of political debate at the state and local levels.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/USwind_Main.jpg,,,2025-12-23 11:59:50.388372

Pamela Evette’s campaign for governor hit a milestone last week, as she completed her goal of visiting all of South Carolina’s 46 counties by year’s end.
She’d already been to every county since she became lieutenant governor in January 2019, she told the SC Daily Gazette.
But this five-month trip around the state, which started in Edgefield County in August, gave her a chance to talk with potential voters in their favorite local gathering spots.

“I want people to understand that I truly care,” she told the Gazette after her final stop of the tour.
While she’s campaigned and served alongside Gov. Henry McMaster since he picked her as a running mate in November 2017, Evette was still largely an unknown to many voters when she launched her campaign in July.
She touts that she’s the first and only candidate for governor of the entire seven-person field to meet with voters in every county.
She’s also the only one making her first solo run for elected office.
When McMaster chose her to be South Carolina’s first lieutenant governor elected as part of a joint ticket, the political novice was president and CEO of Quality Business Solutions, an outsourcing payroll and human resources firm operating out of Travelers Rest, where she lives.
She’s campaigning on her business credentials, saying that’s what voters want.
“No matter where I was — big city, small town — everybody really, the number one thing they expressed [was] they really wanted a business governor,” she said.
Stops included Harold’s Country Club in the Lowcountry town of Yemassee — a family-owned restaurant “proud to be in the middle of nowhere yet close to everything,” according to its slogan. She wrapped up her tour in Bishopville, home to the Lee County Veterans Museum, which displayed a surprising array of veterans’ personal items, including a captured Japanese flag with blood on it.
“I bet you, most people that are true war buffs have no idea that’s there,” she said. “We have so many gems like that in these little small towns.”
While in Bishopville, Evette also presented a letter of congratulations to Janice Atkinson, owner of The Little Florist, who was picked from among more than 15,000 applicants to help decorate the White House for Christmas.
During the tour, Evette said she saw first-hand what South Carolinians want fixed — for example, closed bridges in Chester County.
“It’s just amazing what you learn by being on the road,” she said.
Her sampling of food at restaurants along the way included all of South Carolina’s barbecue types, though ketchup-based remains her favorite. And she watched several football games, including Clemson’s 28-14 victory over South Carolina at the annual Palmetto Bowl rivalry held this year in Columbia.
One of Evette’s three children graduated from the University of South Carolina law school and another attends Clemson, so she stressed she wasn’t cheering for one over the other: “I’m just rooting for South Carolina,” she said.
Before the GOP primary on June 9, she said she wants to visit each county at least one more time.
The four other Republicans who have announced bids for the Governor’s Mansion are state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, and Attorney General Alan Wilson.
On Monday, the state Republican Party announced the schedule for at least three debates between the GOP candidates — four if there’s a primary runoff.
The two Democrats in the race are state Rep. Jermaine Johnson and Charleston lawyer Mullins McLeod, who previously ran for governor in 2010 but dropped out ahead of the primary.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Farmer-2-Marlboro-County-Farmer-Roundtable-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 11:59:50.388372

Since Sept. 5, right-wing sports publication OutKick has published 19 articles about a 12th grade girls’ volleyball player at Skyline High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The player caught the attention of reporter Dan Zaksheske after he obtained public documents that appear to show her requesting a legal name change from a traditionally masculine first name to a traditionally feminine one.
Over the next three months, Zaksheske would write 18 of the 19 articles OutKick would publish about this student. He and other OutKick reporters attended multiple high school girls’ volleyball games where they recorded and reported on Skyline High’s volleyball season. At the heart of each article was a focus on the girl, who Zaksheske refers to as a “trans-identifying biological male.”
Zaksheske’s reporting stoked a controversy that drew the attention of multiple right-wing publications, politicians and influencers. This coverage led Sean Lechner, whose cisgender daughter played against Skyline and allegedly shared a locker room with their team, to file a Title IX complaint.

While the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) does require trans athletes to get a waiver approved to compete in official state tournaments, the Democrat-majority state Senate outright rejected the idea of a trans athlete sports ban earlier this year. In addition, LGBTQ Michiganders have strong anti-discrimination protections under the state’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act.
In the complaint, Lechner calls for a ban on “biological males from competing in female sports” and for a “full investigation into actions and communications of Ann Arbor Public Schools/Monroe High/Chet Hesson,” citing a Trump executive order that declares that trans-inclusive policies are in violation of Title IX.
Shortly after the complaint was filed, Uncloseted Media published an interview clip with Hesson, the athletic director of Monroe Public Schools, in which he simply said his “heart goes out” to the player for being under such scrutiny. Less than 24 hours later, he was put on administrative leave.
As this story spreads like wildfire, experts in journalistic ethics are raising concerns about Zaksheske’s reporting. 
“OutKick’s inflammatory reporting on a Michigan high school volleyball player who may or may not be trans disregards several core principles of the Society of Professional Journalists’ [SPJ] Code of Ethics,” Dan Axelrod, chairman of the SPJ’s ethics committee, told Uncloseted Media. SPJ’s Code of Ethics, originally drafted in 1973, has been embraced and used by thousands of journalists from numerous newsrooms and schools.
“The Code cautions reporters to ‘show compassion for those who may be affected by news coverage,’ and to ‘use heightened sensitivity when dealing with juveniles,’ while ‘weigh[ing] the consequences of publishing or broadcasting personal information,’” Axelrod says. “[OutKick] has essentially ignored all those ethical principles, given [Zaksheske’s] relentless coverage of the player, which has led the public to easily infer who she is, and its negative framing of her story.”

Ethical Questions
The player, whose mother did not respond to an interview request, does not appear to have publicly come out as trans prior to the publication of Zaksheske’s first article.
Chad Painter, associate professor and chair of the communications department at the University of Dayton, says this “brings up a whole host of issues.” While Zaksheske wrote that he did not name the girl “because the student athlete is under 18,” Painter says that doesn’t do enough to conceal her identity.
In his reporting, Zaksheske references the existence of publicly accessible name change documents, the girl’s county of residence and the name of a local volleyball club she’d been a part of. “Someone who is reasonably well-versed in being able to Google someone can figure this out pretty easily,” Painter, who has co-authored multiple media ethics textbooks, told Uncloseted Media.
“There’s longstanding norms in newsrooms that we don’t out people, that that is a very personal decision that an individual gets to make, and unless there is a massively compelling reason to do that, it’s not our role,” he says. “The idea that he is in the clear because he didn’t specifically write this person’s name in a story, it wouldn’t hold up to journalistic scrutiny.”

And Zaksheske’s reporting appears to have outed the girl. The same day that he published his first article on the matter, an X account whose mission is “to call out these male athletes and expose the damage that they have each caused to women and girls in sports” published the girl’s full name and deadname along with multiple photos and videos of her. (Uncloseted Media has chosen not to link to these posts directly in the interest of her privacy.)

In addition to the 18 articles Zaksheske wrote, he also tweeted about the situation at least 41 times and attended at least four high school girls’ volleyball games. While watching, he recorded videos of the girls playing and then posted them to X and OutKick’s website.
“Having 19 stories about one athlete … to me, that seems like this coverage is out of line with how we’d normally talk about, especially high school sports, which, frankly, no one outside of this little area in Michigan are going to really care about,” says Painter. 
“Outside of the culture war stuff, I don’t see where this is a story.”
When Zaksheske was confronted by multiple people at the school about attending and recording one of the games, he published another article accusing them of harassment. “I was shadowed by the school principal and harassed and stalked by Skyline supporters,” he wrote.
Painter notes that while Zaksheske was within his rights as a journalist and citizen to be attending and recording such events, he understands why the school would approach him with skepticism.
“I have a feeling that if I just started showing up randomly to high school volleyball games and taking photos and videos, there would probably be questions,” Painter says. “Because, again, we are talking about minors.”
“The reporter has a right to pursue news … and that right especially exists at a public school,” says Axelrod. “However, one has to wonder at what point is the coverage just pandering to curiosity as opposed to serving a valid societal purpose in informing and facilitating larger discussions about real and valid questions regarding the participation of trans athletes in sports.”
Misinformation and Animus
Zaksheske has pushed back against similar criticism on X, accusing those who question the ethics of his reporting of being “in favor of sterilizing, mutilating and castrating children” and characterizing his reporting as “exposing their heinous acts.”
“I don’t see that as an ethical problem because it doesn’t even enter into the world of ethics,” Painter says of Zaksheske’s rhetoric. “It is wrong factually and it doesn’t really have a place in what we do in terms of the journalism field.”
Misleading rhetoric about trans health care is common throughout OutKick’s reporting. Zaksheske has written several articles about gender-affirming care, where he has claimed that puberty blockers “take healthy children and sterilize them for life.”
Puberty blockers have been FDA-approved for treating precocious puberty in cisgender children since 1993. Multiple studies have found no evidence of them causing permanent infertility, and gynecologists and endocrinologists have said that they do not cause sterilization.
Much of Zaksheske’s coverage of trans people has been negative. Of adult trans women, he wrote that “that person might see himself as a woman, but we are under no obligation to ‘affirm’ that.” He also wrote that doctors who provide gender-affirming care “have to answer to their consciences.”
OutKick also generally misgenders trans women and girls, referring to them as “males,” “biological males” or “trans-identifying males,” additionally using masculine pronouns to refer to them. 
Painter notes that this goes against the “Associated Press Stylebook,” which he says “any newsroom worth its salt is going to follow.”
“The journalist and the news outlet squander their credibility covering these types of societal questions when they use language … that fails to recognize and respect the underlying humanity of an entire group of people,” he says.
In an email, Brian Karpas, OutKick’s director of media relations, told Uncloseted Media that the publication “stands by the thorough and responsible reporting of Dan Zaksheske and will continue to protect women from competing against biological males.”
Beyond Michigan
OutKick’s extensive reporting of the Michigan volleyball player is reflective of the publication’s increasingly conservative bent since it launched in 2011. In 2021, it was acquired by Fox Corporation. Since then, it has partnered with Fox News and has become home to numerous right-wing personalities known for anti-trans rhetoric. These include founder Clay Travis, who has said World Aquatics is “encouraging …super young kids to be transitioned”; Tomi Lahren, who said that liberals “don’t know what a woman is”; and Riley Gaines, who referred to an eighth-grade trans girl as a “mediocre man.”
This story in Michigan is not the first time OutKick and Zaksheske have hyperfocused on one trans girl. They were one of the first national publications to report on California-based track and field athlete AB Hernandez, who later became the center of a feud between the Trump administration and Gov. Gavin Newsom. Since March, OutKick has published at least 24 articles about Hernandez, 10 of which were written by Zaksheske. They sent reporters to at least two games to photograph Hernandez and other teenage players. Additionally, OutKick published 15 articles and attended at least four games covering the story of a trans softball player in Minnesota, whose presence on the team became a key point of a lawsuit by the Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQ hate group, Alliance Defending Freedom.
This massive amount of coverage is common for U.S. conservative media: A report published this year from Media Matters for America found that Fox News ran over 400 weekday segments mentioning trans athletes from Feb. 5 to June 6.
Consequences and Impact

All of this has had an impact. While the Title IX investigation is still pending, Hesson, who was named in the complaint, told Uncloseted Media that he had been targeted with harassment and vitriol online.

In the comments of the Instagram post, Hesson was attacked by numerous users: squaredbeach9 wrote, “Stop normalizing these freaks. You don’t give a bulimic chick a bucket and some gum.”
And others chimed in, saying:
● “Guaranteed he has child pron on an electronic device.”
● “Fuck off, poor tranny hates attention, give me a fn break.”
● “So a male playing in women’s sports. And this cuck is defending it.”
All of this has come even though Hesson is not directly affiliated with Skyline High School, which is part of a different district. As such, he was not involved in the decision to allow the girl to play, and he was also not privy to whether she had a waiver.
Still, Zaksheske’s 18 articles have catapulted this small story to the national level. Lechner has been interviewed by journalists sympathetic to his cause, including Dave Bondy and Fox Business anchors. And since Hesson was placed on administrative leave, the Daily Mail, CBS News, the Toledo Blade, WTVG, MLive, The Times of India and more have covered the story.
In addition, numerous right-wing lawmakers and candidates have endorsed Lechner’s complaint. Republican state Rep. James DeSana posted a statement to Facebook “calling for Chet Hesson to be removed immediately.”
“The public cannot have good discourse, debate, or dialogue without good information,” Painter says. “Supplying that information is the fundamental duty of the news media. When journalists are distracted by inconsequential stories, then we’re not spending the time to cover interesting and important news that our readers really need.”
Both Painter and Axelrod took note of the small number of known trans athletes in the U.S. Last year, the NCAA’s president told a Senate panel that fewer than 10 of the 510,000 college athletes affiliated with the organization were transgender.
“This controversy is part of a much larger national narrative about transgender athletes and the LGBTQ+ community as a whole,” Painter says. “The entire national conversation is based on virtually nothing, so this particular set of stories are based on an inconsequential premise.”
Going Forward
If the Department of Education does find that Title IX was violated, the school district could risk losing federal funding if it continues to allow trans athletes to compete.
Zaksheske has been pressuring the MHSAA to confirm whether a waiver was approved for the volleyball player to compete, citing a statement from early September in which the association said it had not yet approved any waivers for the semester. On Dec. 9, MHSAA confirmed that one waiver was granted in the fall season, though no details were given in the interest of the student’s privacy.
While research into the relative athletic capabilities of trans and cis women is ongoing, numerous experts and athletes say that politicized vitriol, misleading information and outsized media attention about trans athletes makes girls’ sports less safe for all athletes.
“There are real, valid, and necessary societal discussions to be had about trans athletes participating against competitors who don’t match their birth gender, and ethical journalism can have a place in informing those discussions,” Axelrod says. “At the end of the day, this woman is still a human, and a child at that, not a canvas for OutKick to paint a distorted picture of one individual who’s a tiny part of a much bigger societal dialogue about trans athletes.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-23-084831.png,,,2025-12-23 11:59:50.388372

The deadline to introduce measures is Jan. 15 at 4 p.m, so there is still plenty of time for lawmakers to file what normally ends up being thousands of bills.
Realistically, only a couple of hundreds are ever signed into law.
Still, early proposals aim to protect Oklahomans from predatory home and auto insurance practices, increase transparency of public meetings, invest in public schools and exclude immigrants — legally present in the country and otherwise — from certain aspects of public life.
One measure, Senate Bill 1253 by Big Cabin Republican Micheal Bergstrom, aims to adjust the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefit administration to align with new federal guidelines, specifically those related to employment and other eligibility requirements.
Here is an early breakdown of bills filed for Oklahoma’s 2026 legislative session so far:
Insurance protections and tax breaks

	Tulsa Republican Rep. Mark Tedford filed a series of six measures aimed at protecting Oklahomans from various predatory insurance practices.

House Bill 2929 – prohibits home insurance providers from canceling or increasing premiums for people who make single claims based on large floods or claims older than five years.


House Bill 2930 – Prohibits auto insurance providers from using traffic tickets to adjust policies and increase premiums.


House Bill 2931 – Increases the value of certain annuity funds subject to the Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act, which helps keep Oklahomans holding health coverage policies with a provider that goes out of business, for example, insured while they make adjustments.


House Bill 2932 – Prohibits the recovery of the first $100,000 of bodily injury and/ or property damages for people who fail to maintain proper liability insurance on their vehicle.


House Bill 2933 – Requires insurance providers to report a slew of information to the Oklahoma Insurance Department, including but not limited to changes in policies and price hikes.


House Bill 2934 – Protects people from civil liability when they cause bodily injury or property damage while responding to the criminal act of another person, unless they’re an accomplice.

On the tax front, Oklahoma City Republican Rep. Emily Gise filed House Bill 2935, a tax break on diapers for infants.
Meanwhile, her fellow Republican from Catoosa, Rep. Derrick Hildebrant, refiled an income tax break for churches with “health care ministry” expenses in the form of House Bill 2942. It’s similar to his measure last year, which failed in the House Appropriations and Finance Subcommittee.
Proposed government ethics and transparency regulations

	
At least eight measures focused on forcing more transparency from the state government were filed, mostly by members of the far-right Republican coalition known as the Oklahoma Freedom Caucus. Blanchard Republican and Freedom Caucus member Sen. Kendal Sacchieri filed four of the proposed bills.

Senate Bills 1199 and 1200 – Add restrictions on financial conflicts of interest for public school and technology center boards. It also aims to limit certain financial interests to a 5% stake if board members, or their family, have a part in a local business acting as one of a few local suppliers of certain goods or services.


Senate Bill 1215 – Prohibits any state government entities, including individuals and public trusts, from entering into a non-disclosure agreement.


Senate Bill 1240 – Also dubbed the “Protect Taxpayers Act of 2026,” this measure prohibits state entities from spending public money to lobby on behalf of any issue or legislation. Punishment is whatever injunctive relief a defendant might claim, assuming a judge approves it. In other words, it requires a lawsuit to enforce.

Fellow Freedom Caucus members Sen. Prieto, R-Tulsa, and Rep. Olsen, R-Roland, filed similar measures in their respective chambers addressing public access and comment at meetings held by government entities.

Senate Bill 1206 by Prieto requires all government officials holding a meeting before the public, subject to the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act, to allow reasonable public comment periods and to formally address those comments in following meetings.


House Bill 2940 by Olsen, dubbed the “First Amendment Open Meetings Protection Act,” requires public bodies holding meetings to allow members of the public to record. Attempts to prohibit recording can be met with legal action and monetary compensation determined by a judge.

Sen. Brian Guthrie, R-Bixby, while not a member of the Freedom Caucus, filed Senate Bill 1252, which aims to accomplish much of the same as Prieto and Olsen’s bills.
Early school funding measures

	
Sen. Adam Pugh, R- Edmond, is the Senate Education Committee Chair and a candidate for Oklahoma’s next State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He’s filed two early measures aiming to inject money into public schools.

Senate Bill 1189 – Enables a $50 million from the School Security Revolving Fund to be distributed evenly among all 500-plus school districts in the state over three years, if there is enough money in the account. It’s unclear what the fund’s total balance is, but the injection would be less than $100,000 per district.


Senate Bill 1193 – Allows smaller school districts to keep unused state appropriations and still get money for the following fiscal years.

Attempts to exclude immigrants from public life

	
Sen. Sacchieri filed six measures aimed at restricting the lives of immigrants in Oklahoma.

Senate Bill 1211 – Disqualifies H1-B visa holders, who are highly skilled employees hired from abroad by companies operating in the U.S. and considered ‘nonimmigrants,’ in federal statute, from certain Ad Valorem tax breaks on their owned property.


Senate Bill 1222 – Prohibits the issuance and use of driver’s licenses without an address on them, invalidates such licenses issued in other states and increases the fines on commercial drivers who carry them as identification.


Senate Bill 1223 – Requires commercial truck drivers to meet certain English Language Proficiency standards before driving. The proposed fine for not meeting it is $1,000.


Senate Bill 1230 – Requires Service Oklahoma verify ‘legal presence’ in the U.S. for REAL ID applicants.


Senate Bill 1231 – Prohibits members of the public not in possession of a “digital ID” from refusing access by state government officials to any location.
Senate Bill 1243 – Requires anyone driving in Oklahoma to be a U.S. citizen or ‘legal resident’ of the country. It also mandates a “citizen marker” to be displayed on newly issued IDs, while prohibiting the issuance of identification to anyone who can’t prove they are a citizen or lawfully in the U.S.

(Photo by Getty Images)Animal-welfare advocates say that while one of Iowa’s biggest puppy-mill operators is no longer licensed, he is still selling dogs and has ramped up the illegal practice of puppy laundering.
The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals claims in a court filing that one of Iowa’s most prolific violators of the Animal Welfare Act, Steve Kruse of West Point, hasn’t ceased operations with the loss of his license, but has actually expanded the “illegal activities” intended to facilitate the sale of puppies and dogs.
In September 2024, the ASPCA filed a seven-count civil complaint against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the federal agency that polices animal breeders and brokers at the national level.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The ASPCA alleged the USDA has knowingly allowed illegal activity to occur through its issuance of licenses to Kruse and two of his associates, Brian Lichirie and Wuanita Swedlund, and by failing to revoke any of their licenses.
The case centers on the USDA’s alleged failure to act in response to its own written findings that Kruse has used Lichirie and Swedlund to engage in puppy laundering – the practice of routing dogs to retailers through intermediary breeders, allowing Kruse’s dogs to be sold even in states that restrict the sale of animals originating from kennels owned by repeat violators.
Aside from a USDA motion to dismiss the lawsuit, there was very little activity in the case until Oct. 8, 2025, when U.S. District Court Judge Jia M. Cobb noted that so much time had passed that Kruse’s three-year USDA license had expired. The judge asked the USDA and the ASPCA to each submit briefs as to whether the expiration of Kruse’s license rendered any part of the case moot.










It appears that Mr. Kruse continues to engage in regulated activities, despite the cancellation of his license, and continues his scheme to launder puppies.


– ASPCA, in a civil lawsuit against the USDA


In its filing, the USDA recently suggested the five claims concerning enforcement against Lichirie and Swedlund remained live, while the two counts specific to Kruse were moot and should be dismissed. Without a license, the USDA argued, there is no issue of enforcement the court can address.
Last week, the ASPCA filed its own brief, contending all seven counts should proceed, arguing the USDA “did not offer any indication that they had conducted an inquiry or investigation as to whether Mr. Kruse continues to participate in the venture even without his license, still owns the land on which the kennels operate, or otherwise maintains involvement in the ongoing enterprise.”
The ASPCA alleges that while Kruse is no longer licensed, its investigation suggests he “remains actively involved in regulated activity under the Animal Welfare Act, despite the cancellation of his license.”

Inset photo taken by USDA inspector, courtesy of Bailing Out Benji)
The APCA notes that days after Kruse’s license was canceled in August 2025, the USDA approved Christine A. Snakenberg for a license to do business at the same West Point address where Kruse has for years operated a large-scale kennel.
The USDA’s pre-license inspection report for Snakenberg indicates there were 142 adult dogs on the property when the inspector visited and the federal agency agreed to grant her a license.
Kruse still owns that property, the ASPCA says, and Snakenberg, who is not a co-owner, owns a single family, owner-occupied home 19 miles away in Danville.
In addition, the ASPCA says, an Illinois Bureau of Animal Welfare inspection report dated Nov. 26, 2025, shows that Kruse himself “continues to supply dogs” to Ray Duckmanton, an Illinois-licensed breeder doing business as Racore Inc.
“These records demonstrate that Mr. Kruse has not ceased his unlawful activities,” the ASPCA argues. “It appears that Mr. Kruse continues to engage in regulated activities, despite the cancellation of his license, and continues his scheme to launder puppies through his associates in violation of the Animal Welfare Act — including through Snakenberg, who the USDA has licensed to conduct regulated activities on Mr. Kruse’s property.”
In its brief to the court, the ASPCA alleges that the USDA has historically failed to act even when its own inspectors have confirmed that a previously licensed individual is still engaged in breeding or brokering. The organization adds that the USDA, in its brief to the court, has not argued that the alleged illegal activity has halted and has instated stated only that Kruse is no longer licensed.
“There is nothing preventing Mr. Kruse from reapplying, and nothing suggesting that the agency would not re license him if he did,” the ASPCA argues. “Thus, it is entirely likely, and expected, that the wrongful behavior by the defendants will continue.”
The ASPCA claims the USDA wrote to Kruse nine years ago, in 2016, to inform him that federal law required him, Lichirie and Swedlund to operate under a single license. When Kruse failed to take corrective action, the ASPCA claims, the USDA continued to renew his license and never took any steps to revoke the licenses of either Lichirie or Swedlund.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeks a court order that would force the USDA to void all current licenses issued to Kruse and his associates.

Classic Rock Across Generations: Launch Brings Queen, Boston and Styx to Wilmington on Dec. 27
WILMINGTON, Del. — The music that helped define arena rock and shape generations of fans will echo through downtown Wilmington on Friday, Dec. 27, when Launch takes the stage at the Queen Theatre, featuring music from Queen, Boston, and Styx.
The concert is designed as a celebration of classic rock’s most enduring era — music that continues to resonate across age groups, from longtime fans who grew up with it on vinyl and FM radio to younger listeners discovering it through films, streaming playlists and family road trips.
Each of the featured bands left a lasting mark on rock history.
Queen redefined what a rock band could be, blending operatic ambition with stadium-sized anthems. Frontman Freddie Mercury’s theatrical style and the band’s genre-crossing sound helped elevate rock concerts into full-scale performances. In contrast, songs like “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “We Will Rock You” became cultural touchstones still heard at sporting events and celebrations worldwide.
Boston helped usher in the polished sound of arena rock in the mid-1970s, proving that technical precision and powerful melodies could coexist with raw energy. Their debut album remains one of the best-selling first records in music history, influencing how rock was recorded and produced for decades.
Styx bridged progressive rock and mainstream appeal, combining storytelling, layered harmonies and synthesizers with radio-friendly hooks. Their success helped push rock toward more ambitious compositions without losing mass appeal.
Launch brings these influences together in a single night, recreating the sound, feel and musical craftsmanship that made each band iconic. Rather than focusing on one catalog, the group presents a shared history of rock — highlighting how these bands collectively shaped the sound that dominated arenas and airwaves for more than a generation.
Organizers say the Dec. 27 show is intentionally family-friendly, welcoming longtime fans and newcomers alike. For many, it offers a chance to pass down the music they love to younger audiences in a live setting, where the power of classic rock is fully felt.
The Queen Theatre has become a regional destination for tribute and legacy concerts, offering an intimate venue where large-scale music can still feel personal. That setting allows audiences to experience songs originally written for stadiums in a space where every note is close and immediate.
Launch performs Friday, Dec. 27, at the Queen Theatre in Wilmington. Doors open at 7 p.m., with the show beginning at 8 p.m. Tickets are available through the Queen Theatre box office and website.
For fans of classic rock — and for those discovering it for the first time — the concert promises a night that celebrates why this music continues to endure, connect and inspire across generations.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Interior8.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 10:58:29.315488

The next-generation aircraft will serve patients across Delaware, increasing ChristianaCare’s 24/7 capability to transport critically ill and injured patients.
NEW CASTLE, Del. — ChristianaCare and Air Methods marked a major milestone in emergency medical response Dec. 17 with the ribbon cutting of a new Airbus H145 D3 helicopter for ChristianaCare LifeNet at New Castle Airport.
The next-generation aircraft joins ChristianaCare’s LifeNet air medical program, operated in partnership with Air Methods, and will serve patients across Delaware and parts of Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Officials said the helicopter is the first H145 D3 operating in the Northeast, strengthening the program’s 24/7 capability to transport critically ill and injured patients.
“At ChristianaCare, our mission is to serve our neighbors,” said Ric Cuming, chief operating officer at ChristianaCare. “This Airbus H145 D3 is not just a new mode of transport but an innovative leap forward in how we deliver critical medical services during those urgent moments when every second truly matters.”
The aircraft brings advanced safety and performance features, including a five-bladed main rotor system, enhanced engines and Helionix avionics. Program leaders said those upgrades increase payload capacity, reduce vibration and noise, and improve reliability and patient comfort while enabling crews to operate more efficiently in challenging conditions.
Dr. Christopher Rogan, vice chair of Prehospital Services and medical director of LifeNet/CareNet at ChristianaCare, said the helicopter’s technology ensures high-quality care is delivered regardless of location. “Our goal is to create a safe haven for our patients from the moment our care team arrives,” Rogan said.
More than 50 health care leaders, first responders and industry partners attended the ceremony, which included remarks from ChristianaCare, Air Methods and Airbus leadership, along with tours of the aircraft.
Steve Konold, regional vice president at Air Methods, called the helicopter “a powerful symbol of what strong partnerships can achieve,” noting the collaboration raises the bar for air medical transport across the region.
John Roussis, program director at ChristianaCare, said the investment enhances both patient care and crew safety. “It strengthens our ability to reach patients when and where they need us most,” he said.
Airbus officials said the H145 D3 delivers the latest rotor and avionics technology to support lifesaving missions, reinforcing ChristianaCare’s commitment to advanced, accessible emergency care.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-23-101925.jpg,,,2025-12-23 10:58:29.315488

The congresswoman will vie for the seat held by Sen. Lummis, who announced last week she is not seeking reelection. 
The post Wyoming’s Rep. Harriet Hageman announces run for U.S. Senate appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman will run for U.S. Senate in 2026.
“We must keep up this fight. And that’s why today I am announcing my campaign for United States Senate,” Hageman said in a campaign video. 
The announcement follows last week’s news that Sen. Cynthia Lummis would not seek reelection and would retire in 2027 after serving in the upper chamber since 2020. Lummis earlier this year indicated she would seek a second term, but said last week that she realized she didn’t have the energy for another six years in office.
Hageman quickly announced that she would pursue the suddenly open seat. 
“For forty-six years in jobs with the public trust, Cynthia Lummis has embodied the clear-eyed common sense that Wyoming is known for,” Hageman wrote in a statement on Lummis last week. “Her retirement marks the close of an extraordinary era in our state’s political history — one defined by integrity, independence, and unwavering devotion to the people she served.” 
Hageman was first elected Wyoming’s sole congressperson in 2022, soundly defeating then-Rep. Liz Cheney in the Republican primary with the backing of President Donald Trump. The race drew national attention as Hageman triumphed over one of Trump’s harshest Republican critics.
Since then, Hageman has remained loyal to Trump and popular among Republican voters in Wyoming. 
Hageman announcing a Senate run is likely to set other GOP candidates in motion, particularly those who have expressed deference to the congresswoman and her plans. Both Secretary of State Chuck Gray and Speaker of the House Chip Neiman previously told news outlets their 2026 plans hinge on Hageman.  
Who’s Hageman?
Born in Douglas and raised on a ranch near Fort Laramie, Hageman attended Casper College before earning a bachelor’s and a law degree from the University of Wyoming. As a trial attorney, Hageman spent several decades opposing environmentalists and federal regulations.
Before serving in Congress, Hageman was an active member in the Laramie County GOP, including as a delegate at the National Republican Convention in 2016, where she supported Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas over Trump. 
Two years later, she lost a bid for Wyoming governor, placing third behind Foster Friess and Mark Gordon. 
In January, Hageman was named chairwoman of the House Committee on Natural Resources’ Water, Wildlife and Fisheries Subcommittee. 
In that role, she has sought to delist grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from the Endangered Species Act. She’s also worked to reverse the Bureau of Land Management’s resource management plan for its Rock Springs, which she has described as a threat to Wyoming’s fossil fuel industries. Alongside Lummis and Sen. John Barrasso, Hageman introduced legislation in October to overturn a Biden-era ban on new federal coal leasing in northeast Wyoming. 
In March, as Republican congressional leadership urged members to stop hosting in-person town halls to avoid angry constituents and viral confrontations, Hageman held a town hall in Laramie.

After more than 500 people showed up, the congresswoman faced tough questions and angry constituents, several of whom pressed Hageman for answers about the federal government’s mass layoff of federal workers. 
“It’s so bizarre to me how obsessed you are with the federal government,” she said when asked about the fate of Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks.
“You guys are going to have a heart attack if you don’t calm down,” Hageman said. “I’m sorry, you’re hysterical.”
In September, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appointed Hageman to a newly formed congressional committee tasked with further investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

Jim Pillen during a 2025 event honoring social workers, resigned her position because of concerns with operations at the National Association of Social Workers. She led the Nebraska NASW chapter. (Photo submitted by Jessyca Vandercoy)TOPEKA — Social workers nationwide directed furious complaints toward their national association, demanding accountability, transparency and an external review of finances in the wake of a structural realignment that jettisoned 14 state-level leaders.
Four state chapter boards of directors resigned in protest and other state leaders wrote letters to the National Association of Social Workers board of directors after it announced the reorganization in November.
In South Dakota, the chapter’s board told members that whistleblowers alleged “harmful dynamics” at the national office, including questionable spending and a “troubling” consolidation of power.
“These communications raise serious concerns about governance and ethical practices within the Association,” the chapter said in a letter to members.
The letter encouraged social workers to reach out to the national board and ask for a vote of no confidence in NASW CEO Anthony Estreet.
Estreet was selected in 2023 to become the organization’s CEO, after serving on the board for several years.
A letter from the Michigan NASW chapter was equally blunt.
“It is our duty to keep NASW leadership accountable to the core values we hold as social workers, including integrity, transparency, accountability, and collaborative governance,” the letter said. “At this time, the NASW–Michigan Board finds that these standards are not being upheld, and our unanimous vote of no confidence reflects serious and ongoing concerns.”
The letter listed issues that include quality and transparency of national leadership communications and lack of meaningful response to issues raised by chapters.
Letters from Rhode Island, Kansas, Kentucky and Texas were written in the same vein, and each asked for an accounting from the national organization about restructuring decisions and failure to communicate clearly. Several demanded an external investigation.


Online outcry
Unrest among members of the National Association of Social Workers spawned numerous online posts and the creation of social media accounts. They include the following.

An Instagram account called “investigatecorruptionatnasw.”
Multiple active Reddit threads, including NASW whistleblowers are back.
A Substack post from Arkansas social worker Angela Campagna, who said, “The resignation of the NASW Arkansas Chapter Board exposes something deeper than organizational fracture it reveals the growing tension between the daily reality of frontline social work and the structures meant to represent us.”
An in-depth look at the situation on The Macro Lens, called “Deafening Silence: NASW Restructuring and the Fear of Speaking Up.”



LaToya Evans, an external communications expert hired by NASW, said an investigation is not planned. 
“Investigate what?” she said. “Like, no one’s giving me any proof of anything. What are we going to investigate? What are we going to do?”
 
Concerns raised
In October, the NASW’s treasurer and compliance officer, Sylvester Bowie, sent an email to members saying he had received correspondence “raising concerns about sensitive organizational management and operational issues.”
“The board takes its fiduciary responsibilities very seriously and is committed to oversight of the organization,” the email said. “The Board will promptly review relevant information and determine what additional steps, if any, are necessary to address the financial concerns raised, as well as any other allegations within the Board’s scope.”
In response to Kansas Reflector questions about unrest within the organization, Evans referred to annual financial audits by an independent accounting firm.
“NASW has also been audited annually for the past two decades by an independent firm, and they continue to have clean audits with no evidence of financial mismanagement,” she said.
Most financial audits do not uncover fraud, which is typically found when tips are received, according to the National Council of Nonprofits.
“There was no formal internal investigation per se, but a committee did look into the allegations in letters. Dr. Estreet was never under any investigation,” Evans said. “This is false.”
 
‘No proof’ 
Evans said the whistleblower letters referred to by boards were unsigned and contained no specific allegations to investigate.
And she said no proof of any financial mismanagement or other issues has been shown to the national board of directors.
“Have you seen it? You haven’t. Because, if you’ve seen it, please furnish it for me. Because if people are writing all these letters and they’re saying financial mismanagement, no one has said one plus one equals five,” she said. “No one has a receipt, no one has a copy of anything. Because typically when someone is saying financial mismanagement, they have documentation of it.”
With no proof, the allegations being made by state chapter members are upsetting and don’t make sense, Evans added.
“It’s a lot of unfounded claims of people who just want to complain,” she said.
In an email to membership Dec. 8, the NASW board pointed members to audits of the organization’s annual financial statements that found no problems and directed them to access the 990 financial forms required to be filed by nonprofit associations.
 
Demanding accountability
An online letter asks social workers to sign on to demand the national organization become more transparent and accountable. The author of the letter is unclear, but it lays out numerous questions signees would like to see answered, including a section on NASW financials.
Data in the 990s shows that from 2014 through 2020, NASW “experienced persistent operational deficits,” but that began to turn around in 2021, the letter says.
“We recognize the seriousness of these long-term financial challenges and acknowledge the need for strong corrective action,” it says. “It makes sense that there were conversations nearly a decade ago about restructuring.”
Financial patterns beginning in 2021 showed that “day-to-day operations have been stable and largely sustainable for the last several years,” the letter says. In 2023 and 2024, there were major increases in liabilities and a decline in assets.
“These types of shifts are typically caused by non-operational financial events, such as legal or insurance-related obligations, recognition of contingent liabilities, related-party financial impacts, and accounting reclassifications or corrections,” the letter says. “These events are national-level issues, not chapter-level failings. It is therefore essential to understand the true drivers of the restructuring decision.”
The letter asks that the board and Estreet, the CEO, schedule a virtual open forum so members can ask questions.
Evans said board president Yvonne Chase has scheduled a meeting with volunteer chapter presidents.
“They invited her to chat and she is doing that while also planning other town halls and listening sessions,” Evans said. “Dr. Estreet previously had a town hall with members and staff after the reorganization announcement.”

Restructuring
NASW announced the structural realignment a few weeks ago, eliminating 14 state leader positions and merging some states together to be overseen by one director. Kansas leader Becky Fast was laid off and the state’s chapter is now grouped with Iowa.
The leaders who were let go, some of whom oversaw two chapters, covered Alaska; Arizona; Arkansas; Georgia; Guam; Kansas and Oklahoma; Kentucky; Missouri; North Dakota; Pennsylvania; Tennessee; Utah; Virginia and Washington, D.C.; and Washington and Hawaii.
A letter signed by Arkansas chapter board members, all of whom resigned, said the decision to remove state leadership failed “to uphold principles of transparency, accountability, fairness and responsiveness to community needs.”
Jessyca Vandercoy led the Nebraska NASW chapter for 18 months before she resigned, citing concerns about the direction the national organization was going and decision-making transparency.
It was her dream job, she said, especially the opportunity to follow the social worker code of ethics, which has a mandate for social and political advocacy.
Vandercoy was part of a council of chapter executives, a small group of chapter leaders who worked with the national organization. She said they were tasked with giving feedback about the model that put one executive director over two states, which has now been implemented.
Although the group found benefits to the model, it raised concerns about whether states would have advocacy at a strong enough level to support local chapters, among other issues, she said.
Those issues were not addressed, and she was upset when the national board chairwoman sent a letter saying they had “rigorously vetted and planned for” the new structure, Vandercoy said.
Instead, there was no open communication about the concerns raised by chapter executives, she said. One concern was the importance of having a person working in the state who is able to attend legislative hearings and to build relationships with state officials.
“This is not something to take lightly, because the relationship between the social workers in the state and our executive director is absolutely essential to get policy passed, even to know what social workers want in that state,” Vandercoy said.
 
‘A difficult time’
Evans said the reorganization that resulted in the combining of chapters is a process that’s been in the works for 10 years, part of NASW’s attempts to modernize its structure.
“Nearly three dozen chapters have been reliant on Chapter Development Funds, meaning they are not financially independent and need additional financial support from membership and national revenue to meet basic operational and chapter goals,” Evans said. “To continue being a national resource for social workers, the move to a Dual Chapter (executive director) model became financially necessary.”
Chapter executive directors, though, argue that some of the consolidated chapters were on strong financial standing and had funds in accounts that will now be rolled into the national organization.
As stories ran nationwide about NASW’s restructuring and how upset social workers were, NASW issued a Dec. 8 communication that some felt missed the point.
“While we acknowledge that this is a difficult time for NASW, we are confident that we are moving in the right direction,” board president Chase wrote in an email to members. “We intend to keep all members and staff aware of any additional changes and will continue to keep transparent, ethical, and honest communication at the forefront. Actions from Board meetings are regularly posted on the NASW website once available.”
Evans said NASW will be able to reduce spending in areas where there are financial deficits but still provide organizational resources, especially in chapters where states have fewer than 1,000 members.
 
Insurance problems
The restructure set afire smoldering tensions that began more than a year ago.
In September 2024, Preferra Insurance Co. Risk Retention Group, which offered discounted professional liability insurance to NASW members, filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., courts, where NASW is headquartered.
The lawsuit named NASW and its two subsidiary insurance companies.
Preferra alleged the three entities violated contracts that managed the way the three businesses worked together.
In case documents, Preferra also said NASW CEO Estreet and chief financial officer Sekou Murphy didn’t understand the insurance regulatory environment. The result was a disagreement between the companies about how dollars paid to NASW through the insurance program would be calculated, the filings said.
At the same time, Preferra discovered Estreet failed to disclose his criminal record while seeking approval for a seat on the company’s board.
“Preferra subsequently learned that Dr. Estreet has a criminal conviction for burglary as well as licensing issues that he did not disclose to Preferra and thus were not included in the application to (District of Columbia Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking), which requires such information to be disclosed,” the Preferra case complaint said.
NASW filings denied Preferra’s accusations, calling it a “work of fiction, intended solely to obscure the misdeeds of (Preferra CEO) Anthony Benedetto.”
Benedetto also served as CEO of NASW’s insurance companies until early in 2024, when he was dismissed, NASW said. The nonprofit’s attorneys accused Benedetto of abusing his position.
NASW said its CEO and chief financial officer asked questions about Preferra’s consolidated audited financial reports, which Benedetto and his team refused to answer.
Ultimately, the two companies settled the lawsuit and parted ways, filing a dismissal in court on July 31.
AM Best, a national insurance rating company, in October placed NASW Insurance Co. “under review with negative implications status,” according to the Insurance Journal.
The review was issued because of uncertainty regarding NASWIC’s prospective business plans to operate on a stand-alone basis,” the Journal reported.
In November, Preferra announced it was teaming up with the Council on Social Work Education to offer insurance with discounts for social workers.
NASW is developing a new product in 2026 to provide social workers with professional liability insurance at a discounted rate and membership benefit, Evans said.

Estreet’s history
As the Preferra case played out in court, social workers from around the country learned about Estreet’s criminal history. They were concerned he may not have disclosed it to the board, and many said they didn’t feel as if the organization’s leadership was transparent about what was happening.
Evans said the board did a background check on Estreet before he was hired and was aware of his criminal history, which happened when he was “practically a teenager.”
Brenda Rosen, who led the Kentucky NASW chapter until being let go in November, said that as a social worker, she believes strongly in and works with many people “living in recovery.”
She and two other social workers Kansas Reflector spoke with emphasized that they have no issues with someone who has a criminal history.
“I have so much respect for people who live in recovery, or who have committed a crime, paid their time, and are giving back, if you will, to society by being social workers,” Rosen said. “So when I say that this guy, the CEO, was being dishonest about his felonies, I take that really seriously because to me, the ethics are own it. Own it. Name it and highlight the good things you’ve done. Don’t make it look like somebody else is attacking you. Be honest.”
As social media posts percolated online, NASW’s board made a statement in September 2024 in support of Estreet and national staff.
The NASW board encouraged members to engage in “constructive and honest dialogue and to rely on official communications from NASW and its chapters for accurate information about the organization.”
 
What’s next?
NASW members are demanding accountability, and they’re hoping for stronger communications, Vandercoy said. It’s concerning that social workers may drop their membership over the situation. But the organization won’t go away, she said.
“I think in a lot of ways, NASW is too big to fail. They hold our code of ethics,” Vandercoy said. “They issue standards of practice that are rooted in research and evidence, which is also part of our code of ethics, so that, I think, continues to exist. So what does it become?”
Vandercoy was uncertain of the answer, but she is seeing states tackle the issue on their own as they are losing faith in their national association. In Nebraska, she’s been contacted by several people interested in starting some local work outside of NASW.
“For me, I’m not going to spend any time being — probably the wrong words, but jaded or angry at what’s happened,” she said. “There is too much important work to do.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Jessyca-Vandercoy-1-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-12-23 10:13:09.217197

(Photos courtesy of the Office of Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger on Tuesday announced two additional cabinet appointments, tapping longtime Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, to serve as Virginia’s next secretary of finance and public administrator Traci Deshazor as her secretary of administration, rounding out key leadership roles as she prepares to take office.
Sickles’ departure from the state legislature will also trigger a special election in the strongly Democratic House District 17, a seat that includes parts of Fairfax County, before the General Assembly is set to convene for its 2026 session next month.  
Spanberger said Sickles, a senior budget writer in the House of Delegates, will bring deep fiscal expertise and a bipartisan approach to managing the state’s finances. Deshazor, a Danville native with experience across local, state and federal government, will oversee core administrative functions ranging from elections to workforce support.
“The secretary of finance plays an essential role in guaranteeing Virginia’s long-term economic strength, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and addressing the challenges facing Virginia communities,” Spanberger said in a statement. 
She pointed to Sickles’ role as vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee and said he has worked with lawmakers of both parties to pass budgets that offered tax relief for families while supporting economic growth.
Spanberger said Sickles shares her commitment to fiscal responsibility and to ensuring taxpayer dollars are used effectively, adding that she expects him to be a key partner in her administration’s efforts to lower costs for families and secure Virginia’s long-term financial footing.
Sickles, who is completing his 22nd year representing parts of South Fairfax County, said he is looking forward to assisting Spanberger as she works to make life in Virginia more affordable. 
He said the administration must deliver results for families, young people and seniors by building budgets that reflect shared values and reduce the cost of living.
“We need to make sure every tax dollar is employed to its greatest effect for hard-working Virginians,” Sickles said, citing priorities such as keeping tuition low, expanding affordable housing, ensuring teachers are properly compensated and making quality health care accessible and affordable. 
Sickles is widely known in Richmond for his influence over health and human services spending. Since 2004, he has served on — and chaired — the House Health and Human Services Committee. He joined the Appropriations Committee in 2014 and currently chairs its Health and Human Resources Subcommittee.
He has also played a central role in budget negotiations, having been appointed to the House-Senate budget conference committee in 2018 and reappointed each year since by successive House speakers. 
Sickles currently chairs the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission and serves on several other influential panels, including the Major Employment Investment Commission, the Joint Commission on Health Care and the Governor’s Advisory Committee on Revenue Estimates.
Over his legislative career, Sickles has helped shepherd major policy changes through the General Assembly, including the transition from the federal health insurance marketplace to the Virginia Health Insurance Exchange, election administration reforms, legalization of sports betting and the creation of the Virginia Innovation Partnership Authority. 
He has also championed investments in libraries, endangered species protection and bioscience initiatives, and is the patron of a pending constitutional amendment to protect marriage equality for LGBTQ Virginians.
Alongside Sickles’ appointment, Spanberger named Deshazor as her secretary of administration, a role responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations that underpin state government.
She described Deshazor as a knowledgeable leader focused on making government work better for people at both the state and local levels.
Deshazor said her career has been centered on ensuring public institutions are effective and results-driven, and she emphasized the importance of administration as the foundation of good governance. 
“I will bring a people-first, outcomes-driven approach to strengthening Virginia’s operations, promoting transparency, and strengthening trust in government,” Deshazor said.
Deshazor brings experience from multiple levels of government. 
Most recently, as the deputy chief administrative officer for human services in Richmond, she oversaw a six-agency portfolio with more than 1,000 employees. During that time, she helped create a new Department of Neighborhood and Community Services, launched offices focused on homelessness and community services, and established a community resource and training center. 
She also served concurrently as the city’s first chief equity officer.
At the state level, Deshazor previously served as deputy secretary of the commonwealth under Govs. Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe, supervising teams responsible for core constitutional and administrative functions. 
In that role, she supported clemency efforts and contributed to actions restoring civil and voting rights to more than 300,000 Virginians and to the granting of thousands of pardons and sentence computations.
Earlier in her career, she represented Virginia as deputy director of intergovernmental affairs, working with Congress, the White House and federal agencies.
A graduate of programs at the University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Yale University, Virginia Tech and Hollins University, Deshazor lives in Richmond with her husband and said she remains committed to serving the commonwealth she has always called home.

Minnesota’s ethanol mandate, on the books for more than two decades, works against that. 
All gasoline sold in Minnesota must contain at least 10% ethanol, a fuel made from fermenting sugars from plants like corn. In 2003, ours was the first state to mandate that every gas station sells E10 blends. The federal renewable fuel standard, or RFS,  followed in 2005, requiring a certain volume of ethanol and other renewable fuels be blended into U.S. gasoline supplies, setting annual volume targets. Ethanol now accounts for nearly 45% of total corn use.   
This competing use of corn has raised its price, increasing the cost of food used as livestock feed. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that demand for ethanol has raised Americans’ total food spending by 0.8 to 2%. Another estimate suggests that corn prices were 30% greater between 2006 and 2011 as a result of the RFS mandate. As corn becomes more lucrative for farmers — and corn farms received $3.2 billion, or 30.5% of all federal farm subsidies in 2024 — cropland is diverted from other crops and livestock, raising prices for all crops. 
Ethanol mandates increase prices at the pump as well. The federal RFS adds about 30 cents per gallon to the wholesale cost of gas, on average. Consumers pay more for each gallon and use more gas because of ethanol’s lower energy content, which leads to about 3% lower fuel efficiency for E10. 
These higher prices might be justified if there was some environmental benefit, but there isn’t. Indeed, ethanol may increase carbon emissions. Ethanol production requires feedstock, the fertilizers used during growing, the fuel and energy used during refining, the milling process, and increased land use for corn, all of which generate carbon emissions. 
A 2022 study concluded that RFS expanded U.S. corn cultivation by 8.7% between 2008 and 2016 and suggests that ethanol’s carbon intensity is likely “at least 24% higher” than gasoline after accounting for land use changes. 
Once indirect land-use effects are considered, ethanol can have twice the greenhouse gas emissions as gasoline. A 2015 study suggests that the RFS’ overreliance on corn ethanol has resulted in “unmet targets for cutting air pollution, water contamination and soil erosion.” Another study points out that that emissions from burning ethanol contain more ozone precursors than emissions from gasoline, with adverse respiratory health effects when released at ground level. Ethanol also demands water, uses fertilizers that leech nitrogen into surrounding waterways, and encourages unsustainable land management practices that lead to soil erosion. 
None of this is the fault of Minnesota farmers, who operate under the incentives that the state and federal government have put into place. 
Policymakers in St. Paul and Washington, D.C., bear the responsibility of fixing these incentives.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)For Alaska’s fishing industry and fishing-dependent communities, 2025 was a year of turmoil and uncertainty, much of it imposed by ideological pursuits from the new Trump administration.
The short-lived agency called the Department of Government Efficiency hacked away at federal funding for science across the board. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in particular was in its crosshairs; the Heritage Institute’s Project 2025 blueprint for the second Trump administration heaped scorn on NOAA, saying its National Weather Service, National Marine Fisheries Service and other agencies “form a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity.” The NMFS’ Alaska Fisheries Science Center, which does the bulk of the research on which fishery managers depend, was among the agencies that suffered deep budget and staffing cuts. 
The prospect of more cuts is unsettling, some officials said. “I guess now we’re getting to a point that I’m getting really concerned and almost freaked out about how much data that we’re potentially losing that we’re used to having,” Anne Vanderhoeven, a member of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, said on Dec. 4 during that body’s December meeting.
Even as the Trump administration cuts the support fishery management, it is demanding that the industry harvest more fish, in line with an administrative order issued by the president on April 17.
The federal government shutdown created more problems for fisheries managers, but the North Pacific Fishery Management Council used data from last year to set next year’s harvest limits for Alaska pollock — the nation’s top-volume commercial seafood — and other groundfish in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.

	Alaska’s seafood industry continues to endure a variety of economic challenges — competition in markets that are glutted, rising costs, declines of some important fish stock and labor shortages, among them. There are fewer people harvesting seafood commercially in Alaska than at any time on record.
Alaska legislators have tried to address some of those woes. A legislative task force made numerous recommendations about financial systems, marketing, industry diversification, workforce development and other subjects. Those recommendations produced a series of bills. Two of them passed during the 2025 session, gaining unanimous support, but Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed one of them, which would have shored up the Alaska Commercial Fishing and Agriculture Bank. The Legislature has the opportunity to address the subject again in the coming session.
The Dunleavy administration ran into trouble with two of its other fishery-related efforts. The governor introduced a bill that would legalize salmon farming, which is widely disdained in the state. The bill went nowhere. The administration is also continuing to try to overturn federal subsistence management on federal sections of the Kuskokwim River, but it has lost in court so far.
There were some notable improvements in 2025.
Bering Sea snow crab stocks are starting to rebound after a massive crash that closed harvests for two years, the first. However, there has been a puzzling boom in the number of snow-tanner crab hybrids. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game is treating the hybrids as snow crabs for harvest-management purposes.
The overall salmon harvest was much bigger and more lucrative than last year’s dismal totals. Bristol Bay reds were not as small as last year’s record tiny fish, and the region also had a bigger run than predicted. However, salmon runs in the Yukon River continue to be poor.
But trouble is brewing in the marine and freshwater environments that support fish.
In areas of thawing permafrost, particularly Northwestern Alaska, a phenomenon called “rusting rivers,” has released such high levels of metals that conditions at times are toxic for fish. The thaw creates acid rock drainage, similar to the type of pollution that can come from hardrock mining. Iron and other metals that are freed through the process turn clear waters orange or red. The problem is serious enough to have merited a chapter in this year’s Arctic Report Card, issued on Dec. 16 by NOAA.

	Alaska scientists have also confirmed that invasive northern pike, a bane to native salmon runs in Southcentral Alaska, can swim across Cook Inlet to colonize new territory. The freshwater pike, which gobble up salmon fry and other fish, are too entrenched in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough to be eradicated from waterways there. Biologists have been working to keep Kenai Peninsula pike-free and believed they were successful in 2018, until scientists discovered that pike are able to survive the relatively short swim through the inlet’s saltwater into new freshwater sites. The eradication work has continued, and state biologists believe the peninsula is again pike-free.
Another looming threat comes from the south. Resource managers with the Metlakatla Indian Community, the tribal government in Alaska’s most southeastern spot, have been battling what its officials term an “explosion” of invasive European green crabs. The first Alaska discovery of the invasive crabs, which can devastate native fish stocks, was in 2022 in the Metlakatla area. At first, there were only a few shells. But this year, workers in the tribal program trapped more than 40,000 of the crabs, which have been steadily expanding north.

A mental health clinician with a bullet-proof vest is helping change the way a Bay Area city responds to some of its emergency calls.
That’s what CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich found when she visited the San Mateo Police Department earlier this month to check out a new approach for mental health calls. 
The city was one of many that searched for a better way to help people in the throes of a mental health crisis. It participated in a 2021 pilot program from San Mateo County that paired law enforcement officers with mental health clinicians in four cities with the aim of freeing up police officers and avoiding unnecessary confrontations. 
Rather than police officers having to decide whether to arrest a person, send them to a hospital for a hold or leave them to their own devices, a paired clinician was deployed to provide additional measures such as safety planning, follow-up calls and community mental health resources. 
“I fill in the gaps,” said San Mateo Police Department mental health clinician Briana Fair, who builds relationships with people she calls clients and joins officers on some emergency calls.
Known as a “co-responder model,” the pilot appeared to work: Involuntary holds decreased about 17% and it reduced the chances of future mental health calls to 911, according to a new study by Stanford University. By reducing the number of involuntary detentions, researchers also estimated that the cities saved as much as $800,000 a year on health costs.

Mariela Ruiz-Angel, director of Alternative Response Initiatives at Georgetown Law’s Center for Innovations in Community Safety: “The idea was never about taking cops out of the equation altogether. The idea was that we don’t have to center them as the main response of 911. We don’t have to make public safety about cops. Public safety is about the appropriate response.”

Since the end of the two-year pilot, nearly all of San Mateo County cities have rolled out the co-responder model. Cities that participated in the pilot also found a way to sustain the program, including the police department in the city of San Mateo, which currently employs Fair and another part-time clinician.

Gun suicides in rural California

In rural California — where medical and mental health care can be hard to come by — firearm suicides particularly among older men are rattling communities and families who have been left behind, reports CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
Rural counties in Northern California have some of the country’s highest rates of gun suicides among older adults. In Trinity County, for example, at least eight men 70 and older died from an apparent firearm suicide between 2020 and 2024. Over the course of 15 years, the gun suicide rate of adults in this age group in seven northern counties, including Trinity, was more than triple the statewide rate. 
In addition to owning more guns, residents in these areas have more limited access to medical and mental health services. When these services are farther away, people often remain in pain for longer because of missed or delayed appointments. In California, more than half of people 70 and over who died by gun suicide had a contributing physical health problem, and over a quarter had a diagnosed mental health condition.

Jake Ritter, on the death of his 81-year-old grandfather, Jeffrey Butler, who had health and pain issues and died in Trinity County in 2024 from a self-inflicted gunshot: “I’m sad that he didn’t get the help that he needed, and I’m sad that he felt so strongly that this is the road that he chose.”

New law to prevent sex abuse at schools

By July 2026 all California K-12 schools — including private schools — must have protocols in place to help protect schoolchildren from being sexually abused by educators, as directed by a new state law, writes CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
The law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, requires schools to enact a number of measures to rein in abuse and hold themselves accountable, including training students, teachers and other school staff to recognize signs of sexual grooming and report misconduct. 
The law’s most notable provision is the creation of a database that keeps track of teachers credibly accused of abuse. The database will be available to schools so that administrators can use it to vet prospective teachers. The database is intended to curb the practice of schools re-hiring teachers who have resigned from another school after being accused of sexual misconduct.

The law creates an array of measures to educate school staff, beef up reporting requirements and stop teachers credibly accused of abuse from getting jobs at other districts.


Facing a mountain of lawsuits, California K-12 schools will have a system in place beginning this year to prevent teachers and other staff from sexually abusing students.
A new California law creates an array of measures to educate school staff, beef up reporting requirements and stop teachers credibly accused of abuse from getting jobs at other districts.
The law, Senate Bill 848, goes into effect Jan. 1 and schools must have protocols in place by July. The law applies to all schools, including private schools.
“I’m proud to see this bill move forward. It’s been really personal for me,” state Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, the bill’s author, told CalMatters after it passed. “For survivors, this is an important step toward justice.”
Avalanche of lawsuits
The law stems from a previous California law that made it easier for victims to sue school districts and counties. Under AB 218, which went into effect in 2020, victims can file suit until age 40 or even older if they didn’t remember being abused until later in life. That’s led to an avalanche of lawsuits and much greater public awareness of the scope of the problem.
So far, victims have filed more than 1,000 lawsuits against school districts and counties, with some resulting in enormous payouts. A jury in Riverside County in 2023 handed Moreno Valley Unified a $135 million verdict over abuse allegations, and Los Angeles Unified faces more than $500 million in claims. 
Overall, California schools face nearly $3 billion in sex abuse claims from former students, according to the Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, a state agency that helps school districts with financial matters. Some of the incidents occurred decades ago, as early as the 1940s, and some of the payouts have been so large that they’ve led districts to financial insolvency.
School accountability
While the new law doesn’t address the lawsuits, it does institute measures intended to stop future abuse and hold schools more accountable. It requires schools to write comprehensive policies on appropriate behavior, and train students, teachers, coaches and other school staff on recognizing and reporting misconduct. It also broadens the number of staff who are required to report abuse allegations.
Perhaps the most noteworthy requirement is creating a database of teachers credibly accused of abuse. The database, to be administered by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, will be available to schools during their hiring processes. The aim is to stop teachers who’ve abused students from quitting and getting rehired elsewhere, only to abuse more students. Teachers who’ve been cleared of wrongdoing will be removed from the database.
Pérez, a Democrat from Alhambra, said she was inspired to author the new law after reading about generations of abuse at Rosemead High School, which is in her district. She also told CaMatters that she was the victim of a teacher’s unwanted attention when she was in high school. 
“There are now dollars and cents being assigned to these cases,” she said in September. “It’s really opened up this conversation about what can we do to better prevent this abuse from happening.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/051122-School-MG-CM-29.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:58:23.863632
,California,2025-12-23 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Mayor Bass got some of LA’s homeless people indoors. Will it matter to voters?,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/la-mayor-bass-homelessness-reelection/,Homelessness numbers in Los Angeles are down but not enough for many voters to notice. It's also no longer the main issue of Karen Bass's reelection bid.,"Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass staked her political future on a promise: As a candidatein 2022, she vowed to make homelessness her top priority and to make dramaticreductions in the city’s population of unhoused people.
She won the campaign. To deliver on that promise, her first act as mayor was to sign Executive Directive 1, which was intended to streamline the construction of affordable housing and to signal the new administration’s urgency on the issue. She also rolled out Inside Safe, a program that breaks up homeless encampments and offers a safe alternative to those living inside them.
Three years later, as she enters the final year of her first term and embarks on hercampaign for re-election, Bass can point to real achievements in the homeless area, but shebattles a difficult perception problem: What if the number of homeless people in Los Angeles is down but not enough so that most Angelenos feel the problem is being solved?
There is evidence of progress. According to the mayor’s office, Inside Safe hasconducted 117 operations since Bass launched it, and it has brought 5,496 people infrom the streets. Of those, 1,321 have made their way to permanent housing. Othershave found temporary shelter or, sadly, have returned to the streets.
How much progress?
Against a citywide homeless population of more than 40,000 people, thosenumbers may seem incremental, but they are helping to reverse years of neglect. Thenumber of unsheltered homeless people — the focus of Bass’s work — has declined by17.5% since the mayor took office, according to the county’s annual count.
Austin Beutner, the former Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent who sofar is Bass’s most serious challenger in the mayor’s race, questions the numbers andclaims of progress. 
(Disclosure: I worked as a senior editor and columnist for the L.A. Times when Beutner was its publisher in 2014-15.)
Beutner points to a recent study by the RAND Corp. that sounded skeptical about Los Angeles County’s annual homeless count, suggesting it may significantly underestimate the extent of the area’s unhoused population.
The RAND study pointed to a rise in the number of so-called “rough sleepers,” peoplewho sleep on the street without even a tent or car which, it said, has caused the county’sannual homeless count to become increasingly inaccurate. That’s in part because rough sleepers are difficult to find and include in official tallies.
RAND attempted to check the county’s numbers by focusing on three areas — Venice,Hollywood and Skid Row — and comparing its count to the one produced by the LosAngeles Homeless Services Agency.
The results, according to RAND, suggest that LAHSA is missing large numbers of unsheltered people. But even the RAND report noted that the number of people without shelter in its study areas was falling, sometimes dramatically.
In 2024, RAND found, the number of people without housing in its study area dropped by 15%.In Hollywood, the decline was 49%.
That’s not enough to declare victory against the scourge of homelessness, but it’shardly the basis for declaring failure.
Complicating matters further are the relentless facts of politics and the strains theyput on any holder of the LA mayor’s office. No matter how much a mayor sets out toconcentrate on a single issue, life intervenes, throwing up new challenges anddistractions.
In Bass’s case, the past year sent two big ones her way: the wildfires that destroyedlarge swaths of the Pacific Palisades, within Bass’s area of responsibility, and Altadena,outside it. And then there was President Donald Trump’s decision to turn Los Angelesinto the testing ground for his demonization of immigrants and militarization of Americanlife.
A shifting focus
Either of those could have upended Bass’s focus on homelessness, and it’s true that newscoverage of the mayor has largely moved off the issue that brought her to office.
As she enters her re-election campaign, critics are more likely to focus on her halting reply tothe fires, while supporters point most eagerly to her dogged resistance to Trump.In political terms, both issues may prove offsetting, as the fires highlighted what someregard as the mayor’s administrative weaknesses while the Trump assault remindedvoters she has served as a bulwark against a deeply reviled president and hislegion of not-very-bright minions.
As 2026 opens, the Palisades are rebuilding, and the troops dispatched by Trump to putdown non-existent riots have returned to homes and bases.
Homelessness persists.

That then frames a central question of this mayor’s race: Has Bass done enough toaddress the shameful reality of a city that boasts extravagant wealth and yet tens of thousands of its people sleep without shelter?
That, too, is politically complicated, in part because measuring the problem is only onepiece of its politics. It may not be enough for Bass to tell voters that they should behappy with the city’s progress, because the annual count shows the problem slowlyebbing or because RAND found huge progress in Hollywood.
What really matters is how most people come into contact with homelessness. In that sense, homelessness as a political issue resembles inflation. It does little good for a politician to tell voters that they should be happy with the economy if they’re not.
Joe Biden learned that the hard way, and Trump is busy learning it today. Everytime President Trump dismisses “affordability” as a “hoax” or a Democratic scheme, it backfires with voters who feel pressed by rising prices or stagnant wages.
Hence Trump’s march into the dark abyss of public disapproval.
Similarly, it’s not enough for Bass to insist that fewer people are homeless than werethree years ago, if voters don’t sense that for themselves. If there’s an encampment onthe corner, it hardly matters that there are 49% fewer unhoused men and women inHollywood. Homelessness still feels present.
That may turn out to be this campaign’s wildcard. If voters feel that their ownneighborhoods are better, it will land as proof that Bass is making headway anddeserves four more years to complete the work she began with Executive Directive 1.
If not, Beutner or some other candidate may get the chance to finish what she started.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/092624-Karen-Bass-Homeless-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C673&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:58:23.863632

Ashley McClure
Ashley McClure is an East Bay physician who cofounded Climate Health Now



For nine years, I’ve practiced primary care medicine in the East Bay, taking care of people from all walks of life. Lately, I’ve noticed a troubling pattern in my exam rooms: more young people needing asthma inhalers, more middle-aged patients developing new seasonal allergies that get worse every year as temperatures rise, and more elderly patients struggling through wildfire season and heat waves. 
I’ve watched parents miss work to care for children whose asthma flares up during poor air quality days. I’ve counseled pregnant women about the risks of air pollution exposure. 
These aren’t just statistics in a medical journal. They’re my patients — real people whose health is suffering because of oil and gas-related pollution and the global warming it’s causing.  
We know that fossil fuel related air pollution is responsible for 1 out of 5 deaths worldwide each year. As a physician, I strongly oppose the Trump administration’s proposed plan to give private corporations leases for new oil and gas drilling on our public and federal lands in 17 California counties, up and down the state.
Trump’s Bureau of Land Management is preparing new resource management plans that could pave the way for expanded oil and gas drilling across more than one million acres of California public lands — from the San Joaquin Valley all the way up the Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area. The recent draft of the Environmental Impact Report kicked off a 30-day public comment period when the public can get involved. (It’s a Scroogey timing, to be sure).
This plan is the next front in President Donald Trump’s full-fledged assault on our public lands and the next step in his “drill, baby, drill” agenda. If approved, this plan could lock in decades of new toxic oil drilling in wild spaces that should be open to all, or near frontline communities who already live with the deadly impacts of air pollution, water contamination, and environmental injustice. 
This year California’s air quality report card shows a failing grade for many counties, with 98% of the state’s population experiencing unhealthy air at some point during the year, according to the American Lung Association’s “State of the Air” 2025 report. It will absolutely get worse if we allow the Trump administration’s land management plans to move forward.  
Public lands belong to all Americans. They should promote our health, not undermine it. These are the places families visit to breathe clean air, where watersheds begin, where ecosystems provide natural buffers against climate impacts.  
With enough political opposition we can absolutely stop Trump and his oil lobby besties from pillaging and plundering our natural public lands. Objectors just did it in the Southeast USin late October. Concerned environmentalists and some Republican stakeholders who were worried offshore drilling would harm tourism were successful in protecting their waters. 
Now it’s our turn. This is the moment for California’s elected leaders to stand up and fiercely oppose the plans Trump and his oily campaign funders before the drilling starts. 
Our public lands should be a source of health, recreation, and resilience; not another source of the dirty pollution making my patients sick. Protecting public lands from oil and gas drilling isn’t just environmental policy; it’s preventive medicine. It’s choosing a future where I spend less time treating pollution-related illness and more time helping patients thrive.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/070723-Yosemite-National-Park-MG-CM-15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:58:23.863632

Re: How Gavin Newsom’s CARE Court lost its teeth in the California Legislature
The recent CalMatters article on how California’s CARE Court evolved in the Legislatureprovides in-depth coverage of the challenges counties face implementing constrained policy.
The California Association of Public Administrators, Public Guardians, and Public Conservators(CA PA|PG|PC) represents county officials who serve individuals with the most serious mentalillness, often when no family or support system is available.  Our members see the gap betweenCARE Court’s intent and real-world application.
Narrow diagnostic criteria, difficulty locating people experiencing unsheltered homelessness,and assumptions about outcomes all present obstacles. 
CARE Court is funded and can produce positive results in some cases. But failing CARE Court should not be treated as an automatic path to LPS conservatorship: the burden of proof remains high, and many people may not succeed in CARE Court for reasons unrelated to their ability to survive safely.

Maura Healey’s agenda around energy issues.,"THE CLIMATE STORY written in Massachusetts this year was, depending on your perspective, an instant classic or a nightmare. 
It had intrigue. It had personalities. It had political posturing. And it sure had long-term repercussions for the Bay State’s vision of a green economy and its preparations for the impacts of climate change. 
2025 started with a turbocharged shakeup of the climate and energy landscape. After taking office in January, President Trump quickly used his power to pull funding for clean energy and energy efficiency initiatives and to stop additional offshore wind permits. 
Many Massachusetts residents also saw their winter gas bills skyrocket, prompting widespread anger and calls for relief. Elected officials began shifting the discourse – and their attention – toward energy affordability, which opened up an intense debate about the cause of the high costs. The Department of Public Utilities, in fact, recently opened an investigation into all charges on gas and electric bills. 
Those frustrations drove Gov. Maura Healey’s agenda around energy issues the rest of the year as she fashioned herself as an “all of the above” supporter on energy. And these dynamics teed up a host of policy fights as the state looks to thread an increasingly delicate needle: how to meet rising power demand, bring down utility bills, and meet the ambitious climate commitments that require dramatically cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  
CommonWealth Beacon chronicled these storylines and more throughout the year. Here is your 2025 climate and energy recap. 
Healey’s energy affordability bill 
Healey’s main vehicle for addressing the state’s high energy costs that drew outrage last winter is the energy affordability bill she filed in May. The legislation seeks to empower the Department of Public Utilities to remove charges from bills, bring more energy onto the grid, remove barriers to the development of nuclear power, and change how Mass Save is financed. 
What came next rattled Beacon Hill, brought advocates swarming to the State House, and divided the Democratic supermajority.  
CommonWealth Beacon exclusively reported on a plan hatched by Rep. Mark Cusack, the Democratic chair of the House energy committee, to use Healey’s legislation to weaken the state’s 2030 climate commitments in the name of energy affordability. Cusack also proposed cutting the Mass Save budget and reducing the amount of renewable energy that utilities are required to procure. Cusack, who received campaign donations from the utilities right around the time he filed his bill, then pushed the measure through his committee in the final days of session before House leadership ultimately punted the issue to next year. 
Insurance 
What’s happening in the insurance industry is increasingly a climate story since insurers are the ultimate arbiters of risk.  
As home insurers raise rates and end policies in the face of growing climate risk and high rebuilding costs due to inflation and tariffs, new data show that more Massachusetts homeowners are enrolling in the insurer of last resort, or the FAIR Plan. Last year saw the first single-year increase in FAIR Plan policies since 2017 and the largest jump in two decades after high nonrenewal rates in 2023 likely drove more people to look elsewhere for home coverage. 
There are also significant changes when it comes to flood insurance, which is typically not covered under a home insurance policy and is a market largely run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. New flood maps across the state threaten to place more residents in the flood zone, requiring them to buy additional insurance. And in Boston, flood-prone residents have had to pay an additional $785,000 in flood insurance charges since 2021 because the city missed its goal to join a FEMA program that offers discounts on premiums — triggering new urgency from city councilors.  
Energy supply in Trump 2.0 
Offshore wind across the Northeast stalled in 2025 under a Republican trifecta in Washington that was ushered in by last year’s election. Trump started the year by threatening to stop wind projects already under construction and swiftly took action to block new permits, and ended the year on a similar note, this time taking aim at Vineyard Wind, the lone offshore wind project currently delivering power to Massachusetts. The Healey administration also proposed to delay a statutory offshore wind procurement requirement intended to keep the state on track to meet its climate commitments.  
Struggles in the offshore wind industry also showed up in other ways: Shortly after Trump took office, a wind cable manufacturing company pulled its project despite winning state support. And CommonWealth Beacon reported that no company has claimed $35 million in state offshore wind tax credits offered in 2023 and 2024, even before Trump had returned to the White House. 
The Trump administration also targeted solar power, canceling $156 million in solar funding for Massachusetts. There is one bright spot, though. The delayed Hydro-Quebec line bringing hydropower from Quebec into New England is on track to start delivering power next year. 
Resilience 
Healey’s other big environmental legislative package unveiled this year is her nearly $3 billion bond bill, which will likely see action in the Legislature in 2026. The measure seeks to improve bridges, dams, culverts, and other critical pieces of infrastructure to better guard against floods, streamline restoration projects, and create a fund to finance similar initiatives in the future.  
The bill would also force Massachusetts property owners for the first time to disclose their flood history when selling. The Bay State is one of just 14 that doesn’t require flood risk disclosures. The proposal is widely praised as one that will provide prospective homebuyers with the information they need to evaluate the flood risk of a property, but there’s concern that the influential real estate industry could serve as a roadblock to the provision.  
The state is confronting the complications of flooding in other ways, too, and going directly at what once was a third rail. Environmental officials are formally calling on Massachusetts to establish a voluntary buyout program for residential properties at risk of being consumed by rising seas.  
Massachusetts regulators didn’t enforce their own climate rule 
CommonWealth Beacon reported exclusively on court documents filed earlier this year that show that state agencies didn’t follow a 2017 climate rule and that the state Department of Environmental Protection didn’t enforce it, either. The rule requires agencies to report on and reduce the emissions of their state-owned vehicles, but the DEP said in court filings connected to a lawsuit that the state brought against Exxon that they haven’t received any such agency reports and didn’t take any enforcement action to comply with the regulation. 
The rule came about in response to a landmark lawsuit brought by the Conservation Law Foundation and other groups, in which a court in 2016 found that the state needed to issue more specific regulations to meet the 2050 climate commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10_14-Tepper_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:58:23.863632

(File)The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals Friday upheld a lower court’s dismissal of a lawsuit that alleged that inmates were being forced to labor in involuntary servitude in violation of the state constitution.
The three plaintiffs, currently incarcerated by the Alabama Department of Corrections, said in the lawsuit that they were assigned additional work duties without pay and lost phone and canteen access; visitation hours and good-time credits, while receiving unfavorable disciplinary reports.
The court affirmed the Montgomery Circuit Court’s decision, which found the plaintiffs that court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to decide the issue and that the people currently incarcerated lacked standing to file the complaint because they have not accrued any correctional incentive time that they could lose.

“None of the other punishments the prisoners alleged … constitute involuntary servitude because they do not involve the use of physical coercion, the threat of physical coercion, or the use of or the threat of coercion through law or the legal process,” the ruling states.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs criticized the decision.
“We’re deeply disappointed in this decision,” said C.J. Sandley, senior staff attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, who is representing the plaintiffs. “The court failed to recognize that punishing incarcerated people for refusing to work indeed violates the state constitution’s ban on involuntary servitude and slavery. Our courageous clients will continue to fight for the rights of incarcerated workers.”
Alabama voters in 2022 approved a wide-ranging recompilation of the 1901 Constitution that struck out a passage allowing slavery or involuntary servitude “otherwise than for the punishment of crime, of which the party shall have been duly convicted.”
The plaintiffs are part of a voluntary work release program that pays them while also assisting with “housekeeping” duties in their respective prisons, from cleaning the cells and picking up garbage to working in the cafeteria.
The lawsuit alleges that ADOC punished them for refusing to work and arriving late for work, as well as “complaining about unsafe working conditions.” The plaintiffs argued that EO 725, an executive order from Gov. Kay Ivey outlining rules for correctional incentive time, and AR 403, a modification of those rules by ADOC Commissioner John Hamm, violated the new constitutional language adopted in 2022.
“The prisoners assert that EO 725 and AR 403 violate Article I, § 32, of the current Alabama Constitution because, the prisoners allege, ‘they require and enforce slavery and involuntary servitude,’” the ruling states.
The Montgomery Circuit Court ruled in favor of the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, which argued that the case should be dismissed because the court did not have jurisdiction to decide the matter, and that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they did not have correctional incentive credits to challenge.
The appeals court said the term “involuntary servitude” means “a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury, or by the use or threat of coercion through law or the legal process.”
“None of the punishments the prisoners alleged were imposed by EO 725 and AR 403 for the prisoners’ refusal to work involved physical acts or the threat of physical acts to compel them to work,” the ruling states. “There were no allegations that the prisoners would be beaten or otherwise physically abused if they refused to work or that they would be threatened with physical harm if they refused to work. Moreover, the prisoners did not allege that they would be coerced through law or the legal process if they refused to work.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Gate-2019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

(Photo: Getty Images)Northern Nevada’s state-run behavioral health system is heavily reliant on contracted workers as it continues to struggle to fill its vacant positions, lawmakers were told last week.
Managers from the state Department of Human Services appeared before the Interim Finance Committee to request the transfer of $1.8 million from its personnel budget line, which covers employee salaries, to its professional services budget line, which covers people working under contracts.
Julie Lindesmith, the manager for Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services, told lawmakers the agency has been unable to fill vacancies for licensed professionals.
NNAMHS’ overall employee vacancy rate is 31%, which they’ve brought down from 36% two years ago. However, the vacancy rate for psychiatric nurse positions is 50%, and the vacancy rate for licensed clinical social workers is 55%.
“We have been making great successes in recruiting,” said Lindesmith. “In fact, we even had a psychiatrist come over from contract to a state position. However, it is still difficult to hire psychiatric nurses and licensed clinical social workers.”
As a result, contracted positions are needed to maintain required staffing ratios.
The money transferred by IFC is expected to cover contracted workers until February. NNAMHS is expected to have to appear before the legislative money committee again in April, as it is projecting a budget shortfall. But Lindesmith told lawmakers the agency is attempting to find budget savings.
No internal wage study has been conducted to compare the state’s salary and benefits to other employers within the industry, according to Lindesmith. Recruitment efforts have included community outreach events and mailing flyers to everybody on the state’s licensure list.
Contract workers earn a higher hourly wage but do not receive employee benefits. Lindesmith said many only work one or two days a week for the state. Some who do work 40 hours prefer a schedule (like working four 10-hour shifts) that the state cannot offer due to its collective bargaining agreement.
The Department of Human Services currently has an overall vacancy rate around 15%, according to its website.
Within the department, the Division of Child and Family Services has the highest vacancy rate: 24%. The Division of Public and Behavioral Health, which includes NNAMHS, has a vacancy rate of 21%. The Division of Social Services has the lowest vacancy rate: 9.7%.
Over half of the vacancies across the department are in positions related to medical, health, social services or rehabilitation. Along with psychiatric nurses, mental health technicians, mental health counselors, family services specialists and social workers are listed as the positions with the highest vacancies.
The State of Nevada has been working to lower its employee vacancy rate across all departments and has seen success. Gov. Joe Lombardo announced lowering the vacancy rate as a priority when he took office in 2023 and quickly issued several executive orders aimed at reducing barriers to state employment. Retention bonuses were also awarded to employees that year.

Businesses and Missouri lawmakers are scrambling to understand what will happen in November, when new federal limits on intoxicating hemp products go into effect.
It’s unclear just how proactive the federal government will be enforcing the new restrictions. Will it clamp down, or like it has with marijuana, look the other way as states enact their own rules?  
To add to the uncertainty, President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to loosen federal restrictions on marijuana. That action could impact whether or not the feds choose to enforce hemp products as well, according to a congressional report.
Amidst the swirling questions, several Missouri lawmakers have pre-filed bills for the upcoming legislative session that begins in January to establish state regulations on intoxicating hemp products. 
Not all of the Missouri proposals include the federal THC limit in their definitions of hemp, which will take effect Nov. 12 and was included in a  federal spending package approved by Congress and signed by the president in November. 
One proposal that does align with the federal restrictions comes from Republican state Sen. David Gregory of Chesterfield, and it would regulate intoxicating hemp the same as marijuana. That would essentially ban current hemp products, because marijuana must be grown in Missouri and most hemp currently is grown outside of the state. It would also require hemp products to be sold in licensed cannabis dispensaries, where most are currently sold in gas stations, liquor stores and restaurants and smoke shops. 
Republican state Rep. Matthew Overcast of Ava said he has “no concerns” about the federal language impacting the hemp industry. He plans on continuing to push his proposed constitutional amendment that would overturn the current regulatory framework for the cannabis industry and instead allow marijuana and intoxicating hemp products to be sold in the same stores as alcohol and tobacco. 
“Historically, there’s been this softened congressional enforcement of our federally illicit marijuana programs that have regulated programs across the nation,” he said. “Even if the language were to stand, I don’t see — outside of big marijuana continuing to try to influence congressional and state legislators and state agencies — that we’re going to see federal enforcement on hemp.”
Democratic state Sen. Karla May of St. Louis pre-filed a bill that would allow intoxicating hemp products to continue to be sold outside of dispensaries with a $1,000 registration fee annually. Her bill does not include the federal definition, she said, because it was drafted before the spending package went through. May called her bill a “starting point.”
Through it all, intoxicating hemp businesses — along with companies that assist them — are trying to figure out what their future might look like. 
“Think about your bank, your payroll company, your merchant processor — they may not want to wait out the 365 days,” said Jessica Velazquez, a Las Vegas-based accountant with Beach Fleishman, during a November webinar for hemp businesses. “They may take a more conservative approach and say, ‘Hey, you know, this really is like [marijuana] and maybe we don’t want to service you anymore’ in the way that they currently are now.’”
 What is the law?

Hemp and marijuana are essentially terms the government uses to distinguish between the part of the cannabis plant that has high amounts of THC.
Hemp has previously been defined as any part of the plant containing 0.3% or less delta-9 THC by dry weight.
Last month, a provision in the federal spending bill amended the definition of hemp, changing the limit to a total THC concentration of less than .3% on a dry weight basis, rather than only delta-9 THC. It also prohibits products from containing more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container.
The changes address some of the concerns Congress heard from groups like the Cannabis Regulators Association, which represents state marijuana regulators across the nation.
The association submitted information to Congress in a 2023 report stating that many hemp businesses are selling “THCA hemp” flower, or buds, containing less than 0.3% delta-9 THC. 
“However, cannabis plants produce THCA, not THC,” the report states. 
(Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).
When the plant is smoked, the THCA converts or decarboxylates into delta-9 THC – and that’s why every state marijuana program defines THC in terms of both THCA and delta-9 THC, regulators said.  
THCA products – including flower, vape cartridges and concentrates – are “indistinguishable” from marijuana products sold in dispensaries, the association stated.
And that’s why, regulators argued, there was a need to add language about total THC, instead of only delta-9.
Regarding weight, the association told Congress that the threshold of 0.3% delta-9 THC by weight is a small amount of THC in a hemp plant. However, when applied to things like chocolate bars or beverages that can weigh significantly more, 0.3% by weight can amount to hundreds of milligrams of THC.
The association gave the example of a 50-gram chocolate bar at 0.3% THC would have around 150 mg of THC — 30 times the standard 5 mg THC dose established by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. A family sized pack of cookies weighing 20 oz can contain around 1,700 mg of THC using the 0.3% THC threshold.
“The whole question was: what is hemp and what is marijuana?” said Jack Cardetti, spokesman for the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association. “There was not a bright line there, and it was a line that obviously some bad actors have used to push intoxicating products that were completely unregulated.”
The lack of government oversight on these products makes them a public health risk, Cardetti said. Now there is a “clear bright line,” he said, and he believes a majority of Missouri lawmakers will want to align with the federal definition.
The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee stated the changes were made to prevent “the unregulated sale of intoxicating” hemp products.
A report from the Congressional Research Service released this month states that it “remains to be seen” whether the FDA will opt to try and remove the products from the market or not.
The FDA and DEA, in coordination with the Department of Justice, “have a range of civil and criminal remedies they may use in efforts to exercise control over these activities,” it states.
It also says these federal agencies, “may lack the resources to broadly enforce the laws prohibiting intoxicating hemp products on the market.”
Congress may also choose to exercise oversight over federal enforcement priorities regarding state-regulated cannabis activities, the report says. It took that step with medical marijuana, when it prohibited spending money on enforcement.
“Congress can say that, ‘FDA and DEA, we prohibit you from using federal dollars to enforce against state-compliant hemp programs,’” said Craig Small, a Denver-based cannabis attorney. 
With the federal limits, Small said hemp companies could run into the same banking and tax issues that marijuana companies do — where there are no business tax deductions allowed and banks largely won’t take them as customers. 
How much priority federal agencies need to put on enforcing hemp-derived products seemed to be a “subtext” of Trump’s executive order to reschedule marijuana, Small said. 
It ordered his administration to work with Congress to develop a framework that permits full-spectrum CBD products, which have a trace amount of THC. Those products “will once again be controlled as marijuana,” under the federal spending bill’s provision, the executive order states. 
However, it also states the regulatory framework should preserve Congress’ “intent to restrict the sale of products that pose serious health risks.”
And it orders federal health agencies to “develop research methods and models utilizing real-world evidence to improve access to hemp-derived cannabinoid products.” 
“It does signal to the industry that if we were on a DEFCON 1 before, we’re now on DEFCON 3,” Small said. “Whatever arguments law enforcement want to make on a federal or state level about the danger of these products and how serious it is that we get them off the streets, I do think that’s lessened a little bit with these instructions.”
 Lawmakers weigh in

This will be the fourth year in a row that Missouri lawmakers have attempted to regulate intoxicating hemp products, with previous debates ending in stalemates. 
May said she’s planning on sitting down with Gregory to talk about how to move forward this legislative session. 
“We really want to solve the issue,” May said. “That’s the key, so I want to make sure that everybody’s on the same page saying the same thing.”
Under May’s bill, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services would be tasked with establishing rules on potency limits, recall procedures of dangerous products, advertising standards and “create mechanisms for compliance and enforcement.”
May led a seven-hour bipartisan filibuster in April against a bill similar to Gregory’s, after arguing it was nothing more than an attempt by the marijuana industry to stomp out its competition. 
“It reminds me so much of a street drug war,” May said during an April Senate floor debate. “All drugs have always been about distribution and territory. And this is no different.”
Sen. Karla May, a Democrat from St. Louis, debates an intoxicating hemp bill by Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, in the Missouri Senate in April (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The department has previously put a high price tag on proposals that create separate rules for intoxicating hemp and marijuana products. 
Republican state Rep. Dave Hinman of O’Fallon led a similar effort as May to license hemp business during the last legislative session, but he said he will file a bill that aligns with the new federal definition.
Overcast’s constitutional amendment would replace the marijuana legalization amendment approved by voters in 2022 with language that instructs Missouri lawmakers to create regulations that are no more burdensome than what we already have for alcohol and tobacco. 
The amendment is nearly identical to four initiative petitions filed in September and bankrolled by American Shaman owner Vince Sanders and some other major hemp business owners. While the petitions have been approved to circulate for signatures, the effort has been put on pause, said Eapen Thampy, a lobbyist for American Shaman.
“Although we were successful at securing some commitments,” Thampy said, “it wasn’t to the level where we felt comfortable moving forward with a full fledged signature campaign.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Slaphappy-Hemp-scaled-e1762889871439-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

(Screenshot of Colleton County government livestream)Information is emerging about the massive data center that is proposed near Green Pond in Colleton County by Eagle Rock Partners.
The project got its first public airing in a zoning meeting Dec. 18. This Colleton proposal has significant implications for policies that must be enacted to protect the public interest throughout our state as data centers proliferate like wildfire.
Defense of the project by Ken Loeber of Eagle Rock has been unconvincing.
As reported by Jessica Holdman in the SC Daily Gazette on Dec. 19, “Loeber told the SC Daily Gazette he estimates the center will need 1,000 megawatts of electricity. That would take up nearly all of Santee Cooper’s share of a 2,200-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plant that the state-owned utility company is seeking to build, in partnership with Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy, in nearby Canadys.”
Gigawatt data center proposal draws opposition from SC Lowcountry residents, politicians

Meanwhile, Dylan Nolan at Fitsnews reported on Dec. 19 that Loeber also said that “The simple fact is your [energy] rates are not going up due to this project.”
He appears to base that claim on his statement that “those [energy infrastructure projects] are projects that are being done regardless of whether we come to Colleton County or not.”
But why are they planned? It has been conceded by utilities that the rapid development of massive energy demands by data centers underlies much of the pressure to increase generating capacity.
Santee Cooper officials have placed the number at about 70% of the expansion at Canadys.
Loeber’s figures would place that percentage even higher, at more than 80% for this single project. This is not a case of more efficient use of existing capacity.
Utilities are planning to build specifically to meet data center needs.
The numbers in this case are daunting. Canadys is expected to cost $5 billion, of which $2.5 billion will be assigned to Santee Cooper. Pipeline extensions are expected to add at least $430 million to this total.
Unless the General Assembly acts quickly and decisively to demand that data centers pay in full for construction of the generating and transmission capacity that they will use, residential and small business ratepayers will be forced to absorb too much of that cost.
Santee Cooper, to its great credit, has established a large user rate that would help to mitigate this.
However, secondary distributors of Santee Cooper energy, like the co-op serving the proposed project area, are not obligated to do the same. Thus, data center builders can waltz in after a generating plant is underway and claim their right to be served, receiving much of the output at rates lower than those charged to residential and small business users.
Of course, if Eagle Rock is planning to assume Santee Cooper’s share of costs for building generation and transmission capacity in proportion to their planned use of that energy, none of this would be problematic.
Here’s what SC landowners should expect from a proposed 71-mile natural gas pipeline

Loeber conspicuously did not offer that clarification, and he surely would have if that was planned.
Instead, he offered comments that appear to be designed to evade that responsibility.
Hundreds of thousands of South Carolinians must pay their energy bills and then decide whether they can afford their medicine and their food.
Often the answer is only one of those, or neither.
All of us must pay energy bills or live in the dark and the cold.
Who will benefit from our payments, given current law and practices? Immensely wealthy corporations like Amazon and Google.
What Loeber is effectively saying is that our paying for much of the energy expansion that his company would need is already planned, and if his company doesn’t swoop in and take advantage of us, others will.
I don’t think I am alone in finding this small and unsatisfactory consolation. This is only one of the many reasons that the Eagle Rock data center proposal should die a rapid death.
However, it should be of major concern to small business and residential ratepayers and to public officials in Colleton County and at the Statehouse, both for this data center proposal and those that will come in the future.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-19-at-3.32.29 PM-e1766176660315-1024x573.png,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

DemasA group of volunteers seeking to preserve and connect people with the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park has opened applications for its artists in residence program, offering creatives an opportunity to immerse themselves in the wilderness of the Upper Peninsula and channel it into their work.
The Friends of the Porkies Artist-in-Residence program is open to writers, composers and all visual and performing artists, offering them the use of a rustic cabin on the Little Union River for a minimum of two weeks, and a three-night backcountry campaign permit, if requested. As part of the residency, artists will also provide a public presentation demonstrating an aspect of their work. 
Located in the western Upper Peninsula, the park encompasses 60,000 acres, including 35,000 acres of old-growth forest, as well as waterfalls, rivers and 25 miles of Lake Superior shoreline. 
According to Friends of the Porkies, the goal of the program is “To offer residencies to new and established artists of recognized excellence from around the world to pursue their creative process in a wilderness environment.”
Applications for the program can be found at the Friends of the Porkies web page at Porkies.org/Artist-in-Residence. Applications for the 2026 season must be received by Feb. 14, 2026 and selected artists will be notified mid-April.
According to a news release from the Department of Natural Resources, selection for the program will be based on their artistic integrity, ability to reside in a wilderness environment, their ability to relate to and interpret the park through their art, as well as their willingness to donate an original, finished piece of art inspired by their stay.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_1761-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

CalMatters produced a nonpartisan voter guide for the Prop. 50 special election, and brought it to more readers across the state thanks to newsroom partners.


CalMatters was already planning its coverage of the 2026 midterm and gubernatorial elections when, in August, the California Legislature approved Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal for a surprise special election on Proposition 50. Our team of reporters, editors, data journalists, developers and more dug right in to bring people all over California a trustworthy, nonpartisan guide to Prop. 50.
“Soon after I joined CalMatters/The Markup, we started planning our 2026 election coverage,” said CalMatters Director of Product Andrew Losowsky. “Then Proposition 50 was announced, and suddenly the next election was 11 weeks away. I’m so proud of how we all responded.”
Our team started with two hallmark CalMatters election resources: our nonpartisan, clear and trustworthy Voter Guide on our site, and our day-to-day Prop. 50 news coverage.
Then, we got to work on new ways to reach new audiences:

The same day that the proposed district changes came out, we created and published a searchable map so you could find out if your district would change. We also highlighted, using maps, the districts most impacted by redistricting. 
When Prop 50 was announced, we asked “How do you feel about it?” and more than 1,800 of you answered, our biggest response ever. We used it to source ideas for stories and essential information, even featuring some of you in our coverage.
We built our voter guide to be easily embeddable, and more than a dozen news websites did exactly that. As a result, our guide was seen more than 200,000 times across partner sites. 
We customized our voter guide for Apple News, and afterward, Apple News featured the guide by sending it to all its Californian subscribers through a push notification. 
We made a separate “Did Prop. 50 pass?” website to give anyone searching the internet a fast yes or no on the results.
We built a detailed election results tracker, which broke down voting margins by county for anyone who wanted to dive deep.
We summarized and let you search campaign contributions to both sides of Prop. 50 in real time.
Libraries printed out and shared our one-page version of our guide, which we produced in color and black-and-white, English and Spanish.
We made a Prop. 50-specific email newsletter to keep voters informed throughout the election.
Our team went to community events to share our guide and answer questions, at a music festival and at a UCLA voter education event.
We partnered on a Prop. 50 debate with Capitol Weekly and the UC Student and Policy Center.

And that was all on top of how we continue to improve our existing, trusted ways of informing voters:

We built on our 2024 election social media videos, making Prop. 50 skit videos for TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts in partnership with high school students.
Answering reader questions by email (in English and Spanish), plus in an ever-evolving FAQ.
Producing Props-in-a-Minute video overviews, in horizontal and vertical and also in Spanish.
Walking new voters through how to vote, including registration, checking your status and key dates.
Including thoughtful commentaries on both sides of the issue in our California Voices section.

Here’s more on what made our 2025 Special Election Voter Guide unique.
Our Voter Guide, republished by dozens of other news outlets

We coordinated with local and statewide news organizations all across California to get our trustworthy Voter Guide to as many voters as possible.
Our guide was republished by: CapRadio, KPBS, Jefferson Public Radio, Local News Matters, Lookout Santa Cruz, Yahoo! News via The Desert Sun, San Jose Inside, Long Beach Post, KVCR, KAZU, Mendocino Voice, Stocktonia, Voice of San Diego, Alameda Post, Trinity Journal, San Fernando Valley Sun, Lost Coast Outpost, Times of SD and Yubanet.
CalMatters reporters were called upon to explain Prop. 50 to public radio listeners across the country.  Our reporters shared insights on nationally syndicated shows, including multiple appearances on WBUR’s Here & Now, WAMU’s 1-A, and a segment on  C-SPAN. We were also invited to break down California’s redistricting efforts for listeners in Texas while the state was pursuing its own redistricting campaign. Our team also provided regular support to our partners at the California Newsroom, a collaboration of more than 10 NPR affiliates across California.
To make sure that our partners across the state, who are nonprofit news websites, public media stations, newspapers, TV stations, and more,  we worked to make it easier than ever to republish our work. For the first time, our team built our voter guide differently from the beginning, so that we could share a simple embed code with any partner who wanted to republish it on their site. We also  shared ways to link to our full coverage, download or share our videos, and print simplified one-pagers of our guide. Plus, we offered all the same resources in Spanish.
One of our close partners, Pascale Fusshoeller at YubaNet, reached out when we shared that we’d have a Prop. 50 embeddable guide for the election.
“Our district (CA-03) would change dramatically if voters approve redistricting,” Fusshoeller said. “That’s some exciting news, we’d love to have a fully embeddable guide to Prop. 50.”
Innovations and experiments to make our guide work for readers

Our team, building on innovations from our 2024 Voter Guide, worked to bring our guide to people in their preferred formats and channels. The result? We were there to serve California voters trustworthy information, whether you prefer a suit and tie and going out in public to learn, or if you prefer sweatpants on the sofa scrolling to stay in the loop.

We made a printable, one-page nuts and bolts version of our guide to reach people who frequent libraries and for civic groups to distribute in the real world. Library staff in Alameda County both printed copies for patrons and also made versions on cardstock to put up on display.
We made polished videos for YouTube desktop viewers and then made funny, skit-based videos to reach people doomscrolling on TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. We adapted our guide to work just as well on Apple News. We made a video of the biggest donors, and another on wacky districts – all trying out a call-center type dialogue that would feel out-of-place on calmatters.org but right at home on the preferred social habitats of Gen Z and Millennials.
We even tried a youth social media contest to make Prop. 50 videos as cool as saying 6-7 (ok, not as cool, but still, we tried). Schools used our voter guide as class curriculum to help students pitch us fun ways to cover the proposition on TikTok. We then selected the best three ideas and worked with and mentored the young winners to publish their engaging and nonpartisan clips across our channels.
The winning video entries explained: How Nevada County neighbors are split on Prop 50, how Prop. 50 would alter San Diego district maps and how California has districts, just like the Hunger Games.
We partnered with Capitol Weekly and the UC Student and Policy Center on a Prop. 50 debate, featuring proponents from each of the campaigns and moderated by Rich Ehisen of Capitol Weekly and our politics editor, Juliet Williams.And we brought our guide to community events in Southern California. We went to a music festival in Downtown Los Angeles and a voter information event at UCLA, where we spoke to dozens of students about Prop. 50. Our conversations with students even inspired us to make a TikTok video to answer some of the most common “what’s at stake” questions.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/090325-Redistricting-Modoc-County-MG-CM-32.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-23 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippians navigate new SNAP work requirements that put food further out of reach,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/23/mississippi-snap-work-requirements/,"Stricter work requirements for food stamps went into effect in November, putting 33,000 Mississippians at risk of losing their benefits.","Tameshia Williams, a single mom of four in Jackson who works as an elder aide, was kicked off Mississippi’s food stamp program in October despite being eligible. She says she was not informed of an upcoming appointment in the mail until after the appointment passed – a reality she worries will be the new normal for many families now that the federal government mandated more red tape for the program. 
“And then that puts you in a position where now you have to recertify completely, and you got to turn in extra paperwork, and now you have to wait til they work your case back up, and now you’re behind on getting food,” Williams said. 
Stricter work requirements for food stamps went into effect in November, putting 33,000 Mississippians at risk of losing their benefits, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. The new work requirements were signed into law by President Donald Trump over the summer, alongside a major reduction in federal funding for food assistance. The cuts will hit Mississippi harder than many states because of the state’s high poverty and hunger rates. 
Mississippi will have to pay the price for its high error rates in eligibility determinations. That rate measures how accurately each state determines if a person is eligible to receive benefits, and states with error rates over 10% will have to pay the maximum 15% in benefits. That, in addition to administrative costs, means Mississippi will have to put up about $140 million in costs previously covered by the federal government to run its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the next two years. The new costs will drastically affect the state’s priorities, experts say. 
The temporary loss of food aid from the recent government shutdown – and its immediate effect on hunger – showed the country how many Americans live paycheck to paycheck and rely on the nation’s largest anti-hunger program, said Theresa Lau, senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
“We saw a lot of families really struggling to make ends meet,” Lau said. “What we learned is you can’t ‘food bank’ your way out of this crisis.”

About 1 in 8 Mississippians — nearly 400,000 people  — receive food assistance through SNAP. More than 67% of participants are in households with children, and about 41% are in households with older adults or adults with a disability. In four Mississippi counties, over a third of residents rely on the program to purchase food, according to a report from WLBT. 
Mississippi is one of 15 states where SNAP expenditures will rise more than 300% as a result of the new law, according to the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality. Twenty-three governors signed a letter to Congressional leadership stating they may be forced to end their state SNAP programs and outlining the harm this would do to their constituents, but Gov. Tate Reeves was not one of them. 
The Mississippi Department of Human Services, responsible for implementing the state’s SNAP program, is already bracing for this change. In September, Bob Anderson, head of the department, asked the Legislature for $15 million to cover the administrative portion of the program. Meanwhile, Anderson stayed quiet on child care requests despite more than 19,000 families having lost access to vouchers that made child care affordable since pandemic-era funds dried up. 
Last year, before mounting SNAP costs created greater strain on the state’s budget, Anderson asked the Legislature for $15 million to make a dent in the growing waitlist for child care vouchers. 
“SNAP currently serves around 350,000 Mississippians while child care (serves) around 24,000,” Chief Communications Officer Mark Jones told Mississippi Today. “Unfortunately, tough decisions must be made in preparing a budget.”
Experts expect these kinds of priority equations to become more common in the coming years. 
“That’s something we’re very worried about as states try to balance their budgets and have these millions of dollars they need to put up in order to get federal SNAP dollars,” Lau said.
Do work requirements work?
Work requirements already exist for the SNAP program, but the new federal law will expand them to people previously exempt: adults aged 55 to 65 and parents of children aged 14 and older. Everyone subject to the requirements will have to prove they are working, going to school or training at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for one of the exemptions. 
About three-quarters of SNAP beneficiaries work or are in between jobs, and another 20% are attending school, taking care of a family member, or have a health condition or disability, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Opponents of the reporting requirements say the policy doesn’t take into consideration the barriers keeping people from steady employment, such as low pay, discrimination, and lack of paid parental leave and affordable health insurance. 
“Work requirements don’t improve job outcomes, they just take food away from people,” said Lau. “In rural areas where jobs are very limited, work reporting requirements often force people to volunteer in order to qualify and essentially what that means is they’re providing unpaid labor.”
They are also costly to implement and often cause eligible beneficiaries to be kicked off because of administrative errors – something that already happens. 
Amaya Jones, a Jackson mom of two who works full-time at Kroger, said her caseworker recently told her she would have to submit SNAP paperwork via mail rather than online, only to later be told the office never received it. Jones said she believes they do things like this “to make it harder” for people to get assistance. 
“They want you to send things by mail, they claim they don’t get it, you go in and the people give you attitude,” Jones said. “It’s the communication. One minute you have this caseworker, and the next it’s another caseworker. You don’t know if you’re going or coming.”

When Mississippi’s Medicaid office began its “unwinding” process in 2023 – reviewing its rolls for the first time since the pandemic – 75% of the dropped enrollees lost coverage due to “procedural errors.” Now, experts think Mississippians will live to see a similar trend with the state’s SNAP program. 
The added burden of red tape will be exacerbated by aging technology that fails to support these administrative overhauls, resulting in qualified people losing access to food, explained Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Tax and Income Supports Division at the Urban Institute. 
“We’re up now against the fact that a lot of states have not really been able to fully upgrade their technology in a way that helps them manage things nimbly,” Waxman explained. “Replacing your state’s administrative systems is usually not high on any legislator’s list of priorities, but we do pay the price for that later.”
Between the immediate administrative costs and the roughly $120 million Mississippi will have to pitch in for benefits next fiscal year, Waxman said the state cannot rule out the possibility of having to close the program altogether. 
“We would expect to see very high levels of hardship, higher rates of poverty and poorer health outcomes,” said Waxman. “Local stores and producers would also experience negative consequences because there would be far fewer dollars available to buy their products. And the charitable food system wouldn’t be able to fully fill the gap, even for a short time.”
Not only are food banks not equipped to take up the slack for a scenario as catastrophic as the end of a state’s SNAP program, but they also can’t offer the freedom of choice or the selection of healthy meats and produce that supermarkets do. 
Schelika Chisolm runs Tupelo’s Salvation Army branch with her husband, Michael Chisolm. She’s organized the food in a way that people can shop for what they want, because she knows it boosts morale and makes life easier for people with allergies and parents of small children. 
“It’s about being able to feel like there’s something you can control and something you can make a choice about,” Chisholm said. “You feel happy to know that what you have in your cart is something your kids will eat.”
But she said she still can’t offer the variety of fresh and healthy foods that a supermarket does. Many food pantries don’t offer people any choice, giving out pre-packed boxes for efficiency. Chisolm said she hopes the SNAP program continues to be as accessible as possible for those trapped in cycles of poverty. 
“Those that are in need already have barriers they’re trying to overcome, whether it’s transportation, working a minimum wage job, trying to provide for multiple people in your home or taking care of an elderly parent – they already have barriers,” Chisholm said. “I hope we don’t make it less possible for them to complete the process.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/05140357/3X0A2282.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)A new report released by the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama (PARCA) suggests changes in federal student reporting may affect the reported number of Hispanic students in Alabama schools, a change which also led to an increase in students who identify as “two or more races.”
“Because of the classification change, it is unclear from the publicly reported data whether Hispanic enrollment rose or fell,” wrote Thomas Spencer, a senior research associate for PARCA and the author of the report. “Alabama State Department of Education [ALSDE] officials said that the number of students who checked the Hispanic box increased by about 1,000 statewide. In past years, Hispanic enrollment had grown more rapidly.”
According to the report, in 2025, Hispanic student enrollment was just over 84,000 students and enrollment for students of two or more races was over 21,900. 
But in 2026, Hispanic student enrollment dropped to 26,458 while enrollment for students that are two or more races increased to 78,610.
Messages seeking comment were left with the ALSDE and School Superintendents of Alabama Monday.
The change in student reporting policy came in a March memo issued by ALSDE made to comply with standards set by the Office of Management and Budget in March 2024. 
The ALSDE notice states “Hispanic will no longer be collected as a separate ethnicity question and will instead be included as a race/ethnicity option” and that the two or more races option will be removed and students who report more than one race will have each one documented separately.
Previously, the question was asked in two separate parts. The first question asked whether the student identifies their ethnicity as Hispanic or non-Hispanic, and the second question asked how the student identified racially. 
The updated form now only asks one question, but allows respondents to check more than one box and adds Middle Eastern and North African as new racial categories.
Hispanic people often differ in how they choose to racially identify themselves.
“Hispanic individuals may consider themselves white. There are Latino Black people, they may consider themselves Native American, if they have indigenous roots, or Spanish or European,” Spencer said in a phone interview Monday.
Spencer said the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown could have contributed to the dip in the number of Hispanic and Latino students, but it’s uncertain due to the new reporting rules.
“We had been kind of tracking the growth and enrollment of Hispanic students over the last couple of decades, frankly, and we kind of wondered about the trajectory this particular fall, considering the new attention that the current administration is paying to immigration and wondered what effect it would have,” he said. “Due to the new classifications, it’s really kind of hard to say, what if any effect that’s had. Obviously, there’s been a significant shift in the identification of students, but to what extent numerically it’s harder to tally.”
Another reason for the dip in Hispanic and Latino student enrollment could be due to how families could be told to fill out the form by the local boards of education.
“You can look at a major swing in the way Albertville reported. They went to more than one race strongly. Russellville is not as much of a heavily Hispanic district, but still, a lot of respondents counted only as Hispanic,” Spencer said.
In October, Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey told members of the State Board of Education that enrollment for the current school year has decreased by 5,800 students. The decrease is the largest drop in 40 years.
Mackey told board members that of the students, roughly 3,000 of them had taken money from the CHOOSE Act and enrolled in a private school. The remaining 2,100 students were unaccounted for.
The CHOOSE Act is a voucher-like program that allows students to claim up to $7,000 in tax credits for non-public education expenses including private school tuition.
Despite the drop, Spencer said the number of Hispanic people in Alabama will continue to increase regardless of current immigration to the state.
“Any kind of, you know, growth or change in Hispanic populations among students is not necessarily due to migration,” he said.“The Hispanic population grows through natural change, and maybe even at a greater rate than the white population. So regardless of whether or not we have large or small immigration rates, our Hispanic population will continue to grow as they’re American citizens or lawful permanent residents.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Colorado-school.jpg,,,2025-12-23 08:12:01.931548

(Photo by Jerry Redfern/Capital & Main)The New Mexico Environment Department on Friday published a “Climate Action Plan” that contains more than three dozen steps to meet Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. 
NMED officials collaborated with their counterparts at the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department to craft the plan, which they describe as a roadmap to a carbon-neutral future for the state. Officials said the plan protects energy industry jobs for New Mexicans while also cutting emissions and tending to the state’s finite natural resources. 
“The New Mexico Climate Action Plan is more than a set of goals — it is an actionable roadmap to a resilient, energy-independent and prosperous future for every New Mexican,” NMED Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. “We are confronting climate change head-on while building a thriving clean energy workforce and creating long-term economic opportunities, especially for communities historically overburdened by pollution.”
The plan and existing policies together put the state on track to nearly cut emissions in half by 2030 when compared to levels from 2005, according to NMED. Officials expect an 82% reduction in emissions by 2050. In a news release, the department said these measures will prevent $294 billion in health care costs, property damage and other pollution-related impacts.
“We’re an energy state — that’s not changing. What’s changing is how we produce that energy,” Erin Taylor, acting cabinet secretary for the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, said in a statement. “This plan shows we can protect the industry jobs New Mexicans depend on while cutting emissions and creating new opportunities in clean energy.”
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grant and the Innovation in State Government Fund, which Lujan Grisham signed into law earlier this year, helped to pay for the plan.
The new plan lists 45 steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including: 

Implementing new rules to mitigate methane leaks from the oil and gas industry and explore the potential of carbon capture technology
Decarbonizing electric grids
Promoting energy-efficient building codes
Enhancing forest health and expand post-fire recovery programs
Creating a statewide organic and food waste diversion program to reduce methane emissions from landfills

An aging generation must reckon with shrinking resources, rising taxes and hard choices about what services Vermont can sustain.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Will Patten: Baby boomers racking up bills Vermont can no longer afford.","This commentary is by Will Patten of Hinesburg. He is a retired business executive and author of the book, “Saving Capitalism, Vermont Shows a Way.”



Growing up, we baby boomers were steeped in the idealism of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King and the minimalist hippie ethic. But Watergate, Vietnam and assassinations would turn idealists into cynical self-serving uber-consumers.  
Our manufacturing economy transitioned to a marketing economy that taught us to always crave more. Supply now drives demand and consumption now drives 70% of the U.S. economy. We have been catered to during the past prosperous decades. The markets have provided us with cheap abundance, so we expect our governments to provide us with protection, education, recreation and transportation. Cheaply.  
Now we live in a more resource-restricted time, and baby boomers are getting old. About 10,000 of us retire every day and live on fixed incomes. We rattle around in our large empty homes and complain about property taxes. But taxes are simply what is due and payable for the services we’ve received, and they won’t go down until we reduce some of the services they pay for.
It will fall to younger generations to perform the cost-benefit analysis underlying our town budgets and identify what we can no longer afford. I wish them luck. There will be challenges:
Much of Vermont’s charm derives from a culture of community, fostered by 251 small town governments for roughly 650,000 people. All but a few towns have their own police and fire departments, schools and road crews. That has to change. The challenge will be to regionalize services while maintaining our culture of community.
And let’s understand that a decision to regionalize services and consolidate school districts to save money is a decision to reduce the quality level of both.
As the climate deteriorates and our population shrinks, we’re going to need more resources to cope with hard times ahead, and that will require new taxes. Two Blue Ribbon Tax Commissions have recommended that we raise new revenues by taxing services and income. That will be a challenge.  
The real estate tax is a wealth tax. It makes sense for baby boomers that have equity in their homes and land. But younger and first-time homeowners are paying an unfair tax on an asset that belongs mainly to a bank. If we have to stick with a wealth tax, it should only be assessed on assets that are easily converted to cash.  
Hard times indeed.

As Michigan grapples with an ongoing teacher shortage, a new report says the state is also falling short when it comes to building a diverse educator workforce.
According to EdTrust-Midwest, just over 11% of Michigan teachers are people of color, even though nearly 40% of the state’s students are non-white.
The study finds about one in 10 Michigan students attends a school with no teachers of color at all, a gap Charlotte Pierce – senior policy analyst at EdTrust-Midwest – said can affect academic outcomes and long-term workforce readiness.
“Strong and diverse teacher workforces have been linked to quantitative improvements in test scores,” said Pierce, “fewer absences and suspensions, higher graduation and college enrollment rates, and an increased trust between students and teachers.”
The report offers a roadmap to strengthen Michigan’s teacher pipeline, such as earlier recruitment and retention efforts. Pierce said state leaders are receptive and open to taking action.
Pierce also pointed out that the lack of diversity isn’t tied to a single failure point, but to barriers that build over time.
“What we really want to frame this as is a pipeline issue,” said Pierce. “So it’s not one single point where we’re losing all of our teachers, but rather, we’re not getting as much diversity of interest in the teaching profession and that could be for a number of reasons, including low pay.”
Researchers say barriers like cost, lack of support during student teaching, and poor early career conditions continue to limit who enters and stays in the profession. Pierce emphasized that representation in the classroom can shape how students see their own futures.
“When students aren’t seeing diversity at the front of their classrooms,” said Pierce, “it’s hard to inspire the next generation, if they can’t see themselves in that profession.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/teach67.png,,,2025-12-23 07:11:40.504931

An analysis from Gov. Mike Braun’s administration estimates that total state tax breaks on businesses and individuals could top $900 million over the next two years if the Legislature were to adopt all the tax changes included in what Republicans dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Republican legislators are poised to take up proposals on conforming the state tax code with federal rules after the legislative session resumes Jan. 5.
The federal changes include temporary deductions for individuals who receive tips and overtime wages along with the interest on loans for vehicles built in the U.S. Other adjustments give numerous tax breaks to businesses, including a broader deduction for some production facilities.
Chad Ranney, Braun’s state budget director, called conformity with the federal tax code “a provision-by-provision decision in conjunction with the Legislature.”
“There’s nothing that says you have to take all or nothing,” Ranney said. “We’ll figure out, working with the Legislature, what makes sense from a policy perspective, what makes sense from a fiscal perspective and, frankly, what gives Hoosiers the best bang for their buck.”
Details from conformity analysis
Indiana’s last major conformity update came in 2023, when Indiana adopted the Internal Revenue Code as of Jan. 1, 2023, bringing the state into line with pandemic-era relief measures such as the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan. 
The state analysis provided to the Indiana Capital Chronicle on Monday projects that taxpayers would save nearly $275 million over the next two years with the deduction for overtime wages. 
The tax break on tips would total about $80 million during that time, while the vehicle loan deduction was estimated at $70 million. 
The biggest of the business tax cuts amounts to an estimated nearly $380 million over the two-year period.










We have more priorities, urgent priorities that we need to tackle first before we implement any of these changes.


– Democratic Sen. Fady Qaddoura


But those savings mean revenue loss for the state budget.
The tax conformity debate will come in the wake of an improved forecast of state tax collections released last week. The new projections show that the state’s cash reserves could grow to nearly $5 billion by the middle of 2027 — more than double what was anticipated when the new state budget took effect in July.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, was noncommittal on what tax code changes legislators will take up.
“Ideally it’d be nice to be revenue neutral on some of that,” Mishler said. “You know, some of them are cost savings and then some would cost money. So I guess we just have to balance that out.”
Legislators would likely need to act quickly to enact those tax breaks for 2025 before individuals and businesses begin filing their tax returns — and amid worries of confusion over differences in what could count toward income subject to federal and state taxes.
It is possible that lawmakers could push through a conformity bill in the first few weeks of the legislative session that is now scheduled to conclude by the end of February.
Arguments over priorities
Few states have so far adopted the federal tax changes despite the Trump administration urging them to do so, The Associated Press reported.
One worry with Indiana adopting all the federal changes is that it would further reduce the state’s tax base, said Neva Butkus, a senior analyst for the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
That could make the state more dependent on its 7% sales tax — among the highest in the country — that now draws in nearly half of the state’s revenue. 
Butkus said the federal tax changes directed a disproportionate share of savings toward the wealthy. She also called the deductions on tip and overtime income “short sighted” and not equitable.
“Why should a child care worker making $30,000 and a bartender making $30,000 all of a sudden pay different amounts in taxes?” she said during a webinar put on by Prosperity Indiana last week. 
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, the top Democrat on the Senate Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee, said he believed the Legislature should be cautious in adopting the federal tax changes.
Qaddoura cited concerns about federal Medicaid funding cuts included in Trump’s tax and spending bill threatening to increase state costs for the health insurance program for low-income families. 
He argued that rather than enacting the federal tax breaks, the state should boost funding for programs such as child care vouchers that have long waiting lists and eliminate the state’s sales tax on residential and business utility bills.
“We have more priorities, urgent priorities that we need to tackle first before we implement any of these changes,” Qaddoura said. “We’re not obligated to comply with the entirety of what has been sent to us.”

Full of sacks containing plastic dust contaminated with lead, cadmium and chromium, the trucks made their way to the outskirts of Berger, Missouri, a town of 250 people along the Missouri River.

The next day brought another 85 tons. Then 43. Then another 22. By early 2014, 6,500 tons — or 13 million pounds — of powder, stuffed into drums and bags, filled the warehouse to its brim.
Over the next five years, drums would spill, sacks would rip and dozens of people would be exposed to the toxic material before it was cleaned up, in part, on the taxpayers’ dime.
 ‘A very successful program’

Raymond Williams had been in the sandblasting business for decades. His Ohio-based company, U.S. Technology Corp., made a national name for itself by leasing sandblasting material and equipment for the restoration of the Statue of Liberty and Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
U.S. Tech also leased the material to federal agencies and defense contractors, such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to strip paint off of planes, ships and other vehicles, including the space shuttle.
The sandblasting material, made of tiny plastic pellets, could be used for several projects before it became too fine to reuse. By that point, it was mixed with paint and metal chips containing lead, cadmium and chromium, heavy metals that rendered the powder hazardous.

Dumped In Berger is a collaboration between KBIA and The Beacon examining the U.S. Technology Superfund site in Berger, Missouri. Stories will publish daily the week of Dec. 15. Read the series.

Normally, hazardous material is considered waste and needs to be disposed of at a licensed facility. But under a federal law known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, companies can recycle hazardous materials into products instead.
They have to meet certain requirements first, though. The new products have to be a usable replacement for the regular version, and they can’t come into direct contact with the ground.
Finally, companies can’t sit on the hazardous material forever. To prevent hoarding, most of it has to be recycled within one to two years.
“If you’re doing these things, you’re exempt from regulation,” Williams told KBIA and The Beacon. “That means you don’t have to have a permit to transport it, you don’t have to have a permit to store it, you don’t have to have a permit to manufacture your product. It’s all exempt from regulation.”
By bypassing these regulations, U.S. Tech and its customers were able to save a lot of money. The cost of getting permits and paying to dump the material at a hazardous waste facility would be “astronomical,” according to Laura Mills, Williams’ lawyer.
At the same time, military officials were under growing pressure from the Department of Defense to comply with federal waste-minimization regulations, according to a ProPublica investigation into military contractors, including U.S. Tech.
Recycling the sandblasting powder helped bases meet quotas for eliminating waste, and recycling the material was baked into Williams’ contracts.
During the 25 years Williams oversaw U.S. Tech’s recycling program, he said the company had written approval from 48 states to offer its services to companies and agencies there.
KBIA and The Beacon reviewed many of these approvals, including one from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, which said: “The MDNR does not consider the spent plastic abrasive to be a solid waste if it is recycled according to (federal requirements).”
“It was a very successful program, and military bases all over the country got awards and prizes for participating,” Williams said.

In a 2007 magazine article, Williams was lauded for his development of a nonporous, stronger concrete block — made with 10% recycled sandblasting powder — that was being used for “re-building the South” after Hurricane Katrina.
“With two production facilities, one just outside of Canton, OH, and one in Yazoo (City), MS, the manufacturing plants are two of the most advanced of their kind in the world,” the article read.
 ‘Doing the right thing’

The Mississippi facility was the outcome of a collaboration between U.S. Tech and a company called Hydromex in 2000. Williams said Hydromex President Dennie Eugene Pridemore approached him with an offer to help recycle his material.
Under this new partnership, Hydromex opened a facility in Yazoo City, a town of 10,000 northwest of Jackson, to recycle U.S. Tech’s sandblasting powder into concrete blocks to help it fulfill its contracts.
It never sold a single block. 
“At some point, they started using less and less cement, less binding agent, to the point that most of their blocks were just crumbling in the yard. They had no structural integrity,” said Richard Harrell, the then-director of the Office of Pollution Control within the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ).
“Then, at some point, (Hydromex) just started pouring it in the ground and pouring pads over top of it,” he added.
A photo provided by Raymond Williams shows flooded trenches where U.S. Technology employees were in the process of digging up buried sandblasting powder during the cleanup of the Hydromex site in Yazoo City, Miss., in 2012. (Cal Tobias/Columbia Missourian)
Hydromex was shut down in 2002, and Pridemore would eventually be sentenced to more than three years in prison.
At the same time, federal investigators looked into U.S. Tech, ultimately concluding that Williams was a victim of Hydromex’s cover-up, not a conspirator.
Meanwhile, Williams took matters into his own hands.
“I went to the attorney general in the state of Mississippi and said, ‘Hey, we had a subcontractor inappropriately bury this material in your state. It’s going to cost millions and millions of dollars to recover it, and as the party that’s contracted with the government to recycle, we’d like to step in and … dig it all up … and put it back in the recycling world,’” Williams said.
Mills, Williams’ lawyer, said her client took on the job “because otherwise, he would not have been able to continue his lease-and-recycle program with the government, because they would have said, ‘Hey, this isn’t working.’”
“It was a matter of stepping up and doing the right thing, but also maintaining the business he had,” she said.
Under the federal law that makes it possible to recycle hazardous material, a company must recycle 75% of its material within a year. If it doesn’t, the material has been “speculatively accumulated,” making it hazardous waste that cannot legally be recycled.
Because Hydromex had speculatively accumulated the material on its site, that material was now hazardous waste in the eyes of the government. But in its offer to help clean up the site, U.S. Tech insisted that it be allowed to recycle the powder, and Mississippi agreed.
In 2003, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Tech entered into an agreed order, a legally binding agreement commonly used by the department. The agreement gave U.S. Tech one year, with the possibility of a second year, to remove, process and recycle the material from the site.
It would take until 2007 — the year after Pridemore was indicted — to fully recycle all of the above-ground powder.
During a later trial, Mills would question Felix Flechas, an expert witness who used to work at EPA Region VIII enforcing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
Flechas said U.S. Tech took a longer time because of the ongoing investigation into Hydromex — which turned the property into a crime scene — as well as wet conditions and the sheer amount of material.
“. . . this project is well within the time frames that would be expected for cleaning up and remediating this amount of waste,” he said.
Despite the delays, Harrell said the department was “trying to work with them” because “the agency encourages recycling.”
Promotional material provided by Raymond Williams shows commercial buildings where U.S. Technology’s “SEALTECH” blocks, made with 10% recycled sandblasting powder, were used. (Cal Tobias/Columbia Missourian)
“(You) had a pretty good collapse in some of the industries at that time, so a lot of the bricks he was making, he was having trouble selling them,” Harrell said. “We just tried to work with him on schedules and timelines as the economy ebbed and waned.”
Williams did sell blocks — in promotional material, he claimed his patented “SEALTECH” blocks, which use 10% recycled material, helped build Walmarts, hardware stores and even a “pregnancy support center” in Ohio, where he’s based.
In 2009, U.S. Tech and MDEQ began investigating the scope of the underground material. Two years later, they amended their original agreed order to give the company another two years to excavate and recycle the buried powder.
In 2013, before the deadline to have everything removed from the site, Williams reached out to MDEQ to tell it that U.S. Tech had gotten approval from the Mississippi Department of Transportation to use its powder in road base for an upcoming highway project.
MDEQ amended the agreed order again, giving U.S. Tech until the end of the year to get all of the remaining material to the MDOT project site.
But in October, the MDOT deal fell through because the department had lost funding for the new highway.
 A different route

Williams immediately reached out to MDEQ to ask if he could instead move the material to a site a mile down the road from the Yazoo City facility, where he hoped to set up his recycling equipment. Mississippi said no.
“We already had one contaminated site. We had contamination in the soil. We had contamination in the water around the site. We were concerned that all we would be doing is moving one problem from Problem A to Problem B and generating another site, ” Harrell testified in a 2015 court case.
“At that point, I don’t think we had any confidence that that material was being handled right,” Harrell told KBIA and The Beacon. “This had been going on for multiple years, and we weren’t seeing near enough progress to remove this material and handle it safely.”
So, Williams turned to the World of Concrete, an industry conference in Las Vegas.
There, he ran into Daryl Duncan, who had worked in abrasive blasting for decades, including as a salesman for U.S. Tech from 2003 to 2005.
“In our discussions, I related that I had to move 16 or 17 million pounds of recycle material out of Mississippi. Daryl said he would love to get the material since he had completed recycling several billion pounds of glass and liked the recycle supply business,” Williams wrote in a statement.
Duncan’s family owned a large warehouse outside of Berger, Missouri, a small town near the Missouri River east of Hermann. The warehouse, once the home of several factories, was vacant.
KBIA and The Beacon were unable to get in contact with Daryl Duncan, but some of his thoughts were included in a transcribed interview with federal investigators.
In that conversation, interviewers questioned whether Williams and Duncan conspired to dump the material in Berger to save Williams from the cost of properly disposing of it, but Duncan insisted he was “trying to develop that (site) into an industrial park.”
“We used to have GenCorps in the building; (it) had 300-400 employees. Was great. They moved out, and we are trying to develop that,” he said.
As part of that new enterprise, Duncan and his then-wife, Penny, founded a new company, Missouri Green Materials, of which Penny was listed as the registered agent. She declined repeated requests for an interview.
From the end of October through December 2013, trucks arrived at the warehouse almost daily, carrying tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds of hazardous powder each trip.
On Nov. 27, 2013, a Google Earth satellite captured at least nine semitrailers in the process of unloading their cargo — used sandblasting powder — into the Berger warehouse. (Source: Google Earth)
The government would later accuse Duncan of knowing it was hazardous. Prosecutors said Williams had it tested in October, and the results revealed more than seven times the legally safe limit of cadmium, a heavy metal and known human carcinogen.
Sacks from Yazoo City and barrels from other U.S. Tech facilities were loaded onto the warehouse floor. When space ran out, they were stacked on top of each other.
According to court documents, Williams tried to inform MDEQ in mid-November that U.S. Tech had been shipping the powder to the Berger facility, but the department never responded. When Williams followed up two weeks later, officials told him to contact Missouri regulators.
“I said, ‘I don’t know why. We don’t have a requirement to do that. But if it makes you happy, we will,’” Williams said.
When Williams called the next day, Missouri officials said Mississippi had informed them that U.S. Tech was illegally hauling hazardous waste into their state.
Both states ordered Williams to stop moving the material as Missouri launched its investigation. Ultimately, regulators at the Missouri Department of Natural Resources deferred to Mississippi’s decision.
“If MDEQ has evidence that this material is/was hazardous waste, then we would consider the material to be hazardous waste, contrary to Mr. Duncan’s claim,” Anthony Pierce, then an environmental specialist at Missouri DNR’s Hazardous Waste Program, wrote to Steve Bailey, an MDEQ employee who oversaw the Hydromex site, in December 2013.
 To be recyclable or not recyclable

In his conversations with Mississippi and Missouri officials, Williams argued that the material was not hazardous waste because it had been granted a recycling exemption under the agreed order.
When Williams volunteered to clean up the Yazoo City site and recycle what was there, Mississippi regulators decided to exempt him from permit requirements. But according to Bailey, the exemption never changed the status of the material itself, which had been speculatively accumulated by Hydromex.
“Since we have deemed it hazardous material, any time it is transported to another facility, it has to be properly manifested as a hazardous waste,” Bailey later testified. “We exempted it (for) them on (the Yazoo City) site.”
Williams also argued that the 2011 amendment to the agreed order allowed him to send the material to a “manufacturing facility designated by U.S. Technology.”
However, when Mississippi approved using the material for the road base, it amended the agreed order. It removed a section allowing U.S. Tech to use the material to make blocks and replaced it with a section allowing it to use the powder for the new highway.
That meant that under the new version of the agreed order, the highway project was the only legal way for Williams to recycle the material.
Because the highway project was made impossible by Mississippi’s state budget decisions, Williams argued U.S. Tech could revert to the previous amendment.
“. . . because the road base opportunity went away beyond our control, we reverted to the prior agreed order and shipped it up here to Missouri Green Materials,” Williams told federal investigators. “They were going to buy the equipment off of us and manufacture concrete products with the material.”
But even if MDEQ had agreed to revert to the previous version of the agreed order, that version said that how much could be sent to a facility “shall be controlled by the production capacity of the facility.” Missouri Green Materials’ capacity was unknown, as it had never recycled this material before and didn’t yet have equipment installed.

When Mills, Williams’ lawyer, pressed Harrell in court about what U.S. Tech was supposed to do after the highway project fell through, Harrell replied, “I believe we always left the alternative that he could ship it to a proper hazardous waste permitted facility.”
Which would be costly. Williams estimated the cost to dispose of 13 million pounds of spent blast media would be around $6 million.
By moving the material without permission, U.S. Tech violated the agreed order, the only thing allowing it to transport the material without permits, Harrell said.
Under federal law, the material had been speculatively accumulated and was therefore hazardous waste. Mississippi’s exemption applied only within its own borders, meaning that in Missouri or elsewhere, the material would be treated as hazardous waste, according to an environmental lawyer and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act expert who spoke with KBIA and The Beacon on background.
It would be several years before federal prosecutors accused Williams and the Duncans of illegally transporting hazardous waste and dumping it in Berger to save Williams from the cost of disposing of it properly.
In the meantime, the trucks had stopped coming. By the time the last truck left the facility, 9 million pounds of powder from Yazoo City and another 4 million pounds from U.S. Tech’s facilities in Arkansas, Georgia, Ohio and Utah filled the Berger warehouse to the brim.
Despite federal and state authorities knowing about the site, the material would continue to sit on the outskirts of the tiny town flanked by the Missouri River for five years.

Growing up in Missouri in the 1980s, the Show Me State meant something.
We built America’s cars. We brewed America’s beer. We even had America’s best baseball teams. Missouri was a bellwether state. If you wanted to know what was happening in the country, Missouri could show you.


But my home state, once proudly independent, is suffering an identity crisis.
There is the capitulation to national political forces — selling out its citizens to curry favor with oligarchs. There is the overturning of the will of voters by officials who owe their careers to those very voters. And there is the systematic hollowing-out of institutions and infrastructure that made us a dynamic force: labor, agriculture, education and rural health care.


The story of the above is a story of power. And if power lies in the ability to impose one’s will, then unilaterally disenfranchising 300,000 Missourians may look powerful indeed.
But in doing so, Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Gov. Mike Kehoe, don’t build power but enthusiastically cede it. They hand the reins for Missouri’s future to Trump and his malevolent billionaires, even foreign entities, and they are almost certainly shortening their own political careers in the process.


Viewed through a psychotherapeutic lens, Missouri isn’t exhibiting a Nietzschean “will to power.” Instead, I see what Viktor Frankl defined as a will to meaning.
“Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, … or a quest for power, … but a quest for meaning,” the psychiatrist wrote in his best-known work, Man’s Search for Meaning. “This striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man.”


So how do these seemingly nihilistic acts demonstrate a desire for meaning? And how does strong-arming voters show weakness?
Consider the beneficiary.
Contrary to conventional American individualism, Frankl writes that true meaning is found in duty to others. His theory of logotherapy “tries to make the patient fully aware of his own responsibleness; therefore, it must leave to him the option for what, to what, or to whom he understands himself to be responsible.” Missouri’s Republican Party has repeatedly shown itself responsible not to its constituents, but to Trump and Trump only.


Anecdote: As a candidate for state legislature, I spent months knocking doors in my suburban Republican district. A native of this district, a fellow churchgoer and parent of four children attending school here, I expected to find common ground with my neighbors “across the aisle”
And I was right: we largely agreed on many topics. Not only did we agree statistically — Amendment 3 restoring abortion rights and Prop A, guaranteeing paid sick leave and raising the minimum wage, both passed convincingly in my district — but we found common ground in face-to-face conversation, from a desire for gun safety to fiscal accountability.


But all too often, our friendly rapport was abruptly squashed by partisanship — partisanship predicated not on honest differences about our community’s needs, but on parroted talking points and hyperbolic proclamations of national political figures.


With each conversation, a depressing picture came into clearer focus. These people weren’t espousing deeply held beliefs or community needs based on lived experience, they were showing solidarity. Solidarity with television talking heads and social media accounts of indeterminate origin. Maddening as this was to me, a neighbor interested in improving our common spaces and shared destiny, I realized they had a different sense of community.


As gruff as our public discourse has become, people are still social animals. We do still travel in packs and sacrifice our own self-interest to boost the interests of others. Frankl’s theory still holds.


Like a trope in a teen drama, leaders like Hanaway and Hoskins show their true colors when they prioritize a pat on the back from the popular kids over the little people who put them there. After all, former Missouri Attorneys General and Secretaries of State have gone on to achieve a sort of MAGA B-list celebrity. That is a type of fame, and fame can pass for meaning, for a time.


But a Missouri in thrall to external validation—whether from a national political party in self-preservation mode or wealthy oligarchs looking to pad their bank accounts—is a Missouri drained of meaning.


Consider Indiana. They became the most consequential state in the nation this month when they voted down a gerrymandered Congressional map. After being showered with promises (and threats) from the RNC, they won a reputation as fearless, independent, and loyal to their constituents. They harken back to a Republican party that honored two things: “maverick” independence and the sovereignty of state’s rights.


Frankl, who built his theory of human motivation after enduring the atrocities of the Holocaust, emphasizes the importance of knowing oneself, of finding meaning not in extrinsic validation but in intrinsic value. Missouri’s inherent value is our citizens. When our officials don’t recognize us as valuable, they have little reason to protect the dignity of our labor or the freedom to make our own healthcare choices. They are happy to trade us away for the fleeting embrace of a celebrity.


Our neighbors — not TV pundits, not billionaires, not a political machine — comprise the community we have a responsibility to honor. “To be human is to be responsible,” Frankl wrote. “Hence, to become conscious of responsibility is to become conscious … of one’s self.”


In 2024, Missourians stood up for the middle class and personal healthcare freedoms. In 2025, we showed the courage—and the numbers—to fight back against unconstitutional gerrymandering. In these acts there is meaning. But if our elected officials don’t recognize the state’s true value (or honor their own oaths of office), then Missouri won’t mean much at all.

When Vermont legalized sports betting in 2023, it established the Problem Gambling Program, which tasked the state Department of Mental Health with expanding resources and support for those with problem gambling issues. 
As part of this effort, the department is rolling out a free 30-hour program to train the state’s mental health clinicians.
“Because this is a new product and offering within the state of Vermont, we wanted to make sure that our mental health clinicians and providers were equipped and educated,” said Chris Allen, the Department of Mental Health’s director of suicide prevention.

The training, which will begin on Jan. 13 and run for 10 weeks in live, virtual sessions, is part of a larger-statewide push to build up the appropriate resources to address problem gambling. State lawmakers allocated $500,000 for the department to use in 2025 for problem gambling programs. The money comes through an agreement with the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery, which receives a portion of the revenue the licensed sports betting operators earn in the state.
In 2024, the Department of Mental Health spent $34,814 out of that fiscal year’s allocated $250,000. Of that, $5,000 went to the training program, as it got off the ground. For fiscal year 2025, the department spent $20,000 on the training program and used nearly the full allocation on the range of its support programs, outreach and staffing for them, a department spokesperson confirmed.
Allen hopes that the training can make more of Vermont’s mental health clinicians eligible to receive referrals on the Vermont Gambling Help website or help them identify and respond to earlier signs of problem gambling in their patients. 
Only 14 providers in the state hold a certificate as a Vermont problem gambling specialist. However, the Department of Mental Health estimates that more than 11,600 Vermonters struggle with problem gambling, citing a national survey from 2021, even before legal online sports betting had begun in Vermont.
He hopes the state will be able to collect better demographic data on how many and which subsets of Vermonters are experiencing sports betting addiction. 
Allen knows that for many people, problem gambling issues compound with other mental health challenges — things like suicidal ideation, substance use disorders and general anxiety around debt.
The training aims to cover these co-occurring challenges, the ethics and fundamentals of gambling issues, as well as strategies to ameliorate the harms of addiction. Allen added that he is particularly glad the training includes a section on techniques for reducing harm, rather than only exploring cold-turkey quitting.
“Abstinence might not be an option for everyone,” he said. “We want to offer this and train clinicians to be proficient in talking through how to moderate a client’s gambling use.” 
Private practitioners and staff at the state’s designated mental health agencies are eligible to participate in the training — the registration for which is now open. Upon completing the free training, clinicians receive 30 continuing education credits, almost meeting the annual requirement to maintain professional licensure as a clinical mental health counselor in Vermont. For some, the expense and time commitment of continuing education courses can be a barrier to full licensure.  
The completion of the 30-hour course is a key component of qualifying for the state’s formal specialist certification.
The training is just one piece of a larger scope of support initiatives the Department of Mental Health has spearheaded, including the telephone helpline, live online chat, peer support specialists and a voluntary self-exclusion program, where people can opt in to restrict themselves from online sports betting.

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)No state that borders South Dakota has publicly confirmed a lethal overdose in a state prison in 2025.
South Dakota has reported eight. 
Most of the suspected or confirmed overdose deaths are thought to be tied to a synthetic drug known as K2, which typically arrives in prisons on sheets of paper soaked with the chemical and dried out for smoking.


South Dakota’s prison overdose problem
This story is part of a series examining a spate of prison overdose deaths in South Dakota, including the causes and potential solutions.
Read the series >


That’s how the drug has appeared in South Dakota’s prisons in each of the three K2 overdoses that have drawn criminal charges so far this year through the office of Attorney General Marty Jackley, who said Friday that another set of charges are pending for a similar case.
South Dakota’s outsized prison death count extends beyond overdoses, and more than half the deaths have been preventable. With 25 total in-custody deaths for the year, the state outpaces every neighbor but Iowa, which has logged 29 deaths for an inmate population more than twice the size of South Dakota’s. 
Death certificates for four of the South Dakota inmates list suicide as the manner of death. Another suspected suicide remains under investigation.
Most of the information released publicly on the overdose deaths has come from Jackley’s office. The state Department of Corrections has offered few details.
The department declined to offer responses to several security related inquiries from South Dakota Searchlight in recent weeks. The agency has also declined requests for an interview with former Iowa prison administrator Nick Lamb, who began his work as corrections secretary for South Dakota in mid-November after the resignation of his predecessor, Kellie Wasko.
Changing formulations, changing dangers
Lamb told the Corrections Commission earlier this month that South Dakota is “no different” from other states in terms of its struggle with K2.
Three correctional officers at Anamosa State Penitentiary in Iowa were reportedly treated for exposure to K2-coated paper a few months ago.
Denny Kaemingk, a former corrections secretary for South Dakota who now serves as a consultant for a security company, said he hears horror stories about K2 from prison officials all over the U.S.
Kaemingk said he’s confident in Lamb, based on the new secretary’s years of service in multiple states.
“He’s a fixer,” said Kaemingk, who was on the team of people who interviewed Lamb for the job of corrections secretary. “He sees problems and sets out to solve them. That’s what we saw that he did in Illinois, Iowa and New Mexico.”

* suspected cause, pending toxicology results



The company for which Kaemingk acts as a consultant, RaySecur, sells a scanner that’s designed to detect the presence of any foreign substances on paper.
In some regions, Kaemingk said, jailers and prison officials put the scanner on a cart and wheel it from cell to cell to check papers in inmates’ possession.
South Dakota has two of the scanning units, Kaemingk said, though the Department of Corrections declined to confirm as much, or to offer any other details on its drug mitigation efforts.
Technologies like scanners need to be able to detect any kind of substance, Kaemingk said, not specific chemicals, because synthetic drugs are frequently reformulated on the molecular level as state legislators vote to add chemicals to their list of banned substances.
The revamps have created a more potent product with more severe side effects. 
“The recipe today might not be the recipe six months from now,” said Kaemingk, who called the difference between the K2 he saw as secretary and what’s now circulating “the difference between night and day.”
DOC changes, concerns about staff
Former Corrections Secretary Wasko told reporters over the summer that friends and family members of inmates had been involved in some of the prison drug trafficking that’s taken place over the past few years.
At a July press conference, in response to a question from South Dakota Searchlight, she said that a March 2024 shutdown of tablet-based inmate communications was tied to drugs.
“We had offenders who were conducting nefarious illicit drug transactions through messaging,” Wasko said, marking the first public explanation for an incident that inspired two bouts of unrest and led to charges for 11 prisoners. 
The Department of Corrections hasn’t allowed in-person visits in Sioux Falls since Father’s Day, in part in response to concerns about visitors passing drugs. 
Four more people died of suspected drug use after the change.
“You can only blame so many things on contact visits,” said Doug Weber, a former South Dakota penitentiary warden.
New corrections leader says SD’s synthetic drug troubles ‘not any different’ from other states

In addition to smuggling in body cavities — something that’s a particular concern in work release facilities — Weber said that people could throw drugs over walls, drop them from drones, try to smuggle things in with the help of volunteers or medical staff, or try to take advantage of daily food service deliveries.
Threats to family members or people’s careers might be used to convince those who come and go from the prison to play along with drug smuggling.
“There’s definitely extortion stuff that goes on,” Weber said.
Weber was critical of former Secretary Wasko’s approach to security, particularly the frequent use of lockdowns, which he said can exacerbate security issues by frustrating inmates if they happen too often or last too long.
During his tenure, he said, there were daily cell sweeps for drugs, and officers worked to identify and target the inmates involved in trafficking.
More than one of 2025’s overdose deaths have allegedly involved collusion between prison staff members and inmates. Jackley first announced indictments for drug trafficking this summer. His office charged a former correctional officer, a 22-year-old named Carson DeYoung, with supplying K2 in September, and announced charges against another inmate and a former prison medical aid named Natalie Krause on Friday.
Jackley said he’s been in conversations with Secretary Lamb about potential security upgrades in the state’s prisons, and that Lamb is “open to working with us.”
He’d also like to see lawmakers stiffen the penalty for collusion between inmates and state employees. This year, lawmakers passed a bill to make it a misdemeanor for supervisors to look the other way when they see unethical or illegal behavior. Jackley wanted felony penalties. 
This year, he said, he’s working with lawmakers on a bill that could attach a possible 50-year prison term to anyone involved with distributing drugs that result in an in-custody overdose.
The details might change, Jackley said, but “this is where the conversation has been going.”
Security measures
The smuggling of K2 on sheets of paper changed the mail policies in South Dakota’s prisons years ago. Instead of being delivered, the letters are scanned and sent to inmates on prison-issued tablets. 
Kaemingk and Weber both said that inmates are always looking for new ways to beat the system. Some will swallow balloons filled with dope, Weber said, and “just wait a few days” to retrieve it from the toilet.
State apologizes, but can’t explain missing evidence in prison overdose case

Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead runs a jail that churns through 18,000 bookings a  year in Sioux Falls. That dynamic — short-term jail stays versus the longer-term sentences served by prison inmates — and the jail’s lack of outdoor areas make it more difficult for drugs to get in, he said, but that doesn’t mean the jail catches everything. 
The jail doesn’t have a scanner for paper, Milstead said, but it does scan inmate mail instead of handing it to inmates. It also has a body scanner, similar to an airport security scanner, used to search anyone who’s booked.
Gov. Larry Rhoden, during a recent press conference, said the state has ordered two such scanners for the penitentiary. Lamb told the state’s Correctional Rehabilitation Task Force that the state is working on security changes at the prison and mentioned scanners, but said he “cannot go into details.”
It’s not unusual to find drugs stashed in a body cavity at booking time, according to Milstead. 
“You’d be surprised at how many people carry it there regularly,” he said.
But the scanners don’t necessarily catch everything, and inmates never stop looking for new opportunities to smuggle in contraband.
“We’ve got people who spend every minute of every day,” Milstead said, “trying to find the most creative ways to get illegal drugs in.”



South Dakota prison deaths compared to other states
Twenty-five state prison inmates have died, including eight by confirmed or suspected drug overdoses, this year in South Dakota. The state has about 3,900 prisoners.
The death numbers stand out in the region:

Twelve inmates have died in Nebraska state prison custody, according to the agency’s news release archive. No release mentions overdose as a cause. Department of Correctional Services spokeswoman Dayne Urbanovsky did not reply to calls or emails about overdoses. Nebraska’s prison population stands at around 5,900.
Fourteen people have died in Minnesota state prison custody this year. None died of an overdose, from K2 or any other drug, spokeswoman Shannon Loehrke said. Minnesota has around 8,000 state prison inmates.
North Dakota, with a prison population of around 2,200, has had no inmate deaths this year, according to corrections spokeswoman Kayli Richards.
Wyoming, with a state inmate population of just over 2,000, has had eight in-custody deaths this year, “none of which were suspicious or narcotic related,” spokeswoman Stephanie Dack said.
There are 3,400 people in prison in Montana. Sixteen inmates have died in 2025, according to the state’s “Mortality in Corrections” online dashboard. The cause of some deaths remains under investigation, but no 2025 death is listed as “accidental,” the category spokeswoman Carolynn Stocker said could include a drug overdose. 
Iowa corrections spokesman Zach Carlyle did not return calls or emails on the subject of deaths in custody. His prison system’s news release archive shows 29 deaths in custody for 2025. None of the news releases mentions causes of death. The majority list hospice, palliative care or an outside health care facility as the location of death. Iowa is home to around 8,500 inmates

Felzkowski spoke at a Republican press conference about postpartum Medicaid expansion in April. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said in a year-end interview with the Wisconsin Examiner that the year has been one of “very steady growth” and top priorities for her in the remaining legislative session include passing legislation to help bring down the cost of health care, advancing medical cannabis legislation and passing additional tax cuts. 
Felzkowski pointed to the state budget in which lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers increased funding for roads and transportation costs, cut taxes including for retirees, increased special education funding and dedicated funding to mental health initiatives. She was one of four Senate Republicans to vote against the state budget, a vote she said she took because of her opposition to increasing the state’s hospital assessment without health care reforms. 
A slimmed down, 18-member Republican majority in the Senate this session and several GOP senators who took a stand against a compromise budget deal gave Senate Democrats an opening to come to the budget negotiating table, and to win compromises on school funding as well as stop cuts to the University of Wisconsin system.
Felzkowski said the slimmer margins this year have been normal. 
“If you look back for the last 30 years, when the Republicans are in control, we are normally at 18-15 margin in the Senate,” Felzkowski said. “When we were up to like 22, that was kind of a gift, so we are a very strong Republican majority right now.”
Felzskowski said working on health care affordability will be her top priority when lawmakers return in January. This includes working on health care price transparency and working to advance her legislation that would make changes to the regulation of pharmacy benefit managers — third-party companies that manage prescription drug benefits between health plans, employers and government programs.
Health care and prescription drugs
Felzkowski’s bill would allow patients to use any licensed pharmacy in the state without facing penalties and require benefit managers to pay pharmacy claims within 30 days. 
“Our neighbors to the south in Illinois just passed their version of PBM reform,” Felzkowski said, adding that her bill has passed out of committee and lawmakers are now discussing whether it will receive a full Senate vote. 
Felzkowski’s health care price transparency legislation would require hospitals to make publicly available to consumers the standard costs of “shoppable services,” which would be defined as those that can be scheduled in advance such as x-rays, MRIs and knee replacements. 
“What is one thing that you buy that you have no idea what it’s going to cost? It’s health care. That’s absolutely ridiculous,” Felzkowski said. “Other states have passed it. They’re starting to see the fruition of it and it does work. There’s a reason we have the fifth highest health care costs. It’s because our Legislature has not done anything to help bring those costs down and it’s time that we actually start doing that.” 
Felzkowski, who has been a longtime advocate for legalizing medical cannabis, said the Senate is “closer than ever” to having a vote on the floor on a proposal to do so, but she believes the chances of the Assembly advancing legislation remain “slim.”
Felzskowski said she hopes legislation to extend Medicaid coverage for postpartum women from 60 days after giving birth to one year isn’t dead this session. Wisconsin is one of two states in the U.S. that haven’t accepted the federal extension.
“I hope that my fellow assemblymen continue to put pressure on their leadership… Deep red states, blue states as well as purple states across the nation have postpartum care for 12 months and they’ve done it because it’s the return on investments for taxpayers as well as being the right thing to do,” Felzskowski said. “We see baby thrive, we see mom thrive, and it actually lowers the cost down the road.”
Fate of WisconsinEye
Felzkowski said Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos are having discussions about solutions to the shutdown of WisconsinEye, the nonprofit service that provides video coverage of legislative hearings, floor sessions and Wisconsin state government business. WisconsinEye halted its livestream and pulled down its video archive last week due to a lack of funding.
“Even if we do something temporary to get us through a session… just get through until April and then do a really deep dive on what should be the next step,” Felzkowski said, adding that that includes looking at how other states cover their state government.
“The transparency is important,” she said, adding they want to ensure people still have access to government proceedings and a record is still being kept of it all.
Felzkowski said she hopes Republicans can get one more tax cut done before the end of the legislative session next year. 
New tax cuts in the works
A few of the ideas legislators are considering include eliminating taxes on tips and overtime. 
“Anytime we can return money to our citizens is a good thing,” Felzkowski said, adding that state Republicans would like to align Wisconsin tax cuts with federal policy. The federal megabill approved in July included a tax deduction on tips and overtime that will be available from 2025 through 2028.
This December, Wisconsin residents are experiencing the highest property tax hikes since 2018, according to a recent Wisconsin Policy Forum report. The report explained that state budget decisions including Evers’ veto that allows school districts an annual $325 per pupil increase for the next 400 years as well as lawmakers’ decision to not provide any increase to state general aid this year have led to the hikes. 
Asked whether lawmakers will look to solutions for lowering property taxes, Felzkowski said it would take a new governor. 
“We have given [Evers] numerous chances to reverse that 400-year veto and he keeps vetoing the bill, so it’s on the governor’s plate right now,” Felzkowski said. “Until we get a different governor in the East Wing and we can start seriously addressing education and all the things that are wrong with it, I don’t know what to say.” 
Felzkowski said that even with the state budget surplus there wasn’t enough state money for the general aid increase.
“There were a lot of mouths to feed on that budget,” Felzkowski said. “With increasing revenues all over, there was not enough money out there to backfill that $325… We would have had to have raised taxes dramatically to do that. The dollars didn’t exist.”
Felzkowski said on education that she hopes Wisconsin will opt into the new federal education tax credit program. The program would provide a dollar-to-dollar tax credit of up to $1,700 to people who donate to a qualifying “scholarship granting program” to support taxpayer-financed private-school vouchers. Evers would need to opt the state into the program by Jan. 1, 2027, but so far has said he won’t. 
Confident GOP will hold Senate in 2026 
Wisconsin Republicans have held control of the state Assembly and Senate since 2010, and next year will test the strength of that majority when the state’s 17 odd-numbered Senate seats will be up for election for the first time under new legislative maps adopted in 2024. 
Last year when the maps were in place for the 16 even-numbered seats, Democrats were able to flip four seats. In 2026, Republicans will need to make sure Democrats cannot flip two additional Senate seats to hold control of the body.
Felzkowski expressed confidence that they will do so. 
“We will come back with a strong Republican majority. We have better policies, we have better ideas and we run great candidates,” Felzkowski said.
There will be several key, competitive districts in 2026 including Senate District 5, which is currently held by Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), Senate District 17, which is currently held by Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Senate District 31, currently represented by incumbent Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) who will face a challenge from Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp). 
“We’re going to run on the same policies we’ve always run on: lower taxes, strong freedoms, strong economies, strong education and government getting out of your way so that you can live the American dream,” Felzkowski said. “The Democrats are going to run on an anti-Donald Trump policy, more government, more influence in your life. It’s all they’ve ever run for.”
Some Democrats have taken election results in 2025 as a sign that people are unhappy with the Trump administration and are ready to elect Democrats. 
Felzkowski said she didn’t think that 2025 election results in other states were going to be applicable in Wisconsin, though she said the new maps could be challenging for Republican candidates. 
“Wisconsin is kind of a unique state. We’re a very purple state,” Felzkowski said. “We knew those candidates in Virginia were going to win, I mean, it’s a blue state so I mean you can’t really base us on what happened in Virginia and New Jersey… We’re going to be running in Democratic-gerrymandered seats, so we’re going to have to work very hard, but we will win.”
Wisconsin also has an open race for governor on the ballot next year. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is considered the frontrunner in the GOP primary, and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann, are the current Republican hopefuls.
Felzkowski said she probably won’t endorse in the Republican primary for governor, but she is looking for a candidate who is a “conservative reformer who’s willing to take on the tough issues from health care, education, and corrections, lowering taxes” as well as someone who will do “a deep dive into our agencies,” adding that she hopes they’ll work to root out “waste, fraud and abuse.” 
The Democratic field of candidates is much larger including Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), Milwaukee County Exec. David Crowley, former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, former Department of Administration Secretary Joel Brennan and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey.

(Getty Images)Every generation faces a choice about who we will allow to speak for us, and what kind of political culture we in Ravalli County and across our state intend to build. We cannot control every voice in the public square, but we can draw a moral line between those who contribute to the work of citizenship, and those who seek only to inflame, intimidate, divide, and ultimately purge.
In that spirit, it is time to speak plainly about the extremism of the John Birch Society – their seductive rhetoric, both its history and its present posture.
For more than half a century, the John Birch Society has operated on a simple but destructive premise: That America is infiltrated, corrupted, and on the verge of collapse, not because of human imperfection or political disagreement, but because “the enemy” is always lurking behind the next door, your coworkers, your neighbors – a doctrine of distrust.  This organization built its identity not on civic dialogue but on suspicion. And suspicion, when elevated into doctrine, becomes something far more dangerous.
The record speaks for itself. John Birch Society leaders once claimed that President Dwight Eisenhower, a man who led the Allied forces to victory over tyranny, was a “dedicated communist agent.” They charged that the Civil Rights Movement was a Soviet operation. They declared that fluoridated drinking water was a communist mind-control plot, and that the United States was losing wars by deliberate design. These were not fringe mutterings. They were the public claims of an organization that insisted it alone could see the “truth.”
What we see now is not new; it is simply the next chapter of the same story. When political movements lose the ability to make a better argument or the capacity for humility, when disagreement becomes treason, and when complexity is replaced by conspiracy, the outcome is always the same — the purification mindset. That is a belief that society must be purged of its enemies, real or imagined, in order for virtue to survive.
History has seen this before, and we should be reminded of the cost.
During the French Revolution, Maximilien Robespierre and his Committee of Public Safety believed they could perfect society by identifying and eliminating its “corrupting influences.” They began with real grievances and ended with a guillotine. What started as an appeal to virtue ended in the “Reign of Terror,” not because the people were wicked, but because the logic of purging extremism can lead nowhere else.
The parallels with the Birch Society are not academic. They are structural.
Robespierre and the John Birch Society share the same underlying assumption: That society can be purified by rooting out enemies; that disagreement is a sign of treachery; and that those who do not conform must be exposed and removed.
When any movement defines itself by the enemies it imagines, rather than the values it upholds, it inevitably turns inward. And when it does, it devours its own.
America does not need another era of purifying zeal. We do not need an American Committee of Public Safety dressed up in 20th-century rhetoric. We need the opposite — civic courage, patience, humility, and a willingness to work with people who do not share all of our views. Our Democratic Republic will not maintained by the search for perfect allies, but by the imperfect work of reasoning together, building and rebuilding not tearing down.
The John Birch Society, where the end always justifies the means regardless of the law, represents a failure of that reasoning. It mistakes fear for insight. Intimidation and absolutism for strength. Our nation deserves better than conspiracy in the place of conversation. We deserve better than purging in the place of persuasion. And we deserve leaders who know that the purpose of politics is not to hunt enemies, but to build a future.
In this moment, when our communities are tired of division and hungry for dignity, we must reaffirm that extremism has no place in American renewal. Not because we fear it, but because we understand where it leads. We have seen its outcomes in history, and we have seen its smaller echoes in our own time. The work ahead requires steadiness, not frenzy. Cooperation, not cleansing, not purging our neighbors, but bringing a more persuasive argument to the table.
Let us be a people who choose to build rather than burn down.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/election-image-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 06:57:16.296718

Eight people have died of suspected or confirmed overdose deaths in South Dakota’s prisons in 2025, outpacing neighboring states. Most are believed to be linked to a synthetic drug commonly called K2, which typically comes into correctional settings on pieces of paper that have been soaked with the drug and dried out for smoking.
The prisons have also tallied five deaths listed as suicides this year, and 24 total inmate deaths — higher numbers for the state than any year in recent memory.


South Dakota’s prison overdose problem
This story is part of a series examining a spate of prison overdose deaths in South Dakota, including the causes and potential solutions.
Read the series >


Gov. Larry Rhoden, who recently hired Nick Lamb to succeed former Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko, said he trusts the prison system to turn things around, citing new camera purchases for the Sioux Falls penitentiary campus and the purchase of two new body scanners meant to detect drugs hidden in body cavities.
There’s a backlog on body scanners, but Rhoden said he talked to his predecessor as governor, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, about speeding up their delivery to South Dakota.
“I believe we will still get them yet this winter,” Rhoden said during a press conference on a new women’s prison, now under construction in Rapid City. 
He told reporters that he couldn’t offer much more on the state’s response to the overdoses.
“I can’t talk about any deaths that are currently under pending or active investigation,” Rhoden said. “And I also can’t talk about a lot of the security initiatives or changes we may be making, because that will jeopardize our operations. But we are looking at a lot of changes.”
Rhoden declined a request for an interview to talk in more detail about the issue. Spokeswoman Josie Harms said Rhoden’s comments in Rapid City cover the bases of what the administration can say.
Primary candidates say more should be done
Rhoden’s Republican primary opponents in the 2026 governor race aren’t sure that’s enough. 
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, said in an interview an overdose death count “well above the national average” is a cause for alarm, and that scanning pieces of paper for contamination isn’t enough.
‘Moral leadership’ needed to stop South Dakota prison overdose deaths, inmates and activists say

He’d like to see the prisons patrol more closely to catch drones he says might be dropping drugs into prison yards. He’d also like to see more random searches of cells, better screening of staff members and daily sweeps of the prison yard to make sure drugs haven’t been planted or dropped there before inmates leave their cells each day. 
“You’re never going to have perfection, so the fact that there have been problems is not as much a concern to me as the fact that there is no plan to fix them,” Johnson said. “There doesn’t appear to be any leadership.”
Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden also decried the situation as evidence of a lack of leadership. If elected, he said, he’d move for more collaboration with law enforcement investigators.
“If we can’t even keep drugs out of our prisons, how on earth are we supposed to keep them off the streets and keep our kids safe?” Doeden said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight.
Johnson and Doeden both talked about bolstering chemical dependency treatment as important steps, too.
Jon Hansen of Dell Rapids is speaker of the House in the state Legislature and a Republican candidate for governor. Hansen issued a statement on the overdose situation that read, in part, that “the buck stops with the governor — who can’t seem to get his house in order.”
“This dysfunction affects far more people than just the inmates within,” he wrote. “Repeated prisoner deaths like this opens us up to huge lawsuits, breeds a culture of prison disorder and violence, and makes it harder and harder to recruit and keep good corrections officers.”
Independent candidate weighs in
Allison Renville of Sioux Falls, who’s running for governor as an independent, volunteers at the penitentiary, working with a group of Native American inmates.
Renville said the Rhoden administration “needs to find out who is causing these casualties, either inmate or staff, before more lives are lost.”
But Renville sees other problems that need solving if the prison system expects to draw inmates out of cycles of drug use.
“Working to address the substance abuse and its underlying problems like depression, suicidal ideation and poverty will help people prone to predatory practices like K2 distribution,” Renville said.
Renville cited a shortage of space in chemical dependency treatment, a lack of options for activities and inmate lockdowns as factors contributing to drug use.
Robert Arnold, a college student who’s declared his intention to seek the South Dakota Democratic Party’s nomination for governor, did not respond to messages seeking comment on the prison overdoses.

(Getty Images)About two dozen Idahoans gathered amid cold winds Thursday night in Nampa, holding artificial candles to mourn at a “pre-funeral” for affordable health care in the U.S. 
The gathering, organized by a group called the Appleseed Project, occurred the same week that Idaho’s health care insurance marketplace ended open enrollment, with thousands canceling their plans with the expected expiration of federal health care premium subsidies.

“Affordable health care is not yet dead, but it is on life support,” Alice Nelson, one of the event organizers, said Thursday. 
The “Health Care Vigil” included various stories from locals about the importance of affordable health insurance and ended with a call to action to contact Idaho’s congressional delegation and urge their support to extend the federal expanded health care premium tax credits, which are set to expire Dec. 31. 
The federal tax credits had reduced Idahoans’ premiums for insurance bought through the state marketplace, created through the Affordable Care Act, by an average of $407 each month, according to the health policy research organization KFF. 
U.S. House Republicans, including Idaho Reps. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher, voted last week on a health care bill that did not include an extension of the tax credits. Four centrist House Republicans joined Democrats in a petition to force a separate vote on extending the credits for three years, but a vote won’t occur until the new year, States Newsroom reported. 
Thursday’s gathering in Nampa focused on the tax credits. 
 Speakers underscore importance of affordable health care coverage 

“Tonight, we may be in mourning, but that doesn’t mean we are giving up,” Nelson said. “We will hold Congress’s feet to the fire until they have extended those tax credits.”

She previously worked for a company that kept her hours to part time, meaning she wasn’t eligible for health insurance coverage through her employer. She said she was offered COBRA, through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which allows for temporary health coverage if there’s a change in eligibility. 
At the time, a plan through COBRA would cost her $550 a month, she said. Franco was working around 28 hours a week for minimum wage, $7.25 an hour, which meant the premium cost would cost more than half of her paycheck, she said.
She experienced kidney failure and required dialysis for more than four years before she received a kidney transplant this February. She advocated for maintaining health coverage for everyone. 
Gary Sandusky, an organizer of the event, urged those in attendance to reach out to U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate deadlocked on two proposals to address rising health care costs, including a bill co-sponsored by Crapo and Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy that would have provided money through Health Savings Accounts for some state marketplace enrollees in 2026 and 2027, States Newsroom reported. 
Crapo and Cassidy’s proposal failed to reach the needed 60 votes to advance in the U.S. Senate. Crapo and fellow Idaho U.S. Sen. Jim Risch voted against a Democratic-led bill that would extend the premium tax credits for three years. 
If the U.S. House approves the bill to extend the tax credits, it will go to the Senate. It’s likely Crapo and Risch will again contend with the three-year extension proposal. 
“So what we’re suggesting is that, Senator Crapo, who was instrumental in defeating the ACA tax credits in the Senate, he will have to deal with it again,” Sandusky said Thursday, “and we think he needs to hear from Idahoans.”

(Photo courtesy of Luisa Caddle)When campaign consultant Sean Caddle pleaded guilty in 2022 to murder-for-hire, he was allowed to remain at home for nearly two years while he cooperated with federal prosecutors on a political corruption investigation. 
But that probe went nowhere, and now a series of prison interviews with Caddle raises questions about why the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Newark wasn’t able to bring charges stemming from a sweeping pay-to-play scheme that Caddle ran. 
“This was all a sham,” Caddle said. “I was never questioned [about] what I was doing wrong with those groups.”
Caddle, 47, is serving a 24-year sentence at the federal correctional institution at Fort Dix in Burlington County for paying two hitmen to murder Michael Galdieri in his Jersey City apartment in 2014. Galdieri was a friend of Caddle’s and, as the son of a former state senator, hung around and worked on campaigns. 
Caddle signed a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors in 2021 that required him to plead guilty to the murder-for-hire plot and provide information about political corruption. “He has been working, collaborating with the FBI in developing an important investigation,” defense attorney Edwin Jacobs told the court when Caddle pleaded guilty and was allowed to return home. 
Twenty months later, prosecutors noted his cooperation and recommended a lighter sentence.
But little came of the investigation, and Caddle received a longer sentence than was recommended by the prosecutors. Lee Cortes, an assistant U.S. attorney at the time, told the court he was satisfied with Caddle’s cooperation, but the information was “not actionable.” Cortes asked for a sentence of 15 years, but the judge tacked on another nine. 
Caddle insists he had evidence of political corruption, but he was never asked about it.
“I said, ‘Look, I’ll peel back all the layers of the dark money funds that existed,’” Caddle said he told federal prosecutors. “While initially stating they had tremendous interest, the reality was they didn’t even peel a page back on it.”
The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Newark declined to comment.
Caddle worked on political campaigns for about 20 years. He was primarily a get-out-the-vote specialist and also ran a series of funds that raised money for those campaigns. Early in his career, he worked for former Sen. Bob Menendez. He also worked closely with former state Senator Ray Lesniak, a Democrat from Union County who rose to a leadership role and ran for governor in 2017. Caddle also worked on campaigns to elect members of the Elizabeth Board of Education and on municipal elections in Perth Amboy, Bayonne, and Little Ferry. 
Caddle said he used dark-money funds for about a decade to skirt New Jersey’s pay-to-play laws, which restrict government contractors from making campaign donations. Dark money refers to nonprofit advocacy groups that are allowed to spend 49% of their budget on election campaigns and are not required to disclose their donors. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that this kind of campaign funding is constitutional. 
Caddle said he offered federal prosecutors information that would expose the secret donors, the elected officials who took the money, and the favors the officials did for those donors. But after his initial proffer — the statement cooperating witnesses provide about what they have to offer — neither the FBI nor the federal prosecutors followed up, he said. 
A recorded conversation obtained by the New Jersey Monitor documents a phone call between Caddle and his attorneys in the days before his sentencing. In that conversation, the attorney, Edwin Jacobs, tells Caddle that the U.S. Attorney’s Office is telling the judge that his cooperation was “stellar” and Caddle responds that he wishes he could tell the judge that. 
“But the problem is, after we did that initial proffer that you were at, they never questioned me about any of the other people,” Caddle says on a call he recorded with his attorneys. “I wish I could tell you they asked me about 37 people. They didn’t even ask me about the other four people on the proffer.”
In the conversation with his attorneys, Caddle says the only person investigators asked him about was Antonio Teixeira, the former chief of staff to state Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union).
Teixeira, 46, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and tax evasion and was sentenced to eight months of house arrest and three years’ probation in 2023, a month after Caddle was sentenced. Teixeira admitted that he had stolen approximately $100,000 from various campaign funds run by Caddle. 
Caddle said he is haunted by a phone conversation he had with Teixeira when the investigation was first closing in on him. Caddle said he told Teixeira that he was worried about becoming a cooperating witness, because a lot of his allies and colleagues were going to be hurt. Teixeira told Caddle he should do what’s best for his family, Caddle said. 
“My exact next words were, ‘If I do that, a lot of people will go to jail,’” Caddle said. “His exact words, without skipping a beat, was, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be all right.’”
Caddle now looks back at that conversation and believes Teixeira had the protection of powerful people.
“What do you mean you’re going to be all right? How are you going to be all right?” Caddle said. 
Teixeira didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
It’s impossible to know why the investigation never went any further. If there were a grand jury convened, that information would never be made public.
Peter Katz is a federal criminal defense lawyer in New Jersey who was a prosecutor for many years, worked on political corruption cases in New York, and then worked in Trenton for the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Katz said it’s not unusual to see no charges come from information provided by a cooperating witness. 
“The difficult part is when you have a piece of information, you have no idea how that fits into a larger picture,” Katz said.
He did not have any information about the Caddle case and spoke with the New Jersey Monitor to provide context. It’s impossible to know why prosecutors don’t bring a case because they are ethically bound to keep information secret if no charges are filed. 
“Usually it’s for a non-nefarious reason. It may be a manpower issue. It may be it doesn’t rise to the level of their interests. It may not align with what the U.S. attorney wants to focus on at the time. It may be there’s not enough evidence,” Katz said. “And it may be because of either incompetence or laziness or political persuasions. Certainly all those are possible. And I’ve certainly have unfortunately seen prosecutors do things that are unethical and inappropriate.”
Caddle looks back at the 20 months he was on home arrest, waiting for investigators to interview him. He thinks he was a patsy. 
“When it turned into a nothing burger, you know, you’re shaking your head going, ‘What happened here?’” Caddle said. 
The expectation among many was that Caddle’s cooperation would result in a major corruption case because he was allowed to remain at home for so long. 
“I remember so many different articles about, oh, how this is going to be the moment. And I’m reading these articles at home and I’m thinking to myself, Well boy, I don’t know what the hell they’re talking about. Like, I’m here. I’m not talking to anyone,” Caddle said. “And then you get frustrated, you develop anger, you get to feel like you got played.”

The state-backed grant will support BWXT's proposed TRISO fuel manufacturing facility in Gillette. 
The post Gordon awards $100M to northern Wyoming nuclear fuel manufacturer appeared first on WyoFile .","Gov. Mark Gordon on Friday awarded a $100 million state grant to BWXT to support its proposed $500 million nuclear fuel manufacturing facility in Gillette.
The Lynchburg, Virginia-based company, a longtime U.S. Navy contractor, says construction of its “Category II” TRISO fuel plant could begin next year, pending approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It’s expected to go online in 2030. 
TRISO consists of tiny enriched uranium pellets the size of poppyseeds, each encased in “carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products,” according to the Department of Energy. TRISO can withstand higher temperatures than traditional nuclear fuels, and the fuel never leaves the encased pellet, the agency says.
BWXT is the first and sole recipient of Wyoming’s Large Project Energy Matching Fund program, created in 2024. The fund, as well as the Energy Matching Funds grant program, are administered by the Wyoming Energy Authority, while the governor has sole discretion over final grant awards.

“This is about meeting real energy demand with real projects,” Gordon said in a prepared statement. “Energy Matching Funds are not about government picking winners; they are about responding to market signals and investing where private capital, innovation, and demand are already moving.”
BWXT’s project aligns with President Donald Trump’s “energy independence agenda,” Gordon said, by advancing U.S. nuclear energy amidst a desire for the industry to be less reliant on foreign nations for nuclear materials. It will also create an estimated 200 permanent jobs and will “contribute approximately $100 million in Gross State Product annually,” according to an Energy Authority analysis.
But the state grant programs, including the $100 million award to BWXT, have faced criticism. 
There’s significant opposition to BWXT’s nuclear fuel manufacturing project in coal country, explained Gillette City Councilman Jack Clary. Aside from the human health and environmental concerns, the state is essentially using its fossil fuel largess to support a private company that threatens to compete against Wyoming’s legacy energy industries, he said.
“Down the road, coal will take a big hit because of this,” Clary told WyoFile. “We’re taking that money that was generated by coal and oil and [natural] gas to help fund a private business. It’s just not what we feel the money should be used for. Why are we allowing [a Virginia company] to actually extract money out of state? It’s insane.”

Although the grant programs include a matching requirement, the concept of giving state money to private energy businesses has also come under fire in recent legislative sessions. 
Gordon, however, maintains it’s necessary for Wyoming to provide financial backing for new energy projects in a highly competitive arena. “A former Legislature made a smart, forward-looking, say-yes-to-Wyoming decision,” Gordon said, referring to the creation of the grant programs. “States across the country are competing for these projects every day. Wyoming is in that competition, and it’s one we intend to win.”
Nuclear divisions
BWXT’s nuclear fuel manufacturing plant represents Wyoming’s third major foray into “advanced” U.S. nuclear energy. 
Portions of TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear power plant are already under construction near Kemmerer. The $4 billion project is backed by a $2 billion commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Meanwhile, Radiant Industries’ proposal to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing plant in Natrona County divided both residents and elected officials, in part, because it would have required storing spent nuclear fuel at the facility. Political division swelled when Radiant announced in October that it was withdrawing its plans in Wyoming and taking the project to Tennessee.
Though BWXT’s project does not include storing spent nuclear fuel waste, its reception among public officials in Campbell County and Gillette has been mixed. In a 6-1 vote, the Gillette City Council agreed to submit a letter of support for the $100 million grant to BWXT, the Gillette News Record reported, while the board of county commissioners declined to do the same. Two commissioners submitted a letter of support independent of the body, according to the News Record.
Clary, the lone dissenting vote on the city council, said he worries that a perennial effort to roll back Wyoming’s ban on storing spent nuclear fuel waste from out of state will eventually come to fruition and force radioactive waste on Wyoming communities that don’t want it.
“All you need is some money, a couple lawyers and policies do change,” Clary said.
Gillette Mayor Shay Lundvall indicated the community can help advance nuclear energy without sacrificing its efforts to preserve the coal, oil and gas industries.
“Gillette has always powered this nation, and now we are expanding that legacy,” Lundvall said in a prepared statement. “Governor Gordon’s decision to award BWXT significant matching funds is a clear vote of confidence in our people, our community and our role in America’s energy and technology future.”

The government is illegally allowing a Trump donor’s drilling company to skirt a court ruling that halted development at a Delaware-sized oilfield, conservationists claim.
The post Drillers say ‘political process’ outweighs environmental law in Wyoming oilfield appeared first on WyoFile .","“The political process,” and not environmental law, governs the development of a Delaware-sized oil and gas field in central Wyoming, drilling companies argue in an ongoing lawsuit that challenges the Converse County Oil and Gas Project.
A drilling magnate whose acolytes now oversee federal agencies in charge of oil and gas permitting made that argument — and others — through his company’s Dec. 8 court filing.
Harold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources, donor to President Donald Trump and friend and associate of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, is watching his company’s prospects flourish as Converse County drilling proceeds despite a temporary injunction imposed by a Washington, D.C. court.
Continental, along with Devon Energy, Anschutz Exploration and the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, is fighting a new claim by the Powder River Basin Resource Council and Western Watersheds Project in the 3-year-old suit. The energy companies are aligned with the state of Wyoming and the federal government — all opposing a new claim that developers are skirting a court’s 2024 temporary injunction.
Federal Judge Tanya Chutkan last year halted drilling across 1.5 million acres until environmental questions raised in the original lawsuit are resolved. The conservation groups want to supplement their 2022 suit after the Bureau of Land Management this summer issued 255 permits to drill in the area and development apparently began, their filings state.
“Just because [conservationists] wish BLM had decided differently does not mean that they can enlist this Court under the guise of judicial review to delay or block the Project.” Continental Resources
But some environmental laws don’t apply to the development, despite conservationists’ claims, Continental and its allies say. In a court brief, the drilling companies said the Bureau of Land Management has analyzed the environmental damage drilling will cause and greenlighted the project.
“BLM analyzed the relevant impacts and feasible alternatives in its 1,108-page [Final Environmental Impact Statement],” the brief states. The agency in the last year also wrote shorter environmental reviews to authorize the 255 permits.
“Just because [conservationists] wish BLM had decided differently does not mean that they can enlist this Court under the guise of judicial review to delay or block the Project,” Continental and the other drillers wrote. “The political process, and not [the National Environmental Policy Act], provides the appropriate forum in which to air policy disagreements.”
The political process
Hamm’s “political process” includes donating millions of dollars to Trump’s campaigns, causes and aligned political action committees. Critics say the donations, documented by numerous media outlets, gave Hamm influence over energy policy and the political appointees who implement it.
In addition to Burgum atop the Department of the Interior, Trump appointed Hamm’s associate Chris Wright as Secretary of Energy. Last year, the University of Wyoming hosted Hamm at a fireside chat, honoring him as a “titan of industry” for advancements in fracking and horizontal drilling.
Gov. Mark Gordon joined Hamm, the executive chairman of Continental, at a Houston industry conference earlier this year and hailed both the Oklahoma oilman and Trump. “The new administration — with energy friends Doug Burgum and Chris Wright — understands states know how to manage their resources best,” Gordon said, according to one report.

The BLM issued the permits under agency “resource management plans” instead of relying on the overarching Environmental Impact Statement for the entire 5,000-well drilling proposal. That impact statement prompted the conservation lawsuit in 2022 and the temporary injunction. Judge Chutkan based her stop-work finding on a federal misrepresentation of groundwater impacts.
The BLM re-wrote that section of the statement and this summer began issuing drilling permits. Those permits, however, cited the resource plans, not the Environmental Impact Statement, as the authority under which drilling could begin.
Conservationists called foul and are asking to update their suit with new claims. That’s where the issue sits today, with conservationists and industry advocates at loggerheads over whether the suit can be updated and supplemented.
Pollution, odors, hazards
The latest round of court filings is long on legal arguments rather than the effects of drilling itself. The conservation groups don’t have a stake in the development — they lack “standing” — drilling advocates say. Powder River and Western Watersheds shouldn’t be allowed to bring new claims in a case that is close to resolution, drillers contend.
Developers also question the chance of conservationists’ success and whether claims of potential environmental destruction have already been legally resolved. Drillers said allowing the new claims would “scuttle any hope of timely final resolution” of the suit.
The new conservation claim “seeks to unnecessarily complicate this simple process, delay resolution of pending matters, and yoke separate and distinct agency decisions to unrelated matters before the Court,” the Department of Justice stated. “[T]his Court should deny the Groups’ motion to file a supplemental complaint,” Wyoming said.
The BLM’s permits were issued “in circumvention of the interim injunction,” the conservationists claim. The new claims are closely related to the original suit, and rules require judges to freely grant new pleadings, the conservation groups say.
To establish standing, the supplemental requests say that Maria Katherman and others are affected by the industrialization of the area. Members of the group who visit the wide-open landscape will suffer “exposure to air pollution, industrial noise, noxious odors, and traffic hazards; reduced wildlife viewing opportunities; deteriorated viewsheds and scenic enjoyment, including stargazing; and other harms.”
During one visit, “Katherman counted 42 semi trucks in just a 5-mile stretch, all hauling gravel or fracking sand,” conservationists state. The conservation groups say development could extirpate 54 sage grouse breeding ground leks and threaten more than 1,000 raptor nests.
Conservationists fought the firing of a BLM employee who they say was unjustly terminated by Trump’s first administration after standing up for wildlife protections.
Chutkan had not scheduled further action after Powder River and Western Watersheds filed their last brief Friday.
Continental claims an environmental ethos. Wildlife preservation is “a fundamental aspect of our operations,” the company states. Hamm is a philanthropist, donating millions to diabetes research and education, the University of Wyoming said.

The Forest Service resumes the long-delayed process to manage climbing in the popular canyon. Now it’s seeking public feedback.  
The post Feds propose ending ban on climbing route development in Tensleep Canyon — again appeared first on WyoFile .","The much-delayed federal plan to manage rock climbing on the soaring cliffs of Tensleep Canyon has resumed, laying the groundwork for climbers to renew route development after a nearly six-year ban. 
The U.S. Forest Service released a draft environmental assessment last week, and is seeking public comment through Jan. 20. The plan’s proposed actions include opening the canyon back up to conditional rock-climbing route development — which groups like Bighorn Climbing Coalition have long urged. That would put an end to a ban that’s been in place since 2019 in the recreation destination.
This is the third iteration of a plan that users have awaited for years. This one is accompanied by an extensive inventory of climbing routes. It lists the locations as well as pertinent conditions such as trail erosion or cliffs where the rock has been chipped away or glued — a controversial practice known as “manufacturing.” 
Sport climbing is characterized by the use of metal anchors permanently bolted into the cliff face. Climbers attach carabiners and ropes to them as they ascend. The prevailing ethos among climbers is that humans should not interfere with the natural rock resource by manipulating the route to improve the climbing experience. 
But without guardrails on climbing development, route building on Bighorn National Forest — and other public land — has historically occurred with little oversight, a reality that has spurred conflicts. The Tensleep Canyon plan could change that by setting development ground rules for the canyon. 
The draft details steps to significantly update an area that’s been hit by impacts of heavy use including rogue trails, crammed parking lots, improper disposal of human and pet waste, erosion at the bases of cliffs and a proliferation of dispersed camping. Proposed changes include adding up to 16 miles of mostly existing trails to the National Forest Service’s network, re-naturalizing 2.2 miles of closed or rerouted trails, prohibiting dispersed camping in certain areas, installing vault toilets in four locations and designing a parking area to accommodate up to 50 parking spaces.

Under the proposed action plan, the Forest Service would close the Leigh Creek Research Natural Area entirely to sport climbing and remove all 25 existing routes there. Sensitive plant and animal species have been identified in that zone.
The plan also proposes improving staging areas — spots at the base of routes where climbers spend time while roping up and belaying — with materials like retaining walls and staircases. That proposal aims to minimize erosion and other impacts. 
Starts and stops 
It wasn’t long ago that Tensleep Canyon was an off-the-beaten-path climbing area. Word got out, and in an era of social media and growing interest in the sport, the former backwater half an hour east of Worland has become one of the most popular sport-climbing destinations in the Northern Rocky Mountains, according to the U.S. Forest Service.
The federal land-management agency anticipated the sport’s rise. A 2005 resource management plan predicted climbing in Tensleep Canyon would require formalized management and included recommendations to develop a management plan.
It wasn’t until a climbing conflict roiled the canyon in 2019, however, that the agency diverted energy and resources toward that plan in a meaningful way.
Climbers had discovered what they believed was widespread, manufactured climbing routes. This process of either gluing holds to the rock or chipping them out using drills or hammers can be used to turn a featureless rock wall into a climbable route. While some degree of TLC is often employed to blow out loose stones or clean up routes during development, most climbers agree that significantly altering the character of the rock is unacceptable.

At the height of the route development controversy in Tensleep Canyon, a group of climbers chopped several routes — removing the bolted equipment from the rock — and secured padlocks on bolts at the base of other routes. (Screenshot/Facebook/Ten Sleep Canyon Aerospace Society) 

A battle grew over ethical development, who the culprits were and how to make them stop. That boiled over in a nighttime raid by climbers who manually chopped bolts from rock faces and affixed padlocks to bolts.
Following these heated actions, the Forest Service in July 2019 halted the establishment of any new climbing routes or trails in the entire Bighorn National Forest. It then began work on the plan, which stands to be one of only a handful of Forest Service plans specifically focused on climbing. The Forest Service has no national-level guidance on climbing. 
The district initiated a scoping process in 2021, but the process was put on ice after then-District Ranger Traci Weaver and other key players left their positions. Inventories started in 2022, and the Forest Service resumed the project in 2023. But it was paused again last year due to further turnover and a desire for more time to consult with Native American tribes. 
All told, forest officials met with historic preservation and other representatives from the Northern Arapaho, Eastern Shoshone, Crow, Northern Cheyenne, Sioux and other tribes on the matter, according to the Bighorn National Forest. 
What now?
The agency’s Powder River District office released the new 27-page Environmental Assessment last week. The public can view it, along with the inventory, implementation guidance and other documents, at this online project page or learn more through a StoryMap. Comments are due Jan. 20. 
The project area encompasses 26,544 acres located in the southern Bighorn range between the towns of Ten Sleep and Buffalo. Though area recreators also include OHV riders, hunters and skiers, the plan hones in on climbing.

“Bighorn National Forest staff need a climbing management plan to effectively manage rock climbing … to minimize user conflict, and to protect the area’s resources,” the office stated in a press release. 
The proposed actions are all designed to that end, it states. A major part of that is enacting a review and approval process for new rock climbing route development. 
The proposed plan would allow route development under certain conditions. It could occur “only where rock climbing would not negatively impact wildlife and botany sensitive species,” for example. It couldn’t negatively impact traditional cultural use areas either. 
In addition, the guidelines would “prohibit route development that removes rock from areas except where the rock in its natural position poses a risk to the climbing party or a future climbing party,” and “would prohibit gluing, attaching artificial holds, or using mechanical equipment to create holds where a natural hold did not exist.”

From Miss Frontier to the U.S. Senate, columnist Kerry Drake writes, Lummis has had remarkable success in state and federal offices. 
The post Lummis not running again changes 2026 political strategies appeared first on WyoFile .","If I had known I’d be interviewing a future U.S. senator, I would have probably worn something a bit more formal for the occasion on that hot July afternoon in 1976.

Opinion

Then again, I couldn’t. Cowboy hat, boots, Western shirt and jeans were the required uniform for anyone who wanted a press pass to Cheyenne Frontier Days. I looked like a drugstore cowboy but didn’t mind. The beer in the press box was cold and free, which is how I, and all the others covering the biggest rodeo in the country, liked it.
Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a former Miss Frontier, dropped a bombshell last Friday that she’s not running for re-election to one of the nation’s safest Senate seats. My mind turned to our first professional encounter nearly a half-century ago. I had only been a reporter for the Wyoming State Tribune for three months.
Lummis was already on the roof above the stands, watching bulls and riders coming out of the chutes. Wearing a white buckskin outfit and braided pigtails, she definitely looked like rodeo royalty. 
Our conversation didn’t include a drop of politics, by my recollection.
We talked about her cowgirl life growing up on a large Laramie County ranch. Her father, Doran Lummis, was chairman of the Laramie County Republican Party and a county commissioner in the 1960s. While she was obviously proud of her dad, I don’t recall her expressing any aspiration to follow in his footsteps into public service. 
She did, though, beginning in 1979. Lummis, then 24, is still the youngest female legislator ever elected to the Wyoming House. In 2020, she became the first woman U.S. senator to represent the Equality State.
I don’t know if serving as Miss Frontier played much of a role in her early success, but publicity certainly didn’t hurt. Once she was in the Legislature, Lummis’ political career took off. 

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who isn’t running for a second term, was the 1976 “Miss Frontier” at Cheyenne’s Frontier Days. She’s a member of the rodeo’s Hall of Fame. (courtesy Cheyenne Frontier Days Old West Museum)

Lummis received her law degree at the University of Wyoming in 1985, spent 14 years in the Legislature, clerked for the Wyoming Supreme Court, was elected state treasurer in 1998 and served two terms.
Then she was elected to the U.S. House and re-elected twice before taking a break from politics in 2016. But four years later, when Wyoming’s U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi retired, she was back campaigning for his open seat. Lummis raised $3 million for the GOP primary and general elections, an impressive sum for Wyoming politics, and defeated her Democratic opponent by 46%.
One of the reasons Lummis decided to leave after her term expires is that she’s tired.
“Deciding not to run for re-election does represent a change of heart for me, but in the difficult, exhausting session weeks this fall, I’ve come to accept that I do not have six more years in me,” the 71-year-old senator said in a news release. 
I can relate. I haven’t had the stress of campaigning; I’ve just covered them. While Lummis kept climbing the ladder, my career literally flatlined. I’ve done the same thing for 49 years: talk to interesting people and write it up.
But I did hang up my cowboy reporter costume in the early 1980s, and after various stints as a photographer, sportswriter, legislative reporter, film critic, entertainment editor and managing editor, I decided my true passion was reporting and commenting on Wyoming politics. 
Lummis and I live in two vastly different political worlds. Trump is one of her heroes, and I can’t wait until he’s out of office. Things were much simpler when we were younger and could enjoy watching the rodeo while she told me what life was like on her family’s ranch.
Lummis’ decision leaves many Republican candidates scurrying to see if there’s a place for them on the 2026 ballot. That only happens when a veteran politician unexpectedly retires and injects some life into what seemed like a pretty dull campaign season, except for electing a new governor to replace term-limited Gov. Mark Gordon.
For political columnists like me, this is an early Christmas present I didn’t dream of happening.
With the holiday just two days away, I’d like to say please, please, please! to Santa: Give us a U.S. House race between Gordon and Secretary of State Chuck Gray, two men who really don’t like each other.
You might be wondering why I’m talking about the House, when Lummis is in the Senate. I’m guessing Hageman will run for the upper chamber, leaving the lower chamber for the taking.  
Gordon has no state office to return to, so relocating to Washington, D.C., would be the perfect next step. He’s always had a high approval rating as a moderate governor, and he’s vetoed some of the far-right Freedom Caucus’ worst ideas.
Gray desperately wants to run for another office, as evidenced by the “Elect Gray” advertisements that ran during the Chicago Bears game Saturday. The spots didn’t say for what office, just elect him!
One thing is certain: Gray has no appetite for taking on U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, the early favorite to replace Lummis.
We’ll have to see how well the Hageman juggernaut, which began when she trounced Liz Cheney in 2022, holds up, and who will challenge her. Hageman will likely win, but Cheney’s downfall proved that no Wyoming pol is invincible.
The governor’s race could be a lightning rod for every House Freedom Caucus lawmaker and Senate ally. Non-officeholders already campaigning are Brent Bien and Joseph Kibler. Reportedly showing interest are Rep. Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, and Senate President Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester.
The more ultra-conservatives who dilute the gubernatorial candidate pool, the easier it will be for moderate Sen. Eric Barlow, R-Gillette, to win. 
The Freedom Caucus has the opportunity to see if it can retain power and grow an agenda aligned with Lummis that she no longer feels the need to lead. Lummis and I are hoping for different outcomes, but after 50 years of this, maybe we can both sit back and enjoy the show.

(Courtesy of the Idaho Supreme Court)The Idaho Supreme Court has dismissed a lawsuit from a bidder for an Idaho Medicaid contract to run mental health services.
The Dec. 18 decision upheld a lower state court’s decision to dismiss the lawsuit by Beacon, resolving a years-long legal dispute over a managed care contract that is likely Idaho state government’s largest contract, valued at $1.2 billion over four years.

Before Idaho awarded the company Magellan the contract to run Medicaid mental health services in 2023, Beacon initially had the highest score for its bid — but the state disqualified the company due to past work that officials said was related to the contract. 
Later in 2023, two separate Idaho district court judges dismissed lawsuits by Beacon and Optum, another bidding company that didn’t win the contract. The judges agreed that they lacked jurisdiction to review the state’s contract award decision, citing limits on judicial review in the State Procurement Act, Idaho’s government contracting law, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Optum’s lawsuit was dismissed in the Idaho Supreme Court in 2024. Last week, the Idaho Supreme Court ruled on Beacon’s appeal.
“… We hold the State Procurement Act does not violate the Idaho Constitution’s separation of power’s doctrine,” the Supreme Court ruled on Dec. 18. 
Beacon’s national affiliate, Carelon Behavioral Health, could not be immediately reached for comment. 
In a statement Monday, Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said the state Supreme Court “reinforced the authority of the Idaho Legislature to define when district courts may review agency actions of the executive branch.”
“As my office argued and the Court concluded, such authority is vested in the legislative branch by the Idaho Constitution,” Labrador said. “If Carelon had prevailed, losing bidders in government contracts could drag the state into court over every major contract and ask judges to second-guess agency decisions and invalidate billion-dollar agreements that Idahoans depend on for health care, roads, and critical services.”
As Idaho faces a projected budget shortfall, the contractor Magellan has cut critical mental health services. The contract to run Idaho Medicaid mental health services is called the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan.

Critics argue the policy has far-reaching implications and undermines academic freedom. (Photo: courtesy of Naseem Rakha)Once upon a time I consulted with a local nonprofit that needed help revising a client satisfaction questionnaire. Years earlier, I had apprenticed as a survey researcher, so I knew how to do this sort of thing. It’s a craft like any other. I fixed several problems with the old questionnaire and drafted a new version that would yield better data. People in the organization were grateful and happily paid me for my work.
A few months later, my contact at the organization called to say that they were ready to deploy the questionnaire, but they hadn’t had time to make the changes I recommended. He wanted to know if I thought it would be okay to use the old version. We were on the phone, so he didn’t see me roll my eyes. I said that using the old version would likely reproduce the problems they’d encountered before, but it was entirely up to them to decide what to do. It was their questionnaire, their data, and their effectiveness at stake, hence their choice.
In that instance, I hoped that people in the organization would value my work and benefit from it. But I wasn’t invested in controlling the product. It was as if they’d brought me a lamp to fix; once the repair was done, it wasn’t up to me to say where or when it could be turned on. This is how it is with “works for hire,” or what are often called in university contexts “directed works.” The creator of the work, no matter the expertise involved, relinquishes control of the product to whoever paid for the work to be done.
I have never thought of a syllabus this way.   
Over the course of a 40-year teaching career, which included stints at a community college, two four-year colleges, and three research universities, no one ever suggested that the syllabi I created for my courses were works made for hire—with all that this implied. None of my colleagues, as far as I knew, thought of their syllabi as works for hire, either. Nor did any department chair, department head, dean, or other administrator ever suggest such a thing. Syllabi—the documents that describe what a course will cover, how it will unfold, and what students will be expected to do—were seen as the intellectual property of the instructors who created them. 
But now, under a new policy, this would no longer be true in the UNC System. Peter Hans, UNC System president, has said—with little prior consultation with faculty—that course syllabi will be considered directed works, copyrighted and owned by the UNC System, not the instructors who created them. To some, this might seem like a small change. After all, faculty don’t usually hoard their syllabi; in fact, we eagerly share them with colleagues and students. You’re interested in my course? Great! Here’s the syllabus. 
And yet, the impending UNC policy is cause for concern. Because of the far-reaching implications of defining syllabi as directed works—the same, in effect, as calling them works made for hire—this policy can be seen as a trojan horse, sneaked in the back door and potentially usable later as a tool for controlling course content and undermining academic freedom. 
As with the questionnaire I mentioned at the outset, the content, character, and use of works made for hire are the province of whoever commissions the work. If syllabi are defined as such works, the same legal principles would apply. University administrators could say what must be included or excluded, the form a syllabus must take, and how the syllabus can be used—perhaps even whether a faculty member can share it with others or allow it to be reprinted. All this becomes legally permissible if a syllabus is owned by the university. This would amount to an extraordinary transfer of control.
I grant that this is a slippery-slope argument, and that the slope might be less slippery than I fear. Perhaps nothing worse will happen going forward. Yet in the current political climate, fear is warranted. Consider that the directed works policy is part of a larger policy change that defines syllabi as public records that must be provided to any interested party. What prompted this change? A snooping mission by the Heritage Foundation, a DC-based right-wing outfit that aims to purge US education of anything that smacks of DEI, critical race theory, or “gender ideology,” or insufficiently reveres free-market fundamentalism.
There is nothing secret about this. 
In its widely publicized Project 2025 report, “Mandate for Leadership,” which has come to serve as a policy manual for the Trump administration, the Heritage Foundation is clear about wanting education at all levels in the US to promote free markets and other so-called American values, while denying oxygen to DEI, critical race theory, gender studies, and area studies. When Heritage Foundation personnel wanted to pore through the syllabi of UNC System faculty for evidence of heresy, they were initially daunted—because syllabi were not consistently defined as public records (e.g., at UNC-Greensboro, they were; at UNC-Chapel Hill, they were not). Peter Hans’s policy diktat will change this.
The Foundation’s “Mandate for Leadership” also includes this line: “[S]tates should require schools to post classroom materials online to provide maximum transparency to parents.” Although the new UNC System policies regarding syllabi do not go this far, they are a step in the same direction, in service to the same goal: making education great again for white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism. As faculty objecting to the policy argued, making syllabi public isn’t really about transparency for the benefit of students, as Hans claims, but about making faculty and their courses easier targets for outside critics with an ideological agenda.  
If faculty revise their syllabi to avoid being targeted, critics will likely demand to see classroom materials, as the Heritage Foundation calls for. If the demand for “maximum transparency” applies to K-12 public schools, why not to public universities as well? If syllabi are public documents, why not an instructor’s PowerPoint slides or handouts? For that matter, why are these latter works—also created as part of an instructor’s job—any less works made for hire than a syllabus? It’s not that the sky is falling; it’s that the logic of how the sky can be made to fall is right in front of us and seems to be guiding policy-making in the UNC System.
In the end, outside critics of higher education might not get much traction; if protected by the formal rules and informal norms of academic freedom, faculty can ignore such criticism, if they so choose. But when syllabi are defined as works made for hire or directed works, the situation changes. Now the entity that commissioned the work—the employer, the university—gains the power to say what the work may include, must include, may exclude, and must exclude. Now we’re talking not just about grading rubrics and assignments but potentially about course content. This is the eventuality to which the trojan horse policy of defining syllabi as directed works could lead. Which would mean, to put it bluntly, the end of academic freedom.
In 2022, the board of governors of the Florida University System, political cousins to the UNC Board of Governors, claimed that speech by professors in public universities is “government speech,” therefore subject to regulation by government officials. Such regulation was further said to include university curricula and course content. It’s a nutty idea, one that the courts have so far rejected. But the idea that professors should be brought to heel and allowed to teach only what is congenial to the far right still has a heartbeat. Listen closely and you can hear it beneath the words “directed work.”

(StockPlanets/Getty Images)West Virginia schools are increasing their online safety training for students to educate children on the dangers of sharing sexually explicit photographs with others. 
In November, 15-year-old Kanawha County student Bryce Tate was found dead by a self-inflicted gunshot wound hours after he was targeted in an online sextortion scheme.
Predators, typically outside of the United States, coerce victims into taking and sending sexually explicit photos and videos then immediately demand payment or threaten to release the photo to the victim’s family and friends, according to the FBI. It is a financially motivated crime.
State lawmakers passed a bill in 2024 requiring public schools to implement an age-appropriate cyber security training program for children, known as the Cyber SWAT program, or Safety While Accessing Technology. The program would teach students about the long-term and unforeseen consequences of sharing sexually suggestive or sexually explicit materials and how sharing it could be connected to bullying, sextortion and human trafficking. 
Sen. Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio
Sen. Laura Chapman, R-Ohio, a sponsor of the bill, said that as a mother of two, she felt compelled to make sure West Virginia students know about the risks of sending nude photos online. It could lead to sextortion, she warned. 
“Kids feel like they have no options, they’re in a panic. Unfortunately, a lot of people in that situation do take their lives,” she said. “Those poor children didn’t know what to do, and probably had never heard of a situation like this.”
Prior to the legislation, the West Virginia Department of Education was already providing cyber awareness and security lessons, according to department spokesperson Christy Day. The Cyber SWAT program is a defined curriculum that has to be the same in all counties for students in third through 12th grade. 
“This is an online platform designed in a game format that allows children to experience various situations, some of which are very sensitive, and answer questions as to how they should handle them. As students answer correctly, they progress through the game.” Day explained.
The bill required that each county school board implement the SWAT education program beginning with the 2025-2026 school year. Day said the app was made available within the first semester of this school year. 
Language in the legislation required the SWAT education program to be based on specific learning and modeling concepts. The bill didn’t come with any new funding for the schools to implement the training. 
“The non-profit organization Safe Surfin’ Foundation and the company Skyll were the vendors that could meet the requirements listed above in the legislation,” Day said. “Due to the sensitive nature of the content, several rounds of testing and revisions were necessary to provide age-appropriate content to children at both the elementary and secondary levels while also meeting the requirements of the legislation. The build and testing phase required extensive testing and revisions to ensure the game would provide the necessary learning experience within the context of mature subject matter.”
“Once this was achieved, the app was made available during the first semester of the 2025-26 school year,” she continued.
Chapman, who amended the bill to include an implementation date, hoped the program would be rolled out swiftly in hopes of preventing any future student tragedies. 
She said the bill provided “a toolkit for these students who are in this situation to know where to turn, to know how to report it, to know that they themselves are not going to be in trouble.”
West Virginia lawmakers this year passed legislation banning cell phones in classrooms — an initiative requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey. County boards of education were required to create and adopt a policy that includes whether cellphones are permitted on school grounds and what the consequence would be for students who violate the policy. 
Day said West Virginia public schools “want to support communities and families in providing safe environments for children regardless of whether they are inside of or outside of the school building.”

Bill Lee has been silent on his plans  (Photo: Getty Images)As a deadline looms for states to opt into a federal program to feed low-income kids during the summer, Gov. Bill Lee has yet to announce whether Tennessee will participate.
States have until Jan. 1 to decide whether they will give families with children the opportunity to draw on the federal nutrition program funding in 2026. 
Last year, citing rising administrative costs to the state, Lee made the decision to forgo Tennessee’s participation in Summer EBT, rejecting $84 million in federal funding allocated to feed more than 700,000 Tennessee children living in poverty during summer break, when in-school free and reduced costs breakfast and lunch are not available.
Lee has thus far declined to reveal his decision about whether Tennessee will rejoin the program, known as SUN Bucks, for the summer of 2026. The governor’s office did not respond to emailed questions Monday.
Meanwhile child advocates, faith leaders and elected officials have urged the governor to rejoin the Summer EBT program, citing the urgent need to address child nutrition in Tennessee, where one in five under the age of 18 face hunger.
Tennessee launches its summer food benefits this week. Most students in the state will miss out.

On Monday, a letter signed by 314 faith leaders across Tennessee urged Lee to rejoin the food program.
“To refuse federal partnership which can address that hunger is morally wrong, economically insane, and constitutionally inconsistent with the peace, safety, and happiness of the people,” said Rev. Gordon Myers, a retired Lutheran pastor from Memphis who signed onto the letter.
County mayors have also urged Lee to participate in the program.
“With the state’s decision to opt out of the federal Summer EBT program, families have lost access to a crucial benefit — $120 per eligible child — that helps pay for groceries when school cafeterias are closed,” a letter to Lee signed by more than 30 Tennessee county mayors said.
“Summer should be a time of joy, not hunger. Yet, this year, too many Tennessee children are going without the meals they need,” they wrote.



				Mayors asking for Gov. Bill Lee to opt into Summer EBT are those from Bedford, Campbell, Cannon, Chester, Claiborne, Clay, Coffee, Crockett, Dyer, Franklin, Gibson, Hancock, Hardeman, Hawkins, Jackson, Jefferson, Lewis, Lincoln, Marion, Marshall, Maury, Moore, Morgan, Pickett, Polk, Rhea, Smith, Stewart, White and Wilson. 			


In a separate letter to the governor, Sen. Lamar London, a Memphis Democrat, called the Summer EBT program “a commonsense way to make sure kids don’t go hungry just because school is out. These funds help parents stretch tight grocery budgets and this shopping supports our supermarkets and state economy.”
Republican states reject EBT
The Summer EBT program was established by the Biden administration in 2023 as pandemic-era food programs wound down.
Akin to food stamps, SUN Bucks provide families a debit card loaded with cash to use at the grocery store during the months that in-school meals aren’t available. Parents who meet the low-income requirements received $40 per month per child.
In 2024, more than a dozen Republican governors rejected Summer EBT funding, citing reasons ranging from administrative costs to opposition to “attempts to expand the welfare state.”
Lee also announced in 2024 that the state would forgo the funding beginning in 2025, citing administrative costs. In 2024 the state spent $5 million to administer the program. 
But after facing blowback for opting out of the program, Lee launched a smaller state-funding pilot program. 
Lee’s Summer Nutrition Initiative last summer operated in 15 counties, providing 18,000 students the same per-child funding as the federal program: $120 for each child for a total state expenditure of $3 million in the selected counties. 
Children in Tennessee’s other 80 counties, including the state’s urban centers in Shelby and Davidson, weren’t eligible.
National advocates have noted that Summer EBT, which brings in a flow of federal cash for low-income families to spend at Tennessee grocery stores, has an economic impact beyond dinner tables. 
The 2024 economic impact of Summer EBT in Tennessee, before Lee rejected the funding, was more than $115 million, according to the Food Research & Action Center.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Dozens of children, some dressed as angels, shepherds, and farm animals, stood flanked by twinkling blue and white lights as they sang Ukrainian Christmas carols at a Raleigh church recently.
Nearly four years ago, many of the children on stage were forced to flee their homes as Russian forces swept into Ukraine and drone strikes turned their neighborhoods to rubble. For some, it was their first opportunity to share in the cultural tradition of Vertep with other Ukrainian families since leaving home.
Held on Saint Nicholas Day, Dec. 6, Vertep marks the start of weeks of yuletide celebration in Ukraine. The performance is what Ukraine House founder Iryna Borodina describes as a “Ukrainian interpretation” of the nativity play, full of traditional folk songs and characters unique to the country. It’s the first time her organization has held the performance for Raleigh families.
Formed in the wake of the invasion, Ukraine House provides a Saturday school at Ridge Road Baptist Church in Raleigh where around 30 children learn Ukrainian art, history and language skills as well as activities like choir, guitar lessons, and ballet.
Parents say it is a crucial connection to the home their children were forced to leave behind. Some had lost much of their ability to read, write, and speak Ukrainian, more accustomed to English in day-to-day life. Others left at such an early age they never learned those skills in the first place.
“We left when [my daughter] was eight years old, so it was like second grade, and now she speaks English very well, more than Ukrainian,” said Yuliia Sytnyk, an art curator from Kherson who teaches at the Saturday school. “For kids, it seems like they get used to everything so fast, but of course it’s hard, all these changes.”

‘Each person tries to give something’
When Iryna Yermolaieva fled the war in Ukraine with her family, her oldest daughter had not yet started grade school. She did not know how to read and write in Ukrainian.
Traveling from place to place in Europe searching for refuge, there was no opportunity for her daughter to attend a Ukrainian school. It was only after coming to Raleigh that her child finally got the opportunity to become literate in her family’s language.
“We started attending classes in Ukrainian school, and in just a few months, she started reading Ukrainian,” Yermolaieva said. “She writes better than even me and my husband. Her handwriting is so perfect.”
Halyna Seredyuk, a longtime Ukrainian educator in the U.S. and overseas, was a big part of that journey. She has taught for 40 years, first as a high school teacher in Ukraine and then through Ukrainian Saturday schools abroad, including in Sweden and for roughly 20 years in Atlanta.

Seredyuk creates her own lesson plans, weaving in traditional Ukrainian proverbs such as Bdzhola mala, a y ta pratsyuye (“The bee is small, but it works too”). She brings back a big bag of handmade notebooks for the children every time she returns from a trip to Ukraine.
“They are reading, they are writing, they are talking,” Seredyuk said.
Though Yermolaieva’s daughter came to the school two months after classes began, Seredyuk worked one-on-one with her to get her up to speed. “She helped us so much,” Yermolaieva said.
Now, Yermolaieva volunteers her own time as a substitute teacher as many of the other parents do.“Each person tries to give something,” she said.
Yermolaieva said her daughters have made fast friends at the school. Her youngest, turning five years old this month, invited all of her classmates from the Ukrainian school to her birthday party.
“She just started [learning the] alphabet, a little bit of reading, art,” she said. “I hope everything will work out like with my oldest.”
At its core, she said, the school has provided an opportunity for her kids to experience their culture that she will be forever grateful for.
“I hope that this school will stay here for a long, long, long time and will help a lot of Ukrainian kids to know better their culture, language and history,” Yermolaieva said.
‘We need to build a new life’
Sytnyk, the former curator who teaches art at the school, feels she has no home to return to. “I don’t miss my home because I know that around, everything is destroyed,” she said.
Kherson’s population has fallen from nearly 300,000 to roughly one-fifth of that, with much of the city laid to waste under Russian occupation. Even two years after its liberation by Ukrainian troops, the city faces hundreds of drone attacks every week.

“Nothing exists right now, and we cannot come back [to] our life,” Sytnyk said. “That’s why we need to build a new life, and how it will be, it’s only God knows.”
Since coming to the U.S., Sytnyk has worked to keep the arts of Ukraine alive through visual and musical exhibits and hands-on workshops with institutions like UNC Chapel Hill, Carnegie Hall, and Yale.
One project she’s proudest of is a virtual tour of the vibrant home of Kherson artist Polina Raiko, its interior blanketed with painted representations of the artist’s grief. The home, a national cultural monument, was destroyed by floodwaters in 2023, after Russian soldiers destroyed a nearby dam.
She learned about the Saturday school program through Ukrainians in the Carolinas, a nonprofit that sprang up during the war to support the more than 2,000 refugees who have come to the state from Ukraine. As a teacher, she has brought her cultural expertise to the classroom.
Like Seredyuk, she has developed her own lesson plans for the classes at Ukraine House with the goal of connecting the children with their home country through its art. She also teaches a class for adults, open to Ukrainians as well as Americans who wish to better understand the country and its culture.
For a workshop on Petrykivka painting, a distinct floral pattern of painting originating from a village in Ukraine, she said some Ukrainian attendees came from as far as Wilmington.
“They said, ‘We don’t have anything about Ukraine, no events, nothing that we want to share with our kids,’” Sytnyk said.
“The parents want their kids to know about Ukraine and know their history, their culture, and it’s really important,” Sytnyk said. “Some people understood it only here when they’re so far from Ukraine.”
‘I live for two countries’
Under Borodina’s watch, the Ukrainian school has grown from a single weekly language class in 2022 to a full-fledged Saturday school, with four classes a day for everyone from preschoolers to fifth and sixth graders.
Borodina sees her work not as building an enclave for Ukrainians in the Triangle, but as creating a bridge between two nations.

“This school is a part of our war to save and preserve our culture,” Borodina said. “We do not want to allow our culture to disappear even in the USA, because Russia, for example, in this war declared that we are not existing, and our culture is not existing culture.”
In her view, the war has forced Ukraine to become a “global nation.” She is in communication with Ukrainian schools from all around the world, from North Carolina to Germany, aimed at raising a generation of children fluent in the cultures of their native and adopted countries — future ambassadors in a world where Ukraine must work alongside countries across the globe to defend itself and rebuild.
“Right now, I live for two countries,” she said. “This is my mission.”
But she’s troubled by a year of sometimes hostile rhetoric by President Donald Trump toward Ukraine’s government and deep uncertainty over the future immigration status of Ukrainian refugees in the U.S.
Unlike some families who belong to Ukraine House, Borodina does not wish for her children to remain in the United States indefinitely.
“I would like my children to come back to Ukraine,” she said. “Actually, I would like other American children to come back to Ukraine, because they are our heritage.”
She said she had plans to found a secondary school for Ukrainians that could serve a similar purpose in North Carolina, but abandoned those plans after Trump made it clear he would take a hardline stance on refugees.
But the school she leads and the welcoming community within it will persist, she says.
“I believe this Saturday school will live even without me,” Borodina said. “We [Ukrainians] used to help each other ourselves, always, and this is our history.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PB155044-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-23 06:12:15.551186

(Photo: Gabrielle Nelson/Buffalo’s Fire)RYDER, N.D.,  — Tyler Stafslien is a fourth-generation farmer who’s worked his family’s land in central North Dakota for about 20 years. Roughly half of his 2,500 acres are typically dedicated to soybeans, a major crop in the state and in the Mississippi River Basin. But growing soybeans has become less profitable over the last decade as input costs rose and the Trump administration’s tariff negotiations in 2018 and 2025 destabilized trade and strained farmers’ incomes. 
This year, wary of the precarious export market, Stafslien decreased his soybean acres by half.
“We’ve been experiencing in ag, the last couple of years, a downturn in commodity prices, a lot of that related to just a large supply across the globe of major commodities, but then you add this trade war on top of it, and it’s like the icing on the cake,” Stafslien said.
The administration announced on Dec. 8 a $12 billion fund for one-time payments to row crop farmers to offset a portion of their inflation- and trade-related losses in the 2025 crop year.
Farmers were asking for the federal relief funds and are happy the administration is finally answering, said Stafslien. But he’s still facing uncertainty. The administration has yet to announce how much money per acre eligible growers will be receiving, and the funds will not be distributed until February, further stressing farmers like him with large debt and growing interest.
“Payments announced this week must be followed by additional and expedient efforts to keep farmers on the land and to improve the farm safety net, leaving annual bailouts as cautionary historical context rather than ongoing policy,” David Howard, policy development director of the National Young Farmers Coalition, wrote in a statement Dec. 9. 
Farmers and farming associations are looking for longer term solutions: to diversify trade partners and increase domestic uses for soybeans as export revenues become less certain. Some, like Stafslien, are shifting to other crops, like corn and wheat.
Soybeans are the largest agricultural export in the U.S. The legume covers more than 81 million acres — or 10% — of all U.S. farmland, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported in September, and more than 40% of the nation’s soybeans are exported to other countries. 

U.S. farmers received $24.5 billion from soybean exports in 2024, with Chinese purchases accounting for $12.6 billion – roughly twice the amount purchased by the next five largest export partners combined, according to USDA data.
But this year, China stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans during tariff negotiations with the Trump administration, instead falling back on its relationships with Brazil and other South American countries to meet its soybean needs. For U.S. soybean farmers, this growing season ends with low prices, unsold harvests, big financial losses and uncertainty going into the next season despite a tentative new deal with China. 
“We learned firsthand that being heavily reliant on China for export sales is only good when things are good,” University of Tennessee Professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics Andrew Muhammad said.
How did we get here?
Soybeans brought by traders and missionaries from Asia first took root in North America in small quantities in the 1700s, but the USDA did not begin tracking soybeans as a crop until the early 1920s. 
Around that time, the USDA, land grant university extension agents and farm groups started to promote the soybean to farmers as a soil-fertilizing crop that yielded high-protein meal for animal feed, oil, and even meat replacements for human consumption. The Mississippi River Basin’s flat plains and intermittent rain proved to be ideal conditions for the crop. 
Soybeans gained a foothold on U.S. farms in “fits and starts” over several decades, author Matthew Roth writes in his book, “Magic Bean: The Rise of Soy in America,” but really took off as a cash crop after World War I. Its success was later buoyed by the Agricultural Adjustment Act that allowed soy plantings while restricting other commodities as a way to stabilize crop prices during the Great Depression, policies limiting foreign oils, and the growing need for animal feed and oil during World War II, according to Roth.
The crop helped diversify farming in the south and midwest. By the 1960s, Roth writes, “the soybean had insinuated itself thoroughly into the American diet,” but indirectly – as feed for the country’s livestock, oils for salads and derivatives in processed foods.

At the same time, soybeans proved to be a desirable product for international trade partners. In 1989, U.S. soybean exports totaled around $4 billion, about a fifth of which went to Japan. The Freedom to Farm Act in 1996 allowed farmers to plant single-crop fields, and with rising export demand from China starting in the early 1990s, many farmers chose to plant soybeans, Roth wrote.
In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization and gained better access to globalized trade with the organization’s members, including the U.S., according to Muhammad and the Council on Foreign Relations. From there, growth in China’s tourism economy and middle class spurred increased demand for meat protein, Muhammad said, heightening the country’s need for animal feed in the form of U.S. soybeans. 


 

By 2000, the crop was planted on more than 74 million U.S. acres, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service.
“Over time, China has grown, and it seems to be the case that our total export sales have grown with our exports to China,” Muhammad explained. “They’ve sort of driven that rise over the last two decades.”
Brazil’s soybean industry has competed with American exports since the 1970s, but since 2017 has consistently exported more than the U.S. 
When Trump first upped tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018, China retaliated, Muhammad said, and began investing more heavily in purchases and transportation infrastructure in Brazil. Their turn toward Brazil as a primary provider during trade negotiations in 2025 “represents a return on that investment (for China),” he said.
Farmers in the U.S. are reckoning with the fallout. 
Farming pains and changing plans
Justin Sherlock farms 2,400 acres of corn and soybeans in eastern North Dakota. His dad started farming in the early 2000s and he took over the farm in 2012.
“The last, you know, 13 years that I’ve been going, the last decade, has been pretty tough to really try and get established,” he said. 
For Sherlock, China coming to market very late in the 2025 harvest season was a blow to profits. Nearly one-quarter of the state’s agricultural exports hinge on soybeans, with China serving as the largest market for U.S. grain.
Sherlock was able to sell most of his soybean crop early to North Dakota soybean elevators — facilities that store the beans — which then found domestic processors in Nebraska and Kansas to sell to. But those domestic markets were also absorbing the supply that would typically be exported to China, so prices — around $8.65 per bushel — dropped significantly below Sherlock’s cost of production. He said he will lose “several hundred thousands of dollars” this year, on top of similar losses last year. 
“We just have to find a way to hopefully make it to next year,” he said. “That’s the struggle right now for a lot of producers.” 
Especially for young or beginning producers, said Sherlock, farmers will likely be having “tough financial discussions with their bankers and lenders.” Or, worst case scenario, these losses could mean losing their farms.
“You cannot have a successful agriculture industry in North Dakota without trade,” he said. “It’s so important that we fix these trade relationships and get back to doing business with other countries.” 

Trade uncertainty was keenly felt by soybean farmers in several Mississippi River Basin states, many of which lead the nation in soybean production and exports. 
Illinois accounts for 16% of the country’s total soybean exports, followed by Iowa with 13%, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service. North Dakota comprises 5% of national exports.
Even in states that aren’t among the country’s top producers, soybeans can make up a significant portion of the state farm economy. Tennessee ranks 16th in the nation for soybean exports, for example, but soybeans were the highest-ranked agricultural commodity produced in the state in 2023, bringing in more than $990 million in cash receipts. In 2025, soybeans covered nearly 1.5 million acres of Tennessee farmland – the most of any crop in the state – according to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture.
The USDA’s Economic Research Service reported in July that more soybeans are being processed domestically. Most of the soybeans that stay in the U.S. are crushed into oil and meal, and a majority of that meal goes toward feeding livestock. The oil is used in biofuels, for industrial uses, and in food. New crush facilities that separate the beans into oil and meal are under construction in North Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas and Ohio — states that previously shipped soybeans to other countries to be processed. Biofuel has increased domestic demand for soybeans — and crush facilities — since around 2010, providing an alternative for farmers facing lower demand from traditional export partners.
April Hemmes, a fourth-generation farmer in north-central Iowa, said in September that she is fortunate to have nearby options for her beans: there is an ethanol plant and a crush facility that makes soybean meal, biodiesel and food-grade oil, about 10 miles away from her farm. Farmers who don’t have those options will have a harder time adapting to changing export markets, she wrote in an email.
The lack of money in farmers’ pockets is trickling down to other sectors in farming communities, too, said John Bartman, a regenerative farmer working about 850 acres in northern Illinois. He pointed to farm equipment dealers and factories in Illinois and Iowa that are shuttering well-paying jobs because business has been so slow. 
“So it’s more than just farmers who have been affected by this,” Bartman said. 
What comes next? 
In October, China and the U.S. hammered out a trade agreement. China agreed to purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the year, according to the White House, and will purchase at least 25 million metric tons each year through 2028. USDA export sales data from Oct. 2 through Dec. 8 shows China made soybean purchases from the U.S. totaling about 2.8 million metric tons.
For comparison, China purchased an annual average of 29 million metric tons of soybeans from the United States between 2020 and 2024, according to The Center for Strategic and International Studies, an international public policy think tank.
The deal “really isn’t much of a trade deal at all,” Bartman said.
“We’ve just gone through this tariff war, which we’re still going through right now, and what did we get out of it? China agreed to buy less soybeans than what we had last year, and we as farmers have suffered the collateral damage from this,” Bartman said.
With low trade prices and higher input costs, he warned, “we have not improved our economic situation for next year.”
Bartman is among farmers who are promoting investment in domestic uses for soybeans, including biofuels and plastics, though he acknowledges that a market the size of China’s will be “very difficult” to replace.
Muhammad said the turbulence in the soybean exports market shows that disruption of stable trade policy has consequences, which can hurt some sectors more than others.
The U.S. agriculture sector is often a political target in trade disputes, he said, because other countries understand the agricultural community’s significance in U.S. politics.
“It’s not a major export in the context of all exports, but it’s a politically viable community, and it carries a lot of heft in the context of trade agreements and trade policy because of the national security nature of food,” Muhammad said.
Farmers who are eligible for the Trump administration’s $12 billion Farmer Bridge Assistance program should expect the USDA to announce payment rates for crops the week of Dec. 22, according to the department. Payments are limited to up to $155,000 per person or legal entity.
The program appears similar to a $10 billion aid package offered to farmers impacted by trade retaliation in 2018. Those subsidies did not cover all of farmers’ losses. 
For many farmers like Sherlock, these subsidies are a necessity for short-term survival. He said any farming subsidies he receives go straight to paying his bills and paying off loans.
“There will be a lot of producers, especially young, beginning producers, who won’t be able to make it and farm next year if we don’t do something to help them pay their bills from this year,” he said.
Even established producers are worried. Stafslien works land that’s been in his family since 1912, but the tough years are piling up. 
“This is my future. This is my retirement. I don’t have a 401k plan. I have a farm,” said Stafslien, who lives on the farm with his wife, Shannon, and their two kids. “If I have to keep burning through this equity, that’s very, very scary for my future and my family’s future.”

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s top oil regulator is pessimistic about oil prices for 2026 but says oil production should hold steady, due in part to new drilling technology companies are using to remain profitable.
“Every time somebody thinks that the industry is essentially kind of maxed out on their technical capabilities, they usually come through with some type of innovation,” said Nathan Anderson, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources.
North Dakota produced nearly 1.17 million barrels of oil per day in October, the most recent figure available. The market price of North Dakota crude oil averaged about $53 that month, close to the bare minimum producers need to make a profit and a drop of $14 per barrel since January.
“Operators generally have shut down or slowed down activity in the past at those levels,” Anderson said. “What we’re seeing now is these activity levels are continuing to maintain where they’re at in spite of that.”
North Dakota, the No. 3 oil producer in the nation, relies on oil and gas tax revenue for much of the state budget. The state maintains a revenue forecast to track that, based on oil production and fluctuations in prices. Oil production is nearly 2% above the state’s revenue forecast for the 2025-27 budget cycle, while the price was nearly 10% below forecast in October.

There are 27 drilling rigs active in North Dakota, compared to 37 a year ago at this time. The number of hydraulic fracturing crews dipped from 13 to seven in recent weeks, which Anderson said is partially due to budget constraints at the end of a calendar year. He expects activity will pick up in January. 
“Some of them are actually increasing activity,” Anderson said. “Each company has a slightly different business model on how they operate.”
One reason North Dakota oil production is stable, despite the dip in oil activity, is companies are drilling longer horizontal wells. Oil wells drilled in the Bakken typically drill vertically until they hit the Bakken rock formation about 2 miles underground, then curve horizontally for 2 miles. The surrounding rock is then fractured, or fracked, to release the oil. 
But companies are now drilling farther horizontally. More than 1,000 permits have been issued for wells that are drilled horizontally for 3 miles instead of 2. That accounts for 30% of all wells being completed, according to Department of Mineral Resources data. 
Some companies took it a step further in 2024 and began drilling horizontally for 4 miles. There have been 105 permits awarded for wells of that length, a fifth of which have been drilled and completed. 
These longer wells have made it economically feasible to drill in areas outside of the Bakken core, where wells are typically most productive. That has prompted more activity in areas like Divide County, Burke County and southern McKenzie County, Joel Brown, mineral services manager at Mineral Tracker, a subsidiary of First International Bank and Trust, said during a presentation this month.
Brown collected production data for wells in a portion of northern Mountrail County, one of those less productive regions, and shared his findings with the Board of University and School Lands. The typical Bakken wells produced 200,000 barrels of oil within an average of 46 months, and the 3-mile wells hit that mark in 22 months. 
The one well he analyzed that drilled for 4 miles horizontally in the area reached the milestone in eight months, Brown said. 
State-owned minerals projected to generate $8 billion in future royalty payments

The 200,000-barrel milestone is approximately when a well will “pay off,” said Gov. Kelly Armstrong, chair of the five-member board. If a company can recoup its investment quicker, then it can re-allocate those funds to a second well location, he said.
“Cash flow is their problem,” Armstrong said. “If they can pay off a well in eight months, they can drill more wells.”
The increased value offered by longer wells was evident this fall when the state held its highest-grossing auction of oil and gas rights in 14 years. The Department of Trust Lands, which manages state-owned minerals held in trust for the public, holds two lease sales a year. The October 2025 auction involved 64,000 acres and collected $49.5 million for the state.
“That acreage is now way more valuable than they previously thought in the past,” said Chris Suelzle, director of minerals management for the Department of Trust Lands. “You’re getting more out of a 3- or 4-mile lateral in your rate of return because you just don’t have to spend as much money.”
Those cost efficiencies will be particularly important while oil prices remain low. Anderson told lawmakers earlier in December he is pessimistic that oil prices will recover any time soon due to a combination of factors, including global oversupply. 
That oversupply is the primary factor contributing to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s price outlook for 2026. The agency’s data projects the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil to remain in the low $50s per barrel for all of 2026.
“It just doesn’t lend itself to me being bullish on oil prices in 2026,” Anderson said on Dec. 19. “I’m bearish probably for the next 12 months.”
The price of North Dakota oil will be slightly lower. North Dakota oil production is sold at a slight discount relative to West Texas Intermediate, factoring in the cost of transportation and refinery demand. The average discount in December was $6.61 per barrel according to North Dakota Pipeline Authority data.

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)Beginning New Year’s Day, West Virginian residents who rely on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program can no longer use their benefits to purchase soda. 
The state’s SNAP ban includes regular soda, diet soda and zero-calorie soda, but does not include water, milk, juice and energy drinks. The state defines soda as “any carbonated, non-alcoholic beverage that contains water, a sweetening agent, flavoring, and carbon dioxide gas to create carbonation.
The Trump administration approved West Virginia’s SNAP soda ban waiver along with that of several other states this year. 
The SNAP changes are one part of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. West Virginia was one of the first states in the nation to pass a sweeping ban of artificial dyes in foods sold in grocery stores and restaurants, another part of the MAHA agenda. The state also banned the use of some artificial food dyes in school lunches.
The SNAP soda ban is also part of a health initiative from Gov. Patrick Morrisey called the “Four Pillars of a Healthy West Virginia.” Other pillars included prohibiting the sale of certain food dyes in the state, and the “Mountaineer Mile” challenge to walk at least a mile a day. The governor has said the changes are “long overdue.”
“I’m happy now that in West Virginia, taxpayers are not going to be subsidizing soda and these sugary drinks — things that have no nutritional value and are directly linked to obesity, diabetes, a lot of other terrible health care outcomes,” Morrisey said during a news conference in August. 
Retailers who accept SNAP have been required to change their point of sale systems, which can cost up to thousands of dollars, Traci Nelson, president of the West Virginia Oil Marketers and Grocers Association told West Virginia Watch over the summer. 
Speaking to reporters last week, West Virginia Department of Human Services Secretary Alex Mayer said the department has been working with the state retailers association and federal Department of Agriculture to prepare for the change. 
“We meet with the Retailers Association regularly,” Mayer said. “So, what the team has been telling me is that the retailers are on board, and that there’s been progress, and that there’s been no indication that they’re not going to be prepared for that Jan. 1 date.”
Representatives for the West Virginia Retailer’s Association and the West Virginia Oil Marketers and Grocers Association did not return an email seeking comment last week. 
Critics of restricting the use of SNAP benefits argue the bans may negatively impact the businesses of state retailers, particularly for retailers located along the state borders. SNAP recipients in border counties may cross state lines to purchase soda, taking business away from West Virginia retailers.
About one in six West Virginians receive SNAP benefits. The benefits equal less than $6 per day per person, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. In 2024, SNAP brought more than $500 million in federal food benefits to about 2,200 authorized West Virginia SNAP retailers, the center said. 
The state Department of Humans Services told West Virginia Watch it will not enforce the ban on out-of-state soda purchases. 
“SNAP applicants, and applicants for all benefit programs administered by the West Virginia Department of Human Services (DoHS), have always been required to sign the Rights & Responsibilities form,” Angelica Hightower, a spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services, wrote in an email. “Soda will be designated as a non-eligible item under West Virginia’s newly approved waiver, however, the [Rights and Responsibilities] form does not reference or apply to purchases made in other states.”
West Virginia’s SNAP waiver allows the state to restrict soda for two years, ending Dec. 31, 2027. The state may request three annual extensions after that for a total of up to five years. As part of the evaluation process, the state will collect responses to a survey about the ban next year.

(Getty Images)Joe Albertson once said, “Never have so much experience that you know something cannot be done.” That belief continues to guide the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Family Foundation as we support leaders determined to solve Idaho’s toughest challenges. 
One of those leaders, Anselme Sadiki of Children’s Home Society of Idaho, often says, “I do not believe there is a problem that cannot be solved.” That shared conviction is why we are helping the Children’s Home Society, the Women’s and Children’s Alliance, and Idaho Youth Ranch unite around a single, urgent issue: the mental health of Idaho’s youth. 
Most Idaho families struggle to find behavioral health care. Providers are scarce, waitlists are long and the number of young people experiencing trauma, depression and anxiety is rising. 
Idaho is widely known as a mental health care desert. Nonprofits are hit especially hard, losing counselors to organizations that can simply pay more. We believe that can change. 
Philanthropy can help spark progress. These three nonprofit organizations are some of the oldest in the state. They bring decades of experience, deep relationships with Idaho families, and an unwavering commitment to helping kids heal. 
For just as long, they have confronted the provider shortage individually. Now with our help, they are choosing to collaborate, combining their experience and insight to pursue solutions that no single organization could take on by itself. At the foundation, our role is to help make that collaboration possible. 
Our support is not about handouts. It’s about hand-ups. We aim to be an accelerant — a partner that helps remove barriers, expand opportunity, and give nonprofit leaders room to pursue innovative approaches. Our job is to stand behind them with long-term support and help them speak with a shared, stronger voice. This is patient work. The challenges are generations deep, and meaningful change rarely happens quickly. But we believe in long bets, especially when they are placed on thoughtful, competent leaders who put Idaho’s children first. 
This work fits squarely within the long arc of our mission. For nearly 60 years, the foundation has invested in opportunities that help Idahoans learn, grow and thrive. Education has always been a central focus because it is the most reliable pathway to opportunity. 
But a child cannot learn if they are not mentally healthy. Families cannot stabilize when support is out of reach. When we follow the journey of a young person, mental health is not an adjacent issue. It is foundational. 
We have supported these nonprofits for many years, and we have seen firsthand what happens when a child gets the right help at the right moment. Healing becomes possible. Futures open. Families find their footing again. 
It is a privilege to support the people and organizations doing this work every day. We believe in these nonprofits, and if this vital effort matters to you, they’re worthy of your support. Their dedication reflects the same belief that guided Joe Albertson. When capable leaders and the community come together, aligned in purpose and committed to Idaho’s kids, nothing is impossible.

Joseph is an American citizen but ever since the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s immigration crackdown has begun in greater New Orleans, she said she has been worried about her family members who are not. Joseph said she has undocumented relatives on both sides of her family. Her father’s family is from Grenada and her mother’s is from Honduras.
“I was just thinking, what if it’s the last time that I see them?” Joseph said. “I found it hard to finish my schoolwork, and I was just spiraling the whole day, just wondering what was going to happen.”
No one in her family was detained that day, but she still worries about what will happen next time.
The immigration sweeps coincided with Joseph’s exams. But when she normally would have been studying, she has been spending much of her time finding resources to help her community. She said she’s looked into food delivery resources for families that are afraid to leave their homes, and legal services to prepare for the worst-case scenario.
Looking out for her community, she said, is just “a part of life.”

Cristiane Rosales-Fajardo, founder of El Pueblo NOLA, said Operation Catahoula Crunch has taken a toll on student well-being. Older students are finding it hard to focus on exams and college applications, she said.
“Children are enduring a lot of the fear,” Rosales-Fajardo said.
And although Joseph feels safe going to school, attendance data suggests that other students may not. Attendance at schools across the area has dropped dramatically since the start of the immigration crackdown. In Jefferson Parish, where 39% of students are Hispanic, attendance was almost 9 percentage points lower than it was immediately after Thanksgiving break in 2024, according to district data obtained by Verite News. Rates have risen since then, but are still lower than they were last year. In New Orleans, attendance rates across 17 schools, especially those with higher Hispanic populations had also dropped from last school year, data shows.
The drops follow trends seen in Chicago and Charlotte during operations in those cities earlier this year. Although DHS has repeatedly said that it does not target schools, agents have been seen around schools in the greater New Orleans area before and after the operation began. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment Friday (Dec. 19) about how actions affect children or schools. 
Under a Biden-era rule schools used to be a protected “sensitive location” largely off-limits to immigration agents, but the Trump administration reversed those protections in January. A number of school leaders in the area have said that federal immigration agents will not be allowed into schools unless they have court warrants, but many families in the area are worried about encountering agents on the path between school and home.
“There’s no policy or procedure for when you know there’s a military-style operation in your neighborhood,” said Neil Ranu, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. “So we’re asking schools to account for the reality of what’s going on and to make accommodations.”

Even children with legal status aren’t attending school, said Angela Ramirez, executive director of youth support group, Puentes New Orleans, given reports of agents detaining citizens and those with legal status.
“Even if these kids were usually or would usually be secure or safe, that’s not the case anymore, and that’s why, even if they have their documents in order, parents don’t want to send them to school,” Ramirez said.
Genesis, a 15-year-old who attends high school in New Orleans, was one of the thousands of students who did not go to school the first week after Thanksgiving break. She prefers to only use her first name for fear of retaliation against her and her family.
Genesis said her mother usually takes her to school. But when the operation began, her mother, who is from Honduras, stopped leaving the house and going to work. Genesis requested instructional materials from teachers, and said school administration was fairly accommodating of her situation. A volunteer started taking her to school two weeks ago, and she was able to submit all the work she had missed to her teachers.
“I do feel way better than I’m now back in school, and I can distract myself,” Genesis said. “I just feel a little better, but I still worry about my mom.”
In the classroom, the difference after Thanksgiving break was obvious, Ramirez said. At one of Puentes’ sessions in a New Orleans school, only three out of 23 enrolled students attended.
“It was evident that they were disengaged and they were concerned and frustrated at the same time,” Ramirez said. “And this is something you can easily assess and you can easily perceive when you walk into a classroom.”
Students and community members who work closely with them have said that they’ve seen an increase in stress and anxiety among young people. Not going to school can take a toll on their mental health and overall learning, Ramirez said.
Genesis’ teachers’ understanding, she said, eased some of her anxiety. The Jefferson Parish school district did not respond to requests for comment on whether they have or will offer alternative, online learning for students missing school. Charter school leaders in Orleans Parish would not speak publicly about alternative learning options. The NOLA Public Schools district did not respond to requests for comment on how the operation has affected students and staff.
The Southern Poverty Law Center and other civil rights groups submitted a letter this week to public school systems in southeast Louisiana asking that they consider offering accommodations for vulnerable students. Those accommodations would include excusing absences for Hispanic students who are afraid to leave their homes and offering online instructional material to make sure they don’t fall behind in school. Ranu, who signed the letter, said the response could be similar to emergency responses that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Students who miss extended amounts of school will not only miss out on learning and socialization, but can also end up in legal trouble or expulsion. But districts, Ranu said, have the discretion to excuse absences and save families the trouble of dealing with truancy hearings.
Some students who have stayed home from school for fear of immigration raids have already received warning letters, said Rosales-Fajardo. Verite News obtained a copy of one sent to a student for missing five days of school, sent by the Einstein Charter School network. Einstein did not respond to phone calls with requests for comment.
Ranu said that families shouldn’t panic if they receive a notice in the mail. Some schools, Ranu said, have an automated system for sending out attendance warning letters. Parents should send a note to their child’s school to explain that they fear for their safety, he said.

Our reporting in 2025 shed light on major policy issues both new and old that have rattled cities like Holyoke, Leominster, and Lynn.","THIS YEAR, CommonWealth Beacon ramped up its coverage of Massachusetts’ former industrial cities by adding a new Gateway Cities reporter role in its newsroom. These 26 cities, which anchor regional economies around the state yet suffer from the long-term decline of manufacturing, have long faced a host of barriers to adequate schools, health care access, housing development, and more.  
These are communities where targeted resources, policy solutions, and revitalization efforts have the potential to strengthen and revive once-flourishing parts of the state. But policymakers, researchers, and local leaders agree that there is more work to be done.  
This year, our reporting shed light on major policy issues both new and old that have rattled Gateway Cities like Holyoke, Leominster, and Lynn. Some of the issues covered are longstanding, such as Holyoke’s struggle to convert vacant, blighted properties into much-needed housing. But other issues were new, like the Trump administration’s purge of federal funding aimed at helping communities prepare for future flooding, which directly impacted projects in Chelsea and Everett.  
CommonWealth Beacon chronicled these storylines and selected its top five pieces from 2025. Here is your Gateway Cities recap.  
Maternal health care access in Leominster and North-Central Massachusetts  
Reports of women giving birth in cars, ambulances, emergency departments, or reaching a maternity unit just in time to deliver are a far cry from what is expected in a state that consistently ranks first in the country for its health care system.  
But in North-Central Massachusetts, pregnant women and families are living a reality that data, statistics, and health care rankings don’t always show.  
Two years after UMass Memorial Health Alliance-Clinton Hospital closed its maternity unit in Leominster, a CommonWealth Beacon deep-dive found that the region is struggling. The hospital was one of 11 in Massachusetts that have closed or filed to close their maternity unit services since 2014. The region has already faced multiple health care service closures in the last decade, and its emergency medical services have since been stretched thin. Women have had to travel longer distances to give birth.  
The fallout of the maternity unit closure paints a complicated picture in a state that technically doesn’t have maternity care deserts. But experts and advocates say recent losses and impending cuts to Medicaid will make it harder to access maternal health care in Massachusetts. Other Gateway Cities are facing the same dilemma, CommonWealth Beacon recently reported.  
Rehabbing vacant, blighted properties in Holyoke  
Dozens of old, blighted industrial buildings sit boarded up along Holyoke’s canal system and have been mostly vacant for decades. Some are close to collapsing, while others are covered in graffiti. Scattered across the center of downtown, the battered brick buildings are an untapped opportunity and serve as a constant reminder to city leaders of what could be. 
In recent decades, historic mills and old industrial buildings in Gateway Cities across the Commonwealth have been renovated and converted into much-needed housing. The projects are often a way for cities to preserve their historic charm while creating modern residential units in high demand. They also help to revitalize post-industrial era cities that suffered from the long-term decline of manufacturing. 
But while Eastern Massachusetts cities like Lowell and Lawrence have had success – with almost no former industrial buildings left to restore – cities farther west with weaker housing markets, which don’t enjoy the luxury of being connected to Greater Boston via the commuter rail, still struggle with an array of blighted properties that have yet to be developed. In these communities – like Holyoke, Springfield, and Fitchburg – the housing market doesn’t support rents that attract developers for these projects.  
Federal flood prevention funding in Chelsea and Everett  
When the axe fell on $882 million in federal funding aimed at helping communities prepare for future flooding, it came paired with a critique of the program’s very purpose.  
The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program “was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” a FEMA spokesperson said in April. In dramatically re-orienting the US federal agency responsible for coordinating the country’s disaster relief efforts, the Trump administration cancelled all BRIC applications from Fiscal Years 2020-2023, imperiling states from New England to the Gulf Coast. 
Chelsea and Everett had money on the line – a $120 million flood resilience project for the Island End River, which generates dramatic flooding during serious coastal storms, that included a storm surge barrier, storm surge control facility, and wetland restoration set to begin construction in 2026.   
Massachusetts officials later estimated that some $90 million in funding and potential grants would be pulled, almost $50 million of which was dedicated to the Chelsea and Everett endeavor. Overnight, project managers overseeing resilient park and stormwater flooding projects, updating drinking water and watershed regulations, and preparing for the best ways to hold rising waters at bay rushed to triage.  
A tale of two middle schools in Holyoke  
After an October report published by the MassINC Policy Center (which is a part of MassINC, the nonprofit that publishes CommonWealth Beacon) detailed an inequitable state reimbursement process that disadvantages Gateway Cities and urban districts when it comes to school building projects, reporter Hallie Claflin travelled to Holyoke to tell the tale of two middle schools.  
As half of the school district’s middle school students filed into a newly built, state-of-the-art facility this year, the other half weren’t so lucky. Instead, those students filed into Clare P. Sullivan Middle School, a dated building constructed in 1961 that was originally built as an elementary school.  
In 2019, Holyoke set out to build two new middle schools to replace their dated facilities. After months of heated debate, a ballot measure to fund the project was voted down by the community, and the city was forced to continue with the construction of just one school – all they could afford.  
Some say the outcome is a testament to how limited fiscal capacity, an insufficient state funding formula, and local tax constraints work to prevent Gateway Cities like Holyoke from building equitable, modern school facilities. Many have also argued that racial bias has long prevented the city from investing in its public schools. 
New development clashes with affordable housing advocates in Lynn 
Thanks to the newly constructed Lynn Harbor Park, residents can now enjoy a view of Lynn Harbor that had been obstructed by garbage for decades.   
The waterfront is one of Lynn’s major attractions, and its development has been a key part of the North Shore city’s ongoing growth and economic revitalization plans. As the Harbor Park project neared completion this year, investors came flocking to the South Harbor. Several private housing projects are already underway.  
But affordable housing advocates in Lynn have raised concerns about the kind of development the park has attracted, comparing it to the technology-driven redevelopment of Boston’s wealthy Seaport District, which has resulted in a mostly high-income, white neighborhood on a previously underutilized waterfront.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/leominster-hospital-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-23 06:12:15.551186

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Fox Business host Dagen McDowell recently showed Americans that even Republican pundits will launch a war on Christmas if it means supporting AI’s creeping expansion into the economy.
“Everybody needs to get on board. I just don’t — You know what? Buy a fake [Christmas] tree!” shouted McDowell recently, defending the proposed destruction of a Maryland Christmas tree farm to make room for artificial intelligence data center transmission lines. 
But Fox media figures aside, do Americans actually want AI to become a major part of not just how we conduct business, but of how we live?
AI plans, straight from the horse’s mouth
People are usually right to give new technologies the benefit of the doubt and to be cautiously optimistic about where they will take us. 
This time it’s different. 
There is no benefit of the doubt for where AI is headed, because the “Tech Bros” who run AI companies have been honest and loud about what they’re planning:
“AI and robots will replace all jobs,” says xAI founder Elon Musk, attempting a utopian description of what life will look like when AI does everything for everyone. 
Color me skeptical that the wealthiest man on earth will advocate for an economically egalitarian society where everyone’s needs are met at the largess of billionaire-controlled AI systems, especially considering this particular billionaire runs an AI data center that’s poisoning a Memphis community.
As AI takes the helm of decision making, signs of perpetuating historic biases emerge

Musk established xAI’s “Colossus” data center in Memphis in 2024. The Southern Environmental Law Center took legal action against xAI in 2025 for operating 33 methane-powered gas turbines, despite only having a permit for 15. The facility belches nitrogen oxide and formaldehyde around the clock, blanketing primarily African American communities in a toxic haze and increasing Memphis’s smog by 30-60%.
Musk promised economic growth for Memphis, but do the handful of jobs created by the data center justify pollution and environmental racism, not to mention the facility’s massive electricity and water needs?
Tennessee is making a huge bet on AI
Each state is facing the question of how to approach AI, though the Trump administration is doing its best to stifle states’ rights with President Donald Trump’s recent executive order banning states from regulating AI. Tennessee lawmakers are not complaining, though, because the Volunteer State is all in, embracing AI with the kind of mad glee a dog has as it pounces on a porcupine. 
In November, Tennessee released its first Artificial Intelligence Advisory Council Action Plan, outlining how the state will integrate AI across government, education, and industry. The plan says nothing about curbing AI’s harmful effects on society or the environment, and it equivocates on how AI will affect Tennessee’s job market. 
Integrating AI throughout the state requires data centers, of which Tennessee now has at least 60, with the global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield identifying Nashville as an “emerging market” for data centers (Nashville has 27 data centers as of November). The surge of AI infrastructure into the state and the strain these facilities place on the grid is a big part of why Tennessee made the Top Ten list for states with the highest electricity bill increases in 2025.
Artificial intelligence is already changing how Americans work
Every time the Tech Bros promise to create jobs through AI development, they also brazenly admit this new technology will come at the cost of untold numbers of existing jobs.
“I think 30 to 40% of the tasks that people do in today’s economy could be done by AI in the not very distant future,” said OpenAI founder Sam Altman.
AI’s economic disruption isn’t just predicted, it’s already here. Amazon is automating its warehouses with AI-powered robots in places like Shreveport, Louisiana, and Stone Mountain, Georgia, slashing its human workforce and planning another half-million layoffs. UPS and Verizon have also executed significant layoffs, citing AI adoption. 
The changes are affecting young people the most. The U.S. is posting its highest college graduate unemployment rate in decades, with businesses closing their hiring portals and using AI to replace entry-level positions.
Tradespeople and working-class folks might think they’re safe, but AI is coming for them, too. A cohort of AI experts left the industry and collaborated on a paper predicting that humans will produce superhuman AI sometime between 2027 and 2030. 
Americans, anxious about AI’s role in the election, may not know its full scope, expert says

“Several large tech companies have explicitly set the goal of getting to [AI] super intelligence in the near future, which means an AI system that is better than the best humans at everything, while also being faster and cheaper,” says Daniel Kokotajlo, one of the paper’s co-authors and a former OpenAI employee.
Once AI development reaches a superhuman, super-intelligent stage, all human talent becomes obsolete immediately. Kokotajlo explains that at this stage, the AI begins training itself: advancing without human influence. The AI, not humans, begins designing and building robots that then go out into the world, build infrastructure and factories, and create more robots. In the blink of an eye, AI becomes its own quasi-species that can do everything humans can do, only better. 
If AI-powered robots in Shreveport and Stone Mountain are already running Amazon warehouses and physically moving packages around without the help of humans, it doesn’t take a stretch of the imagination to envision robots fixing your plumbing, re-roofing your house, cooking your food or teaching your kids math.
The economy is supposed to be about creating new opportunities, not giving up existing ones
From TV hosts arguing that we should have fewer choices in Christmas trees to tech oligarchs suggesting Americans shouldn’t have as much access to labor markets, it has been alarming to see formerly staunch defenders of capitalism suddenly argue that fewer opportunities are the correct way forward.
If AI expansion continues as it has been, publicly unaccountable and directed solely by a few tech billionaires and their bought-and-paid-for politicians and pundits, it will fundamentally alter how we conduct business, how we ascertain truth, and how we innovate.
Let us not so readily sacrifice the very avenues by which we express our humanity.

(Getty Images)Just days before Christmas, West Virginians should be focused on family, faith and the small joys that carry us through the coldest months of the year. Instead, far too many families across our state are staring down something that should never be part of the holiday season: the real possibility of losing their health care on Jan. 1.
With Congress leaving Washington for the holidays without extending the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced subsidies, the reality is now set. These critical affordability measures — lifelines for roughly 67,000 West Virginians — are slated to expire. And paired with the looming threat of Capito Care — or the “Big Beautiful Bill” — which makes the largest cuts to Medicaid in history and destabilizes our coverage system even further, West Virginia families are heading into the new year with more uncertainty than comfort.
The timing could not be more painful. Marketplace premiums are already rising sharply for many families in our state. Parents who found coverage they could finally afford last year are opening renewal notices that show premiums doubling or tripling. Older adults who rely on ACA plans until they reach Medicare age are being told their new premiums will rival a mortgage payment. Families who were budgeting for Christmas have been forced to pull from those same savings to keep their children insured.
And because Congress adjourned without renewing these subsidies, there is no longer time to prevent the immediate impact. The choices households are now facing are brutally simple: pay more than they can afford or go without coverage altogether.
This isn’t how a society should care for its people—especially not during the season that most deeply reflects compassion, generosity, and community.
Here in West Virginia, the consequences land harder than almost anywhere else. Our state has one of the highest percentages of residents relying on Medicaid. We have a large number of older adults, rural families, and workers in physically demanding jobs who depend on reliable, affordable health care to stay healthy and stay employed. Losing subsidies doesn’t just threaten individual families — it strains rural hospitals, weakens local economies and pulls stability out from under entire communities.
And yet, this moment also reflects something deeply true about our state: West Virginians know how to endure hardship, and they know how to fight for what’s right. In every major health care battle of the past decade, our neighbors — patients, caregivers, nurses, faith leaders and advocates — have stepped up to share their stories and stand together. That civic strength didn’t prevent this particular setback, but it will be essential in the weeks and months ahead.
The truth is that while Congress missed the window to prevent the immediate premium spikes, nothing about this outcome is inevitable going forward. Policy choices created this situation, and policy choices in the new year can fix it. There is still time — and still a responsibility — for federal leaders to restore the subsidies, protect Medicaid, and reject proposals like the “Big, Beautiful Bill” that would push even more West Virginians into crisis.
As we head into Christmas, my hope is that lawmakers remember the human impact behind every line of a bill or budget. Health care isn’t a partisan talking point. It’s the insulin a grandmother needs to survive. It’s the cancer screening that catches a problem early. It’s the coverage that lets parents take their child to the doctor without fear of bankruptcy.
At West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, we remain committed to lifting those stories and pushing for solutions that protect every family in our state. This season may bring anxiety for many, but it also brings clarity: West Virginians deserve better. They deserve health care that is reliable, affordable, and treated as the essential foundation it is.
Christmas reminds us to care for our neighbors. As we move into the new year, we must make sure our policies do the same.

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)This story was originally published by WESA. It is not available for republishing. 
Pennsylvania’s Department of Human Services is notifying households who might have lost benefits like medical or food assistance because of a problem with a state mail vendor that caused more than one million pieces of mail to be delayed by a month, officials said Friday.
The Harrisburg-area vendor did not send a month’s worth of state mail, officials have said.
Some families in the Pittsburgh area have been impacted by the problem.
Raymond Jiang is a 26-year-old Franklin Park resident with autism.
His mother Lei Zhang said her son Raymond’s Medicaid assistance was wrongly cut off because of the mail delay.
On December 12, she received a letter — dated Nov. 10 — saying her son’s Medicaid would be terminated Nov. 23. By the time she got the letter, it was too late to be able to keep the benefits on while she appealed the case.
The cutoff means not only has he lost the health insurance Medicaid provides, but also services and supports like a job coach, who helps him maintain his job as a dishwasher at a senior living center.
The ordeal has been very stressful, Zhang said. “I don’t know how he’s going to live without those supports,” she said.
About 1.7 million pieces of mail from the state’s Department of Human Services were impacted by the delay, which lasted from Nov. 3 to Dec. 3.
A spokesman for the department, which administers benefits like Medicaid and food stamps, said the agency’s staff “has worked around the clock” since it discovered the problem “to ensure clients receive communications as quickly as possible so they can respond to renewals and requests for information, and so DHS can make accurate eligibility determinations and avoid unnecessary disruptions.”
The department is working to notify impacted households, said Brandon Cwalina, a DHS spokesperson, and is also seeking guidance from federal officials since programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, have strict federal guidelines.
The department is extending deadlines for appeals “where possible under federal and state law,” Cwalina said.
It’s unclear exactly how many people have been impacted to the point of losing their benefits, said Maripat Pileggi, a supervising attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, which assists low-income clients and has been helping some impacted by this issue.
People who receive assistance through SNAP or Medicaid must renew their benefits annually, and for SNAP, must also fill out semi-annual renewal paperwork every six months. People also must report changes in income or household size.
While the state has a website and an app where people are able to receive electronic notices, report some changes and upload documents, many people still receive paper notices through the U.S. mail about renewals.
“Mail is critically important for public benefits,” said Ann Sanders, an advocate with anti-hunger organization Just Harvest, which helps people apply for food assistance.
Sanders said the state will send text message reminders when people need to renew their benefits, but the reminders are often necessarily vague, she said, such as telling people to call the department.
“They won’t send you a text message that says your benefits were stopped,” Sanders said, partly because that’s exactly the kind of message sent by online scammers.
The state has since terminated the contract with the mail vendor, “and is exploring all legal options to protect Pennsylvanians, hold the vendor accountable and recover damages caused by the delay,” DHS’s Cwalina said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pennsylvania-Capitol-in-Harrisburg-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 05:57:46.551408

This disconnect between health care spending and outcomes should make us pause. How much of our health care cost is truly about care, and how much is being consumed by the administrative machinery that manages care? It’s time to look beyond simply how much we spend and focus instead on how we spend and what we expect to see in return.
For decades, Medicaid has been viewed as a safety net: a system put in place to catch patients when they fall and provide them with coverage when they need it most. But safety nets can do more than catch; they can also propel. Public health programs should not only protect patients from medical crises but should propel them toward lasting health. However, achieving this requires one critical shift in the way we approach government-funded health care. We must move away from such a heavy focus on enrollment and begin to focus more deliberately on what comes after enrollment — patient engagement and education.
Health care coverage alone does not create wellness. Patients must be supported to engage in preventative care, and when they are, the results are undeniable. A flu shot costs less than the flu; a mammogram costs less than metastatic breast cancer; managing blood pressure costs less than a stroke. Preventive care isn’t just smart medicine, it’s compassionate care. It helps people stay healthy, catch problems early, and avoid needless suffering. And it’s also fiscally responsible: investing in prevention saves lives and reduces strain on families, communities, and the health care system as a whole. Given this, a patient’s enrollment in Medicaid should be viewed as the very beginning of their health care journey – not the outcome. Coverage allows the real work of launching a patient’s coverage into care, and care into health, to begin.
But Kentuckians need support to turn their coverage into action. That starts with knowing what’s already in their hands: every Medicaid member is assigned a primary care provider (it’s right there on the back of the insurance card), and their managed care organization (MCO), the company that runs their Medicaid plan, is just a phone call away. MCOs can help connect members to practical supports like transportation, care coordination and even incentives that make it easier to show up and stay engaged in care.
Still, coverage alone isn’t enough if care doesn’t fit real life. Health care has to work around jobs, kids, language barriers  and long commutes — not the other way around. That means extended hours after 5 p.m. and on weekends, urgent care options, clinics inside schools, translation services, mobile clinics, community health workers and the kind of wraparound supports that remove everyday obstacles.
Community Health Centers have been doing exactly this for almost 60 years, and Kentucky is fortunate to have 30 organizations operating nearly 600 sites statewide so high-quality, community-based care is never far from home. To help patients find these clinics and better navigate the health care system, the Kentucky Primary Care Association developed FindHealthNowKy.org to serve as a simple, user-friendly tool to help Kentuckians quickly connect with the services they need, where and when they need them.
The gap between coverage and care isn’t just clinical — it’s motivational. People can’t value what they don’t understand. When patients begin to see health care as an investment in their own future — and not just a bureaucratic necessity — they begin to engage. And that’s patient activation: turning passive coverage into active care.
This is the real return on investment — when we shift from paying for illness to investing in long-term health and wellness.
The worst-case scenario is a missed opportunity: someone remains covered but disengaged, sicker, unable to work, and still caught in the safety net. The best-case scenario is transformational: an activated patient who stabilizes, learns, grows, and propels themselves forward – managing chronic disease, preventing illness, gaining literacy, working more, and eventually graduating off public assistance altogether.
That’s the kind of ROI Kentucky should be proud to fund.
As Kentuckians know, in basketball, you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. The same holds true for health care. We can have the best programs, the most compassionate and skilled providers, and the most generous benefits. But if patients don’t engage in the opportunities available to them, we all lose.
Our challenge, and our opportunity, is to ensure that every Kentuckian understands that coverage isn’t the end of the story. It’s the start of a new one. When we invest in patient activation, we’re not just funding health care — we’re investing in human potential. And that’s how a safety net becomes a launchpad.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/241210MobileClinic408-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:57:46.551408

(Photo courtesy Dominion Energy)Dominion Energy’s massive Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, which is nearing completion, has been put on pause after the U.S. Department of Interior announced that “national security risks” were identified by the Department of Defense in classified reports.
According to a press release, the pause on offshore wind leases is intended to give the two departments time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess ways to mitigate the potential risks from the projects. The nature of those risks was not disclosed to the media. 
Dominion officials said the pause will last 90 days while the assessments are conducted. The announcement came just one day after a ship left port to begin installing the first turbines beyond the two pilot turbines that were built in 2020.
In response, Dominion raised concerns that delays to the project could worsen strains on the electric grid as energy demand continues to grow from the naval base, residential customers and the rapidly expanding data center industry.
“Stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation’s most important war fighting, AI, and civilian assets. It will also lead to energy inflation and threaten thousands of jobs,” Dominion said in a statement.
The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is one of five major offshore wind projects now on hold. The $11 billion, 2.6 gigawatt project is designed to supply enough electricity to power more than  660,000 homes and is well into the construction phase, with the first turbines expected to be installed on their foundations in the coming weeks. The project includes a total of 176 turbines. 
Before the pause was announced, Dominion projected that the first power from the project would come online around the end of March.
“The project has been more than 10 years in the works, involved close coordination with the military, and is located 27 to 44 miles offshore, so far offshore it does not raise visual impact concerns. The project’s two pilot turbines have been operating for five years without causing any impacts to national security,” Dominion said.
This is not the first challenge the project has faced from the Trump Administration. In September, funding was pulled from several offshore wind projects and related port renovations. Those affected included the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port, also known as Fairwinds Landing, and the Portsmouth Marine Terminal Offshore Wind Development Project, both of which were already underway or had already spent the allocated funds.
The PMT project was intended to serve as part of the staging area for the CVOW project but ultimately was not impacted by the funding changes. U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, has been pushing back in recent months to make sure the project moves forward.
“I have been working with the Department of the Interior and Gov. Youngkin for months to safeguard Virginia’s Coastal Offshore Wind Project, and I am deeply disappointed by this news. This new directive will negatively affect Hampton Roads, thousands of workers, and the amount of energy that can be produced. It will also undermine military readiness,” Kiggans said.
U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats, and Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, released a joint statement calling the move by the Trump Administration political:
“Despite our senior roles on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, the administration has failed to share any new information that supports this sudden and sweeping move to halt all offshore wind development, including a project off the coast of Virginia that is already almost complete and operational,” they said. “That silence speaks volumes, especially given the president’s longstanding, well-documented opposition to offshore wind.”
An order from the Department of Interior said previous unclassified reports had identified risks with offshore wind projects, including radar interference caused by the movement of turbine blades.
“Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers,” Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement.
Dominion pushed back on the pause, arguing that completing the project is critical both to national security and to providing reliable power to the commonwealth.
“CVOW is essential for American national security and meeting Virginia’s dramatically growing energy needs, the fastest growth in America,” Dominion said. “This growth is driven by the need to provide reliable power to many of America’s most important war fighting installations, the world’s largest warship manufacturer, and the largest concentration of data centers on the planet as well as the leading edge of the AI revolution.”
Dominion customers are already paying for the project through their monthly electric bills after the State Corporation Commission approved the project in 2022. 
“Our customers are paying for the project after a careful review of project costs and benefits by Virginia state regulators in 2022. These same state regulators, along with numerous federal agencies, oversee our cyber and physical security program, which is among the strongest in the energy industry,” Dominion said.
The Office of Governor Glenn Youngkin could not immediately be reached for comment.

Advocates say expanding insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization would help more Virginians build families without facing overwhelming financial barriers. (Photo by Thanasis Zovoilis/Getty Images)Forty-four years ago on Dec. 28, my mother gave birth to me, the first baby in the U.S. conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF). I exist because of science, and most importantly, because my parents had access to this groundbreaking new healthcare in Virginia. 
The commonwealth of Virginia, the state where my parents became the first in the nation to give birth to an IVF baby, has a chance to make the procedure far more accessible to many Virginians by mandating that this safe and effective medical treatment be covered by insurance. 
The state that led with the science to help create families can now once again become a national leader in lowering the financial barrier to accessing it.  
It wasn’t that long ago that IVF was a brand-new medical technology regarded as experimental. 
In 1981, my parents, struggling with infertility, left our home in Massachusetts to receive IVF treatment in Virginia from Drs. Howard and Georgeanna Jones, who pioneered it, because the procedure was outlawed in our home state. Just over four decades ago, IVF was new, misunderstood and heavily restricted. 
Thankfully, today, IVF is accepted as standard care for infertility, and the vast majority of  Americans — a reported 86% — support access to this treatment. While to call IVF a miracle would be to shortchange the medical geniuses behind the treatment, each of the tens of thousands of IVF babies born in the U.S. yearly are a personal miracle to people struggling with the devastation of infertility. 
Yet ironically, Virginia, the birthplace of IVF, today lags behind many other states in mandating insurance coverage for the procedure, putting it out of reach for far too many. 
Without insurance coverage, one round of IVF can cost from $12,000 to $25,000. Most people need to undergo several rounds before sustaining a viable pregnancy — adding a crushing financial burden to the emotional angst and physical ordeal of fertility care. 
We know a very high number of couples who embark on IVF stop their treatment because of the cost — and we don’t even know how many people never even begin it because of the burden of out-of-pocket expenses.
In the DMV, both Maryland and Washington, D.C. residents have greater access to IVF than the one in six Virginians facing infertility. 
Other states have taken their commitment to helping infertile couples seriously. Massachusetts, which once barred my parents from IVF, today offers one of the strongest and most comprehensive IVF coverage mandates in the country. 
Fortunately, the Virginia General Assembly returns in January with a meaningful opportunity to expand access to family building. 
Last year, Democratic Del. Dan Helmer of Fairfax passed a transformative bill to direct Virginia’s Health Insurance Reform Commission to include IVF and infertility treatment in Virginians health plans. Helmer’s bill means that for millions of Virginians, the decision to start a family isn’t limited by their ability to afford care.
IVF is the most pro-family medical care we have. It allows patients a chance at parenthood. It is also modern health care critical to addressing the medical condition of infertility which, like any other medical condition, should be covered by insurance to diagnose and treat. 
Without mandated insurance coverage, Virginians facing infertility face impossible choices. But having a baby shouldn’t be a privilege only for those with resources or employers that cover fertility care. It’s a right that should belong to all Virginians. 
As living proof of what can happen when people have access to science, I urge Virginia legislators to seize this moment and help families across the commonwealth. Forty-four years ago, Virginia made my birth possible by removing the barrier to new medical care. Today, its leaders can remove the cost barrier to IVF and give the next generation the same chance that was given to my parents. 
Elizabeth Carr is the first person born in the United States through in vitro fertilization and a leading advocate for fertility rights and patient-centered care. She speaks nationally and internationally on access to infertility treatment and currently works at Genomic Prediction, a company that provides genetic testing for embryos used in IVF.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Several Eastern Shore counties have withdrawn from an appeal of Maryland’s recertification for the Conowingo Dam, a challenge that the state feared could put a $340 million settlement with Constellation, the dam’s owner, in jeopardy.
But the county that hosts the dam, Cecil, is moving forward with the complaint, which argues that counties on the Shore were improperly excluded from the recertification process. Tbe appeal also bemoans the fact that the agreement itself does not guarantee that harmful sediment in the dam’s overflowing reservoir will be drained out.
The deal resolved years of legal wrangling between the dam owner and the state, pluscwaterkeeper groups that intervened in the litigation. In exchange for recertification — which is needed for Constellation to get a 50-year license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to keep operating the hydropower plant at the dam — Maryland is set to receive $340 million from Constellation for environmental projects at the site. If all goes according to plan for the state, the federal license will incorporate Maryland’s conditions.
Several counties on the Shore had joined the appeal of the certification filed by an attorney for the Clean Chesapeake Coalition. But Maryland Department of the Environment officials lobbied counties to rescind their complaint, arguing that it could muddy the waters as the dam tries to get its new FERC license.
Officials also worried that an anticipated policy change from the Trump administration, undermining states’ recertification authority, could make matters worse.
After those conversations, Dorchester and Kent counties opted to abandon the administrative appeal, which MDE will ultimately rule on. Queen Anne’s has also withdrawn, according to the state and the Coalition, but that county did not respond to a request for comment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“They [MDE] explained to us more about how a delay in this agreement going through could hamper some of the actions they want to do to clean up the bay,” said Dorchester County Council Presdent Lenny Pfeffer. “We’d rather see some cleanup than no cleanup.”
Cecil County, though, is holding pat, said county spokesperson Robert Royster.
In a statement earlier this month, Royster expressed concern that county leaders didn’t play a role in the settlement, and said that the county’s water intakes south of the dam, including in Perryville, Port Deposit and Havre de Grace, “continue to experience significant impacts from sediment and debris trapped behind the Conowingo Dam.”
Dorchester County officials also learned after filing the administrative appeal that “it wouldn’t be possible to change the negotiations between Constellation and the state,” because they occurred as part of the litigation, Pfeffer said.
“MDE has told us that they will be giving us a seat at the table going forward,” Pfeffer said.
Adam Ortiz, deputy secretary at the Department of the Environment, said the state has “committed to the parties that dropped the challenge that they can have an advisory role in the implementation of the projects.”
“We’ve had good conversations in recent weeks, and when good people talk, good things happen. So, we’re really glad that these counties have stepped back,” Ortiz said.
After nearly a decade of back-and-forth, state officials are eager to “get out of the courts and get to work,” Ortiz said.
Pfeffer said that his county council does not plan to renege on a $5,000 commitment to the attorney who filed the complaint, Charles “Chip” MacLeod. The money came from the county’s contingency funds, Pfeffer said.
Kent County also planned to send the same sum, said Ronald Fithian, president of the board of commissioners. But it’s unclear whether the funds were dispatched before the county reversed course, Fithian said.
Fithian said that the state promised to convene a meeting in January to discuss the Conowingo settlement with the counties — if they dropped the appeal.
“We just figured it might be better to work with them and go to this meeting,” Fithian said, “and see if we could recommend some ways that would make the bay a healthier place.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HEADSHOT-198-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:12:09.816046

(Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)The second half of New Hampshire’s biennial legislative session starts on Jan. 7. As the state aims to fulfill its goal of increasing child care capacity and combating workforce shortage struggles, here’s a look at some of the filed bills relating to early care and education. 
House Bill 1566, Senate Bill 483: An act making a contingent appropriation to the Department of Health and Human Services for recruitment and benefit grants for child care employees. 
What these bills aim to do: After the federal government said the state could not use Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds for child care employers, $15 million is in limbo despite it being allocated in the state’s budget earlier this year. HB 1566 and SB 438 propose allocating $15 million in a “non-lapsing general fund appropriation” for the next fiscal year to aid child care employers in recruiting and retaining employees. So far, this is the only child care-related bill filed in both the House and the Senate, with very few differences in language. 
What legislators said: Rep. Mary Jane Wallner, a Concord Democrat and primary sponsor of the bill in the House, said failure to fund the $15 million appropriation would be “sliding backwards” instead of moving forward. 
“The real issue that we are having in New Hampshire with our child care community is that we do not have a workforce, and we’re trying to hang on,” she said. “There is a workforce shortage, but child care is something that really benefits businesses, government, families; it’s something that really benefits everyone.” 
The hearing for SB 483 will be held on Jan. 14 at 1:30 p.m. at the State House. 
House Bill 1515: An act repealing the child care grant program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
What the bill aims to do: If passed, HB 1515 will repeal the $15 million appropriation in House Bill 2 to the Department of Health and Human Services to provide recruitment, retention, and benefit grants to child care employers.
What one bill sponsor said: Bill sponsor Rep. Len Turcotte, a Barrington Republican, said, “the language [of House Bill 2] also details what the money could be used for, mostly for payments to child care centers and their employees. I do not believe we, as taxpayers, should be on the hook for what the ‘backers’ proposed.” 
House Bill 1433: An act creating a child care tax credit for qualifying businesses.
What the bill aims to do: HB 1433 proposes creating a tax credit program that would incentivize businesses to create or expand child care programs. If passed, businesses would receive a tax credit if they increase the number of seats in a child care program by 12 or more, either directly or through a third party, after Jan. 1, 2027. 
The bill states: “The general court finds that: The availability of reliable child care is critical for parents to remain in the work force, and that there is a shortage of child care available to working parents in New Hampshire. It is in the interest of this state to stimulate the creation and expansion of child care programs by providing an incentive to businesses in the form of a tax credit.” 
Expenditures eligible for the tax credit include money spent on the creation or renovation of a child care facility and on operational expenditures — employee compensation, training, utilities, and rent — during the first two years of a new facility. Businesses can claim a credit equal to 50% of their total expenditures applicable to the Business Profits Tax and Business Enterprise Tax. 
What Gov. Kelly Ayotte said: During a forum on investing in child care on Oct. 30, Ayotte said she was “very mindful” of the bill’s ability to motivate the private sector into colocating child care. 
“So if there’s a way that we can incentivize the private sector, say ‘this is an investment area where you invest,’ we’re going to provide some added incentive for [businesses] to do that, because that makes it a lot easier for people,” she said. “It makes it easier for employers, because they have child care right there, they can attract good employees, and it’s a win-win for both sides of the aisle.” 
Senate Bill 614: An act establishing pooled risk management programs for the benefit of child care centers and foster family homes. 
What the bill aims to do: If passed, the bill would establish a pooled risk management program for child care centers and foster family homes, specifically for liability insurance. A risk pool is a collective agreement in which multiple businesses share and manage their risks, maintain financial stability together, and provide support to one another, rather than buying insurance from an agency. 
The bill states that child care centers and foster care homes are “presently burdened” with trying to secure insurance and that it is “essential to the proper functioning of child care centers and the foster care system.” Liability insurance is a significant expense for child care providers and has become increasingly difficult to obtain due to the high risk and limited availability of coverage.
A risk pool may provide coverage for workers’ compensation, general, professional, or employer liability; medical payments; unemployment compensation; property damage; transportation and/or theft. The bill requires the state to “ensure standards are met” in establishing the pool, and the pool will not be subject to insurance regulation or taxation. 
What one bill sponsor said: “Liability insurance for day cares is very expensive,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Bedford Republican. “There aren’t many insurance companies offering that specialty liability coverage, and the market is described as a hard market by the insurance department,” she stated. “This is a practical, fiscally responsible step that strengthens the foundation of care for New Hampshire’s children.”
House Bill 1195: An act relative to municipal zoning requirements for child day care providers.
What the bill aims to do: Currently, some towns have local zoning ordiances that prevent family-based care in residential areas and center-based care in commercial areas. The zoning barriers do not always align with state law and can make it difficult for providers to open new child care programs. 
HB 1195 would ensure that in residential areas, family care providers are allowed by right to use their homes as a child care facility as long as they comply with state licensing rules and requirements. It would also require towns to allow child care centers in commercially zoned areas.
What bill sponsor, Rep. David Page, said: Page, a Conway Democrat, said, “We know that with the dire shortage of available slots, parents are often commuting long distances to the nearest center where they can find care and then having to double back to their place of employment. More child care near jobs makes sense for families and for employers. It’s a win-win.”
Senate Bill 645: An act relative to income eligibility for New Hampshire child care scholarship program and allocating certain revenue to fund the program. 
What the bill aims to do: If passed, SB 645 will increase income eligibility for New Hampshire’s Child Care Scholarship Program from the current 85% of the state median income to 95%. Additionally, it proposes reallocating 2% of tax revenue generated from alcohol and tobacco to the Department of Health and Human Services to help administer the program. 
Senate Bill 608: An act relative to family caregiver support in certain programs and child care support for kinship caregivers.
What the bill aims to do: SB 608 proposes to amend the eligibility requirements for the Child Care Scholarship Program and child care training costs, and to expand the services allowed under Medicaid waiver programs. 
Eligibility currently requires a parent, grandparent, or legal guardian to be working, applying to work, or in a training program. If passed, the bill will change the work requirements of the Child Care Scholarship Program to allow retired grandparents who are the legal guardians or primary caretakers of their grandchildren to be eligible for the program. SB 608 also proposes changes that would require the Department of Health and Human Services to offer evidence-based trauma-informed trainings at no cost to child care providers. Currently, trauma-informed trainings are not legally mandated to be evidence-based and can be at the expense of the provider. 
Additionally, the bill directs Health and Human Services to seek approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to expand family support services as an allowance to the Acquired Brain Disorder, Choices for Independence, and Home and Community Based Services waiver programs. 
House Bill 1720: An act relative to notice to child day care providers of child care scholarships.
What this bill aims to do: The bill proposes new measures to improve communication between the Department of Health and Human Services and child care providers using the Child Care Scholarship Program. It requires that if a licensed child care program is named on a scholarship application (as is sometimes the case because applicants must be connected to a provider before or during the application process), the provider must be electronically notified within three business days. 
A notice would include the child’s name, anticipated start date, and a statement that the application is pending eligibility determination. Health and Human Services would also be required to notify providers within three business days whether a child is approved, denied, or has withdrawn their application.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ecebillsstatehouse-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:12:09.816046

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Establishing a comprehensive data privacy law. Using tax credits to offset energy costs. Returning sovereignty to the Wabanaki Nations. Expanding the state’s infrastructure to track and test rape kits. 
These are among the nearly 400 proposals that the Maine Legislature is poised to revisit when lawmakers reconvene in January. The state Legislature operates on a two-year cycle, often pushing off the most debated bills into the second year. 
Or, in the case of digital privacy, some policy debates can span multiple Legislatures. 
Maine is now in its 132nd Legislature but lawmakers first proposed this type of law during the 131st, with two competing plans failing after outsized lobbying efforts. Those plans returned in 2025, with the version that would make regulations in Maine among the strictest in the country the top lobbied bill of the year. But agreement has still not been reached, so debate will resume when lawmakers reconvene. 
Some of the bills carried over received initial votes but the final outcome is still undetermined. The data privacy bill favored by the Judiciary Committee reached the floor, but lawmakers decided not to vote on it and instead to push off a decision until next session. (Read about why here.) 
Meanwhile, legislative committees decided to carry over other bills that they didn’t finish work on,sometimes even before holding public hearings, which was the case for the sweeping tribal sovereignty bill. 
Not included in the table above, lawmakers also opted to carry over all of the bills that were left on what are referred to as the appropriations and study tables when the Legislature adjourned, as well as any bills left in the possession of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee.
The appropriations committee sets the budget, and if a bill is not accounted for in the budget, it’s placed on the appropriations table, where lawmakers on this committee decide whether to fund it with remaining funds after the budget is set. 
Two of the bills that lawmakers didn’t fund had to do with sexual assault forensic examination kits, commonly called rape kits. One would establish a statewide tracking system for such kits, and the other would require an inventory be taken of existing kits in the possession of law enforcement. These kits preserve evidence left behind during an assault through a forensic medical examination that survivors can choose to undergo. DNA evidence from these kits can then be used to solve and prevent crimes.
As the Legislature enters the second year of its two-year cycle, any bills left on the table upon final adjournment will die. During the 131st Legislature, less than 10% of bills that were placed on the table at some point ultimately became law. 
Bills end up on the study table if they involve studies. The Legislative Council, which is made up of the ten elected members of leadership, manages this table and decides which bills get legislative staff to help conduct the research.
Last session, the council did not approve studies on a range of issues — such as an equitable energy transition for Maine’s workforce and the feasibility of establishing a dedicated state family court — which can be considered again next session. (More on those proposals here.)
Any bills that get funded off of the appropriations table or staffed from the study table still need the approval of Gov. Janet Mills, who is entering the final year of her two-term tenure. 
During the first regular session, Mills postponed her decision on 61 bills that the Legislature had approved. 
This legislation included proposals to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following the state’s largest toxic foam spill in Brunswick.
Noting the high number of bills passed at the end of session, Mills said she needed more time to thoroughly review these proposals and their implications. When the next session begins on Jan. 7, Mills will have three days to either veto the legislation or allow it to become law without her signature. 
She’s already announced her intention to allow at least two to become law: one bill to restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement and another that will require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Stewart_12_4_JNeuger-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:12:09.816046

(Official photos.)It now seems nearly inevitable that health insurance costs will spike at the end of the month for nearly 600,000 Ohioans and 23 million Americans. An Ohio family doctor and colleagues in other states are blasting Republicans in Congress for not doing more to stop it.
Subsidies for health care purchased on exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire Jan. 1, causing health expenses to more than double for millions.
“Without the ACA tax credits, they just can’t make health care work in their budget. So they’ll put off screenings… they won’t just split pills, they won’t take them at all,” said Catherine Romanos, a Columbus family doctor. 
She was speaking during a virtual press conference last week sponsored by the Committee to Protect Health Care, a nonprofit advocacy group of 36,000 doctors that says it doesn’t accept funding from for-profit health care corporations. 
“I don’t blame them,” Romanos said of her patients. “Everything is expensive — rent, child care, groceries. Something has to give. I blame the leaders in Washington. They had an opportunity to help out patients like the ones I see every day. They had an opportunity to ensure that their constituents would continue seeing the doctor… but they chose not to.”
The office of Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno attacked Romanos on political grounds and said he was working on a compromise extension of the subsidies. The office of Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted did not respond to a request for comment.
Despite President Donald Trump’s promises to quickly stop inflation, it continues nearly a year into his second term. 
Meanwhile, when adjusted for inflation, median annual income actually dropped from about $71,000 in 2019 to $67,873 four years later, according to the Ohio Housing Finance Agency.
Even so, Husted and Moreno this summer voted for Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
It extended Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, at a cost of $4 trillion over 10 years, with $1 trillion of that benefit flowing to the richest 1% of Americans. It will add an estimated $3.4 trillion to the deficit.
At the same time, it cuts more than $1 trillion in medical and food assistance to low-income Americans over the same period.
Even though they extended the tax cuts, congressional Republicans opted not to extend 2021 subsidies to people buying health insurance on the ACA exchanges. 
The struggle over the subsidies was at the center of a 43-day government shutdown that ended Nov. 12.
Husted said he didn’t want to put the $350 billion cost to extend them 10 years “on the national credit card for a program that we know is dysfunctional.”
Those subsidies average about $700 a year, but they can be as high as $20,000 for some. They’re credited with helping to bring the rate of uninsured Americans to an all-time low. 
Republicans have thus far thwarted Democratic attempts to renew the subsidies, but huge majorities of Americans support doing so. 
Vulnerable Republicans in Congress have defied their leaders and joined an effort to force a vote on extension sometime in January. 
Moreno has been participating in bipartisan talks about a compromise. And he and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in December made a proposal for a two-year extension that didn’t go anywhere.
If an agreement is struck in January, it can be made retroactive. But by then, the damage will already be piling up.
The health-analysis nonprofit KFF estimates that average premiums for 23 million Americans will more than double in the absence of the subsidies. And nearly 5 million are expected to drop coverage and join the ranks of uninsured.
The time to have extended the subsidies was months ago, before the government shutdown, Rob Davidson said. 
He’s an emergency doctor in western Michigan who spoke during the Committee to Protect Health Care press conference. 
“This didn’t sneak up on us,” he said. “Democrats and health care advocates have been calling for months — pretty much all year — for Congress to take action and extend the ACA tax credits but congressional Republicans have chosen to do nothing.” 
He said expiration of the subsidies would hurt everybody. 
Emergency doctors in Ohio have said that just because people lose insurance, that doesn’t mean they’ll stop getting sick. And emergency departments have to treat them regardless of their ability to pay. 
That will sap hospital budgets and increase wait times and compromise care for all, they said.
“This isn’t just a crisis for Americans who get their health care through the ACA,” Davidson said. “When millions of Americans can no longer afford their plans, and when millions more lose their health care because of Republican cuts to Medicaid, hospitals operating on thin margins will be forced to close.”
Romanos, the Columbus family doctor, said patients themselves will become sicker if skyrocketing premiums make them poorer. 
The vast majority of those receiving subsidies already are in the bottom half of the income distribution. 
About 70% of the people using the ACA exchanges make 250% or less of federal poverty guidelines. 
For a family of four, that’s $80,375 a year,or  a third less than the median income for a family of that size in Ohio.
Romanos said patients will ration their own care if they think they can’t afford it.
“Maybe they don’t get all the lab tests that I want, or they don’t take all the medicine I prescribe,” she said. “Some just can’t afford the health care I recommend.”
She said it all could have been prevented months ago.
“Here in Ohio, our senators, Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, voted against helping Ohioans afford health insurance,” Romanos said. 
“They voted to let premiums skyrocket. Earlier this year, senators Moreno and Husted voted to give tax breaks to billionaires, but I guess health care for working families is just too expensive. What a slap in the face for my patients. Ohioans deserve leaders who look out for them, not billionaires like Donald Trump, who mocks affordability.”
Reagan McCarthy, Moreno’s communications director, responded with a statement focused on politics instead of the ACA subsidies.
“Catherine Romanos is progressive activist and longtime Democrat donor who supported (former Democratic Vice President) Kamala Harris (and former Democratic Ohio Sen.) Sherrod Brown,” McCarthy said in an email. 
“Romanos even served as a surrogate for the Ohio Democrat(ic) Party and falsely attacked Senator Moreno repeatedly. Someone who ‘fell in love with the idea of being an abortion provider’ is hardly an objective source for this garbage ‘journalism.’ Once again, the Ohio Capital Journal chooses to shamelessly prop up Ohio Democrats rather than report the facts.”
Husted’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
After the government shutdown ended in November, Husted proposed a “freeze” that would have extended the subsidies while cutting benefits, the number of people who could get them, or both.
Makunda Abdul-Mbacke is an OB-GYN in Rockingham County, a rural area in the North Carolina Piedmont. 
She said taking away the ACA subsidies and slashing Medicaid spending will drive many already-struggling rural hospitals out of business. 
She said that will force struggling patients to drive farther for preventative care such as pap smears and mammograms.
“Without a mammogram, we will not be able to pick up breast cancer when it’s early,” Abdul-Mbacke said. 
“We will pick it up when it’s stage three or stage four and that means that someone is losing their mother. Someone is losing their aunt or their sister or their daughter. It just appears as though the Republicans we elected just don’t care about those things as long it’s not their family.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Twenty-year-old Mikayla Foreman knows her experience is meaningful. Dealing with homelessness since 18 and currently living in a shelter, Foreman has managed to continue her academic journey, studying for exams this month in hopes of attaining a nursing degree.
But Foreman believes there were intervention points that could’ve prevented her from experiencing homelessness in the first place.
“If someone in school had understood what I was going through, things could’ve been very different,” she said in an interview with Stateline.
As more cities impose bans, fines or jail time for adults living on the streets, young people who have been homeless say they face unique problems that could have been addressed earlier. Through more than 400 interviews and survey responses, young people across the country recently told researchers how earlier guidance and intervention might have made a difference for them. The research suggests the country is missing its biggest opportunity to prevent youth homelessness — by intervening well before a young person reaches a shelter and years before they are chronically homeless.
The report, from Covenant House and the University of California, Berkeley, finds that the pathways into youth homelessness are different from those of adults experiencing temporary or chronic homelessness. A young person coming out to their family, or becoming pregnant, or experiencing untreated trauma can create conflicts that push them into homelessness. A lot of that doesn’t show up in current data.











If someone in school had understood what I was going through, things could’ve been very different.


– Mikayla Foreman, 20



The survey responses offer the nation’s schools and social services agencies the chance to get ahead of youth homelessness, researchers say, not only by intervening earlier, but also by pinpointing and responding to the diversity of needs among teenagers and young adults who might be close to losing their housing.
Advocates say there are multiple intervention points — in school, in child welfare organizations and inside family dynamics — where the worst outcomes can be avoided. States such as California, Florida, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington have explored some of those intervention points in policies that range from guaranteed income pilot programs to youth-specific rental assistance and campus housing protections.
Hawaii has made its youth drop-in and crisis-diversion program permanent, and Oregon and Washington have expanded rental assistance and education-centered supports for vulnerable youth. Florida now requires colleges to prioritize housing for homeless and foster students.
“With young people, we have opportunities to intervene much further upstream — in schools, in families, in child welfare — before anyone has to spend a single night on the streets. That’s simply not the case with older adults,” said David Howard, former senior vice president for Covenant House and a co-author of the new research, in an interview with Stateline.
“Even at 18, 20 or 24 [years old], young people are still developing,” Howard said. “Their vulnerabilities look very different from middle-aged adults, and the support systems they need are different too.”
One of the key points of intervention for potentially homeless youth is school. Public schools across the country have increasingly reported more homeless students since the COVID-19 pandemic.
And homelessness has many various regional factors outside of individual circumstances, such as climate-driven homelessness. More than 5,100 students in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina became homeless as a result of hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024.
With homelessness rising, new federal rules could benefit states that take tougher approaches

“Homelessness is multifaceted and lots of us slip through the cracks because the system isn’t designed for our reality,” said Foreman, a former Covenant House resident who helped conduct the new research.
Foreman’s insights and lived experience were included in the study, which showed that youth homelessness rarely begins with an eviction or job loss — frequent causes of homelessness among adults.
The top three reasons that young people experience homelessness for the first time, according to respondents, were being kicked out of their family homes, running away, and leaving an unsafe living situation such as one affected by domestic violence. Other instigators included being unable to afford housing, aging out of foster care, being kicked out of or running away from foster care, and moving away from gang violence.
However, respondents also had suggestions for ways government, schools and the community could help or prevent youth homelessness. They suggested youth-specific housing options, identifying and helping at-risk youth in health care settings, providing direct cash assistance and offering conflict resolution support within families.
Among the most common suggestions was to offer services that create long-lasting connections for young people.
“Strong relationships with non-parental adults, including mentors, teachers, service providers, and elders, were identified as especially important when family connections were strained or absent,” the report said.
Couch, car or curb: Defining which young person is ‘homeless’ affects aid state by state

The surveys and interviews also demonstrated that young people want mental health care tailored to their personal experience, said Benjamin Parry, a lead researcher on the report, speaking during a September webinar hosted by Point Source Youth, a nonprofit that works to end youth homelessness.
The research breaks out responses from a few specific groups — Indigenous, Latino, immigrant, LGBTQ+ people of color and pregnant or parenting youth — to understand their distinct needs, said Parry, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley’s School of Public Health. “There’s so much nuance and specificity within these different groups.”
Indigenous youth, for example, often are dealing with the effects of intergenerational trauma and alcoholism that have been projected onto them, Parry said. Those young people have far different needs than pregnant or parenting youth, he noted.
“They are like, ‘I don’t know where my next paycheck’s going to come from, I don’t know how to put food in my baby’s stomach, I don’t have a support network or someone to go to for this advice,’” he said. “That specificity is exactly why we need to understand this better and do better to tailor our approaches and responses.”

Former state Sen. John Kennedy, a Macon Republican who served as president pro tempore, the Senate’s second-in-command, stepped down this month to focus on a run for lieutenant governor.
Kennedy had represented his district, which includes Crawford, Monroe, Peach and Upson counties as well as parts of Bibb and Houston counties, since 2014. Five Republicans and one Democrat have signed up to face off to replace him, including a former GOP state representative, a recent small town mayor and an ex-Fort Valley city council member.
The winner will only serve for part of this year’s legislative session – the election is set for Jan. 20 with a runoff scheduled for Feb. 17, while lawmakers will gavel in Jan. 12 and likely wrap up around late March or early April. All members of the state Legislature will be up for re-election next November.
Here’s a look at the candidates hoping to become Georgia’s newest state senator, listed in alphabetical order.

Eugene Allison
Allison, a Republican and retired factory worker from Thomaston, is an outspoken proponent of strengthening domestic violence laws. He has spoken at City Council meetings on the topic and can sometimes be seen standing on the street holding signs criticizing officials for not doing enough to stop domestic violence.
Allison said he became interested in advocacy after learning that a loved one experienced domestic violence.
If elected, Allison said his top priority will be to increase penalties for domestic violence and related crimes like stalking.
“I’ve been talking to different victims, not just in District 18, but throughout Georgia, and their stories are about the same,” he said. “They got anger management classes, or they didn’t get locked up, police would only give them a warning instead of making the arrest, so that’s why domestic violence is a priority.”
He said he also wants to prioritize increasing school safety, including by hiring more law enforcement and installing metal detectors.
LeMario Brown

The sole Democrat in the race is LeMario Brown, a small business owner and farmer in Peach County who previously served on the Fort Valley City Council.
In a phone call, Brown said his priorities if elected will center around affordability.
“It’s about taking care of real people and real issues,” he said. “We’re talking about just common sense stuff, being able to feed your family, being able to be sustainable with this health care system we have now that I feel like (the Trump) administration put us in a bad spot in. That’s the story out here all over this district and all over the state of Georgia, a lot of rural hospitals are closing, a lot of people, they’re losing insurance because their premiums are going to be skyrocketing.”
Winning in the district as a Democrat will be a tough hill to climb. Kennedy won nearly two thirds of the vote in 2022, the last time he faced a Democratic challenger.
But, buoyed by wins and overperformances in recent elections, state Democratic leaders are putting their weight behind Brown. Figures including Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones and Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey have visited the district to stump for Brown.
Lauren Daniel

Daniel, a Republican from Locust Grove, previously served in the state House, where she sat on committees including education and transportation. Daniel won her seat in 2022 and was defeated in the 2024 Republican primary by state Rep. Noelle Kahaian.
In an email, Daniel said she’s running on her conservative bona fides and her record in the House.
“I’m running because I believe Middle Georgia deserves a senator with conviction and experience to defend our conservative values from the radical left and end the California creep that’s coming into the state of Georgia,” she said. “I’m the best person for the job because I am the only one in this race who has stood with President Trump, I’ve already served in our legislature, and I have a proven record of being unapologetically conservative, while also being able to be effective.”
Among her top priorities if elected, Daniel listed reining in property taxes, improving the education system and boosting public safety.
Steven McNeel

McNeel, a Republican attorney from Bibb County, did not respond to requests for comment.
In campaign statements, McNeel pledged to uphold conservative values if elected, including by cutting taxes, promoting school vouchers and supporting the federal government’s efforts to deport undocumented migrants.
“As your State Senator, I will work diligently to protect our values, stand up for our farmers, and support policies that attract good jobs to Middle Georgia.”
Nathan Warnock

Warnock, a Republican from Bibb County, is a retiree whose career has included serving 15 years in the U.S. Army as well as working in the mortgage and insurance fields.
Warnock said in a phone call that he had been looking for ways to get involved in the community during his retirement, and the opening in the Senate seemed like a sign from above.
“I’ve always wanted to serve, and there’s just some things that I’d like to get done,” he said. “I’d like to see senior citizens be exempt from property taxes and from school taxes. I would like to have a bill passed that if any facility is caught selling alcohol or tobacco to minors, that they lose their license and ability to sell alcohol or tobacco for a minimum of five years, maximum of 10 years, and that that location, even if sold or transferred ownership, is not allowed to be able to sell alcohol or tobacco for that length of time.”
Warnock said he is not accepting campaign donations from anyone for the race so he won’t be beholden to anybody.
“If you’re the kind of person that wants to try to always root for the underdog, I’m your man,” he said. “This is a David and Goliath moment, and I really feel like this is God saying to do this.”
Eric Wilson

Republican Eric Wilson served as mayor of the city of Forsyth since 2016 before resigning to run for Kennedy’s seat. Before serving as mayor, Wilson was a member of the city council, and he is a co-founder and owner of a medical transportation company.
In a phone call, Wilson said those experiences help make him the best candidate for the job.
“I believe I’m the right person for the job because I’m uniquely qualified,” he said. “I have experience for 25 years as a business owner, meeting the payroll and taking care of my employees and taking care of our customers, and also I’ve spent the last 16 years in local government in a small town, serving as mayor for the last 10 years, and I think those experiences combined make me qualified to serve the citizens of District 18.”
Wilson said his top priorities if elected will include lowering costs with a focus on reducing property taxes and building on this year’s tort law legislation to lower insurance costs.

A group of college students braved the frigid New England weather on Dec. 13, 2025, to attend a late afternoon review session at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Eleven of those students were struck by gunfire when a shooter entered the lecture hall. Two didn’t survive.
Shortly after, a petition circulated calling for better security for Brown students, including ID-card entry to campus buildings and improved surveillance cameras. As often happens in the aftermath of tragedy, the conversation turned to lessons for the future, especially in terms of school security.
There has been rapid growth of the nation’s now US$4 billion school security industry. Schools have many options, from traditional metal detectors and cameras to gunshot detection systems and weaponized drones. There are also purveyors of artificial-intelligence-assisted surveillance systems that promise prevention: The gun will be detected before any shots are fired, and the shooting will never happen.
They appeal to institutions struggling to protect their communities, and are marketed aggressively as the future of school shooting prevention.
I’m a criminologist who studies mass shootings and school violence. In my research, I’ve found that there’s a lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of these technological interventions.
 Grasping for a solution

Implementation has not lagged. A survey from Campus Safety Magazine found that about 24% of K-12 schools report video-assisted weapons detection systems, and 14% use gunshot detection systems, like ShotSpotter.
Gunshot detection uses acoustic sensors placed within an area to detect gunfire and alert police. Research has shown that gunshot detection may help police respond faster to gun crimes, but it has little to no role in preventing gun violence.
Still, schools may be warming to the idea of gunshot detection to address the threat of a campus shooter. In 2022, the school board in Manchester, New Hampshire, voted to implement ShotSpotter in the district’s schools after a series of active-shooter threats.
Other companies claim their technologies provide real-time visual weapons detection. Evolv is an AI screening system for detecting concealed weapons, which has been implemented in more than 400 school buildings since 2021. ZeroEyes and Omnilert are AI-assisted security camera systems that detect firearms and promise to notify authorities within seconds or minutes of a gun being detected.
These systems analyze surveillance video with AI programs trained to recognize a range of visual cues, including different types of guns and behavioral indicators of aggression. Upon recognizing a threat, the system notifies a human verification team, which can then activate a prescribed response plan.
But even these highly sophisticated systems can fail to detect a real threat, leading to questions about the utility of security technology. Antioch High School in Nashville, Tennessee, was equipped with Omnilert’s gun detection technology in January 2025 when a student walked inside the school building with a gun and shot several classmates, one fatally, before killing himself.

 Lack of evidence

This demonstrates an enduring problem with the school security technology industry: Most of these technologies are untested, and their effect on safety is unproven. Even gunshot detection systems have not been studied in the context of school and mass shootings outside of simulation studies. School shooting research has very little to offer in terms of assessing the value of these tools, because there are no studies out there.
This lack is partly due to the low incidence of mass and school shootings. Even with a broad definition of school shootings – any gunfire on school grounds resulting in injury – the annual rate across America is approximately 24 incidents per year. That’s 24 more than anyone would want, but it’s a small sample size for research. And there are few, if any, ethically and empirically sound ways to test whether a campus fortified with ShotSpotter or the newest AI surveillance cameras is less likely to experience an active shooter incident because the probability of that school being victimized is already so low.
Existing research provides a useful overview of the school safety technology landscape, but it offers little evidence of how well this technology actually prevents violence. The National Institute of Justice last published its Comprehensive Report on School Safety Technology in 2016, but its finding that the adoption of biometrics, “smart” cameras and weapons detection systems was outpacing research on the efficacy of the technology is still true today. The Rand Corporation and the University of Michigan Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention have produced similar findings that demonstrate limited or no evidence that these new technologies improve school safety and reduce risks.
While researchers can study some aspects of how the environment and security affect mass shooting outcomes, many of these technologies are too new to be included in studies, or too sparsely implemented to show any meaningful impact on outcomes.
My research on active and mass shootings has suggested that the security features with the most lifesaving potential are not part of highly technical systems: They are simple procedures like lockdowns during shootings.
 The tech keeps coming

Nevertheless, technological innovations continue to drive the school safety industry. Campus Guardian Angel, launched out of Texas in 2023, promises a rapid drone response to an active school shooter. Founder Justin Marston compared the drone system to “having a SEAL team in the parking lot.” At $15,000 per box of six drones, and an additional monthly service charge per student, the drones are equipped with nonlethal weaponry, including flash-bangs and pepper spray guns.
In late 2025, three Florida school districts announced their participation in Campus Guardian Angel’s pilot programs.
 


  Three school districts in Florida are part of a pilot program to test drones that respond to school shootings. 

There is no shortage of proposed technologies. A presentation from the 2023 International Conference on Computer and Applications described a cutting-edge architectural design system that integrates artificial intelligence and biometrics to bolster school security. And yet, the language used to describe the outcomes of this system leaned away from prevention, instead offering to “mitigate the potential” for a mass shooting to be carried out effectively.
While the difference is subtle, prevention and mitigation reflect two different things. Prevention is stopping something avoidable. Mitigation is consequence management: reducing the harm of an unavoidable hazard.
 Response versus prevention

This is another of the enduring limitations of most emerging technologies being advertised as mass shooting prevention: They don’t prevent shootings. They may streamline a response to a crisis and speed up the resolution of the incident. With most active shooter incidents lasting fewer than 10 minutes, time saved could have critical lifesaving implications.
But by the time ShotSpotter has detected gunshots on a college campus, or Campus Guardian Angel has been activated in the hallways of a high school, the window for preventing the shooting has long since passed.

Some of the ex-officers wore red-striped outfits that identified them as the most dangerous inmates behind bars.
Parker, a 33-year-old Black man, had survived the abuse of these white officers, most of whom were part of a self-styled group called the “Goon Squad.” 
On the fateful night of Jan. 24, 2023, he heard officers kick in the door.
“I saw the devil come to me,” he told the judge in the sentencing hearing, “in my home, where I was supposed to have been safe.”
They had handcuffed him and his friend, Michael Jenkins, before they shocked them with Tasers, shoved a dildo into their mouths and poured liquids over their nostrils. 
Parker feared he would suffer the fate of his father, whose lung disease caused him to die gasping for air, he said. “I felt like I was dying and drowning at the same time.”
Not long after, a deputy jammed his gun inside Jenkins’ mouth and pulled the trigger. The bullet missed Jenkins’ spine and shattered his jaw.
In the courtroom, Parker stared at another deputy, the one he called a “devil” because he said he had overseen the violence that night. Parker told the judge, “He shouldn’t be let loose.”
That 29-year-old former deputy sat there, numb, wondering what the judge’s words would be.
In a series of exclusive interviews through phone calls and hundreds of emails with Mississippi Today over the past year, Christian Dedmon talked about the fraternity he found in law enforcement and his descent into cruelty. “I see Michael Jenkins bleeding in my sleep sometimes,” he said. “It is a nightmare I will spend the rest of my life paying for.”
‘Mindless murderers and sadistic torturers’
As early as he can remember, Dedmon hated drugs.
He hated what they did to his parents. He hated what they did to his friends. He even refused to take pain medication after being injured.
Born in 1994, he grew up as an only child in the shadow of Mississippi’s capital in the suburban city of Pearl. He was 2 when his parents divorced, and he bounced between them, from rental home to apartment to trailer.
One night when he was 12, he helped his father repossess a car. When they began to hook the car to the tow truck, people rushed out, screaming. During the tumult, his father closed the hydraulic arm too fast, cutting off two fingers from Dedmon’s left hand.
Doctors managed to reattach his index finger but could only save half his thumb. Four other surgeries followed, and Dedmon missed most of sixth grade. A few years later, he moved out, dropped out of high school and drove tow trucks, just like his dad.
He was 16 when he heard of a horrific murder in Jackson, Mississippi. A Black man, James C. Anderson, had been beaten and run over with a truck.
Then he heard that his first cousin, Deryl Dedmon, was involved in the attack with other Rankin County residents, most of them in their early 20s.
He felt sick. How could anyone do such a thing?
To support his cousin, Christian Dedmon attended the sentencing hearing, where U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves talked about the lynchings of more than 4,700 Black Americans between 1882 and 1968.

The judge detailed how this white mob of teenagers, like marauders of the past, invaded the city of Jackson, which they called “Jafrica.” They beat Black homeless men. They beat a Black man at a service station. They beat a Black man at a golf course who begged for his life.
“Like a lynching, for these young folk going out to ‘Jafrica’ was like a carnival outing,” the judge said. “It was funny to them — an excursion which culminated in the death of innocent, African-American James Craig Anderson. On June 26, 2011, the fun ended.”
Reeves posed a question that could have been asked later of the Goon Squad officers: “How could hate, fear or whatever it was transform genteel, God-fearing, God-loving Mississippians into mindless murderers and sadistic torturers?”
Deryl Dedmon, who ran over Anderson with his truck, received 50 years in prison.
Pam Lantrip, said her grandson, Christian Dedmon, was “really upset about his cousin going to prison for what was essentially a life sentence.”
She never dreamed this grandson, the one who never got into trouble, would be next.
Law enforcement became the ‘brotherhood’
While Dedmon was still a teen, a police officer he knew from deer camp invited him to ride along. Dedmon grew up cheering Chuck Norris as he beat up the bad guys on television, and now these rides lit “a fire within me,” he recalled.
At age 19, he became a 911 dispatcher for the Pearl Police Department, finished high school and got married. Months later, he learned his wife was pregnant. They listened to the baby’s heartbeat, and the obstetrician said everything looked fine.
Days later, she began to bleed, and he rushed her to the emergency room. A sonogram revealed there was no heartbeat. They wept at the awful news, the first of three miscarriages.
On the 15th anniversary of the 9-11 terrorist attack, Dedmon enrolled at the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers Training Academy. He graduated weeks before Christmas in 2016. 
Two months later, he and his wife had a daughter, their miracle baby, and Dedmon vowed to be “the daddy that I did not have.”
He worked as a patrol officer for Pearl police, and law enforcement became the “brotherhood” he had never experienced.
Not long after he joined the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department in 2017, his mother was arrested for selling meth. Inside her home, officers said they also found heroin, marijuana, fentanyl and a firearm.
“I spent his entire life trying to protect him from the world and from anyone who could hurt him,” recalled his mother, Jennifer Williams, “but at the end of the day I was the one who hurt him the worst.”
Dedmon said Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey asked him if he was going to have a problem with his mother being jailed there. Dedmon replied no, but the truth was, he was devastated. He said her arrest made him even more determined to get drugs off the street.

He spent extra time stopping cars and searching them. Through that work, he met narcotics investigator Brett McAlpin. All the meth users seemed to know McAlpin’s name.
Dedmon idolized McAlpin like a big brother. He said McAlpin convinced him they had to do more than arrest those using or selling drugs. They had to make these drug abusers pay. 
McAlpin taught him how to hit people so their injuries wouldn’t show up in their jail mugshots, and he didn’t use a Taser because it recorded every time it was used, Dedmon said. Instead, McAlpin “carried a huge piece of wire on his vest that would hurt if you were hit with it,” he said.
To get people to talk, McAlpin fired his gun in the air — a tactic that often worked, Dedmon said.
The pair didn’t stop there. Together, they destroyed the property of those they believed were using or selling drugs. They smashed food into people’s faces, berated them and told them to leave Rankin County. 
To get confessions, officers sometimes shoved guns into people’s mouths, and behind office doors, investigators would hit people “with phone books and whatever,” Dedmon said. “It’s daily operations up there.”
He came to believe this approach made their community safer for children, he said. “We made people scared to sell drugs, to use drugs or to steal.”
He realizes now how wrong that was. “My job was to clean up the streets while following the Constitution,” he said, “not to be the judge and jury in place of a failed justice system.”
Those who embraced McAlpin’s ways could go on “missions” with him, Dedmon recalled. Over the years, he said, more than a dozen different deputies joined in those missions.
Some deputies, however, steered clear of McAlpin and Dedmon. Two deputies from that time said they didn’t trust the pair because they had heard stories about those missions.
Some of them warned Dedmon about hanging out with McAlpin, who had a reputation for excessive force. “He wouldn’t listen,” recalled one former deputy, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. 
In January, Sheriff Bailey testified in a lawsuit that he knew nothing about the violence carried out by Dedmon, McAlpin and the others. 
Dedmon responded that “people being mistreated was no secret to anyone.” As long as he filled out a use-of-force report, the sheriff “didn’t give a shit what I did,” Dedmon said. “That took care of it.”
Mississippi Today and The New York Times corroborated at least 17 incidents involving 22 victims, based on witness interviews, medical records, photographs of injuries and other documents. Allegations in these incidents include everything from melting metal onto a bare leg to using a Taser to shock people in their genitals.
Dedmon estimates he arrested hundreds of people a year. Those included many cases where he said officers raided homes without warrants, beat people to get information and illegally seized evidence that helped convict people of drug crimes.
Despite this evidence of possible wrongful convictions, the state of Mississippi has yet to conduct a review of all the cases involving Dedmon and other officers now in prison.
Sheriff became the father he never had
In 2019, Dedmon was involved in three deadly shootings, firing the fatal shot in one of them. Each time, he saw a therapist, who signed the paper for him to return to work. Each time, he was back on the street in a few days.

Afterward, Sheriff Bailey bragged about his young deputy, who became Rankin County’s “Top Cop” for the year. “When we would go to political functions, he would say I was the ‘deadliest motherf—er in Rankin County’ to his friends and people around, being funny,” Dedmon recalled. “I never found it very funny.”
In fall 2019, McAlpin became the department’s top investigator. Former deputies said he became the sheriff’s right-hand man.
When the question arose about who would replace the veteran investigator, few doubted it would be Dedmon. Former deputies said they admired Dedmon’s hard work but bristled at his arrogance.
The new job was a dream come true for the 25-year-old Dedmon. He began to arrest as many people as he could, including his own father for meth possession.
Bailey became the father he never had. And like a son, Dedmon wanted to please his father. He said he did everything the sheriff asked him to do, including working with jail inmates to muck out the chicken houses of the sheriff’s mother.
In return, Dedmon and his wife said Bailey bought them an elegant dinner on Valentine’s Day. Other gifts followed. Dedmon said the sheriff made him executor for his will, promising him $50,000, a half-dozen guns and a flatbed Dodge truck. Family members and friends recalled Dedmon telling them this.
Dedmon said the sheriff had him handle cases involving personal or political connections. For instance, although he worked as a narcotics investigator, he said Bailey assigned him to investigate a near-fatal attack in 2019, carried out by the brother of Bailey’s girlfriend.
Clint Pennington slashed his wife so badly that doctors had to put more than 80 stitches in her back. “I am in constant fear — fear that he will somehow try to hurt me again,” his then-wife, Amanda, wrote. “I never feel safe.”
After Pennington pleaded guilty to aggravated domestic violence, the judge sentenced him to five years in prison. Pennington served his time instead at the Simpson County Jail, where he became a trusty. He walked free on Sept. 6, 2024, after spending three years and four months behind bars.
Dedmon said by doing such favors for the sheriff, he received “the power to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted, but it came with a price.”
His wife filed for divorce in 2020. “He was married to his job,” she said, asking not to be named for fear of retribution. “If he heard on the radio that somebody’s house was burning, he was out the door. If a child was missing, he was out the door. If a storm left a road blocked, he was out the door with a chainsaw.”
After a heated argument with Dedmon, she said she complained to McAlpin, who chastised her, “We are alpha males, and you can’t treat us like this.”
That moment made her realize she would receive no sympathy from this brotherhood, she said. “That was Christian’s family.”
The fateful ‘mission’
On the evening of Jan. 24, 2023, thunder rumbled as Dedmon prepared to fry venison for him and Josh Hartfield, a narcotics investigator for Richland Police Department, who had come by to chat. 
Dedmon’s cellphone rang. It was McAlpin. The chief investigator fumed about the home near where he lived in Braxton. A neighbor had seen “suspicious” Black men at the house owned by a white woman.
Dedmon knew the home well. In recent years, several narcotics arrests had taken place there, and two years earlier, he had worked a drug homicide inside the home.
He said McAlpin told him to look out for cameras, lock up everyone there and make sure there were no bad mugshots.
The deputy asked Hartfield if he wanted to go. He did.
Dedmon texted fellow deputies and asked if they could go on a mission. Lt. Jeffrey Middleton, whose shift was called the “Goon Squad,” replied yes. So did patrol deputies Hunter Elward and Daniel Opdyke.
After they arrived, Dedmon and others kicked in the carport door. Harfield kicked open the back door.
For the two Black men inside, Eddie Parker and Michael Jenkins, the nightmare had just begun.
For an hour and a half, officers tortured the two men. After Jenkins continued to deny he knew anything about drugs, Elward jammed his pistol inside Jenkins’ mouth and pulled the trigger. 
Click.
The gun didn’t fire because the deputy had unloaded the chamber.
He racked the slide again, and when Jenkins repeated that he knew nothing, Elward pulled the trigger again. This time, a bullet smashed through Jenkins’ tongue and shattered his jaw.

As Jenkins lay bleeding, the officers dashed outside. Dedmon recalled McAlpin yelling, “Let me think, let me think.”
The officers planted drugs, disposed of evidence of their crimes and created a cover story. McAlpin and Middleton warned officers that if they failed to stick to this story, “they could find us all dead together,” Dedmon recalled.
When the two supervisors later saw Dedmon texting on his cellphone, they demanded to know who he was talking to, he recalled. He said they glared at him when he told them he was letting his girlfriend know he would be late.
Dedmon called for an ambulance, and when the sheriff arrived, the officers shared their concocted story of seizing the two men’s drugs and shooting Jenkins in self-defense. Bailey seemed satisfied.
When the sheriff saw that two deputies had turned off their body cameras, he became upset. He expected them to be turned on, but, as he later testified, he didn’t realize there was an exception for narcotics operations.
This wasn’t the only thing Bailey was upset about, according to two deputies present. They said Bailey mentioned the deadline to file for running for sheriff was Feb. 1, eight days from then.
Dedmon said Bailey called it “a bad time for him to have drama that close to an election qualification” because “someone else could put their name in the hat to run for election.”
Opdyke, another deputy there, said Bailey “was upset because it would bring bad publicity — as if we would’ve waited until after he was elected again, he would’ve swept it under the rug and we would’ve all been fine.”
The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, which investigates every officer-involved shooting, issued a press release: “Rankin County Sheriff’s Department deputies were conducting a narcotics investigation when they encountered a subject that displayed a gun towards the deputies. The subject was transported to a nearby hospital.”
The next day, Dedmon said the sheriff texted him, saying his Taser use would have the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department on the national news. His Taser had been fired four times and Elward’s, eight times.
Hartfield had denied using his Taser, but an internal investigation at the Richland Police Department determined he had fired it five times. The department demoted him, suspended him for two weeks without pay and placed him on administrative leave with pay.
At the Sheriff’s Department, McAlpin and Middleton continued to supervise their divisions. Dedmon, however, was assigned desk duty. “I felt sad, scared and miserable,” he said. “No one would speak to me, so I just started staying home.”
He saw the situation as a lose-lose proposition: Say nothing and risk prison time. Or tell the truth and risk being killed.
‘I knew my life was over’
Dedmon headed for the woods dressed in camouflage. He had his .270 Remington rifle. It was still deer season, his favorite time of year. Today, he had another prey in mind: himself.
He arrived before dawn and sat in the deer stand, watching the dark sky brighten into blue. Soon, streaks of yellow appeared. Then orange and red.
When a buck wandered up, Dedmon said he stared through the scope at the antlers stretching in all directions. He took aim but couldn’t bring himself to pull the trigger.
After the deer disappeared, he fired the rifle. The sound spooked him, and he left.
Each morning that followed, he had a different excuse for why he shouldn’t kill himself. One day, he worried about his daughter. On another, he thought suicide seemed scarier than what he would face behind bars. On yet another, he trembled at the thought of facing God for what he had done.
“I was caught between wanting to drink myself to death, tell the truth or just end it all,” he said. “I knew my life was over.”
Middleton and McAlpin kept reaching out to make sure he stuck to the cover story, Dedmon said. McAlpin had cheered on the torture of the two men, but now he wanted “to make it look like he was never on the scene. He used me to do it and threatened to kill me if I changed my mind.”
But when MBI agents began to question that story, McAlpin grew paranoid, Dedmon said. “He started acting insane.”
Dedmon continued to spiral downward. No longer receiving overtime pay for his narcotics work, he struggled financially. He said he texted the sheriff and asked if he could work on the chicken farm for extra money.
The sheriff never texted back, but a deputy showed up with a sealed envelope, Dedmon said. After the deputy left, he tore it open and counted the cash: $1,000.
‘Policemen can’t go to jail’
On July 13, 2023, Deputy Daniel Opdyke met with FBI agents, federal prosecutors and Justice Department officials. This time, he shared the whole story of what happened that night.
McAlpin confronted Dedmon outside a gas station. “He told me he was going to talk to the feds the following day and wanted to be sure I was going to continue to lie about him not being there,” Dedmon recalled. “He said, ‘Our lives are on the line. Don’t f— it up.’”
Dedmon was the last deputy to talk with the feds, and he volunteered little. Not long after, his attorney, Michael Cory, called and told him the feds were estimating he would receive a 24-year prison sentence. If he didn’t plead guilty, he was told, the feds planned to also indict him for kidnapping.
Cory said he let Dedmon know that he wasn’t so sure about the 24-year figure, given what he estimated the range would be under the federal sentencing guidelines.

Dedmon thought about his life. The joy he felt in becoming a law enforcement officer. The joy he felt in becoming a father. And now the despair he felt about serving more than two decades in prison. 
That meant he would miss his daughter’s high school graduation. He would miss her leaving home. He might even miss walking her down the aisle at her wedding.
The night before pleading guilty, he handed his law enforcement certificate and awards over to Nick McLendon, chief of the Richland Police Department, and asked him to use these items to warn cadets at the training academy about compromising their integrity.
The next day, Dedmon pleaded guilty to federal charges in the torture of Jenkins and Parker and spent his first night in jail. When his 7-year-old daughter learned that he wouldn’t be coming home, Dedmon’s mother quoted her as saying, “What do you mean he’s in jail? Policemen can’t go to jail.”

Hours after five of his deputies pleaded guilty to federal charges on Aug. 3, 2023, Bailey held a press conference, where he apologized to the victims but never mentioned them by name. 
He placed his hand on his chest. “My moral boundary is set by my Christian faith,” Bailey said. “Do I cross that boundary? Sometimes I do. These guys were so far past that boundary, it’s unbelievable.”
Asked how he didn’t know what these deputies were doing, he replied, “That’s what I have supervisors for.” What he didn’t mention was that two of his supervisors had been among those pleading guilty.
When a reporter said some residents were calling for his resignation, the sheriff laughed. “The only thing I’m guilty of in this incident is trusting grown men that swore an oath to do their job correctly.”
Asked if he thought these deputies could have committed similar acts in the past, Bailey replied, “I’d say anything is possible right now.”
Dedmon said for the sheriff “to act as if these five guys are the only people under his nose that used unnecessary force is a lie.”
Asked about Dedmon’s allegations, the department’s attorney, Jason Dare, responded that Dedmon is “a convicted felon – convicted of falsifying evidence.”
An investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times has revealed that a loose-knit group of Rankin County deputies had carried out a campaign of terror for two decades. They barged into homes in the middle of the night and tortured people they suspected of buying or selling drugs until they shared information.
“If the gun had not gone off that night and shot one of the victims through the mouth, there is a good chance the Goon Squad would still be operating,” said Jackson lawyer Jeffrey Reynolds, who represented Opdyke.
‘He hid behind his badge and gun’
The day before his sentencing on March 24, 2024, Dedmon heard on the radio that Elward had received 20 years in prison. He figured his sentence would be close to that. Twenty-two people had written letters of support, and some planned to testify.
An hour before his sentencing, his lawyer told him the judge was going to give him 40 years. “It was like being struck by lightning,” Dedmon recalled. “He told me it would do zero good for any of my character witnesses to speak, that Judge Lee had his mind made up.”
In the courtroom, Michael Jenkins called Dedmon “the worst example of a police officer in the United States.”
Michael Jenkins was in Rankin County Circuit Court, Monday, Aug. 14, 2023, to hear the guilty pleas of the officers accused of beating and torturing them in January.
In a statement, Jenkins said, “Every time I try to take a bite of food, the pain reminds me of what happened that night. All the things I used to enjoy doing in my life have been affected.”
The gunshot wound to the jaw has affected both his singing and drumming at church, he said. At night, he wakes up covered in sweat because of nightmares of the attack, he said. “I’m broken inside. I don’t ever think I will be the person that I was.”
Dedmon’s attorney told the judge the torture that took place that night was nothing new. “Everybody knew that was the culture of the department,” he said.
McAlpin, who received 27 years, put the whole attack in motion by ordering Dedmon to take care of the problem, the attorney said. “It’s an injustice to sentence Christian Dedmon to significantly more time than his supervisor, who was there, who initiated it, who didn’t stop it.”
Assistant U.S. Attorney Erin Chalk said Dedmon faced an additional charge  in an unrelated case for firing his gun to try and scare a confession out of a man he had pulled over to the side of the road. Although he was young, he knew what he was doing, she said. “He hid behind his badge and gun.”
Dedmon apologized to Parker and Jenkins, saying he would never forgive himself for what he did. “If I could take every bit of it back, I promise you I would, or if I could take it myself, I would.”
A year after the sentencings, Parker told Mississippi Today that he forgives his torturers. “I do, because they know not what they did,” he said. “That’s the way God put it on my heart.”
What concerns him is that other officers involved in similar conduct have yet to face charges. “They got nothing, not even a slap on the wrist,” he said. “It’s scary knowing that kind of danger is out there, walking free.”
For more than a year, Parker said he never left the house where he was tortured. After he began to leave, officers sometimes pulled him over and searched his car. He said he welcomed these searches because it gave him an opportunity to share his story.

But after Louisiana officers searched his car on Dec. 17, they arrested him. He now faces charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of cocaine, methamphetamine and ecstasy. He is also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm.
Parker had a felony in Rankin County for failing to “stop vehicle pursuant to officer’s signal” and was convicted in Alabama in 2019 for drug possession with intent to distribute.
Dedmon said he finds no joy in Parker’s arrest. “Prison is a very traumatic experience, and it would be very hard for me to wish this on anyone,” he said. “I truly wish him the best and pray that he uses this opportunity to turn his life around before he ends up with a sentence as lengthy as mine.”
‘Hell of a brotherhood, isn’t it?’
Dedmon said he entered law enforcement, “not as a devil, but to make a difference in the community.”
He doesn’t blame Jenkins and Parker for seeing him that way. “I can’t change their view of me,” he said. “I can only change the man I am from this point forward.”
He said he thanks God that Jenkins “is alive. Nothing about me matters.”
These days in prison, he sits with others battling suicidal thoughts. “I’m expected to set an example,” he said, “yet on the inside I’m dying.”
His life brightened in June when he married his longtime girlfriend. There was no ceremony. Instead, a Kansas pastor wed the pair by phone.
He is slated to be released from prison in 2057 — three years after his cousin, Deryl. By that time, Dedmon will be celebrating his 63rd birthday and eligible for Social Security.
“I’m sitting here with a life sentence while a number of those who did the same kinds of things I did have gotten promotions,” he said. “Hell of a brotherhood, isn’t it?”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/18132958/MT-ChristianDedmon-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:12:09.816046

As the Connecticut legislature overhauled the state’s towing laws last spring, lawmakers came up with a hopeful idea: gather towing companies, consumer advocates and state officials to hammer out a few arcane details that could have big implications for some Connecticut drivers whose cars are towed.
The ambitions of the task force, convened in response to a Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica investigation, grew quickly as it began to meet in September to come up with recommendations for the legislature. Perhaps they could make it easier for low-income people to get their towed cars back or prevent them from being towed at all. Maybe they could change the administrative process that sometimes made it hard to find owners of the cars, which frustrated drivers and towing companies alike.
But with a Feb. 1 deadline looming for its recommendations, the panel has made little progress on reaching a consensus.
That could pose hurdles for lawmakers who say towing practices are still unfair and want to pass more reforms during the legislative session that starts in February.
“We’re still anxiously, eagerly awaiting word from the working group on their recommendations,” said state Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, who co-chairs the Transportation Committee.
Until a few months ago, Connecticut residents’ cars were towed from their own apartment complexes without warning over minor issues like an expired parking sticker.
When those residents went to pick up their vehicles, towing companies often refused to take credit cards or even let owners get their belongings from inside their cars.
And if the owners didn’t have cash to pay the fees, which mounted every day, towing companies could ask the Department of Motor Vehicles for permission to sell some vehicles after just 15 days.
Much of that changed after a new law went into effect in October following the CT Mirror and ProPublica investigation that exposed how the state’s laws had come to favor towing companies over vehicle owners.
Towing companies must now give people warning before removing vehicles from apartment parking lots unless there’s a safety issue. The towers must accept credit cards and let people get their belongings. And although the sales process can begin after 15 days for vehicles worth less than $1,500, towers must wait 30 days before selling them.
Part of the new law also required that a DMV task force examine the process companies use to get rid of towed cars. Lawmakers said they especially wanted the group to look at what happens to profits from the sales of the towed vehicles. Currently, towing companies are supposed to hold onto proceeds for a year so owners or lenders can claim them. After that, any unclaimed funds, minus the towing costs and fees, are required to be turned over to the state. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found that hasn’t happened in part because the DMV never set up a system to collect the money.
The working group has met four times. They’ve talked about stopping towing fees from accumulating once vehicle owners indicate they want their cars back. They’ve also debated changing the way towing companies value cars, which determines how soon towers can start the sales process. DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera proposed scrapping the valuation system and letting companies sell all vehicles after 30 days.
And both consumer advocates and towing representatives complained about the process for notifying owners that their cars have been towed or are about to be sold. The system relies on the vehicle’s registration, which can often have out-of-date addresses. CT Mirror and ProPublica interviewed several people, particularly lower-income residents, who said they were never informed that their cars would be sold.
Yet at the most recent meeting Dec. 15, task force members couldn’t even agree on how many letters needed to be sent to vehicle owners. The meeting got heated on several occasions even as Guerrera warned the deadline to complete a report was approaching.
The working group hasn’t discussed how any proceeds should be given to the state.
Still, in an interview, Guerrera projected confidence that they would reach a compromise.
“You’ve got two sides here that are very passionate about what they believe in, and like any good piece of legislation that people try to draw up, it takes many times at the table to craft something that you can have individuals sign off at the end,” he said.
At Monday’s meeting, consumer advocate and attorney Raphael Podolsky said he was concerned the committee was missing some key issues including making sure people can get their vehicles back.
“I’m more concerned not how do you sell the car, but how do you make sure it never gets to that point?” Podolsky said.
Members of the towing industry argued against a DMV proposal that would mandate that companies send car owners a second certified letter when their vehicles are going to be sold, informing them of the date and location of the auction.
Eileen Colonese, secretary of the industry group Towing & Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said more letters won’t resolve the issue of addresses being wrong.
“You have to find out who the owner of the car is,” said Colonese of Farmington Motor Sports. “If we don’t solve that problem, all the rest of this is really a waste of everybody’s time and money.”
Towers and Guerrera proposed creating a DMV portal where towing companies would list every car towed and where it was being held.
Colonese said it’s difficult for the towers to agree to most of the proposals because they would add costs to companies. Transportation Committee ranking member Rep. Kathy Kennedy, R-Milford, is considering this question as well; “it’s their livelihood,” she said of the towing companies.
Cohen and her co-chair, Rep. Aimee Berger-Girvalo, D-Ridgefield, said they also want to see more transparency from the DMV after the news organizations found that a department employee faced little consequence for five years after an internal investigation found he had abused his power by trading favors for steep discounts on towed cars. The employee was fired last month. He appealed the decision and said he had done nothing wrong.
Guerrera said he wants the working group to have at least three recommendations before the legislature begins its three-month session. He said the group may have to meet twice more in January to come to an agreement. He warned if the group doesn’t reach a consensus, neither side will be happy with the report he plans to submit and what the legislature does from there.
“I’m going to submit the report after the next meeting or two meetings, and they can come back and go to the legislature and say, ‘I still don’t like it,’” Guerrera said. “But I am going to put down what I believe is something that is fair.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0908_SR_TowingMeetingDMV_106-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-23 05:12:09.816046

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Life-sustaining groundwater isn’t so far beneath our shoes, but knowledge about it, and the underground world it flows through, can feel far away.
In some cases, “we know more about distant star systems than we know about the interior of our own planet,” said Mike Howley, a senior geoscientist with the New Hampshire Geological Survey, within the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. 
Howley oversees the dozens of monitoring wells in the New Hampshire Geological Survey’s groundwater monitoring network. Data from the network is used at both the state and federal level, including to inform the National Weather Service’s U.S. Drought Monitor.
Drought data from the monitor is shared widely and used to understand the extent of drought in different regions across the country. Its collection starts at wells like those Howley oversees, where automated instruments and human observers alike access vast and little-understood groundwater networks.
Mike Howley inspects the elements of an automated water level measuring device at a groundwater well in Concord on Dec. 22. The device measures the level of groundwater in the soil, and the temperature. Groundwater typically retains heat well into winter, and then is slow to warm up again in summer, Howley said. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
On the chilly morning of Monday, Dec. 22, Howley was in the field, conducting a quarterly checkup on two of those monitoring wells at a state forest trailhead in Concord. This is a regular appointment for Howley: While automated stations can be checked once a quarter, the state also maintains multiple wells that can’t fit automatic instruments and must be checked manually once per month.
A monitoring station visit entails a water-level check to compare and verify the data logged by the computer. To reach water far below the ground, Howley unspools what appears to be a long tape measure capped with a metal probe. Two lengths of wire run down the tape; when the probe touches water, it completes a circuit, igniting a red light on the spool and sounding an alarm to alert the measurer that the tape has reached water.
Howley measures the depth of each well twice, taking notes throughout. Precision and consistency create the kind of data that can be shared and used far and wide, including by federal agencies, he said. 
On Dec. 22, Howley also removed one of the automated water level trackers for maintenance. The small computers log the water level every hour, and upload their data every midnight, contributing to a fine-grained dataset that can reveal both short- and long-term trends in groundwater fluctuation. 
One of the challenges Howley faces is the need to relocate a well when new development or evolving land use threaten its current location. Doing so requires finding a new location nearby, often on state land, then operating the new and old monitoring wells side-by-side for at least a year. Overlapping data is necessary to put measurements from the new well in context with those from the old well, so that the data — sometimes stretching back decades — isn’t cut off by the move, Howley said. Groundwater can behave differently from location to location, so comparing a year’s worth of measurements can help place measurements from two wells in conversation with one another.

Manual measurements help verify the data collected by automated instruments. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Finding dependable, safe locations to site wells “is kind of a game of whack-a-mole,” Howley said. “We’re trying to preserve these long-term monitoring locations in an ever-changing world.”
Howley likes his work, even on days like Dec. 22, when the instruments’ computers were sending error messages that they were too cold to upload their data while Howley was reeling in wet measuring tapes and taking off his gloves to note measurements despite the 20-degree weather. 
“I thoroughly enjoy it,” he said. 
To Howley, the work is essential. When droughts like this year’s set in, public attention turns to groundwater with some urgency, he noted. But, Howley said, it’s important to pay attention to the state of the natural resource at all times, not only during a crisis. 
He and other scientists are seeking more information about how groundwater responds to weather events and climatic shifts, with effects ranging from droughts and drinking water uncertainty to flooding. Measurements like those taken at the department’s monitoring wells are crucial for building such understanding, said Howley. 
“If we, as a society, want to know how much water is available, we have to monitor,” Howley said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Howley2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-23 04:57:37.617656

Santiago/Getty Images)This story was originally published by the Athens County Independent.
CLEVELAND, Ohio — Cleveland Immigration Court Judge Richard Drucker declined to consider arguments Dec. 18 that he should grant bond to two brothers who were transferred from Athens County custody to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this year.
Victor Laverde Laguna and Gregory Javier Laverde Laguna, asylum seekers from Venezuela, will therefore remain in ICE custody for the foreseeable future.
Victor Laverde Laguna and his son, Julio Laverde Belandria, told the Independent in a Dec. 18 interview that the brothers sought asylum in the United States after the Venezuelan government began targeting Victor Laverde Laguna for his statements critical of President Nicolás Maduro.
The brothers had been living in the United States for about a year before they were arrested in a sting operation conducted by multiple law enforcement agencies in Athens County. The operation targeted an alleged extortion scheme.
Victor Laverde Laguna and Gregory Laverde Laguna have maintained that they did not know their work picking up and delivering packages had anything to do with a criminal enterprise.
Neither brother speaks English, and Gregory Laverde Laguna has Down syndrome.
Their local criminal cases were ultimately dismissed with prejudice, meaning the charges cannot be brought again by the state. In court orders, Athens County Court of Common Pleas Court Judge Patrick Lang wrote, “in regard to these charges, Victor Laguna remains an innocent man” and “Gregory Laguna remains an innocent man.”
Nevertheless, the brothers remain in custody at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, per ICE records.
Liliana Vasquez, the brothers’ immigration attorney, characterized the immigration court system, which operates under the direction of the Trump Administration, as a “guise for a justice system.”
“As a judge, you’re an impartial adjudicator, an interpreter of the law, right?” Vasquez said. “That is not the case in immigration court. It’s a guise.”
Drucker, the judge in the brothers’ case, told Vasquez he would deny her motion to grant the brothers’ bond before he heard anything from her on Dec. 18.
“You’re not gonna like my decision today,” he said at the beginning of the day’s proceedings. “We don’t have jurisdiction to grant bond, still.”
Vasquez told the Independent the judge’s lack of consideration for her request to grant bond stems from the Trump Administration’s reinterpretation of decades-old immigration law, challenged by hundreds of mainly successful federal court cases. Critics say the Trump Administration’s reinterpretation of the law denies immigrants the right to due process.
“It’s just very disappointing,” Vasquez said of Drucker’s Thursday decision. “I did have arguments. I prepared a bond motion with the actual cases where bond has been granted. … And it just seems that none of that was taken into consideration.”
That has been typical of Vasquez’s recent experiences in immigration court, she said.
“This has been routine,” Vasquez said. “The fact that us attorneys expend work and effort to putting forth these arguments and submit documentation for the court to just brush us off is not new. It’s been happening consistently.”
Vasquez has the opportunity to appeal the judge’s decision within the immigration court system. However, she said her priority will likely be to submit a petition for habeas corpus to federal court, which operates independently of the executive branch. Through a petition for habeas corpus, the brothers would seek a court determination that their detention is unlawful.
Vasquez said the federal court has “been doing its job in that it has been upholding the law the way it should be. Unfortunately, it does take a little bit more time, and it costs money.”
Julio Laverde Belandria, Victor Laverde Laguna’s son, is paying for the brothers’ legal representation, which Vasquez is offering at a discounted rate, the lawyer told the Independent.
Meanwhile, the brothers are facing harsh conditions while detained, Victor Laverde Laguna said.
He said the brothers have experienced “violations of human rights” from their initial arrest in Athens County through the present.
The Independent has requested written reports from the arrest, though the reports were not immediately fulfilled.
Victor Laverde Laguna told the Independent in an interview that in addition to injuries both of them experienced during their initial arrests, Gregory Laverde Laguna has suffered emotional distress and repeated threats of violence. The situation was at its worst while the brothers were held at the Butler County Correctional Complex, Victor Laverde Laguna told the Independent.
“Throughout this time, I was thinking, ‘How has no one noticed? How is it possible that my brother can be detained with individuals that are this violent, that are this aggressive? Where is the justice? Why is nothing being done?’” Victor Laverde Laguna said. (Statements by both Victor Laverde Laguna and his son, Julio Laverde Laguna, were spoken in Spanish and translated to English by Vasquez.)
Victor Laverde Laguna said he went on a hunger strike for three days while incarcerated in Hamilton County, “hoping to get my brother released.” This was unsuccessful.
Victor Laverde Laguna said he is “perplexed at how so many agents can operate with so much force towards an individual with Down syndrome.”
The situation has been difficult for Victor Laverde Laguna, too.
“I have felt very hopeless with my hands tied because there is nothing that I can do,” he said.
Laverde Belandria said the stakes of his father’s and uncle’s immigration cases are “very high.”
“Victor had actively spoken out against the government of Nicolas Máduro. He had denounced his policies, denounced his deterioration of human rights and civil rights for all citizens of Venezuela, and because of that, Victor was persecuted, threatened, harassed by the government of Nicolas Máduro,” Laverde Belandria said.
“Giving up is not an option, because they would be facing certain death,” he added.
 Impact of local arrest 

The brothers may not have ended up in their current situation had they not been transferred into ICE custody while their local criminal cases remained pending, Vasquez told the Independent.
She said the move to transfer the brothers was “not typical.”
“Usually they just place an ICE holder on them, wherever they are being held,” Vasquez told the Independent. “When there’s criminal charges, they’ll be held out in the custody of the state or whatever state agency is pursuing the charges.”
“In this situation, ICE physically went and then took them into custody prior to the criminal case being resolved,” Vasquez said. “And so, that is what I feel is a little unusual.”
Vasquez suggested local decision-making led to the transfer.
The Athens County Prosecutor’s Office told the Independent in an email, “The office had no communication with I.C.E. during the pendency of the case.”
The office added that any speculation that ACPO cooperated with ICE was “not accurate.”
ICE submitted immigration detainers for the brothers to the Southeast Ohio Regional Jail Sept. 24, according to records obtained by the Independent.
SEORJ Warden Josh Vanbibber forwarded the detainers to Athens County Prosecutor Keller Blackburn and Athens County Sheriff Rodney Smith Oct. 28, and asked the two how they would like to proceed.
No further emails were obtained by the Independent’s request. Smith has not returned the Independent’s requests for comment on the subject.
Local officials handed the brothers over to ICE Oct. 29.
The prosecutor’s office, which declined in a court hearing to exonerate the brothers, said in its statement that it moved to dismiss the brothers’ cases so that the local cases were not a “barrier to federal action.”
Regardless of how exactly the brothers ended up in ICE custody, had law enforcement followed the process Vasquez says is more typical in her experience, “It could have very well been that ICE never took them into custody,” Vasquez said.
“I personally have seen situations where there is an ICE holder on the individual, and then the charges get dismissed, and then ICE does not pick them up,” Vasquez said.
“My brother should have never been incarcerated, and he should have never been treated with the violence that he was from day one,” Victor Laverde Laguna said.
Because the brothers were transferred to ICE, “now we have to move forward with the immigration court,” Vasquez said.
Drucker scheduled the brothers for hearings in their immigration cases for March 9. Vasquez said if the brothers are successful in their petition for habeas corpus before the hearings, the hearings will be postponed.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal / Republish photo only with original story.)What a cop out. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he didn’t want to sign another voter suppression bill into law before he signed a sweeping anti-voting measure into law last Friday. 
Spoken like a true invertebrate. 
Despite an outpouring of opposition from voting rights advocates, DeWine codified Ohio Senate Bill 293, a measure rushed through the legislature with only one hearing in the Ohio House that will change nearly every aspect of voting by mail, voter registration, and provisional ballot processing. 
Why? Coercion from Trump World and litigation threats from its personal law firm, aka the U.S. Justice Department, unless its voter restriction demands were met. 
Never mind that states, not the president or his heavy-handed lobbyists, run elections in America. But the cowardly governor clutched his pearls and caved. 
Then he came up with a pretext about a possible ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on mail ballot deadlines that could decide whether states can count postmarked absentee ballots that arrive after Election Day. 
DeWine weighed the legally dubious arm-twisting of a historically corrupt regime and what-if judicial scenarios against the rights of tens of thousands of voters being disenfranchised to appease Trump — and chose excuse over principle. Again. 
Ohio Senate Bill 293 was fast-tracked (to dodge public scrutiny and input) from introduction to passage and the governor’s desk for one purpose: control. 
It was designed and padded with last minute provisions to confuse and curb voter turnout, especially among Democratic-leaning demographics, in time to affect the 2026 midterms. 
The trumped-up voting barriers DeWine “reluctantly” imposed on statewide voters, unsupported by objective data from Ohio’s own “gold standard” election administration, are a significant step backward for that system and voter rights.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Yet, next year, thanks to Trump toadying opportunists in the Statehouse and an excuse-making governor, Ohio will needlessly take away the already whittled down four-day grace period it gave to voters whose absentee ballots were properly completed, postmarked on time, and mailed before the legal deadline. 
That post-election window offered 803,253 Ohioans, who voted by mail in the 2024 election, trust that their ballots would be counted if they arrived in the post-election window allotted — as some 9,500 ballots did last year. 
But next year, under Ohio Senate Bill 293, those same U.S. citizens who were eligible to vote in Ohio and did so before the last presidential election could have their otherwise valid ballots tossed if they arrive after Election Day.
The law DeWine enacted effectively penalizes voters for postal deliveries that fail to meet sensible expectations. 
The flimsy rationale for eliminating what was once uncontroversial — extra time to accommodate absentee voters for mail delays beyond their control — was “Election Day is Election Day for a reason” and “Allowing ballots to be delivered days after the election does nothing but hurt the integrity and credibility of our elections.”  
Such well-articulated profundities are standard fare from state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, the go-to fabulist committed to making voting as difficult as possible for Ohioans with baseless nonsense that defies logic and discards facts. 
The Bowling Green Republican’s thin reasoning masks a sinister mission to diminish voter power and citizen challenges to non-responsive government.
During the deliberately short-circuited legislative process to hurry Ohio Senate Bill 293 through the Ohio House and enactment in 2025, Gavarone folded in core components of another anti-voter bill of hers that had not passed the Senate. 
It was a devious back door move to jam through key parts of S.B. 153 (Ohio’s copycat version of the federal SAVE Act stalled in Congress) that will make it harder for eligible Ohioans to vote, harder to collect petition signatures, and create huge bureaucratic and financial burdens on county boards of elections. 
What sailed out of the legislature in the waning hours of the lame duck session is worse than you think. 
The bill that is now law also requires “documentary proof of citizenship” to register to vote or update your voter registrations (with birth certificates or passports that millions of voters don’t have), shuts down online registration and voter registration drives, increases provisional voting exponentially, and creates potential invalidations for minor clerical errors (which risks large-scale disenfranchisement of voters), bans drop boxes, makes citizen initiatives much harder and more expensive to conduct (to undermine direct democracy rights in the state), and expands mass voter purges. 
This is not about election security. This is about erecting obstacles to suppress participation. To disenfranchise countless eligible Ohio voters, particularly married women, young people, the poor, people of color, foreign-born Ohioans. Many in these groups already face disproportionate barriers to voting. 
The additional roadblocks Gavarone copy and pasted into Ohio Senate Bill 293 could prevent some from exercising their fundamental right to cast a ballot entirely. 
This is democracy under aggressive assault in the state. 
Mike DeWine could have vetoed S.B. 293 but said he didn’t to avoid potential chaos in future elections that might happen with a possible Supreme Court ruling that could affect the state or not. 
Instead of making it easier for eligible Ohio voters to freely and fairly participate in our democratic process with expanded access and accommodations, DeWine copped for excuses that allowed more hurdles to be erected for Ohioans who just want to cast a ballot, have it count and not lose their birthright to petition for government change under punitive rules drafted to derail grassroots campaigns.  
More legacy rot for the go-along governor.

(Photo by Clay Wirestone/Kansas Reflector)More of my life used to revolve around buttons than it does today. I seem to remember those plastic brown swirl buttons coming loose, dangling by a thread, needing to be stitched back on my collar or cuff.
To a child, buttons seem mysterious. They attach pieces of your clothing to one another, and they don’t always cooperate with tiny fingers. I suspect that we all have primordial memories of fumbling with buttons on a shirt or a coat or a pair of pants. I can cast my mind back and almost feel my fingers stubbing against one another as they try to ease a button up through the buttonhole.

Little things
Small essays on simple subjects.
Read the archive.

I’m not sure if the rise of fast fashion, easy-to-replace clothing sold at low prices, has affected our relationship with buttons. I suspect it has. We prefer sweatpants with elastic waistbands and cavernous shirts we can pull over our heads and jam our arms through. Bing, bang, boom. Dressed.
Many don’t tie shoes anymore. Pairs of footwear come with pretied laces or no laces at all. Sometimes they use the same kind of elastic as the waistbands of those sweatbands.
I remember my mother’s red sliding button box. It was made of metal, painted a vivid cardinal that browned over the years. The top would slide back, and inside you sorted through a cornucopia of ceramic and glass and stone and who knows what else buttons. Some were tiny, with a couple of infinitesimal holes, while others were large flat discs.
The buttons, dozens of them, shaded from white to gray to brown to black and back to off-white again. Here and there you might glimpse a vivid red or blue or green.
At one point, my mother taught me how to sew buttons back on shirts. You would thread the needle — a dangerous and painstaking task on its own — and then pull the thread through the shirt and then the tiny hole in the button. You would draw the thread through until the needle was free. Then you would turn the needle 180° to go back through the second hole in the button. You would repeat this process until you had gone round three or four times, then tie off the thread on the inside of the garment.
I wonder if parents today teach their children how to sew buttons back on their shirts. My son learned to sew after a fashion, but just because we had an ample supply of thread and fabric. He assembled makeshift clothing just because he could.
I myself never caught that sewing bug, but I understood why it might be necessary to repair a shirt. I understood that you weren’t just going to replace it when everything else worked perfectly well. I remember my father’s half dozen white dress shirts, made from a thin white fabric. Sections would fray until they finally graduated to the work shirt part of the closet.
Buttons don’t preoccupy me anymore, with one exception. My husband gave me a gorgeous woven shirt from Wax London for my birthday this year, a shirt covered with textures and patterns, yet staid enough to wear from Kansas Reflector events. It includes a column of mid-sized, off-white plastic buttons down the front.
I love that shirt. When I button it from top to bottom, connecting one side to the other, I remember the younger me and my mother and the world of the past we all yearn for but can never regain.

San Mateo adopted a new approach to mental health 911 calls by pairing police with mental health clinicians. Researchers found that it reduced the number of future mental health emergency calls and involuntary psychiatric holds by roughly 17%.


Briana Fair, a mental health clinician with the San Mateo Police Department, received a dozen voicemails from the same distressed caller over a single weekend this month. She knew the voice. It was her client, saying that a celebrity has been hacking her phone, that she needed help moving into a different apartment and why was the process taking so long?
“Normally, she won’t call like this unless she’s starting to get towards a crisis,” Fair said. 
If Fair keeps her close, it will ensure she is connected with the services she needs and prevent her from calling 911 dispatch, reducing the possibility of a full-blown crisis involving officers or unnecessary hospitalizations.
“I fill in the gaps,” said Fair. “It’s just a matter of getting her the right supports.”
It’s working, according to a new study of San Mateo County’s efforts from Stanford’s John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities, which found that pairing law enforcement officers with mental health clinicians reduces the likelihood of costlier and more intrusive interventions.
Fair was hired four years ago as part of a program to pilot this approach, also known as a “co-responder model,” across San Mateo County’s four largest cities — Daly City, San Mateo, Redwood City and South San Francisco. The idea was to free up police officers and provide alternatives to incarceration and hospital emergency rooms for people in a mental health crisis. Since then, the model has rolled out to police departments in nearly every city in the county. 
Researchers behind the Stanford study found the co-responder model decreased involuntary psychiatric holds by approximately 17% and reduced the likelihood of future mental health 911 calls among the four pilot cities. The hold allows a hospital to keep someone for up to 72 hours to determine if they are a danger to themselves or others. Given the reduction of roughly 370 involuntary psychiatric holds over the course of two years, researchers Tom Dee and Jaymes Pyne estimated an annual cost savings of roughly $300,000 to $800,000. 
“We’ve got to look to alternatives and really understand that police are not the best equipped to handle mental health crisis situations,” said San Mateo County Executive Officer Mike Callagy, who proposed the pilot after seeing cases that resulted in officers using force and in lawsuits.
During each visit with her client, Fair tries to help her check something off a list of things that have been bothering her. Today, they’re sitting next to one another as they call California’s social services department to ask about in-home care. They’re placed on hold and after five minutes, her client lets out a deep sigh. 
“I know, it’s a lot,” Fair said. “That’s why I’m here.”

As jazz music plays in the background of the call, Fair picks up a bottle of dry shampoo from the desk, reads the label aloud and asks her how she likes it. She brought the product over during one of their last visits — a bandaid solution that she devised because her client was having trouble bathing herself. 
“Have you tried it yet?” she asks. “Want me to spray it for you? Brush it first.”
Her client takes her hair out of its ponytail, brushes it with her fingers and runs her hands along the part. Fair stands up from her chair, shakes the bottle and mists it over her head. 
“Does it feel better?” she asks.
“Yes, but you sprayed it in my mouth,” her client says, letting out a big laugh. “It feels fresh.”
Rising number of mental health calls
Stanford’s research adds to a growing body of evidence about the positive impact of alternative first response programs, which have proliferated across the country amid calls for police reform in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder in 2020. Those reforms are so nascent that not much is known about them, Dee said, and his study is one of a handful that provides a credible evaluation. 
“This is a common-sense reform with a great deal of promise,” he said. “That being said, it’s not a cut-and-paste kind of reform. There are serious design and implementation details that matter for realizing the promise of these sorts of initiatives.”
Some of those details include having buy-in from the police, training dispatchers on how to triage calls, and integrating mental health staff. 
San Mateo Police Chief Ed Barberini said it was a “risky proposition” when his agency decided to participate in the pilot program, worrying that his officers would push back. But mental health calls were on the rise, he said, and without clinical expertise, police officers were being put in a difficult position. That sentiment has been shared by law enforcement agencies across the state, some of which have recently distanced themselves from mental health calls. 
“We recognized that we were triaging problems and just finding short-term solutions,” said Barberini. “I’m pleasantly surprised with how things have turned out.”

Prior to the pilot program, San Mateo police officers who responded to mental health 911 calls had to decide whether to send the person to the hospital for a 72-hour involuntary hold, arrest them, or leave them to their own devices. By pairing them with a clinician, the agency has been able to provide safety planning, follow-up calls and connections to community partners for people in mental health crises. 
Mariela Ruiz-Angel, director of Alternative Response Initiatives at Georgetown Law’s Center for Innovations in Community Safety, said a co-responder model is fantastic — but it’s just the beginning of what a progressive city looks like. 
“This is really about evolving to a level in which we don’t have to send out cops or fire for basic-level need calls,” she said. “The idea was never about taking cops out of the equation altogether. The idea was that we don’t have to center them as the main response of 911. We don’t have to make public safety about cops. Public safety is about the appropriate response.”
De-escalating a family feud
The pilot program cost approximately $1.5 million over the course of two years, split between the county and the four participating cities. Once it ended, the San Mateo Police Department — an agency consisting of 116 sworn officers — converted Fair’s role to a permanent position as the agency’s first-ever mental health clinician. The city is also using grant money to employ an additional mental health clinician part-time. Every other participating city has also found a way to sustain its program. 
On a Monday morning, Fair responds to emails from police officers who have asked her to follow up with people they interacted with over the weekend. This time of year has been busy, Fair says, because the holidays can be lonely. In the last week alone, she’s had to respond to a variety of crises: evaluating a kid who had an interrupted suicide attempt and responding to a transgender youth who wanted to stab themselves.
A radio sits next to her desk. She pauses to listen more intently as a dispatcher relays information about a person who thinks they’re being followed by a federal agent. A family member called in to report the episode. A few minutes later, Fair slings her backpack over her arm, sticks the radio in her pocket and quickly winds her way through the hallway to the garage. In the backseat of her county car – a white Toyota Prius – is a bulletproof vest, which she says she rarely uses. 
Outside an apartment complex, Fair pulls over and turns on her flashers. The process, also referred to as “staging,” is when she parks two blocks away so police officers, who have already arrived, can vet the scene to make sure it’s safe for her arrival.

A few minutes later, she opens the car door and jogs over in her black Nikes and tan cargo pants. An officer introduces her to the family and from there, Fair’s work unfolds. She moves back and forth between the family and their loved one, who’s sitting across the street on a bench, as she collects information from both parties: Is there a mental health history? What kind of substances have they used before? Are they currently receiving any treatment? Have they been hospitalized before? Did they make any threats? What do you want to see happen today?
After 10 minutes, Fair pulls one of the officers aside to let him know that the person doesn’t need to be hospitalized. “Let’s safety plan,” she tells him. It’s what the agency does if they receive a call that doesn’t rise to the level of an involuntary psychiatric hold. At that point, officers say, they’re “just playing peacemaker.”
Fair huddles beside the family to explain that the situation is no longer a police matter or a mental health crisis, but rather, a family matter. Still, she doesn’t want to leave them feeling alone. They create a “safety plan” that everyone can get on board with so that, as she later explains, “We don’t get another call in 10 minutes because they’re arguing down the street.” 
“We get calls like this — where it sounds like it’s going to be wild — and then we get here and it’s just a family matter,” she said. “It happens.”

That work became the Myrtle Street Corridor Master Plan, a proposal and recommendations to transform an aging industrial area into a cleaner, greener “engine” for New Britain’s next phase of growth.
 At the time, the street symbolized the broader challenges the city faced: disinvestment, low incomes, and a lingering gap between opportunity and the neighborhoods that needed it most.

Shuyue Zhang

Today, New Britain is beginning to move in a new direction. The question is whether these early steps can add up to a coherent strategy that delivers real benefits for residents.
New Britain’s story is familiar across post-industrial Connecticut. Once a powerhouse of precision manufacturing —home to Stanley Works, Fafnir Bearing, and other iconic firms— the city has steadily transitioned into a service-oriented economy. According to the U.S. Census, New Britain’s median household income remains around $57,000, significantly below the state average of over $80,000. Population has stabilized at about 74,000, and the city is now one of the youngest and most diverse in Connecticut. Poverty rates remain among the region’s highest, particularly in census tracts around Myrtle Street, many of which are designated federal Opportunity Zones.
Yet in recent years, New Britain has begun to attract exactly the kind of investment that suggests a more sustainable future is possible. Downtown, the CTfastrak bus rapid transit line and the Beehive Bridge have reconnected key districts and spurred new housing and small business activity. The city has embraced Complete Streets design, transit-oriented development, and public realm improvements. These are some of the steps that many Connecticut cities struggled to take.
Myrtle Street, where I worked, sits right at the intersection of these trends. And the scale of change underway there would have been hard to imagine when I drafted that plan.
The most transformative project is the Energy & Innovation Park, a nearly $1 billion redevelopment on former Stanley Black & Decker property. Anchored by a 19.98-megawatt fuel-cell micro-grid and a large-scale data center, it is one of the nation’s most significant clean-energy-powered digital infrastructure projects. 
The first part of this plan, The 67-fuel cell array, was installed last year. State and local officials estimate hundreds of construction jobs, long-term technical positions, and tens of millions in local tax revenue over the coming decades. For a corridor once defined by shuttered factories, this represents a profound shift toward a clean-energy and innovation-driven economy. 
Just down the street, Rich Products Corporation undertook a major expansion to increase Carvel ice cream cake production from 12 million to 19 million per year, adding about 100 permanent jobs. Smaller parcels along Bond and Burritt streets—long vacant or underused—are now converted into new housing, including market-rate apartments at 480 Myrtle Street.
One of the corridor’s most important developments is finally moving forward: the redevelopment of Mount Pleasant, an 81-year-old public housing complex identified in the original plan as a major barrier to revitalization. Luckily, the Common Council has approved the master plan for the community. Kenneth Boroson Architects is currently working on this project to replace obsolete units with new, mixed-income housing and a redesigned street network intended to reconnect residents with Myrtle Street, transit, and jobs.
Altogether, these changes suggest that New Britain —long labeled a “struggling mill city” —is emerging as a regional hub for clean energy, light manufacturing, digital infrastructure, and urban reinvestment.
But while the projects themselves are encouraging, the bigger question is how New Britain can turn them into lasting, inclusive growth. Based on both my planning work and the city’s recent trajectory, three priorities stand out.
First, Myrtle Street, now attracting major private investment, has the potential to become a true innovation and opportunity corridor. The city needs zoning that supports a mix of uses, design standards that make the street safer and more walkable, and clear expectations for employers to participate in local hiring and training. 
The corridor sits between downtown and several low-income neighborhoods, its redevelopment must function as a bridge to connect, not a barrier that divides. 
Additionally, rebuilding Mount Pleasant as a vibrant, mixed-income neighborhood with new design, active community spaces, and firm protections against displacement would demonstrate that public housing can be transformed without pushing residents aside. 
Finally, the city must link new investment directly to stronger workforce pipelines. Manufacturing, health care, education, and services remain New Britain’s backbone, and targeted training in these fields can quickly improve household stability. By partnering more proactively with anchoring institutions, small businesses, and local nonprofits, the city can better connect high school students and adult learners to the jobs emerging from current growth. Economic development reaches its full potential only when residents can access the opportunities it creates.
New Britain is not meant  to start from scratch. The city has a long tradition of hard work, immigrant entrepreneurship, and resilience. But at this moment, when historic industrial land is being redeveloped, New Britain has a chance to redefine itself again.
When I first walked the Myrtle Street corridor, it was easy to see only what the city had lost. Now, the same corridor tells a different story: a community trying to build a more innovative, more equitable future. 
If New Britain can connect these emerging projects with its long-term vision, the city will be well-positioned not only to grow, but to grow in a way that lifts the people who have been here all along.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)One of Rep. Nick Begich III’s uncles is endorsing his main Democratic opponent, Matt Schultz, in next year’s election. Tom Begich’s name was atop a list released to the Alaska Beacon by Schultz’s campaign this month.
Begich’s endorsement of his nephew’s opponent won’t surprise people familiar with Alaska politics — he’s a longtime figure in the state’s Democratic scene, has been publicly critical of his nephew’s actions and is running as a Democrat in the governor’s election — but Schultz’s list and a similar list of endorsements by Republicans for Begich III shows how the state’s political establishment is settling on a two-person race for U.S. House, unlike the crowded contest for governor.
“It will be awkward. It’s always awkward,” Tom Begich said of the endorsement, “ but my mom taught us to learn to live with disagreement, to move beyond it. It doesn’t change the fact that I love my nephew. Just, I’m not supporting him in this election.”
Tom Begich is among 14 people — 12 Republicans and two Democrats — who have registered to run for governor in next year’s election.
Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited and unable to run. 
While there are plenty of candidates for the governor’s seat, the number of people running for federal office is tiny. Incumbent U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican, doesn’t have a well-known challenger yet. Former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, has been rumored as a possible opponent but has yet to file. 
In the U.S. House race, as Begich III seeks re-election, he has the endorsement of President Donald Trump and a wide range of state and national Republicans, including those running for governor on different tickets.
The same is true on the Democratic side, where support for Schultz appears almost entirely united.
“I’m very pleased to support him and glad he’s running,” said state Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage and the other Democratic candidate in the governor’s race.
“I think he’s more connected with the general, broad spectrum of values in Alaska, more connected with some of the challenges we’re facing. He’s really looking carefully at how we’re dealing with homelessness, and I think he’s concerned about some of the affordability issues that are particularly a challenge in rural Alaska,” Claman said of Schultz.
Among the other people endorsing Schultz are independent state Rep. Alyse Galvin, who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. House in 2020 and 2018, and Forrest Dunbar, a Democratic state senator who ran unsuccessfully for House in 2014. 
One notable absence is Peltola, who held Alaska’s U.S. House seat for one term before Begich III defeated her in the 2024 election.
Also missing is longtime Democrat Mark Begich, the incumbent Republican’s other uncle and Alaska’s U.S. senator from 2009 to 2015.
“There’s definitely been a lot of support from Democrats all around the state, and I’m very grateful for that. It seems to be a lot of coalescing support,” Schultz said by phone.
A pastor in Anchorage, Schultz spoke on the day that the U.S. House announced that it would not vote to renew subsidies for health insurance policies purchased on the federal marketplace.
Without those subsidies, the prices of many policies will spike with the start of the year.
“That’s really, really sad and disturbing,” Schultz said. “It seems like it should be a no-brainer that you start out by making sure that people can afford their lifesaving medicine.”
Schultz said that as he’s gone around seeking early support for his campaign, he’s found joy and excitement among people who want to find a common good.
“It really is this wonderful excitement to say — just like we pulled together as a nation to go to the moon, we can pull together as a state to provide food and health care to people. It’s a goal that matters so much and is so basically good at its heart that people can’t wait to start working for it,” he said. “I think there’s a hope out there that has felt absent in the last decade or so.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Brown University’s head of public safety is now on administrative leave as the Ivy League school undergoes two outside reviews of its security practices and its response to the Dec. 13 mass shooting that killed two students and injured nine others.
University President Christina H. Paxson wrote in a message to the Brown community Monday that Vice President for Public Safety and Emergency Management Rodney Chatman would be on leave “effective immediately.”
Hugh T. Clements, a former Providence police chief, will assume daily oversight of campus policing and serve as the interim vice president for public safety. Paxson noted that Clements will report directly to her.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Education also announced Monday that it will conduct its own review of Brown’s security practices, with the feds interested in the university’s potential violations of the Jeanne Clery Campus Safety Act, which allows universities compliant with security standards to receive financial aid money.
The Corporation of Brown University, the governing committee of the school, will approve the “external organizations” who will ultimately carry out an After-Action Review and a separate Comprehensive Campus Safety and Security Assessment,” Paxson wrote.
“A thorough After-Action Review is an essential part of any recovery and response following a mass casualty event like the one that has devastated our campus,” Paxson wrote. “A review like this is standard…These reviews must be both thorough and comprehensive, and the University is committed to sharing key outcomes of both reviews with our community and the public.”
The After-Action Review will look back at the Dec. 13 shooting and examine how Brown responded before, after, and during the event. This review will look at Brown’s emergency response and its coordination with law enforcement in the days that followed the violence that took place in the Barus and Holley building.
Still, Paxson noted, “The response of Brown’s Public Safety officers to the Dec. 13 shooting has been praised by the other law enforcement agencies that assisted Brown on that terrible day. There is no question about the bravery, dedication and commitment of Brown’s Public Safety officers in their rapid response to the scene of the shooting. Our officers were first on the scene mere minutes after the shooting, and their actions saved lives.
The “Comprehensive Campus Safety and Security Assessment will more thoroughly scrutinize Brown’s current safety and security policies, from procedures and staffing to technology and training. Building access, camera coverage, and other security infrastructure will be included as part of this review. 
“I understand the gravity of the concerns about safety that follow a tragedy of the magnitude that Brown has suffered,” Paxson wrote. “I want to assure you of Brown’s deep commitment to take every possible action to increase the safety and security of our campus, with the goal of protecting our community from future harm.”
The school will also set up a “rapid response team” to focus on immediate measures ahead of students’ return to campus for the spring semester, which begins on Jan. 21, according to the Brown website. Paxson wrote that full university operations will resume on Jan. 6. Winter session courses began Monday and will run through Jan. 20. 
Paxson’s letter noted that going forward, the university’s Office of the Registrar website will require Brown credentials to access information on classroom and exam locations.  
The more immediate security measures will include increased police patrols and presence, expedited conversions of buildings with key-based access to card-based access, the installation of additional security cameras (including at Barus and Holley), and an expansion of on-campus panic alarms.
A news release from the Education Department cited concerns that “campus surveillance and security system may not have been up to appropriate standards, allowing the suspect to flee while the university seemed unable to provide helpful information about the profile of the alleged assassin.”
The feds said Brown must submit information — including annual security reports, crime and dispatch logs, and records of emergency notifications — to the department’s Office of Federal Student Aid by Jan. 30, 2026.
“After two students were horrifically murdered at Brown University when a shooter opened fire in a campus building, the Department is initiating a review of Brown to determine if it has upheld its obligation under the law to vigilantly maintain campus security,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement Monday.  
Of the nine students with gunshot injuries hospitalized after the shooting, “all but two” had been discharged from Rhode Island Hospital as of Monday evening, Paxson wrote.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal district judge ruled Monday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia can remain free from government custody, allowing him to spend the Christmas and New Year’s holidays with his family in Beltsville.
Judge Paula Xinis came after a contentious one-hour hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt during which she grilled Justice Department attorney Ernesto Molina, saying she was “growing beyond impatient” with the Trump administration’s constant “misrepresentations” in court.
Xinis kept a temporary restraining order in place to prohibit the Trump administration from detaining Abrego Garcia in the case she called “an extremely irregular and extraordinary situation.”
“Once again, I’m making a finding that these representations, which are misrepresentations, are in bad faith,” Xinis told Molina. “You cannot do that, OK? Judges take the rule of law very seriously and are faithful to giving both sides the opportunity to be heard.”

The case has shone a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, since Abrego Garcia was detained in March by immigration officials and deported a harsh prison facility in his native El Salvador — despite a previous court ruling that prohibited his transfer there because of fear of violence by Salvadoran gangs.
Months after the U.S. Supreme Court’s April order that the Trump administration “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return, he was brought back to the U.S. on June 6, only to face charges of human smuggling three years ago in Tennessee. The judge in that case eventually ordered Abrego Garcia released to home detention while his claim of vindictive prosecution in the Tennessee case proceeded.
He returned home to Maryland, but a check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he was detained on immigration charges and held ain a Pennsylvania jail.
Xinis, who became involved in the case when Abrego Garcia was first deported, ordered the Trump administration on Dec. 11 to release him from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania, where he had been held since September. She wrote in the order then that the Trump administration was “again without lawful authority” for holding Abrego Garica for deportation, without making an effort to remove him to a third country.
Costa Rica has agreed to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee, but Justice Department lawyers could not give Xinis a clear explanation of why the Trump administration would not send him there. Instead, the administration has proposed deporting Abrego Garcia to various countries in Africa.
When Abrego Garcia did a check-in at the ICE field office in Baltimore on Dec. 12, he was not detained but walked out about an hour later to leave and spend time with family in Prince George’s County.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Monday, Abrego Garica arrived at the courthouse in Greenbelt around 12:30 p.m. for a 1 p.m. hearing, his first court appearance before Xinis since the case began with his detention in March. Xinis began the hearing with a slight joke about the six lawyers representing Abrego Garcia at the hearing.
“Mr. Abrego Garcia, you almost have a baseball team representing you today,” Xinis said.
Abrego Garcia quietly sat the table during the slightly more than one-hour hearing and only said, “Good afternoon your honor, my name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia.”
In regards to her earlier order, Xinis on Monday asked Molina who signed a memorandum that her order was issued on “ex parte” basis, meaning one side was not heard or notified.
“I don’t know who the author of that would be because that would be incorrect,” Molina said.
“Wrong,” the judge interjected. “Everybody signed it, and it’s flat wrong. So who did that? There’s like four lawyers that signed this. I want to know who.”
Molina didn’t say who wrote the memorandum, but conceded it was wrong.
“So in the future, I’ll say it again, [be] really careful what you write and make sure it’s factually accurate,” Xinis said.

About 100 supporters rallied for Abrego Garcia outside the courthouse Monday, singing songs and coordinating various chants.
After the hearing, one of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, said his client was ready to go to Costa Rica today.
“It’s actually the federal government that’s keeping him here in the United States right now,” he said. “Again, they’re insisting on punishing him and using ICE detention … to keep him locked up. We’re not going to allow that. We’re going to keep fighting against it.”
But in the meantime, the judge ordered the government’s attorneys to respond by Friday on how they plan to handle Abrego Garcia’s immigration case. His attorneys have until Dec. 30 to file their response to the government.

(File photo by Josh Kurtz/Maryland Matters)For the second time in 2 1/2 years, a 13-member task force will meet to discuss the future of Baltimore’s water and sewer system — and the possibility of a new governance structure.
Baltimore City currently controls much of the system’s infrastructure, including its water and wastewater treatment plants, and Baltimore County relies on the system, and contributes a share of the costs to maintain it. A few other local jurisdictions use the system to smaller degrees.
A new structure could give the counties more say in how the system is managed.
“The future of Baltimore’s water system affects so much of the metropolitan area, it’s important that we employ a regional approach when tackling this issue,” said Baltimore Comptroller Bill Henry (D), the chair of the new task force. “Having chaired the previous regional water taskforce, I know how much progress has been made and I also know how much work still needs to be done.”




Water task force members:

Chair Bill Henry, comptroller, Baltimore City
Vice Chair Del. Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County)
Antoinette Ryan Johnson, president, City Union of Baltimore
Patrick Moran, president, AFSCME Council 3
Kishia L. Powell, general manager/CEO, Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) Water
Kelly Baxter, water/wastewater treatment practice leader, Mott MacDonald
Matthew Garbark, director, Baltimore City Department of Public Works
Matthew Carpenter, deputy director, Baltimore County Office of Budget & Finance
Michael Swygert, chief, Metropolitan District Financing and Petitions, Baltimore County Department of Public Works and Transportation
Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City)
Karen Henry, director, Anne Arundel County Department of Public Works
Adam Ortiz, deputy secretary, Maryland Department of the Environment
Karen Dettmer, director of water resources U.S., Ramboll





Recent events — including customer billing issues and severe breakdowns at the city’s sewage treatment facilities along the Patapsco and Back rivers — spurred a new round of conversations about a more regionalized water system. The existing cost-sharing structure dates back to 1972, when the city had close to 900,000 residents and the counties were considerably smaller. Now, the situation is reversed: The city had 585,708 residents in the 2020 Census, compared to the county’s 854,535.
“This work group gives us the chance to modernize a system that has served the region for decades, but no longer reflects the needs of our communities,” said Baltimore County Executive Kathy Klausmeier in a statement.
The first attempt at a task force, in September 2023, sputtered out after officials determined there were too many unanswered questions about the financial impacts of regionalizing the system, including on the city’s books. But that task force only had until January 2024 to issue a report. State lawmakers passed legislation that gives the new task force until June 30, 2027, to come up with recommendations for the system.
Many of the new task force members are returning players. Besides Henry returning as chair, Del. Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County) is returning, this time as vice chair. The group again includes union leaders, city and county officials. This time, the Maryland Department of the Environment will be represented by Deputy Secretary Adam Ortiz. A retired MDE secretary served on the previous task force.
Anne Arundel County will have a representative this time in Karen Henry, director of the county’s department of public works. Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City) is also a new addition. The private sector will also have a role, with two of the 13 members hailing from engineering firms Mott MacDonald and Ramboll.
“By working together across Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and the State, we can tackle the big challenges that affect the families who rely on safe, reliable water every day,” wrote MDE Secretary Serena McIlwain in a news release.
The task force will convene for the first time on Jan. 7 at 6 p.m. at Baltimore’s City Hall.
47 lawsuits for the 47th president
Maryland joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit Monday filed to block Trump administration attempts to defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, established 15 years ago to fight consumer fraud and discriminatory lending practices.
It is the 47th lawsuit against administration policies that Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown’s (D) office has either led or signed on to since President Donald Trump was inaugurated to a second term on Jan. 20.
“The Trump administration’s attempt to completely defund the CFPB is both illegal and dangerous for Maryland families,” Brown said in a statement Monday. “We’re suing to stop this unlawful defunding scheme that violates the separation of powers and will leave Marylanders more vulnerable to financial exploitation.”
According to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon, the states claim the administration’s push to not seek funding for CFPB “unlawfully” shuts down the agency that was approved by Congress in 2010 under former President Barack Obama (D).
Trump named Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought the acting director of CFPB on Feb. 7. The next day, according to the suit, Vought sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell requesting $0 to fund bureau operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Two days after that, Vought emailed bureau staff “to stand down from performing any work task.” Over the next several days, he moved to fire more than 1,400 employees. Without action, “it’s all but certain the CFPB will run out funding completely in January 2026,” the lawsuit says.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The suit says the bureau has returned more than $21 million that was taken improperly from more than 205 million Americans. It also said  the bureau’s 2024 consumer response annual report showed it received more than 3 million complaints totaling about $90 million in monetary relief. About 83,000 of those complaints came from Maryland with $1.7 million awarded to consumers, Brown said
Besides Maryland and the District, others signed on to the suit include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.
Like Brown, other Democratic attorneys general have joined dozens of lawsuits against the White House. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser told the Oregon Capital Chronicle, a Maryland Matters’ sister publication, that this lawsuit is his 48th.
“My standard hasn’t changed,” Weiser said. “The behavior of this administration has changed. They’re lawless again and again. They’re bullying. They’re reckless. They’re dangerous.”
Christmas came early…
That’s not only the most hackneyed lead on any holiday feature story, it’s also true for federal, and now, state workers.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced Monday that state government offices will be closed on Wednesday, Christmas Eve, in addition to the Christmas holiday, and that state workers will be able to take liberal leave on Friday, Dec. 26. Under the declaration, December 24 will be treated like any other state employee holiday.
“Declaring Christmas Eve as a State holiday is a small way to show our gratitude to Maryland’s dedicated public servants,” Moore said in a statement released by his office. “May all Marylanders across the state cherish meaningful holiday time with their friends, family, and loved ones.”
President Donald Trump last week announced that federal agencies would be closed on Wednesday and Friday both, with the usual exceptions for essential and emergency workers.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20220921_113435-1024x460.jpg,,,2025-12-22 22:11:40.931249

Lewis issued the following statement Monday regarding his arrest:   
“This weekend, I was stopped by law enforcement for a headlight related issue. I cooperated fully and the situation was resolved promptly. While I was ultimately issued a DWI summons, I will be working with lawyers to contest the charge.

The bird has been eligible for some Endangered Species Acts protections since the early 2010s, establishing limits on mining oil, gas, transmission lines and other heavy industry operations, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. The federal agency says the plan addresses threats to the birds’ habitat while balancing the government’s ability to manage public lands for other uses with states’ input.
“We are strengthening American energy security while ensuring the sage-grouse continues to thrive,” acting Bureau of Land Management director Bill Groffy said in a news release. “Healthy sagebrush country powers our communities, sustains wildlife and supports the economies that make the West strong.” 
The greater sage-grouse have been iconic in the Intermountain West, their only habitat, and are recognizable for their chunky bodies and their mating dance. They have been in sharp decline with populations reduced from millions to now fewer than 800,000, according to the BLM. That’s largely because of “habitat loss exacerbated by drought, increasing wildfires and the spread of invasive species.”
In the newly approved Utah plan, areas in the state with the highest conservation standards for greater sage-grouse account for 5.4 million acres and would exclude solar and wind resources, but allow fluid mineral leasing, including geothermal, with “major stipulations.” In those areas, the BLM also increased requirements for permits.



Let us know what you think...


 


Other areas where greater sage-grouse can live seasonally or year-round, but in smaller numbers and with less quality of life, include 1.6 million acres.
The Center for Biological Diversity said in a release the plan strips protections for the bird, including removing “protections from 4.3 million acres of prime sage-grouse habitat” and reducing the amount of protected habitat in Utah.
Other changes include looser habitat protections in Nevada to allow the construction of the Greenlink North transmission line, which, according to the environmentalists, “would destroy nesting and mating grounds.”
The new plan also removes grass-height standards for nesting habitat, “a shift driven by livestock-industry pressure in Nevada, California and Idaho that further threatens the birds’ existence,” the group said in the release.
The Center for Biological Diversity is planning to sue the administration over the amendment.
“Trump’s reckless actions will speed the extinction of greater sage grouse by allowing unfettered fossil fuel extraction and other destructive development across tens of millions of acres of public lands,” Randi Spivak, public lands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity said in the release. “Every president starting with Obama has screwed over these iconic Western birds and the hundreds of other wildlife species that depend on the beautiful sagebrush sea.”

An arctic wind cut across Prudhoe Bay, sending spindrifts swirling as Energy Secretary Chris Wright stepped onto a podium hastily erected among oil wells and pump stations. The gray summer sunlight scattered over ice-rimmed ponds, shadows gathering in the hollows of low heaves and stretching over the tundra. But the visitors gathered around him were less interested in the scenery than what lay beneath it.
Wearing a hard hat perched above a pair of safety glasses, Wright gripped a lectern with red-knuckled hands chilled by the cold air. “I want to say to all of you standing here today,” he told a gaggle of oil workers, “you are the greatest liberators in human history.”

Hovering nearby were Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Lee Zeldin, head of the Environmental Protection Agency. It was the kind of Cabinet-level entourage that made the remote industrial site feel like a campaign stop. They were on a multiday tour of northern Alaska, hyping plans for a pipeline that would carry natural gas roughly 800 miles south to an export terminal on Cook Inlet. If built, it would be one of the largest infrastructure projects in U.S. history.
Since his first day in office, President Donald Trump has focused on “unleashing Alaska’s extraordinary resource potential.” He has hailed the liquefied natural gas project — an idea that has been kicking around since the 1960s — as “truly spectacular.” It has become a centerpiece of his energy agenda, even as scientists warn that emissions must fall to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
Proponents like Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy extoll the economic benefits the pipeline will bring to Alaska and the energy security it will provide to allies. But the cost is staggering: Official estimates put it at $44 billion, though independent analysts suggest it could top $70 billion. Experts say it has required substantial government support to develop and will require “a mix of public and private capital to move forward.”

The North Slope of Alaska holds about 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, making it one of the largest known sources in the United States. But with the project’s steep price tag and no firm commitments from buyers, oil majors like ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil have backed away over the last decade. Glenfarne Group, a privately held energy firm that has never operated a liquefied natural gas export terminal, stepped in last year. Shortly after Trump was elected, state officials handed the company a 75 percent stake in the project in a no-bid deal, the details of which have been kept even from the legislature. Glenfarne will lead the project’s development and financing efforts and, if the company decides to move forward, oversee construction and operation of the pipeline, gas treatment plant, and export terminal. Though the state has not paid Glenfarne directly, it has poured at least $600 million into planning, design, and permitting — and initially floated paying Glenfarne an additional $50 million for its costs, even if the company decided to walk away.
Despite repeatedly tapping state coffers to keep the project going, Brad Chastain, the project manager for the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., the publicly funded entity created to advance the pipeline, told Grist at a recent public meeting, “There are no subsidies.” The corporation denied Grist’s public records request for the state’s contract with Glenfarne, citing trade secrets. It also claimed the publication had no right to appeal its rejection.
The pipeline’s backers are already eyeing additional federal support, including $30 billion in loan guarantees. That backstop would leave the public on the hook if the endeavor falters, an outcome that has plagued previous state megaprojects. “Every taxpayer should be furious that the federal government is chasing this project,” said Cooper Freeman, the state director for The Center for Biological Diversity, which is suing the federal government over the proposed pipeline’s threat to endangered species.
Beyond the financial risks lie grave climate impacts. According to the Department of Energy, the pipeline, export terminal, and related infrastructure could add at least 1.5 gigatons of emissions over its 30-year lifespan. “It’s public funds flowing to support these private companies, while worsening the climate crisis at a critical window,” said Phil Wight, an environmental historian at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

Alaskan oil and gas have always flowed through the shadow of global politics. Where the gravel shores of this continent meet the ice-flocked waters of the Arctic Ocean, the Iñupiat long ago noticed dark stains on the rocks and rainbow sheens in the muskeg. Millennia of tectonic forces had transformed plankton and silt into oil, soaking tundra that Alaska Native people would cut into blocks and burn during long, dark winters.

“These projects, they never die, they just don’t happen,” said Larry Persily, who spent five years as the federal coordinator for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, an agency Congress established in 2004 to advance a pipeline for North American markets. That office disbanded in 2015 due to a lack of funding, as the state turned its attention from developing a domestic market to exporting liquefied natural gas. After it created the Alaska Gasline Development Corp. in 2010 to lead that effort, the corporation spent about half a billion dollars. It has yet to reach the construction phase.
Nevertheless, President Trump’s quest for energy dominance has revitalized the idea, leading to Wright and the Cabinet’s northern roadshow in June. The tour’s next stop was 600 miles south in Anchorage, where Governor Dunleavy hosted the Cabinet members at a sustainable energy conference, whose sponsors included Glenfarne and oil giants like Repsol. (The governor declined interview requests.) Outside the Dena’ina Civic and Convention Center, protesters held hand-painted signs declaring, “Alaska Is Not For Sale.” Rochelle Adams, director of Yukon River Protectors, and other Alaska Native advocates urged potential investors to stay away. “My whole entire life, the Gwich’in people have stood to protect these lands,” she said. “Alaska is not for profit. Alaska is our homeland.”
Inside, where their voices could not be heard, Dunleavy — who has close ties to the fossil fuel industry and has called natural gas a clean and renewable fuel — praised the project over a catered salmon lunch. Secretary Wright interjected. “The president loves energy. He gushes it. His personality is energetic, but he loves the industry and the role energy plays in the world.” Wright later told Grist that federal loan guarantees for the gas line were “quite likely,” and he hoped to quadruple Alaska’s energy production in the next decade. “It’s about people and math,” he said. Attendees were given pins proclaiming, “I  Fossil Fuels.”
Glenfarne declined interview requests but claimed in an emailed statement and public meetings that the pipeline will ease Alaskans’ energy bills — a point disputed by local utilities. They plan for the project to unfold in stages, beginning with 765 miles of pipeline from the North Slope to Cook Inlet, to serve the state’s domestic needs. This delays the expense of an export terminal and a large gas treatment plant on the North Slope. “It can be independently financially successful,” Adam Prestidge, president of Glenfarne Alaska, said at a recent event. Though the company has declined to provide any details, the Alaska Gasline Development Corp. previously projected this first phase would cost at least $11 billion.
Critics say without exports, the gas line would effectively run 90 percent empty, losing its economies of scale. “Pipelines never just go from A to B,” Wight explained. “They are the linchpin in a vertically integrated value chain. You can’t just break it off into little pieces and pretend that they’re not connected.”
For all the recent talk of energy security and eager buyers, even Trump’s support cannot change the economics that have long conspired against the pipeline, Persily said. “I used to get a lot of calls from reporters” asking about such plans, he said, but they eventually got tired of hearing him say the idea was “still bullshit.”

North of the Arctic Circle, Sarah Furman bounced along the muddy ruts of the Dalton Highway in a friend’s battered pickup, swerving through cranberry and willow blazing gold in the day’s last light. The Koyukuk River churned nearby, swollen from floods that had swallowed stretches of the road, which was built to reach North Slope oil fields. Parking under the rusty supports of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, Furman explained that rising waters and restless ground threaten the state’s existing energy infrastructure and put new construction at risk.

Average annual temperatures in northern Alaska have already climbed more than 6 degrees Fahrenheit and could rise at least 8 more by the end of the century. Thawing permafrost is  damaging the oil pipeline by destabilizing its supports. (Similar instability contributed to the collapse of an oil tank in Siberia in 2020, creating a catastrophic spill.) Scientists and state officials have identified dozens of landslides creeping toward the pipeline with no proven way to stop them, and the state has already had to reroute the Dalton Highway. In places like the snow-dusted Atigun Pass, a narrow cleft through the Brooks Range, steep terrain and shifting ground leave engineers with few options for shoring up a system that still carries nearly half a million barrels of crude oil each day.
The Alaska Gasline Development Corp.’s proposed route roughly parallels the Trans-Alaska Pipeline across the northern portion of the state, though scientists warn the ground beneath it could reach “a highly unstable state” as temperatures continue to rise. “The permafrost is thawing so rapidly that there’s no way they’re not going to face challenges in construction,” said Furman, who tracks the impacts of climate change on interior Alaska as co-executive director of Fairbanks Climate Action Coalition.
The project’s environmental review noted the risk of thawing, Furman said, but didn’t adequately consider other long-term climate hazards, like flooding or landslides. Nor did it account for what exporting natural gas would do to global greenhouse emissions, an oversight that led environmental groups to sue the Department of Energy in 2020. The Biden administration agreed the assessment was insufficient but reaffirmed its approval in 2023.
For many Alaskans, that felt like a betrayal — proof that even as the ground beneath them literally shifts, those in power refuse to acknowledge the risks. Among them is Linnea Lentfer, one of eight youth suing the state to stop the project. Alaska’s constitution requires that natural resources be sustainably managed for the benefit of all; the plaintiffs argue that exporting natural gas violates that duty and “would substantially increase climate pollution and devastating impacts of climate change.”
For Lentfer, who was raised on food her family caught or harvested, the lawsuit is about protecting a vanishing way of life. Her childhood was spent hunting on skis and fishing in rivers alive with coho, the demands of each circling season grounding her in “part of something so much bigger.” Now the salmon don’t always return, and the hills around her home in Gustavus often remain snow-free. “To see those things change in my lifetime — I’m 21 — is incredibly scary,” Lentfer said. “It knocks you down to wonder what it means to live a life here, because I can’t imagine anything else.”

Ironically, Glenfarne could receive up to $7 billion in federal carbon sequestration credits through the project. Prudhoe Bay gas contains carbon dioxide, which must be removed before it can flow through the pipeline. This requires an expensive carbon removal and sequestration facility — something the Alaska Gasline Development Corp. promises will be “the largest carbon capture plant in the world.” The project’s environmental review noted Glenfarne could also get paid for the captured carbon, which oil companies could use to expand production in the Kuparuk River Field by injecting it to extract more oil. This would compound the project’s adverse climate impacts.
Natural gas also contains methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide. It has a habit of escaping the infrastructure it passes through, through both intentional venting and leaks across the supply chain. Those emissions, researchers say, far exceed what the government officially counts. Still, in March, Trump overturned a Biden-era fee that would have made oil and gas producers pay for excess methane emissions.
The sheer scale of Alaska’s gas line sharpens those concerns: Once completed, the system could carry 3.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day. The export terminal alone will annually produce four times more emissions than every car currently in the state, a point former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member Richard Glick made in his dissent when that agency approved the project in 2020. “Rather than wrestling with the Alaska LNG project’s significant adverse impacts,” he wrote, “today’s order continues to make clear that the commission will not allow anything to get in the way of its rushed approval.”

Daniel Skarzynski splashed through puddles as he checked on his dog team, the animals circling and restless in the damp. A rumble of diesel engines carried over from Coldfoot Camp, a way station on the Dalton Highway halfway between Prudhoe Bay and Fairbanks, where truckers fuel up as they haul supplies to the oil field.
Skarzynski, a trapper and musher, often spends weeks in the wilderness. When he’s back in Coldfoot in the sturdy canvas tent he lives in, he follows the pipeline talks from afar. He often joins the online public meetings, and watches as officials usually go into an executive session to make  decisions that could remake the North Slope behind closed doors. The way Skarzynski sees it, “A lot of companies just treat the Alaskan government as kind of suckers.” For years, he noted, the president of the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., Frank Richards, has been the state’s highest-paid employee. He earned $488,000 last year — almost three times what Governor Dunleavy made. “To be fair,” said energy policy analyst Ben Botteger, “he gives excellent Powerpoint presentations.”

Richards declined to be interviewed and denied a public records request for communications around the project’s timelines or costs, citing his authority to create confidentiality agreements.
Last year, the state legislature appeared to tire of pouring money into the gas line and cut the state corporation’s budget. It also ordered an independent review to determine whether the pipeline would have “a positive economic benefit.” Though the Development Corp. is a public entity spending state money, a 2018 audit by the legislature found “no evidence” the board approved or even knew about its biggest contracts. Another analysis found that if Alaska had invested the money it gave the agency, every resident could have received $1,800. In the spring of 2024, as some of the project’s permits neared expiration, the corporation’s board conceded that, barring an infusion of private funding, “we have instructed AGDC staff to initiate the work required to shut down and either sell Alaska LNG project assets or put them in storage.”
Then came the deal with Glenfarne. Many Alaskans believe a pipeline will usher in another boom. Others aren’t so sure. “They tout it as job creation, but it’s all outside guys,” Skarzynski said, using Alaskan slang for anyone from beyond the state.
Inside Coldfoot Camp, some of the truckers gravitating toward the wafting smell of diner coffee were more concerned with safety. Some worry that the added traffic will make the Dalton Highway — a remote, minimally maintained two-lane road — even more treacherous. It has already grown more dangerous as inexperienced drivers flock to the Willow project, an oil lease the Biden administration approved. Additional transit will increase wear and tear on a highway the state already struggles to maintain, an expense lawmakers have said the budget can’t absorb.
Out on the highway, a wolf slipped between a lull in traffic, its motion fluid as it ghosted through the brush. Up the road in Wiseman, year-round residents Sean and Mollie Busby worry about the safety impacts of the additional traffic and what that will mean for their business, where guests from around the world come to their hand-built cabins beneath the northern lights. A gas compression station is slated to be built nearby, its round-the-clock glare threatening to illuminate the nighttime sky.
What draws some visitors here is nostalgia for one of Alaska’s most valuable resources: the enduring myth of boundless opportunity. For over a century, it’s fueled the rush for gold and then for oil. “Everybody talks about how things used to be up here,” Skarzynski said, recalling stories about miners traveling on the frozen Koyukuk River as early as September. Today, there are spots where it doesn’t always freeze; every year, Alaskans die falling through what used to be dependable ice roads. “I wouldn’t travel along parts of the Koyukuk any time now, you know?”  he said. The lure of a simpler, untamed world has left the land haunted by its own legend. The ground is thawing. The oil checks are smaller. Even the last frontier has its limits.

Thirty years ago, bumper stickers started appearing on pickups in Fairbanks and beyond as oil prices tanked. Jobs had vanished, foreclosures had spiked, and almost half of the state’s banks had failed. At the time, taxes on oil production provided 90 percent of the state’s general fund. Those stickers appeared on tailgate after tailgate, offering a simple plea: “God, please give us another boom. We promise not to piss this one away.”
Those weathered stickers still appear from time to time, providing a cautionary tale. The cost of building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline ballooned tenfold to $8 billion in part because there were no incentives to control costs. Companies were allowed to deduct their construction expenses, passing them on to the state and refiners transporting oil through the system. By failing to regulate these shipping fees, Alaska forfeited about $80 billion — to say nothing of what’s been lost to rock-bottom oil production taxes. “What those oil companies did with shipping tariffs was the greatest heist in Alaska’s history,” said Wight, the environmental historian.

At the time, the state had few sources of income and was facing bankruptcy if the oil pipeline didn’t move forward. Legislators tried to exert more control over the project and secure an ownership stake in it, but relented when oil companies threatened to walk away. Producers promised jobs for Alaska Natives to drum up support, but the targets weren’t met for decades.
The parallels to what’s happening today are clear. Utilities in south-central Alaska face dwindling natural gas supplies from Cook Inlet, which has historically provided most of the state’s supply. The inlet still holds extensive gas reserves, but they are unprofitable to extract. As a result, utilities are warning the region could face rolling blackouts by 2027, a supply crunch that Glenfarne CEO Brendan Duval said “can only be solved, in the long term, [by] the pipeline.”  The current scramble for energy echoes the leverage companies held over the state during its original oil boom 50 years ago.
Local utilities say the gas line won’t solve the affordability crisis. Without foreign buyers — who so far have not signed binding purchase contracts — the pipeline will be overbuilt and the costs paid by state ratepayers. Even the Alaska Gasline Development Corp. concedes that “Alaskans only require a small portion” of the system, which calls for an oversized, and uncommon, 42-inch pipe. “A more economical solution,” the Alaska Utilities Working Group wrote, “would be a smaller diameter pipeline” — though even that would likely be more expensive than importing natural gas. Richards told state officials last fall that the pipeline is “significantly overbuilt for Alaska’s needs,” but a redesign would require another round of environmental review and permitting. “Current natural gas demand in Alaska simply does not support a pipeline project,” the working group cautioned.
What’s more, the proposal does not include the cost of a 30-mile spur that would bring natural gas from the pipeline to Fairbanks, Alaska’s second largest city. The cost of the additional infrastructure is not included in the Alaska Gasline Development Corp. estimates of future energy prices. If the spur were built, residents would still have to pay home connection fees and replace home furnaces, for which Wight said his family was quoted $40,000.
Even the region’s gas utility seems skeptical. Elena Sudduth, general manager of Interior Gas Utility, said most of Fairbanks’ gas came from Cook Inlet, carried by pipeline to a liquefaction plant near Anchorage, then trucked north. In 2025, the utility switched to trucking North Slope gas to Fairbanks. A spur line could eventually replace that operation, but “it hasn’t started, and we needed a plan,” she said, adding she’d be shocked if gas flowed, as the governor promised, by 2028.
She also said an independent economic analysis funded by the Development Corp. assumes a rapid shift of 90 percent of the greater Fairbanks area’s energy demand to gas — including power generation — even though most of its power plants run on other fuels. “These are existing assets,” Sudduth said. “Gas would have to be cheap enough to justify new capital investment.” If the report’s assumed energy prices did prove accurate, she says it would be “transformative for the economy, and for Fairbanks, and we are all for it.”
In the meantime, as the state teeters on an energy crisis, state Senator Bill Wielechowski noted that Trump has cut more than $1 billion for Alaskan renewable projects, including wind and solar projects near Fairbanks and Anchorage. Wielechowski said this leaves Alaskans vulnerable to volatile energy price hikes, in what he called a “hostage situation.”
“You’re basically holding a gun to your own head, saying you’re going to be forced now to develop fossil fuels at whatever price companies want to charge you,” Wielechowski said. “It’s time for Alaska to stop giving our resources away.”

At the mouth of the Kenai River on a dim fall day, Cook Inlet takes on the color of raw steel. Pale backs suddenly arc across the surface as two belugas surface, their plosive exhales punctuating the drum of rain. Only around 300 of these genetically distinct whales remain, making them one of the world’s most endangered marine mammals.
The gas line, which would cross under Cook Inlet, would pose new risks to both the belugas and the waters they depend on. Even noise from preliminary surveys — not to mention construction, dredging, and ship traffic — would impair their ability to hunt and communicate.
Ecological impacts would unfold all along the project’s route, from the North Slope, where the infrastructure could impede caribou migration and potentially hasten population declines, to the Gulf of Alaska, where tankers will harry the critically endangered North Pacific right whale. A final environmental impact statement warns that the pipeline’s construction and operation would cause “adverse effects on federally designated critical habitat and a number of federally listed threatened and endangered species.” Regardless, the project received the last federal permits it needed in early December. The National Marine Fisheries Service will allow the project to kill or injure 10 percent of Cook Inlet belugas — which the coalition says is a population-level threat. In comments to the agency, Chief Gary Harrison of the Chickaloon Village Traditional Council wrote that for the whales’ survival, “the margin for error is effectively zero.”
Cook Inlet itself adds to the risk. The waterway surges and sinks with tremendous force, creating some of the largest tidal ranges in the world — leading to a history of industrial accidents. In 2017, one of its natural gas pipelines shifted, striking an unseen boulder that eventually created a hole. Methane poured into the water for more than four months. Federal and state agencies argued over who had the jurisdiction to treat the gas as a hazardous material, and whether the owner could be compelled to shut off its pipeline. Ben Botteger, who covered the debacle for the local newspaper, said the incident “opened up a bunch of questions we’ve pretty much subsequently ignored.”
Among them is who will pay for the cleanup and removal of the gas line and its infrastructure once it reaches the end of production, which Alaska law requires. When the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was built, companies were required to set money aside to eventually decommission it. So far, there haven’t been any public estimates of what remediation of the gas line will cost, a bill that will likely add up to billions of dollars. Senator Wielechowski has pressed the company for answers, warning that without firm commitments, taxpayers could be left paying to clean up accidents or abandoned infrastructure.
It’s a familiar worry in Alaska, where the fossil fuel industry’s influence has so often eclipsed the oversight meant to prevent collateral damage. As Vic Fischer, one of the men who drafted the state’s constitution, once explained, oil men used “economic power to buy the allegiance of elites and many ordinary citizens, until it displaced democracy with its own corporate form of government.”
This kind of influence could now put the state’s finances at risk. Alaska holds a 25 percent stake in the joint venture overseeing the project, and state Senator Jesse Kiehl says it’s unclear whether that could obligate the state to cover cost overruns or unexpected liabilities. The gas line’s $44 billion price tag is more than a decade old; since then, steel costs have increased 66 percent while labor is up 46 percent. Glenfarne hired a consultant to update cost projections in May ahead of its final investment decision, but has no plans to disclose those figures.
In mid-December, Governor Dunleavy announced a bill to slash property taxes on the project by 90 percent, meaning state and local governments would lose hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue. Mayors of boroughs who would be impacted told the Anchorage Daily News the governor did not consult them, and they raised concerns about breaking even with the project’s costs to road maintenance and other municipal services. An independent consultancy recently told the legislature property tax changes were needed to make the project viable. It is owned by a company that intends to invest in the gas line. Even prior to this proposal, lawmakers warned the state’s generous construction tax write-offs for participating companies will strain its already fragile finances.
Whether Alaska’s gas will attract buyers remains an open question. “We’ve already committed over half of the LNG volume from this project to buyers in Japan, in Korea and Thailand, and Taiwan, because they recognize that this is a fantastic project,” said Adam Prestidge, president of Glenfarne Alaska, at a recent public meeting. He said President Trump is “making sure other countries are committing to buy LNG.”
But there are no public and binding purchase agreements. Unlike oil, liquefied natural gas requires long-term commitments. Investors typically take an equity position and agree to a lengthy “take-or-pay” arrangement, meaning they commit to buying or paying for a set amount of gas regardless of market prices. In July, Trump announced that Japan was joining the project; Japanese officials later denied this. Glenfarne cites $115 billion in “interested parties” as buyers, yet neither Japan nor South Korea have signed binding agreements to buy gas — and Seoul has said a $100 billion pledge it made this summer for American gas is not specific to Alaska. A South Korean official told the Financial Times that the U.S. hadn’t provided any information on pricing and said the country wouldn’t have considered the project absent federal pressure. In December, Glenfarne lauded a deal with South Korean steel manufacturer Posco to purchase a million tons of gas annually, though industry trade publications describe the agreement as “tentative.”
Meanwhile, a wave of liquefied natural gas development is expected to flood global supply by 2030, including from export projects in British Columbia that are closer to completion and share Alaska’s proximity to Asian markets. In a blunt assessment, independent energy market firm Rapidan Energy Group warned that investors “could incur substantial financial losses” and said the Alaska project is what happens when “politics overrides commercial logic.”
In the absence of committed buyers, the federal government has stepped in. The official export credit agency of the United States federal government has said it will provide financing through its “Make More in America Initiative,” and the Trump administration has floated the idea of the Pentagon buying gas for Alaska’s bases — though that alone would account for a fraction of the project’s capacity.
At the pipeline’s source, Pantheon Resources — the small U.K. firm expected to provide the domestic gas — has not finalized a sales agreement, leaving the project without a guaranteed supplier. Early exploration results have proven disappointing, and Persily argues its existing fields probably cannot meet long-term pipeline needs. Kiehl noted that while plenty of gas reserves exist on the North Slope, major operators don’t appear to be investing any significant resources toward producing for the gas line. “If an oil and gas company sees an opportunity to make a profit, they will pursue it,” he said.
The economic questions could shake markets far beyond the state’s borders. The U.S. is now the world’s largest LNG exporter, largely financed through heavy borrowing. Some experts are starting to ask whether the sector is a bubble, leaving the investors funding them in serious trouble. According to one recent report, if the gas industry’s credit quality declines due to physical climate risks and faltering demand, “we might see more securitized debt packaging similar to the 2008 mortgage crisis.”
Even if the Alaska project never materializes, however, Glenfarne stands to benefit handsomely. By acquiring its intellectual property, permits, and engineering work, the company now has leverage in future partnerships, negotiations, or access to federal support. The company is now working with the private gas utility Enstar, for example, to develop plans to import liquefied natural gas to Alaska in a project that duplicates alternative utility plans, driving up costs for ratepayers, while laying the groundwork for their export facility. As the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote in a public comment about LNG export terminals, “Insiders can skim off just a percent or two in fees and bonuses and walk away rich … even if their project isn’t successful.” Glenfarne can profit from this deal without ever laying a mile of pipe.

On a blustery October night in Nikiski, a small town on the Kenai peninsula, the power was out but the sales pitch carried on. Inside a packed community center, lights powered by generators illuminated glossy renderings of the export terminal proposed for the outskirts of town — flawless, gleaming, and a long way from real.
More than 100 residents came to hear from Glenfarne’s team, which hadn’t initially planned to take questions. The crowd, however, had many. Would the rerouted highway cut across their property? Would their wells stay safe? How many locals would get work? Prestidge said the company recently convened 200 contractors in Anchorage — three hours and a world away.
Many in the room had proudly built careers in the inlet’s oil and gas industry, like Robin Bogard, who worked for 16 years at the Agrium production facility, which converted natural gas to nitrogen fertilizers. For decades, Nikiski faithfully sent liquefied natural gas from Cook Inlet to Japan, never missing a shipment. Bogard had been enthusiastic about a gas line since the 1970s. But Glenfarne’s pitch — and a look at its numbers — left him unconvinced. Lowering energy bills sounds nice, he said, “but hope is not a business plan.”
The pipeline has become a mirror, reflecting an enduring faith in a future powered by fossil fuels. It hearkens back to a time when deals were struck behind closed doors and entire economies bent to the will of a few. “It creates this paradox: what we want life to be and where life is headed,” said Lentfer. She knows the challenges that come with filing a climate lawsuit but still imagines raising children as she was — rooted in the land, even if that home is inexorably changing.
As the meeting wound down, wind whipped off the inlet, rattling the dark windows of a town that has been waiting half a century for the next boom to arrive. It bore surf against rusting platforms and whistled past dormant pump houses. The gas line that could transform these quiet cliffs into a bustling terminal, Wight said, “is the longest running Alaskan dream outside of immortality.” Who will be left to pay for the dream when it finally comes due?

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-23 00:10:18+00:00,Mississippi Today,Incomplete audits make dozens of Mississippi school districts’ finances a mystery,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/22/school-districts-missing-audits/,A third of Mississippi school districts are behind on submitting completed annual financial audits to the state Department of Education.,"A third of Mississippi school districts are behind on submitting completed annual financial audits to the state Department of Education.
Without that information, state education officials are in the dark about current finances at 47 of Mississippi’s 138 public school districts, including any pending financial emergencies.
State Education Department leaders hope to crack down on schools with late audits in the near future, agency officials said Thursday during a state Board of Education meeting. They introduced a plan that would impose stricter sanctions on delinquent districts, including withholding funds as punishment. 
Audits are how the state Education Department monitors its schools’ finances. Districts are required to hire accounting firms approved by the state auditor’s office to perform these annual audits, which it approves.

But in 2011, the state auditor’s office lost a significant number of its staff, education officials said. While the auditor’s office caught up on audit reviews, schools had up to four years to submit late audits without being docked on their state accountability scores, two more years than before. 
Districts also received extensions to complete their audits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The deadline reverted back to March during the 2022-23 school year, and many districts missed it because of the earlier due date and staff shortages at accounting firms.
The state Board of Education held districts harmless for violations that school year, but previous violations still applied and accumulated toward the districts’ records. 
So the audits have snowballed. 
“It’s just a bad situation,” State Superintendent Lance Evans told Mississippi Today this week. “We have fewer auditing firms than we had, and districts have to have the same audits done every year, and it’s just …  it’s turned into an issue. Something’s gotta be addressed.”
The pile-up can mask emergencies, such as the financial situation in Okolona that led to a state takeover last month.
In late October, Okolona Municipal Separate School District officials contacted the state Department of Education because the district did not have enough money to meet the November payroll. Education Department officials discovered that the district hadn’t had a financial audit since 2021 and had been outspending since fiscal year 2023-24. 
At an emergency meeting in November, the state Board of Education voted to take over the district, dissolve its school board and replace its superintendent. So far, the agency has loaned $1.5 million of its school district emergency fund to Okolona and dismissed 19 staff members, including teachers. The high school has absorbed the middle school. 
At the Thursday meeting, Board of Education president Matt Miller called it an “atrocious situation.”
“The adults in the room did not act like adults,” he said. “We need to make sure you’re getting your audits done. School districts cannot function without the financial piece.”

Education officials proposed a tiered process to address the situation. After the agency identifies a missing audit, the district has time to explain why it hasn’t submitted the complete information. From that point, if the district doesn’t have a sufficient response or remains noncompliant, the state Education Department would escalate sanctions. As a last resort, department officials would suspend funding to the district. 
The Commission on School Accreditation must sign off on the proposed policy changes before the state board can approve them.
Miller emphasized that the proposed policy change is a board directive, and the state Department of Education is not an “enemy” of school districts. Instead, he said, the proposed policy is an effort to avoid future takeovers because the state’s funds are limited — the school emergency relief fund is a few million dollars. 
“The department is very in tune with the fact that it’s not like districts are walking around not wanting to have their audits done,” Evans said. “We are very sensitive to the fact that it’s a shared problem … and we’re trying to help them work through it.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-23 00:08:39+00:00,CT Mirror,Waterbury nonprofit used LIHEAP funds to pay its expenses,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/22/waterbury-nonprofit-used-liheap-funds-to-pay-its-expenses/,CT officials moved to take control of New Opportunities Inc. after it bounced a $1.5M check and acknowledged using federal energy assistance to cover its costs.,"Connecticut officials moved Monday to take control of New Opportunities Inc., a Waterbury nonprofit that administers tens of millions of dollars in government grants, after it bounced a $1.56 million check and acknowledged impermissibly using federal energy assistance funds to cover its operational expenses.
With an average annual budget of $41 million in recent years, New Opportunities is a venerable organization formed in the earliest days of Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty. It administers food, housing, early childhood education and energy assistance programs, with nearly half its budget going to help the poor heat their homes.
On Monday, the commissioner of social services suspended the nonprofit as a vendor administering LIHEAP, the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, in Waterbury, Meriden and Torrington. At the same time, the Office of Policy and Management demanded the group accept a state-appointed overseer to indefinitely handle all other financial transactions.
Other “immediate corrective actions” demanded in the letter from OPM Secretary Joshua Wojcik included a new comprehensive audit and the removal of any executive  the state or the group’s board of directors “identifies as having failed to ensure that State or Federal funding was used for their intended purposes.”
Under its LIHEAP contract, New Opportunities vetted applicants for heating, acting as a middleman between the Department of Social Services and heating fuel sources, such as Yankee Gas, the Eversource subsidiary that provides natural gas in the Waterbury area. The nonprofit is supposed to pay Eversource within three business days of DSS paying New Opportunities.
In late November, Eversource notified DSS of non-payment by the nonprofit. 
What happened next is laid out in the letter sent Monday by Andrea Barton Reeves, the commissioner of social services, to William Rybczyk, the president and CEO of New Opportunities Inc., which is referenced in the letters as NOI.
“When DSS inquired about the status of these funds, you provided documentation demonstrating that NOI failed to maintain sufficient funds to cover three checks issued by NOI to support CEAP services totaling over $2.8 million,” Barton Reeves wrote. “While two checks were ultimately reissued to cover approximately $1.257 million of the balance, Eversource informed DSS on December 19th that a reissued check in the amount of $1,569,620.00, would not be honored as the underlying account continued to lack sufficient funds.”
CEAP refers to the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program, the DSS program that oversees federal funding that comes to the state via LIHEAP. 
The commissioner noted in the letter that Rybczyk had acknowledged the previous day that “LIHEAP funds had been inappropriately utilized to support other NOI operational costs.” At a minimum, that is a violation of the state contract and federal funding rules.
DSS has taken over LIHEAP in the Waterbury region. Other programs that are run by NOI employees, including an early childhood education program, will continue — with greater state oversight.
Neither Rybczyk nor his board chair, Melissa Green, responded to requests for comment. Green was the recipient of the OPM secretary’s letter.
Stephanie E. Cummings, a lawyer representing the non-profit, said in an email, “NOI has bee proactive in its communications with the departments of the State of Connecticut and is committed to collaboratively addressing any funding concerns the State may have.”
An audit completed Sept. 29 by Whittlesey, the organization’s outside auditor, found that New Opportunities had ended the 2023 tax year on Oct. 31, 2024 with a deficit of $1.6 million. Barton Reeves said NOI forwarded the audit in November to DSS, which shared it with OPM.
It attributed “an operating deficit and a deficiency in net assets as a result of the startup and expansion efforts of Connecticut Food 4 Thought, LLC, and has stated that substantial doubt exists about the Organization’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
Connecticut Food 4 Thought is a hydroponic food producer. The audit also noted the organization believed it was making progress with its finances.
James Gatling, the long-time leader of New Opportunities, retired as the CEO at the end of Masrch 2021 at age 73. Public records indicate he still is on the payroll, paid $100,000 annually in deferred compensation. As of October 2024, he was owed $509,058.
His successor, Rybczyk, is paid $267,048 annually, according to the group’s publicly available tax return.
Wojcik said the next step for the state is to meet with the board chair, identify a plan to “hopefully get them on an appropriate financial path that the state has has confidence in. That’s the goal, and we are looking to have that discussion as quickly as possible, if not this afternoon, then tomorrow.”
In its most recently available tax return, New Opportunities reported spending about $19 million annually on energy assistance, including $17.38 million to help pay the heating bills of 48,121 people. Other areas of spending included: community services, $5.6 million; housing, $4.6 million; early childhood education, $4.2 million; and Connecticut Food 4 Thought, $2 million.
“The mission of New Opportunities,” the group says on its web site, “is to improve the quality of life for economically disadvantaged individuals by providing the necessary resources to increase their standard of living, foster self-improvement, and maximize self-empowerment.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Waterbury-street-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 19:58:32.954969

By then, he’d done time in South Dakota’s state prisons, where inmates used electrical outlets to light up and smoke bits of paper soaked with synthetic drugs commonly known as “K2” or “spice.”
Things were different at the federal prison in Kansas.
The cells didn’t have outlets, Cooper said. The best way to spark a fire for a drug fix was to pull batteries from electronics, like alarm clocks or radios, and reverse engineer heat by connecting the batteries’ positive and negative ends with wire, aluminum foil or a gum wrapper.


South Dakota’s prison overdose problem
This story is part of a series examining a spate of prison overdose deaths in South Dakota, including the causes and potential solutions.
Read the series >


To quash drug use, Cooper told South Dakota Searchlight, federal prison officials brought in solar-powered alarm clocks and crank-powered radios.
“None of that works,” Cooper said. “You’re talking about the most innovative people in the world. All you did when you gave these guys crank radios in the federal prison system was give them a rechargeable lighter.”
The anecdote highlights an intractable challenge of prison management: Any security measure meant to tamp down drug use must contend with a highly motivated group of inmates, many of whom arrive in prison as addicts, whose desire to get high or make money selling drugs is durable enough to hold up under the weight of institutional pressure. 
In interviews with South Dakota Searchlight, a former prison warden, a former corrections secretary and a county sheriff who oversees a jail all agreed that policing narcotics inside their institutions is a challenge that never ends.
South Dakota’s had a particularly challenging year. The state has logged eight suspected or confirmed overdose deaths in 2025 inside its state prisons, a figure that leapfrogs the annual tally for any calendar year in recent memory. The count also outpaces surrounding states, even those with larger prison populations. 
Cooper can’t imagine a prison system free of drugs. But he can picture one with fewer overdose deaths.
If South Dakota wants to improve things inside the walls, he said, the state should pour its time and treasure into addiction treatment.
“If you take away the addicts,” he said, “the dealers have no drugs to sell.” 
‘What are you supposed to do in the meantime?’
Cooper is sober today. He runs a restaurant in southwest Sioux Falls and is serving out the remainder of his supervised release term. But he also spends a lot of time thinking about the safety of the inmates he used to call neighbors. 
In April, he testified at a meeting of a state task force wrestling with the decision to build a new men’s prison. Lawmakers and the governor ultimately chose to approve the project, but Cooper said drug treatment and job training would serve the state better than a new building.
When Cooper offered his testimony, most of 2025’s prison overdoses — seven suspected or confirmed as K2-related, one from methamphetamine — hadn’t happened yet.

Some of the dead are people Cooper knew and, he said, needed support to stay clean and turn their lives around.
Cooper got support from his older brother, Ryan Vanden Hoek, who’s also a former South Dakota prisoner. Vanden Hoek and another former inmate named Steve Harrison now host a Sioux Falls-based podcast called “Unconfined Conversations.” It’s meant to encourage inmates and parolees to do right by themselves and others, but also to educate the public on what works and doesn’t in South Dakota’s prisons.
Vanden Hoek sees the availability of chemical dependency treatment as a major shortfall. Inmates rarely get a shot at treatment until near the end of their prison term, he said.
“It’s hard to expect somebody to make great personal changes when all you have for treatment is six to eight weeks in the last two years of your sentence,” Vanden Hoek said. “What are you supposed to do in the meantime?”
Department of Corrections spokesman Michael Winder said in an email that there’s no policy forcing inmates to wait. But he also wrote that treatment slots are “subject to available space in a program.”
During a presentation to the prison task force in April, Behavioral Health Chief Justin Elkins displayed a slide on substance abuse treatment that illustrated the system’s crunch for space.
“The basic gist from this page,” Elkins said, “is that there’s over 700 individual offenders in Sioux Falls who are waiting for substance use disorder treatment.”
That figure represents about half the Sioux Falls inmate population.
‘You’ve got just a bunch of hurt guys here’
Sam Lint, who’s serving a life sentence in the South Dakota State Penitentiary, would like to see more rehabilitation and peer support groups, more classes in general and more mental health programming specifically. 
Lint said he and his fellow inmates often spend years dulling childhood trauma with drugs before they get to prison.

“There’s an urge, there’s been nothing introduced to us to intervene, so you just use the maladaptive coping skills you used as a child,” Lint said. “You’ve got just a bunch of hurt guys here, and the prison keeps hurting our families more and more, taking away our stuff and putting up barriers to communication.”
Some of what Lint calls barriers came during efforts to limit drug trafficking in prison, but he said such moves can also fuel addictive behaviors. Things like the temporary shutdown of texting in the spring of 2024, limits on the number of calls inmates can make in a day and the loss of in-person visits at the penitentiary since Father’s Day have worsened inmates’ sense of isolation, he said. 
He’s also grown frustrated with the number of unit-wide lockdowns prisoners have experienced over the past few years.
One lockdown in 2024 lasted more than a month. During lockdowns, inmates are confined to their cells, including during meals and times when they might have in-person coursework or programming.
“You have guys who are making the conscious choice every day to get up, stay sober, go to class, go to work, go to church, go to groups, to just keep their head down and do their thing,” Lint said. “And then one day you wake up and the door doesn’t open because you’re getting punished for somebody else’s behavior.”
Between the frustration, boredom and underlying addictions, Lint said there are plenty of people who’ll say yes to K2, overdose risk be damned.
“We’re a prison full of all-day weed smokers who don’t have access to weed, right?” Lint said. “So yeah, people know the risks and roll the dice.”
Winder, the Department of Corrections spokesman, said in an email that it does not track the number of lockdowns in its facilities.
Drug use responses
Harrison, one of the ex-inmate podcasters, said correctional policies that have changed in the past decade or so can encourage drug use. 
When Harrison got to prison more than two decades ago, people caught getting high would go into a cell designed for disciplinary segregation. So would those found to have helped them get drugs. If prison staff or volunteers were involved, he said, they’d also face consequences. 
Nearer to the end of his term, Harrison said, things got lax. Since his departure, he said, he keeps hearing from friends inside that things have gotten even less strict. 
Word has spread, Harrison said. 
“When you’ve got somebody who’s struggling, somebody who’s addicted and what have you, they start to talk amongst themselves,” Harrison said. “They tell other people, ‘Hey, they’re not locking people up for smoking.’ It perpetuates the usage.”
Vanden Hoek suspects that’s because a spike in prison violence has made it more difficult to keep space for drug users and dealers in disciplinary cells. 
The state’s most recent annual statistical report says prison assaults on staff spiked to a five-year high in fiscal year 2025, with 142. Twenty-two of those assaults caused serious injuries. Inmate-on-inmate fights between males were at a five year high, as well, at 447. Of those, 49 caused serious injuries.
Winder said the agency would not specify how many disciplinary or isolation cells are available. He said those caught using or suspected of using drugs are placed on “restrictive housing” status, meaning they’re confined to their cells for 22 hours a day. 
Restrictive housing, Winder wrote, is “a condition of confinement, not a physical location.”

But Lint, the current inmate, said 22 hours of lockup is a common condition for people who don’t have jobs on the inside, regardless of drug infractions. He said there are fewer than 50 isolation cells overall in Sioux Falls, and that a portion of them are reserved for inmates in protective custody.
Gov. Larry Rhoden, during a recent press conference about a new women’s prison currently under construction in Rapid City, said he is confident in new Department of Corrections leader Nick Lamb. 
He pointed to scanners the prison system purchased to scan for drugs hidden in body cavities. He’s also targeted rehabilitation programming, pledging $1.5 million from a fund he controls to support a diesel mechanic training program on the penitentiary campus and appointing a 30-member rehabilitation task force to study ways to reduce repeat offenses and improve programming.
At a recent task force meeting, Lamb said he’s visited all of the state’s prisons and held listening sessions with staff members. Soon, he said, he intends to do the same with inmates.
“I’m going to be happy to listen to their concerns, especially with programming, what interests they have, and what they think will benefit them,” Lamb said.
Mentorship encouraged
The value of mentorship is something Vanden Hoek, Cooper, Harrison and Lint all see as key to turning things around. Long-term inmates who’ve figured things out ought to be encouraged to guide young people, they say, even if those long-timers are in prison for serious crimes.
Former Department of Corrections Secretary Denny Kaemingk hired an ex-inmate named Michael Standing Soldier to work with the most hardened prisoners about a decade ago. At the time, Kaemingk said Standing Soldier, a former troublemaker who came to prison with a long-term sentence for a violent crime, could relate to people in a similar predicament. 
Standing Soldier has since died, but Vanden Hoek and Harrison each remember him as a force for good at the penitentiary.
Willingness to meet inmates where they’re at and respond to their needs as individuals are pillars of what Vanden Hoek calls “moral leadership.”
Group punishments and lockdowns are signs of its absence, he argued, and he sees the overdose deaths as an outgrowth of that.
“When there are things like empathy and kindness and morality on behalf of the administration, where they simply want to do what’s best for everybody, you aren’t going to see things like this happening,” he said.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Jordan Ward isn’t one of the eight men killed by an overdose in a South Dakota prison in 2025, but a lawsuit filed this year over his 2022 death in custody offers insight into how drugs sometimes make their way into the hands of inmates.
The case also points to the impact of losing a loved one inside an institution obligated to protect their well-being as they pay their societal debt.
An overdose of the synthetic opioid fentanyl killed the 30-year-old Ward in his state penitentiary cell on Aug. 4, 2022. 
The lawsuit filed this August by Ward’s father in the U.S. District Court of South Dakota alleges that the state Department of Corrections had multiple opportunities to prevent the young man’s death.


South Dakota’s prison overdose problem
This story is part of a series examining a spate of prison overdose deaths in South Dakota, including the causes and potential solutions.
Read the series >


The first, court documents allege, came when another inmate’s family arrived at the penitentiary for an in-person visit. The complaint says that inmate’s children had been given drugs by people who’d conspired with associates of a third inmate — Ward’s cellmate — to pass them along during a visit. 
The children were not searched, the lawsuit says, nor were they properly restricted from physical contact with their father in the manner outlined by Department of Corrections visitation policy. The father allegedly wasn’t searched before returning to the prison, either. 
The inmate’s children “provided the fentanyl,” the lawsuit says.
The drugs passed from the inmate who collected them at the visit, the complaint alleges, to Ward’s cellmate. 
On the night of his death, the lawsuit says, Ward was “facing the wall” and didn’t respond to commands given by a female correctional officer checking cells. The officer allegedly ordered Ward’s cellmate to put Ward into bed, but walked away before that happened. The cellmate tried to help Ward, but Ward was much larger. The cellmate struggled and Ward fell, the lawsuit says, and inmates in the vicinity began to yell for help about a potential overdose.
It took 20 minutes for the officer to return, the lawsuit says, and it took her another 10 minutes after coming back to bring a nurse, who did not have Narcan, an opioid overdose antidote. A “third individual” eventually brought Narcan, according to the lawsuit, but it was too late. 
The lawsuit alleges that the state was negligent by failing to follow its policies on searching visitors before visits and inmates after them, in failing to respond properly when Ward was unresponsive, for the pace of the medical response when his cellmate called for help, and for what the complaint described as a systematic failure to offer support and protection to an inmate known to struggle with addiction.
The state’s prison apparatus “permitted, tolerated, and was deliberately indifferent,” the complaint says, to the “negligence by DOC officers towards individuals in DOC custody who suffer from mental illness and/or face a known risk of relapse.”
Ward’s father, Robert Ward, is seeking monetary damages for burial costs, and punitive damages — monetary awards meant to punish a negligent actor for their behavior — for the loss of his son. 
Less than two months before Jordan Ward’s passing, the lawsuit says, his stepmother Janine had died from a long-term illness. 
“Despite being in custody, Jordan was a constant source of support for Robert after Janine Ward passed,” the lawsuit says. “Jordan was Robert Ward’s best friend.”
The Department of Corrections did not respond to a request for comment on the case, but denied the allegations of wrongdoing in its legal response to the Ward complaint. 
The case is working its way through the pretrial process. No trial date has been set.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)A program that helps farmers pass their operations along to their children got a $200,000 boost from a South Dakota government fund under the exclusive control of the governor.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden said in a Monday press release that the Future Fund grant to the South Dakota Ag Foundation’s “Keep Farmers Farming” initiative will make it easier for families to manage “essential estate and transition planning.”
“Keep Farmers Farming is making sure that our kids and grandkids keep South Dakota agriculture strong for generations to come,” Rhoden said in the press release. “It’s about transferring more than just assets — it’s about passing down experience, work ethic, morals, and history.”
It’s the second financial boost from state government for the transition planning program. 
Prior to her departure for Washington, D.C., to serve as U.S. Homeland Security secretary, former Gov. Kristi Noem’s office gave a $200,000 grant to the Ag Foundation to “administer, market, and grow” the foundation’s estate technical assistance work. That included transferring the program from First Dakota National Bank to the foundation.
Governor awards $1 million for business parks in hometown of political opponent

Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms said in an email on Monday that the earlier money came from the Governor’s Office of Economic Development’s Rural Development Portfolio. South Dakota Searchlight asked for further specifics, because the office’s website doesn’t appear to list a program or fund matching that name. A letter of agreement provided on Monday by the office lays out terms and scope of work, but does not specify which program the money came from.
Noem announced the initial award to the program during her 2024 State of the State address. She said the idea to back and expand the estate planning program was born of an informal work group of agricultural leaders convened “to brainstorm ideas on how the state and the ag industry can more actively support the next generation of ag producers.”
The number of participating families in the program has grown from 54 to 125 since that announcement, Rhoden’s news release says.
The foundation that runs the program was founded in 2015 as what its website describes as an “independent, industry-led nonprofit.” Alan Hojer, who runs the program for the foundation, says he works with families directly to help them decide what legal or professional help they might need as they prepare to pass along their operations. 
The grant funding from the governor’s office helped cover program expenses and hire a second consultant to work with families in 2025, Hojer said. Between the new grant and additional recent awards from Farm Credit Services of America and Pioneer Bank and Trust, he said, “we’re looking to add another consultant in 2026.”
Monday’s announcement is the second in a month from Rhoden on his use of the Future Fund, a pool of money meant to be used “for purposes related to research and economic development for the state,” according to state law. The governor has the sole authority to decide on grants from the fund, which is built from a tax on employers.
On Dec. 10, Rhoden announced that he’d given $1 million from the Future Fund to help develop two business parks in Aberdeen.

(Rio Blanco County Sheriff's Office)Colorado officials are urging the Trump administration to reconsider its denial of disaster declarations that would have opened up federal funding to support wildfire and flood recovery in the state. 
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, asked Republican President Donald Trump to issue major disaster declarations for the Elk and Lee Fires in Rio Blanco County and for flooding in western Colorado. Declarations would have opened up Federal Emergency Management Agency funding to help the Colorado communities recovering from the natural disasters. 
Trump denied both requests late Saturday. Polis said affected Coloradans “deserve better than the political games President Trump is playing.”

“I call on the President’s better angels, and urge him to reconsider these requests,” Polis said in a statement. “This is about the Coloradans who need this support, and we won’t stop fighting for them to get what they deserve. Colorado will be appealing this decision.” 
U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, both Democrats, also called on Trump to reverse the decision. Both senators said the denial is unacceptable.
“Communities in Western Colorado are in serious need of help after the life-threatening flooding and historic wildfires earlier this year,” Bennet said in a statement. “Trump continues to use Coloradans for political games; it is malicious and obscene. A disaster is a disaster, regardless of what state in the country it took place.”
The Trump administration has repeatedly targeted Colorado, promising “harsh measures” if the state does not release election denier and former Republican Mesa County clerk Tina Peters from prison, suing the state for refusing to share voter information, and suing the state for its immigrant protection laws. 










Trump continues to use Coloradans for political games; it is malicious and obscene. A disaster is a disaster, regardless of what state in the country it took place.


– U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet


All 10 members of Colorado’s congressional delegation, including Democrats and Republicans, signed a letter to Trump in support of Polis’ request for FEMA assistance. U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, a Grand Junction Republican whose district spans western and southern Colorado, asked the Trump administration to consider an appeal as well. 
“Western Colorado has long supported the President, and that support comes from communities now facing the real human and economic consequences of recent disasters,” Hurd said in a statement. “Local leaders and residents are seeking a consistent application of FEMA criteria so recovery efforts can move forward.”
The Lee and Elk fires grew rapidly and forced evacuations in and around the town of Meeker after they were started by lightning on Aug. 2. A combined total of more than 1,200 firefighting personnel were assigned to the fires at their peak intensity in mid-August, fueled by extreme drought and critical fire weather conditions. The fires led to more than $27 million in damage. 
Flooding in Archuleta, La Plata and Mineral counties in October damaged more than 60 miles of road and associated culverts, drainage structures, and embankment. Drinking water and wastewater infrastructure as well as recreation infrastructure was also damaged. The floods have caused more than $13 million in damages.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The chairman of a state economic development board not only sits on the corporate board for a company benefiting from millions in state aid but also has connections to the company’s landlord.
As reported Friday by South Dakota Searchlight, Jeff Erickson is the chairman of the South Dakota Board of Economic Development and a member of the CJ Schwan’s corporate board. While he’s held those positions, CJ Schwan’s has benefited from a total of $69 million in state grants, loans and tax rebates pledged or paid during the past four years. The money is helping CJ Schwan’s build a 650-employee, $550 million food production plant in northern Sioux Falls.
Erickson abstained from the state board’s discussions and votes on aid for CJ Schwan’s, and he told Searchlight for last week’s story that he has “not financially benefited in any way” from the project.
After the publication of Friday’s story, Searchlight received a tip that a company connected to Erickson owns the downtown Sioux Falls office building where CJ Schwan’s is housing some of its employees while the northern Sioux Falls plant is under construction.
Company that hired state’s former head of economic development benefits from $69 million in aid

Searchlight confirmed in public records that the office building at 200 E. 10th St. is owned by Riverview Holdings, and that Erickson was listed as the original manager of Riverview Holdings when it was incorporated in 2001. In a 2017 financial interest statement filed with state government — the most recent one available from the Secretary of State’s Office — Erickson described himself as a member of the corporation.
Searchlight asked Erickson how to reconcile his earlier statement about not financially benefiting from the CJ Schwan’s project with his ties to a corporation owning the building where CJ Schwan’s is housing employees.
“I recused and abstained as required by law. I had no control or influence over CJ’s source of a home for its Sioux Falls headquarters,” Erickson said in an emailed statement.
Erickson’s 2017 financial interest statement also listed CJ Schwan’s as one of numerous businesses supplying him, his spouse or his children with more than 10% control or more than $2,000 of annual family income.
Searchlight has asked the Secretary of State’s Office why it does not have a more current financial interest statement from Erickson, but the office has not responded. State law says all appointees of the governor subject to state Senate confirmation must file a statement of financial interest before their confirmation. Board of Economic Development members serve four year-terms, and Erickson was reappointed and confirmed by the Senate this year.
State Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, is one of four nonvoting legislative members of the state Board of Economic Development, serving alongside 13 citizen appointees, including Erickson. After Searchlight informed Muckey of Erickson’s ties to the building housing CJ Schwan’s offices, Muckey called for better “public disclosures of private benefit.”
“We cannot make informed decisions with public funds if it is clouded by undisclosed conflicts after decisions are made,” Muckey said Monday in a statement. “Legislative reform is necessary now.”
South Dakota Searchlight also reported Friday that CJ Schwan’s employs Steve Westra, who led the Governor’s Office of Economic Development when that office first pledged assistance for the CJ Schwan’s project in 2021. Westra left state government in May 2023, and his LinkedIn page says he began working as a vice president for CJ Schwan’s in May 2024.
One year is the legally required waiting period for former state employees to benefit from a contract they were involved with, or to enter into a new contract with the state.

Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, another nonvoting legislative member of the state Board of Economic Development, said in Friday’s story that “the optics” of Westra’s transition “are absolutely terrible.” Reed told Searchlight on Monday that he plans to introduce legislation this winter that would increase the mandatory waiting period to two years.
State aid approved to benefit CJ Schwan’s has included about $38.7 million in grants to the Sioux Falls Development Foundation. The grants reimbursed the foundation for land it transferred to CJ Schwan’s, for costs including the construction of an on-site wastewater treatment facility, and for gas-line infrastructure that will benefit CJ Schwan’s and the rest of the industrial park where the project is located.
CJ Schwan’s has also been approved for up to $15 million in rebates of sales taxes paid on construction and equipment, and for a $15 million low-interest loan to help with construction costs.
CJ Schwan’s is part of CJ Group, which is publicly traded in South Korea and disclosed revenues of about $30 billion last year.

(Getty Images)An accounting error led the Wisconsin Department of Transportation to erroneously increase the value on paper of the state’s infrastructure assets by nearly $900 million, legislative auditors said in a new analysis.
WisDOT corrected the error after the Legislative Audit Bureau drew it to the attention of the department, and the erroneous information was not included in the state’s 2024-25 fiscal year financial statements.
WisDOT had initially added $896 million to the value of the state’s capital infrastructure assets. It took that step after a previous audit report recommended a change in some of the department’s accounting procedures. In the process, however, WisDOT overlooked other accounting principles and procedures, which if followed would not have led to the error, according to the audit bureau’s report on the Wisconsin’s 2024-25 financial statements
WisDOT officials agreed with the new audit finding and said they would follow through on the audit bureau’s recommendations to update their procedures.
WisDOT was one of two state agencies that the Legislative Audit Bureau spotlighted in the financial statement audit report. The report was released Friday, Dec. 19, and highlighted Monday by the co-chairs of the Legislature’s Joint Audit Committee.
The audit report also said the state Department of Administration hasn’t adequately addressed security concerns relating to the state’s information technology systems that have been raised in previous audits.
“These audit findings have been found for numerous years, with no corrections taken by DOA,” stated a press release from the audit committee’s Republican co-chairs, Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) and Rep. Robert Wittke (R-Caledonia).
Corrections are underway, however, according to Kathy Blumenfeld, DOA secretary-designee.
In a letter responding to the audit, Blumenfeld wrote that while the audit bureau’s findings were “repeated from previous years,” the department “has in the last year implemented certain corrective actions consistent with the auditors’ recommendations.”
Those changes will require “sustained multiyear execution,” she wrote, given the nature of the audit findings. She also wrote that lawmakers have declined to increase DOA funding for cybersecurity, adding that more state funding “will be imperative to ensure the long-term security needs of the state.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-22 23:13:32+00:00,CT Mirror,Mercedes-Benz to pay $150M to settle multistate emissions allegations,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/22/mercedes-benz-to-pay-150m-to-settle-multistate-emissions-allegations/,AGs from 50 states alleged that software devices in the automobiles optimized emission controls during tests but reduced them during normal operations.,"Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimler AG have agreed to pay $149.6 million to settle allegations that the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles to pass emission tests, a coalition of attorneys general announced Monday.
According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.
The states alleged that Mercedes installed the devices because it couldn’t reach design and performance goals such as fuel efficiency while complying with emissions standards. The automaker allegedly concealed the devices from state and federal regulators and the public while marketing the vehicles as “environmentally friendly” and compliant with emissions standards.
The agreement is still subject to court approval.
Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz USA already agreed in 2020 to pay $1.5 billion to the U.S. government and California state regulators to resolve the emissions cheating allegations.
Mercedes-Benz issued a statement saying the deal announced Monday will resolve all remaining legal proceedings tied to diesel emissions in the United States, but the company still considers the accusations unfounded and denies any liability. The automaker has made “sufficient provisions” for the cost of the settlement, the statement said.
Fifty attorneys general, including the attorneys general of Connecticut and Puerto Rico, made up the coalition announced Monday. California was not part of the group.
The settlement calls for the automaker to pay the attorneys general $120 million with another $29 million payment suspended and potentially waived pending completion of a consumer relief program.
That effort will extend to the roughly 40,000 vehicles with the devices that hadn’t been repaired or permanently removed from the road by Aug. 1, 2023. The owners of those vehicles would get $2,000 per vehicle if they install approved emissions modification software and an extended warranty.
Connecticut is slated to receive nearly $5 million through the settlement. An estimated 3,181 impacted vehicles are registered in the state, according to state Attorney General William Tong’s office.
In a statement Monday, Tong said, “Mercedes-Benz and Daimler hid devices inside their vehicles to cheat emissions tests, knowingly pumping out toxic emissions far exceeding legal limits. Their deception hurt their customers and harmed air quality for all Americans, and we’re holding them accountable.”
The settlement also calls for Mercedes to comply with reporting requirements and refrain from any further unfair or deceptive marketing or sale of diesel vehicles.
Volkswagen also ended up paying $2.8 billion to settle a criminal case due to emissions cheating.

Phil Murphy earlier this year made banning cellphones in schools a priority of his final year in office.,"Gov. Phil Murphy earlier this year made banning cellphones in schools a priority of his final year in office. (StockPlanets/Getty Images)Students using their phones or smart watches during school hours could soon be a thing of the past in New Jersey under a bill approved by both legislative chambers Monday.
Supporters of the legislation say they are driven by concerns over the mental health of students and over disruptions to the learning environment caused by internet-enabled devices. It passed unanimously in the Senate, and in the Assembly, it passed 63-3 with five abstentions. 
“Students benefit from having a bell-to-bell prohibition on cellphones. I think it’s that clear and that simple, and I think that’s what we did today,” Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) told reporters.
The Department of Education would be required to develop new guidelines barring cellphones during the school day under the bill, which is now headed to the governor’s desk for his signature or veto. Gov. Phil Murphy, who leaves office on Jan. 20 after two terms, has made banning cellphones in schools a priority of his final year as governor.
The New Jersey effort is part of a national trend. Nearly half of states now have restrictions on students’ use of phones during classroom instruction.
Bill critic Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-Morris) said regulating tech in schools should be left to local districts instead of being driven by lawmakers who belong to what he called a “dinosaur caucus.” Bergen compared the bill to “stupid” efforts decades ago to criminalize pagers in schools.
“Here’s another attempt to do that. And this isn’t the first, or second, or third time. Calculators back in the day were going to make kids stupid. How could they do basic math?” he said. “If it was up to you’d probably bring back the slide rule.” 
Assemblywoman Vicky Flynn (R-Monmouth), a supporter of the bill, said she has visited schools with different cellphone policies and said students who can’t access their phones during class are less anxious and more engaged with their work. 
“The data is pretty clear. It’s been screaming at us that we have to do something about it,” said Flynn, a former school board member in Nutley and Holmdel.
Under the bill, state education officials would release guidelines aimed at student use of internet-enabled devices like cellphones and smartwatches during regular school hours and on school grounds. It would apply to all students from kindergarten through grade 12 in public, charter, and renaissance schools. 
The state education commissioner would have 90 days after the bill is signed into law to release the guidelines. The new rules would go into effect the following full school year, so the soonest would be the 2026-2027 school year.
At a minimum, the state guidelines would have to: prohibit non-academic use of internet-enabled devices on school grounds; provide rules that are age- and grade-appropriate; be consistent with state and federal laws for accommodations and student health plans; and address how students can use phones during emergencies. 
The guidelines would permit cellphone use for some uses, like for translation services.

(Screenshot/YouTube, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources)The Kentucky Attorney General is demanding the resignation of the board chair overseeing the state’s wildlife management agency, arguing he is ineligible under Kentucky law — a position that could have broader implications for the state’s hunters and anglers. 
Attorney Aaron Silletto, head of the Office of Civil and Environmental Law within the AG’s office, wrote Chuck Meade, the chair of the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission, a Dec. 19 letter reviewed by the Lantern. In it, Silletto said Meade had not held a hunting or fishing license for five consecutive years as required by state law to serve on the commission. Nor did he qualify for an exemption that allows residents to hunt and fish without a license on their farmland during that five-year period. 
“Your failure to obtain hunting and fishing licenses in 2021 and 2022 means you continue to be ineligible to serve on the Commission, and you will be ineligible to serve on the Commission until the 2027 license year, at the earliest,” Silletto wrote. “The citizens of Wildlife District 7 and I look forward to your timely response and resignation.”
Silletto demanded Meade resign by Dec. 31 or else the attorney general’s office would seek to remove Meade from the commission through action in circuit court. 
Meade, a former state representative, told the Lantern in a phone interview that his attorney planned to ask for a continuance of the deadline until January to give him more time to prepare a response. 
He said his response would address an interpretation of a Kentucky Court of Appeals decision from 1955 that the attorney general’s office is citing to argue that Meade does not qualify for an exemption allowing Kentuckians to hunt and fish on their farmland without a license. 
“I believe that if just minds will just take a fresh look at the old decision, these matters can be resolved,” Meade said. “I’ve told this to everyone: The commission is a great privilege, and I’m proud to represent many Kentuckians who enjoy hunting and fishing on their family farms. I have been a lifelong sportsman of the commonwealth.” 
Meade said he would defend himself in court if necessary. 
Meade was appointed to the District seat, representing Eastern Kentucky, by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear in January 2024, after being nominated by sportspeople in his district. The GOP-controlled Kentucky Senate confirmed him in April 2024.
Commission members oversee the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources’s budget consisting of tens of millions of dollars in hunting and fishing license fees, boat registration fees, and federal grants. The commission also implements and changes hunting and fishing regulations. 
State law directs the commission to keep a “watchful eye” over the department, and the commission controls the employment of the department’s head executive, Commissioner Rich Storm. 
A ‘strong connection’ to a farm
Silletto wrote in his four-page letter that Meade was initially advised through a separate letter on Dec. 5 of a “citizen’s complaint” that challenged Meade’s eligibility to serve on the commission. 
Kevin Grout, the spokesperson for Coleman, said in an email that Coleman’s office received the complaint on Oct. 6, but he did not address a Lantern question on who filed it. Grout said Coleman’s office was not aware of “another recent challenge to the eligibility of a Fish and Wildlife Commission member.”
At issue in Silletto’s letter are two parts of state law: One part details eligibility requirements for commission members to serve when a prospective member of the commission goes through a nomination process; another part allows a “resident owner of farmland” to hunt and fish on their own property without getting a license, one of a number of license exemptions permitted for Kentuckians. 
Silletto wrote in his letter Meade did not have five consecutive years worth of hunting and fishing licenses when he was nominated, a requirement that became law in 2022, noting that Meade purchased a 2023 sportsmen’s license “a mere two days before the meeting of sportsmen at which you were nominated.”

Silletto’s letter also details how Meade cited an exemption in state law that allows a “resident owner of farmlands” to not purchase a hunting or fishing license. Silletto wrote that Meade argued, and had witness testimony that he hunted on a 100-acre farm he owned in Lawrence County every year since 2008. 
But Silletto said because Meade did not live on that Lawrence County farm — instead appearing to live in a “gated community in a subdivision” in Johnson County — he did not qualify for the farmland license exemption. 
“You may not use your non-resident ownership of the Lawrence County property to avail yourself of the ‘resident owner of farmlands’ exemption,” Silletto wrote. 
Silletto cited two separate opinions from the attorney general, one from 1963 and another from 1979, along with the Kentucky Court of Appeals decision from 1955 to argue the law meant that a person had to have a “sufficient connection to the particular tract of land” to be “deemed residents of that tract of land.” 
Meade told the Lantern he does have a “strong connection” to the Lawrence County land, mentioning it has been in his family for more than 100 years. 
“We have raised our families. We’ve raised livestock on it. We’ve raised gardens on it. We’ve survived from it, and we feel the connection expressly mentioned in the prior court case,” Meade said. 
Past political clashes
The League of Kentucky Sportsmen, which represents thousands of hunters across the state, is concerned the attorney general’s office’s interpretation of the license exemption for resident farmland owners conflicts with how it’s been long been interpreted by state game wardens. 
A copy of a draft resolution shared with the Lantern calls on the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources to take “immediate action” to clarify how the resident farmland exemption is interpreted. 
The resolution states the resident farmland exemption “has historically afforded Kentucky residents the right to hunt and fish on their own land” regardless of whether the landowner lived there. The resolution also states that after checking in with various wildlife law enforcement officers, they have shared their interpretation “that it is not necessary for landowners to reside on their property to be granted the landowner license exemption.” 
Doug Ramey, the president of the league, told the Lantern he questioned why Meade’s eligibility was being brought up after the Kentucky Senate had already confirmed him. 
“Why is it being brought up now when he’s owned his own property forever?” Ramey said. “I suspect there is an ulterior motive.” 
Scottie Ellis, a spokesperson for Beshear, said the governor was not aware of the investigation into Meade. 
“The governor does not yet know all the underlying facts but is concerned that every time a member of this commission attempts to exert real oversight and demand transparency, a Republican AG intervenes,” Ellis said. “The vast majority of sportsmen have serious and grave concerns with the operations of fish & wildlife, yet their elected members to the board are denied confirmation or threatened with lawsuits.”

Beshear and Storm have clashed on a number of issues in the past, including executive branch oversight of procurement and conservation easements. Republican Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers has previously told reporters that a priority for the Senate, when considering whether to confirm Beshear’s appointments to the commission, was to protect Storm from retaliation. Hunters and anglers have decried past Beshear appointments being denied by the Senate, arguing apolitical wildlife management work was becoming politicized. 
Lisa Jackson, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, in an emailed statement said Storm was not involved in initiating or encouraging any complaint. She said the department is not taking a position on whether Meade should resign and would refer to “the appropriate legal authorities” for a resolution. 
“This matter is between the Attorney General’s office and a gubernatorial appointee to the Fish and Wildlife Commission,” Jackson said. “Storm remains committed to carrying out his duties in accordance with the law and maintaining public confidence in the work of the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screen-Shot-2025-12-22-at-12.34.11-PM-1024x657.png,,,2025-12-22 18:58:52.402956

The chief executive of the Upstate college, until recently, sat on the board of two publicly traded companies: a homebuilding firm and a bank.
He’s been on the board of Greenville-based United Community Banks since 2020. It’s his seat on other one — United Homes Group, formerly Great Southern Homes — since 2022 that brought public questions about his role and a potential conflict of interest. He resigned in October, along with all but the company’s founder. Other board members who left the company included former Gov. Nikki Haley, who also sits on her alma mater’s board.
Combined, those jobs netted Clements as much as $484,000 in 2023 (the most in one year), largely in stock options, according to filings with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
That’s on top of his Clemson salary. He was set to receive up to $1.5 million annually in total compensation through 2031, as per his contract extension approved last year.
College presidents on corporate boards
It’s not unheard of for college presidents, of both public and private universities, to take positions on corporate boards.
Jim Finkelstein, a George Mason University professor who has researched corporate board service since the 1990s, conducted three surveys over the course of about a decade of the top 120 to 130 research universities in the country. His team consistently found between 35% and 40% of those schools surveyed had a president who served on a corporate board.
“These corporate board seats can be very lucrative,” he said.
Across the Southeastern Conference, at least six public college presidents held a corporate board position while leading their respective universities. That does not, however, include the University of South Carolina, the only Palmetto State school in the 16-member sports conference.
None of the presidents of public colleges in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which includes Clemson, appeared in a search of Securities and Exchange Commission records.
These outside relationships can sometimes blow back on the school when interests of the colleges and corporations collide, as Clemson and Clements found out this past fall.
Clements’ connection to United Homes drew criticism from members of the Oconee County Council when the company started pushing a large subdivision in the county, not far from Lake Keowee.
Council Chairman Matthew Durham argued United Homes and its founder Michael Nieri, a Clemson alumnus and large donor, were profiting off the Clemson area’s population growth driven, at least in part, by the school.
“That’s one of the dangers of presidents serving on corporate boards,” Finkelstein told the SC Daily Gazette. “When corporations get into trouble, the president of the university becomes involved.”
For example, former Ohio State University President Gordon Gee was drawn into the legal troubles of coal miner Massey Energy Co. following a 2006 fire that killed two men at one of the company’s West Virginia mines.
Gee resigned from the mining company board in 2009. At that time, he held 28,000 shares of company stock and had been paid about $219,000 for his work on the board.
And in 2016, two University of California campuses received criticism following reporting of conflicts at the top. In San Francisco, the CEO of the medical school’s hospital sat on the board of a medical device company that earned millions in contracts from the hospital system. And at the Davis campus, the college chancellor also sat on the board of DeVry Education Group, a for-profit college operator.
Following those controversies, the California college system’s governing board started requiring chancellors to get approval before joining no more than two corporate boards.
What’s changed?
In the 1950s, Finkelstein said, college presidents earned far less than the contracts inked today. To help with recruitment of university leadership, corporations headquartered in college towns often offered up board seats to presidents to supplement their income and as a gesture of goodwill.
Today, Finkelstein suspects, companies are doing it because of the prestige a university president brings.
Rarely, he said, does a college president have expertise particular to those corporations.
Finkelstein said most of the college presidents he talked with as part of his surveys reported joining the boards as a way to build connections and fundraise. However, there is no factual proof that companies give more to the universities in return, he said.
“Where there is even an appearance that there might be some overlap between the university and that company, it can raise concerns with conflict of interest,” Finkelstein said.
Yet, beyond limiting the number of positions held and requiring prior approval, Finkelstein said college boards across the country have done little else to shut down the practice.
At the University of South Carolina, the president is expected to inform the Board of Trustees of any plans to join an outside corporate board, but there’s no specific policy, spokesman Jeff Stensland said. Neither President Michael Amiridis nor long-time former President Harris Pastides held board positions, according to filings with the state Ethics Commission.
Clemson, Coastal Carolina University, Lander University and Francis Marion University all go a step further: Clauses in their presidents’ contracts require permission of the college governing board. And those contracts stipulate that the outside board seats do not interfere with the president’s official duties.
Winthrop University and South Carolina State University have no stipulations.
The state’s other public universities did not respond to questions from the SC Daily Gazette.
Finkelstein said many colleges have policies requiring permission, but boards generally go along with a request.
“No one does a thorough check of whether the university is doing business with this company,” he said.
Development controversy
In the case of Clemson and United Homes Group, both the college and the company denied that the homebuilder benefited from the connection to the university or used it to put pressure on the county to approve development plans. United Homes Group even tried to distance itself from the project in statements to The Post and Courier, though public records appear to dispute that.
The company had sought to build a mix of single family homes, apartments and a satellite Clemson location on 600 acres, located about 5 miles northeast of the school, near Newry Mill. An early marketing plan called for 5,200 housing units. But in a letter to the editor, one of the developers said a later plan came in at less than 3,200 units over a 20-year span.
From a string of emails provided in response to a public records request and published online by the council chairman, it does appear Clements sought to recuse himself.
“Because the President sits on the Board of Great Southern Homes’ parent company, he has asked not to be involved, however, does have an awareness of the opportunity,” the school’s vice president of external affairs and board advisor wrote in a January 2024 email to the president’s chief of staff, chief operating officer, chief financial officer and a member of the school’s real estate and development office.
Still, those members of the college’s senior management team interacted with the company over the course of at least a year, even flying on a company plane to tour a similar development near Purdue University in Indiana.
In another January 2024 email to Clemson’s vice president, members of United Homes Group staff wrote they considered the school’s participation “mission critical.”
After the trip to Indiana that month, Clemson staff met with employees of the homebuilding company on campus and at the Oconee County site at least four times later that year.
“Clemson is very interested in exploring the potential opportunity,” the school’s real estate vice president wrote in an April 2024 email.
Asked about the controversy, Clemson said last month it “routinely reviews economic development proposals.”
“At no point has the University provided funding for, partnered on or endorsed the planning or construction of any residential development related to this proposal,” reads the statement to the SC Daily Gazette and other outlets.
“As is standard practice, an administrative team conducted a preliminary review to assess the multi-use concept’s potential economic and community impact,” the statement continued. “After completing its due diligence, the University decided not to pursue the economic development initiative … Clemson values its longstanding relationship with Oconee County and remains focused on its mission of education, research, public service and statewide economic development.”
The meetings appeared to fall off near the end of 2024, but it’s unclear when Clemson ultimately stepped away.
Resignations
Then, in October 2025, the entire board of United Homes Group, including Clements and Haley, resigned after Nieri refused to step down as executive chairman and the company’s stock bottomed out. Three board members signed a letter saying “existing management team is better suited to help the Company navigate the current market environment and address the Company’s operational challenges without Mr. Nieri serving as Executive Chairman.”
Clements and Haley each submitted separate resignations. Both cited a desire to focus on their professional obligations.
Less than two months later, Clements surprised the public with an unexpected announcement he would retire at the end of the year. The board appointed Provost Bob Jones as interim president as it begins a national search for a new chief.
Clements remains on the board of United Community Banks. A company spokesperson said the company was unable to meet the Gazette’s deadline for a comment on his role there.
“As Clemson University selects and transitions to a new president, the Board of Trustees is conducting a thorough review of leadership expectations and governance practices,” a statement from the school reads. “This review includes evaluating policies related to service on corporate boards.”
Meanwhile, Clements, age 61, has opted to take a sabbatical, which can last up to one year, and return to teach at Clemson.
Under the terms of his contract, he will continue to draw his $1.2 million presidential salary for a full year, regardless of how long his sabbatical lasts. After that he will be a fully tenured professor in the college of engineering and receive a salary equal to the average of the university’s three highest-compensated faculty members. That could top $450,000 annually, according to the online database of state-paid employees in South Carolina.

(David Espejo/Stock photo via Getty Images)A leading Senate Republican filed a lengthy bill Monday to enact Gov. Ron DeSantis’s proposed “Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights.”
Sponsored by Sen. Tom Leek, a Republican from Port Orange, SB 482 would ban minors from access artificial intelligence chatbot accounts. The bill also enumerates Florida residents’ powers when it comes to AI including: 

The right of parents to supervise, access, limit, and control their minor children’s use of artificial intelligence.
The right to know whether they are communicating with a human being or an artificial intelligence system, program, or chatbot. 
The right to know if artificial intelligence technology companies are collecting personal information or biometric data, and to expect them to protect and de-identify that information or data.  

Attempts to contact Leek for this story were unsuccessful.
The bill comes as the governor has made AI policies — from cracking down on its growth to limiting access to sexual AI chatbots to restricting growth of data centers — a priority for the coming 2026 legislative session. 
“We cannot turn it all over to machines and think it’s going to work out great in the end,” DeSantis said during a press conference earlier this month from The Villages, where he was joined by an Orlando mom who lost her son to suicide after an AI chatbot encouraged him to “come home.”
“I really fear that if this is not addressed in an intelligent and proper way, it could set off an age of darkness and deceit,” DeSantis added.

SB 482 bill does not limit new AI centers but it does go beyond establishing basic rights concerning the technology. 
The legislation would ban government entities, beginning July 1, 2026, from entering into any contract with any entity providing AI unless the company signs an affidavit affirming it is not owned by a “foreign country of concern.” 
A government entity cannot enter into a contract for artificial intelligence technology, software, or products, if the technology is owned by a government of a “foreign country of concern,” such a country holds a controlling interest in the AI company, or a the provider is organized under the laws of or has its principal place of business in such a country.
The bill would provide definitions for “artificial intelligence,” “bot,” and “companion chatbot” and make clear that a chatbot used for a video game, or that functions as voice command and speaker, in customer service, or a business’s operational purposes do not qualify as companion chatbots.
The bill would ban companion chatbox platforms from allowing people under age 18 to enter into contracts and becoming accountholders with the company.
Parents of minors could consent to their children joining the platform but the legislation requires that the consenting parent receive all copies of interactions between the minor and the companion chatbot. The bill would mandate that consenting parents and guardians be allowed to limit the amount of time spent with the chatbot each day as well as days of the week and the times of the day that interactions could occur.
Companion chatbot platforms are required to terminate minors’ accounts within 10 days if requested by the consenting parent or guardian or within five days if requested by the minor accountholder.
The bill changes the rules for accounts owned by minors, too. For instance, with respect to minors’ accounts, SB 248 would require companion chatbot platforms to tell users they are interacting with artificial intelligence.
Additionally, the platforms must at the start of interactions — and at least once every hour during continuing interactions — remind the minors user that they are interacting with AI and to also take a break.
The bill would require companion chatbot platforms to “institute reasonable measures” to ensure the AI is not producing or sharing materials harmful to minors.
A companion chatbot platform that knowingly or recklessly violates the law could be sued. The bill requires that a civil suit be filed within one year after the alleged violation. Injured minors could receive up to $10,000 in damages. The companies could also be required to pay court fees and the minor’s attorney’s fees.
The Department of Legal Affairs, led by Attorney General James Uthmeier, would hold enforcement authority and collect civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation if the department deems the chatbot platform’s failure to comply reflects a consistent pattern of reckless behavior.
The bill would provide protection for residents of all ages, though, and not just minors, requiring that all users be told at the beginning of an interaction and at least every hour that they are not interacting with a person. 
The department would gain authority to take action against platforms for deceptive or unfair trade practices or acts and collect civil penalties of $50,000 per violation.  
And chatbot platforms that don’t de-identify users’ personal information and then sell the data could also be hit for deceptive or unfair trade practices or acts and face $50,000 civil penalties per violation.
There was no House sponsor as of this publication and the freshly filed bill still had not been referred to any Senate committees for hearings.

(David Edward Albright/Tri-City Record)
Six homeowners at a mobile home park in Aztec, New Mexico, allege in a new lawsuit that a Tennessee-based company violated state laws when it abruptly imposed new park rules, fees and lease terms on tenants and then used those illegal measures to threaten eviction.
The New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, a nonprofit legal aid organization, filed the lawsuit late last week on the tenants’ behalf against Capital Communities PM LLC, which owns mobile home parks across the country, including the San Juan Mobile Home Park in Aztec. 
According to the lawsuit, Capital Communities bought the 85-lot property in April and then a month later issued a notice saying rents would increase from $260 a month to $450 a month for most tenants. In the same notice, the landlords said they would pave the park this summer, though they never did so, according to the lawsuit.
Mobile home park tenants get eviction notice after 45 years

Shortly after buying the property, the owners sent park residents a 10-page document called “community standards” that imposed new prohibitions on residents, including on certain pets; which items are allowed on patios; and on cars that management deems against the “appearance of the Community,” according to the lawsuit. 
The state Mobile Home Park Act requires landlords to give tenants 60 days notice for new rules like those, including a 30-day comment period. Instead, the notice to tenants said the new rules are “effective as of the date they are provided to you, even if you refuse to sign and acknowledge receipt,” according to the lawsuit.
Many of the violations in the new rules carried fines of $25 a week, and the lawsuit alleges several tenants received generic notices that they had violated the rules.
Along with the “community standards,” the owners issued new lease agreements containing fines and fees for a number of measures that extend beyond what is allowable under state law, according to the lawsuit. The agreement lists $25 fees for party permits, along with parking and trash violation fees. The lease also includes other unspecified “service and labor fees,” even though state law only allows landlords to impose “incidental charges for services actually performed.”
Management and owners did not respond to Source New Mexico’s phone call or email Monday. Court records show the defendants have not yet responded to the lawsuit or been served summonses.
Neil Lobato, one of the plaintiffs, has lived in the park with his family for 16 years, he told Source NM. The affordable rent made it an attractive place to live, but that all changed with the abrupt and dramatic rent increase when the new company came in, he said. 
“I just know what they are doing is wrong,” he said. “People with money pushing around people that didn’t have money.”
Lobato faces eviction due to lack of payment, court records show. He’s tried to pay for the rent increase through a loan on his tax return. Moving would be expensive and would disrupt his 16-year-old’s school year, he said, among other issues.

“I’ve been stressing so bad,” he said, after “16 years and never having to worry about a place to live.”
The lawsuit seeks damages, attorney fees and court orders nixing the new rules, fees and leases, as well as injunctions preventing evictions of the defendants. According to the lawsuit, three have received eviction notices, and the others may soon. 
Riley Masse, attorney at the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit that the court should intervene to protect the rights of tenants at the mobile home park, since parks like the one in Aztec are the “backbone of affordable housing” in the state.
“These residents are long-time homeowners who contribute to the strength and character of Northern New Mexico,” Masse said. “This corporation is trying to exploit them with illegal rent increases and misinformation that preys on fear. But New Mexico law protects these families and says out-of-state park owners can’t bully residents out of their homes.”
The Center on Law and Poverty has recently pushed for reforms in the state Mobile Home Park Act, first enacted in 1983, including empowering the New Mexico Attorney General to enforce the act, create pathways for tenants to buy the mobile home parks where they live and increase funding for civil legal services to force compliance with the law.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/sanjuan-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-12-22 17:59:04.795544
,WyoFile,2025-12-22 22:47:11+00:00,WyoFile,"BLM deletes contested, off-limits ‘Golden Triangle’ parcels from upcoming Wyoming oil and gas auction",Mike Koshmrl,,,,,https://wyofile.com/blm-deletes-contested-off-limits-golden-triangle-parcels-from-upcoming-wyoming-oil-and-gas-auction/,"

Comments show significant opposition to leasing Wyoming wildlife habitat, including in migration corridors and near valuable sage grouse habitat.
The post BLM deletes contested, off-limits ‘Golden Triangle’ parcels from upcoming Wyoming oil and gas auction appeared first on WyoFile .","The Bureau of Land Management’s Wyoming office is shrinking its upcoming oil and gas auction by more than half, excising acreage that includes the contested leases in the vast, ecologically valuable sagebrush-steppe known as the Golden Triangle. 
In October, the federal agency generated major interest in its June quarterly lease sale by proposing to auction nearly 20,000 acres of an area that is closed to leasing, including a parcel squarely in the middle of the world’s longest mule deer migration path and within two miles of the largest-known sage grouse lek. 
But all those contested parcels ended up on the chopping block, BLM-Wyoming Acting State Director Kris Kirby told WyoFile. 
“What we were trying to do is show our work,” Kirby said. “We were trying to be as transparent as possible.” 
What happened, she explained, is that the BLM state office included the “whole list” of the “expressions of interest” from oil and gas companies and individuals when it was vetting the lease auction in the “scoping phase.” That included “parcels that can’t be leased,” she said.

Adding to the confusion, the federal government was shut down in the fall when the BLM was accepting comments about the auction, leaving employees unavailable to say why they were proposing to lease an off-limits area.
Leasing of the Golden Triangle isn’t allowed in the current Rock Springs plan — which designates it as the “South Wind River Area of Critical Environmental Concern” — but that plan is being revised on a tight timeline in deference to the Trump administration’s “Unleashing American Energy” orders. 
Federal officials pared down Wyoming’s second-quarter 2026 oil and gas auction well beyond removing the off-limits parcels. Between the proposal and the agency’s decision released last week, BLM downsized the area being offered from 227 parcels covering 250,931 acres to 112 parcels spread across 120,9267 acres.
Land was removed for many reasons, according to an environmental assessment the BLM released, but the single largest factor was “sage grouse prioritization,” which deferred 80 parcels. Ten Golden Triangle parcels were “deleted” because they’re located within an area closed to mineral leasing. 
Seven parcels were deleted because of conflicts with existing coal leases and seven others were snipped because they fell within Wyoming wildlife habitat management areas.
Yet, leases moving forward to auction aren’t devoid of controversy and overlap with valuable wildlife habitat.

The auction is positioned to offer oil and gas companies tens of thousands of acres within mule deer and pronghorn migration paths. That includes the designated corridors used by the Baggs, Platte Valley and Sublette mule deer herds, where there will be some protections and stipulations. Other parcels set for auction overlap with the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration, parts of which are being considered for protection. There’s also overlap with known-to-science, but unprotected routes, like the landscapes the Wyoming Range Mule Deer Herd migrates through.
In conjunction with its analysis, the state BLM released hundreds of maps illustrating wildlife habitat and its proximity to all the proposed parcels. 
The federal agency also released dozens of public comments received in response to its proposal, although most names were removed. The overwhelming majority of feedback encouraged the BLM to reconsider leasing within the Golden Triangle and within some migration corridors.

Muley Fanatic Foundation President Joey Faigl, whose co-founder departed for a Trump administration appointment, was among those making the request. 
“These parcels have remained free of oil and gas activity to this point, and introducing development now would be tragic,” Faigl wrote to the BLM. “I want to emphasize that this position is not a criticism of the oil and gas industry. My family has been supported by that industry for over 20 years. Rather, this is a call to thoughtfully consider where development is appropriate — and where wildlife must take priority.” 
An oil and gas industryman who’s been in the thick of the debate about leasing the Golden Triangle said he was “disappointed” that the BLM pulled back the contested parcels.
“Just because I think there are surface restrictions that can be applied that would still allow for development to occur,” said Steve Degenfelder, a landman for Casper-based Kirkwood Oil and Gas. 
Kirkwood holds existing oil and gas leases in that area, and it may get another shot at acquiring more. BLM’s revision to the Rock Springs plan is specifically geared toward updating “areas of critical environmental concern,” like the one in the Golden Triangle, which have precluded leasing for now. 
“The geology hasn’t changed,” Degenfelder said. “I’m convinced that surface stipulations can be put on leases that address environmental concerns.”

Photo: Anna Liz NicholsElection lawyers from both sides of the political spectrum said Monday that Michigan Secretary of Jocelyn Benson correctly declined to issue a declarative ruling on whether the major party’s endorsement conventions were constitutional.
However, the attorneys, in interviews with Michigan Advance, were split on whether the initial concerns of potential special-interest meddling in party decisions at those conventions – engaging in so-called bribery of delegates in the worst case scenario or pushing issue advocacy influence campaigns as a lesser evil – held water.
Benson issued a non-binding interpretative statement late last week in response to a request for a binding declarative ruling issued by Dennis Lennox, a longtime Republican communications consultant. Lennox asked Benson to rule on whether the Michigan Republican Party’s use of endorsement conventions early in an election year was constitutional, considering the party officially nominates candidates in a post-August primary nomination convention in the summertime.
Lennox also asked if delegates at the conventions were considered officials who are required to file financial disclosures and campaign statements, and if parties can require the earlier endorsement of the party as a prerequisite to attaining the nomination at the later summer conventions prior to the November election.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The issue stems from Michigan’s system of letting the respective parties decide their nominees for the offices of attorney general, secretary of state, the three larger university boards and candidates for the state Supreme Court bench. Those nominees are formally nominated in summer conventions following the August primary elections, where the parties will also formally nominate those candidates who won their respective primary races.
Endorsement conventions were established by the Michigan Democratic Party in 2010 as a way to get delegate consensus on who might be the nominees well before the post-primary convention, which gave those candidates a chance to court donors, delegates and potential voters much earlier in the cycle. The Michigan Republican Party followed suit and now both parties hold successive endorsement and nomination conventions in election years.
Secretary of State Benson, who is running for governor in the 2026 race, said it was outside the scope of her authority to rule on the constitutionality of endorsement conventions, mostly because her office was only granted authority to rule on election law matters as dedicated by the state’s Administrative Procedures Act.
On the other questions, Benson also declined to rule definitively, offering her office’s interpretation of existing law. Benson said a person is not a nominated candidate simply by being chosen at the endorsement conviction and would not have to file pre- or post-endorsement convention reports before or after that gathering. But they would have to create a candidate committee if they were established candidates vying for the nomination and must file other reports, like a January disclosure statement, as well as pre- and post-nominating convention campaign disclosures whether they were nominated or not.
2025.12.19 Lennox preliminary response
Benson, an attorney, also said it was her interpretation that precinct delegates are not statewide elected officers, and were not subject to the state’s campaign finance disclosure rules. The parties have different rules for who can be a delegate and how they are put in place to vote on party matters at convention, but they are not formally elected in statewide or local elections.
The Michigan Department of State rarely reconsiders interpretative statements based on public feedback, but the department said it would accept public comment on the draft statement issued Dec. 19, with a deadline of Dec. 30.
Lennox said he was disappointed that Benson did not issue a more declarative and formal decision on the constitutionality aspect, but was concerned that the interpretation of delegates not being subject to campaign finance reporting rules could lead to potential bribery of those delegates and a more widespread use of unregulated funds to curry their votes for specific candidates in the nomination hunt.
Candidates, Lennox surmised, could exploit Benson’s statements and outsource their early fundraising efforts to independent or dark money operations, muddying the waters in elections already awash in dark money.
“I am not trying to subject the internal workings of the Michigan Democratic Party or the Michigan Republican Party, who is on what committee or how those committees are elected, to regulation by the secretary of state, whomever that secretary of state of the day is, whether Republican or Democrat,” Lennox said. “But if they’re going to have conventions that nominate public offices, I believe that specific race, at that specific convention, should be subject to the Campaign Finance Act. I think it’s absurd to argue that you can bribe a precinct delegate and yet that’s what the secretary of state’s position is; that bribery of a precinct delegate is legal.”
Dennis Lennox
Lennox said his concern has some precedent, particularly on the Republican side, as it related to party members, candidates or outside interests meddling in party affairs through bribes. The Michigan Department of Attorney General declined to criminally charge former Michigan Republican Party Chair Ron Weiser for using MIGOP funds to pay former Shelby Township Clerk Stan Grot to withdraw his 2018 secretary of state bid.
“It’s not like this hasn’t happened before,” Lennox said. “What if Consumers Energy or DTE Energy, or the trial lawyers or Dow Chemical – insert boogeyman special interest here – decided to give $300,000 to somebody running for Supreme Court justice’s or attorney general’s convention fund to get their (choice) nominated? We would never know about it. For the good of the people, it’s an important question.”
Nessel won’t criminally charge Michigan GOP chair for ‘insidious’ $200K payoff

Lennox didn’t believe he had standing to take the issue before the courts, but said it was possible that a candidate could push the issue further if they wanted to take up the baton.
Mark Brewer, an election law attorney and a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, said that although the issue of dark money in elections was an ever-present concern, that concern wasn’t a symptom of disease brought on by the parties’ use of endorsement conventions.
“I think, at least from the Democratic side, that this is vastly overblown,” Brewer told the Advance. “First of all, these aren’t elections. … It’s a party function protected by the First Amendment to endorse candidates. Parties do that all the time, but in this case, it’s happening at a convention. You have all kinds of different ways that they endorse candidates.”
Brewer knows about the endorsement convention framework well – he was the person who established them for the Democrats in Michigan.
The question about disclosure, Brewer said, is already covered by its own separate disclosure regime.
“Candidates are going to have to file any reports come January, and then they’re going to have to file the reports before they’re actually nominated next summer,” Brewer said. “And if somebody drops out after an endorsement convention, they have to file a dissolution report and disclose all the money they’ve raised. I think that that’s really irrelevant to this. at least on the Democratic side, because nobody is elected to go to a convention.”
Brewer also mentioned the situation involving Weiser and Grot years prior, and said there was a state law that already covers the potential bribery of candidates. Attorney General Dana Nessel declined to press charges against Wesier, bucking the usual Michigan Republican Party talking point that Nessel made charging or legal decisions through political lens. But Brewer said he was disappointed with that decision from Nessel in 2021.
One of Lennox’s chief concerns revolved around dark money influencing donors, whether that money was raised through non-profit campaign funds supporting issues or candidates or stored in an independent bank account without any real oversight.
Brewer said those funds have filing obligations, too, and having an endorsement convention doesn’t change that.
“They could be doing that anyway,” Brewer said. “That would happen regardless of the endorsement convention; (the existence of that convention) hasn’t induced anybody to set up a 501(c)(4). … What we need, in that case, is disclosure all around, on issue advocacy money, etc. That’s a reporting problem not created by an endorsement convention.”
Bob LaBrant, a retired attorney who was the former general counsel to the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, also told the Advance that he doesn’t see much changing in terms of what delegates or candidates are allowed to do in terms of fundraising or whipping votes due to Benson’s statement.
“First of all, the contribution limits are unaffected,” LaBrant said. “We have election cycle limits. There are no contribution limit increases (as a result of Benson’s statement). This doesn’t have much impact on that. More importantly, the prohibited sources of contribution – corporations, labor unions and domestic dependent sovereigns – are still prohibited from using their own treasury funds to make contributions to a candidate.”
The idea that Benson’s ruling could lead to “wholesale bribery,” LaBrant said, remains to be seen.
That said, LaBrant does see a window of opportunity now for companies, with their own 501(c)(4) issue advocacy funds, to engage in contacts with precinct delegates to encourage them to vote a certain way at convention. He used the example of former Michigan Republican politician Gary Glenn, who claimed that dark money from monopoly utilities in Michigan aided in his primary defeat against current state Sen. Kevin Daley (R-Lum).
The Detroit News reported in 2018 that Glenn cited his hard-line stance against DTE and Consumers led to dark money front groups running issue advocacy campaigns during the cycle that painted his decisions as the chair of the House Energy Policy Committee in a negative light.
LaBrant said that could happen again.
“You can’t use words for express advocacy, but you can sure beat the hell out of someone like Gary Glenn, and if there’s some anathema in the attorney general’s race, they might try to exercise that,” LaBrant said. “The other thing that troubles me is the dark money into these pre-nomination conventions. … Would those (funds) try to involve themselves in the pre-endorsement convection activity? I suspect they might.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Facetune_24-08-2024-21-01-48-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-22 17:59:04.795544
,DC,2025-12-22 22:32:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump canceled temporary legal status for more than 1.5 million immigrants in 2025,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-canceled-temporary-legal-status-more-15-million-immigrants-2025,,"WASHINGTON — Since Inauguration Day, more than 1.5 million immigrants have either lost or will lose their temporary legal status, including their work authorizations and deportation protections, due to President Donald Trump’s aggressive revocation of legal immigration.It’s the most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history, experts in immigration policy told States Newsroom. The Trump administration curtailed legal immigration by terminating Temporary Protected Status for more than 1 million immigrants and ending Humanitarian Parole protections for half a million more individuals. “I don't think we've ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.  The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom. “Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful. “This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.Who is granted Temporary Protected Status?A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition. When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months. Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we're seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren't so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12. The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela. “We've never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care. Haiti, VenezuelaImmigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela – make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term. On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021 memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University. He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.Humanitarian Parole programSeparately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries. DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings. “The onslaught of attacks that we've been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA. Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country. But since the National Guard shooting last month in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national granted asylum, the program is under increased scrutiny and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted. Court decisions influentialThis is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS. During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance. “The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it's clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’” he said. So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program. Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.” “We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they're still left in this limbo,” she said. Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles. “For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said. “These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,"" she continued.TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.  “These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-22 17:59:04.795544

New Mexico Land Grant Council Program Manager Arturo Archuleta said the intent behind the legislation to strengthen relationships between the federal government and land grants is ensure the federal government takes traditional land uses into consideration, including livestock grazing, fuel collection, gathering of traditional herbs and community cemeteries. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)A federal bill introduced by U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) to strengthen federal and local land grant community cooperation in New Mexico passed through its first committee last week.
Luján introduced the New Mexico Land Grant-Mercedes Historical or Traditional Use Cooperation and Coordination Act in April to establish better communication and cooperation between the federal government — specifically the U.S. Department of the Interior and Department of Agriculture — with land grant communities and the New Mexico Land Grant Council. 
The council works as a liaison between land grant communities or pueblos and local, state and federal governments. New Mexico currently recognizes 27 land grant-mercedes under state law as “political subdivisions of the state.”
According to a statement from Luján’s office, the federal bill would require a memorandum of understanding between the two federal departments and the New Mexico Land Grant Council to “clarify agency processes that qualified land grant-mercedes may use” when seeking authorization for historical or traditional use of federal public lands. The bill also notes that the federal departments must communicate with tribes when the MOU is “entered into, extended, renewed or revised;” describes procedures to ensure land grant-mercedes, the council and tribes are able to contribute to agency land management planning decisions; and requires the DOI and USDA to “evaluate” the impacts of federal land use planning on historical or traditional uses of the land.
“I’m proud that my legislation to strengthen cooperation between the federal government and land grant communities, which are an essential part of New Mexico’s history and culture, has passed through committee and is one step closer to becoming law. These communities have cared for our land for generations, and preserving that connection is crucial for our land and cultural heritage,” Luján said in a written statement, adding that the bill will also help preserve the land and cultural traditions for the next generation.
New Mexico Land Grant Council Program Manager Arturo Archuleta told Source New Mexico that the council has worked with Luján on this legislation for over a decade, beginning when Luján was a U.S. representative. He said they have had success in the past with passing the bill through each chamber, but not with enough time to pass during the same Congress. 
“We’re hopeful now that it passed early on,” Archuleta said. “We still have a whole other year to hopefully get it to the floor of the Senate and over to the House.”
He said the bill’s intent is ultimately to ensure the federal government takes traditional land uses into consideration, including livestock grazing, fuel collection, gathering of traditional herbs and community cemeteries. 
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, is leading the legislation in the House of Representatives and said in the news release that “land grant communities represent farmers and ranchers, families, and elders,” who “care for and sustain our lands.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6213-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:59:04.795544

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Roughly 50,000 North Dakota households will pay nothing in property taxes for the 2025 tax year, but some county officials are concerned about how limiting property taxes will affect their budgets.
This year’s Primary Residence Credit program offers up to $1,600 per household in property tax relief for tax years 2025 and 2026, up from $500 per household offered in 2024. That zeroed out property taxes completely for about 30% of eligible households, Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a press conference last week.
“We know the legislation isn’t perfect, and there will be minor tweaks that are needed, but the impact is clear and unmistakable,” Armstrong said during the press conference.
The expanded subsidies were passed by the Legislature earlier this year as part of a property tax relief package, which at the time was estimated to cost $473 million. That bill also increased funding for a disabled veterans tax credit and a renters refund.
Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, said he hopes the program makes home ownership more affordable to first-time buyers.
“This may be the difference between buying a house and maybe renting,” Nathe, who sponsored the property tax relief package during the 2025 session, said.
In a random sample of 50 property tax statements across 15 counties, the state found the household had its property taxes reduced by 46%.
The Office of State Tax Commissioner received 145,000 applications for the credit for the 2025 tax year, which represented about 95% of eligible households.
The primary residence tax credit is paid for with earnings off the state Legacy Fund, so local governments don’t lose out on any tax revenue due to the program. The Legacy Fund, recently valued at $13 billion, invests a portion of the state’s oil and gas taxes.
The legislation also limits the amount local governments can raise property taxes each year at 3%. If a local government doesn’t use the full 3%, officials can tap into unused percentage increases for up to five years. The first time the cap will apply will be on 2026 property tax statements.
Applications for the 2026 residential property credit open Jan. 1 and close April 1.
The program is generally open to anyone who owns a home in North Dakota and lives there a majority of the time. Those unable to live in their homes for health reasons — like those residing in a rehabilitation center or nursing home — can also apply, as long as they’re not renting the residence out while they’re gone.
Homeowners can apply for the credit at tax.nd.gov/prc. Those who need help applying can call the Office of State Tax Commissioner at 701-328-7988.

Impact on counties
Many county officials are worried about how their governments will fare under the cap, said Donnell Preskey, government and public relations specialist for the North Dakota Association of Counties.
The association recently conducted a survey asking county commissioners and auditors how their budgeting process for 2026 was affected by the cap. Officials from 47 of North Dakota’s 53 counties responded, Preskey said.
In light of the cap, some county governments have had to tighten their budgets, Preskey said. That includes cutting pay increases for staff, delaying road projects and equipment purchases, and reducing funding for law enforcement, she said.
Survey respondents from 30 counties said their governments dipped into reserves to fund their 2026 budgets, she said. Of those 30, 12 increased property taxes by the full 3% allowable under the cap.
Notably, the tax cap doesn’t account for election costs, Preskey said. The 3% cap assumes year-to-year budgets for counties will be roughly the same, but counties must add in election expenses every other year — a significant line-item, she said.
Preskey said the Association of Counties may advocate for making election costs exempt under the 3% cap. 
She said the association may also push for exemptions for costs like health insurance for county employees.
“The counties have no control over how much that increases or not,” said Preskey.
Counties are also worried about expenses related to running jails, she added.
“Again, it’s a service to their areas that they have to provide, but yet they can’t control the costs that increase with it,” she said.
About 50% of survey respondents said they were not confident their county can meet the needs of their citizens in the next five years under the tax restrictions. Another 37.5% said they felt somewhat confident.

Lawmakers propose tax breaks to save New Jersey diners

Animal welfare activists have for years urged lawmakers to end these pet sales in a bid to stop the flow of ill or abused animals from puppy mills, commercial breeding facilities with poor conditions that can leave pet owners with surprise veterinarian bills.
The few remaining pet stores in New Jersey that still sell animals — there are fewer than 20 — have argued the ban is unnecessary because they do not source animals from disreputable breeders.
Supporters of the legislation said new limits are needed because pet stores continue to flout rules created by the Pet Purchase Protection Act, citing fines that the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs levied against eight pet stores in September, chiefly for failing to post documents and disclosures required by the law.
One of the eight stores, Oh My Dog in Kearny, was fined for procuring puppies from an unlicensed breeder.
“All of the humane organizations have been speaking with one voice here because it’s really important to stop the puppy-mill-to-pet-store pipeline and the inhumane practices of these commercial breeders,” said bill sponsor Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson).
Earlier this month, pet store owners told lawmakers that banning pet sales could force them to close. Similar legislation spurred some store closures in New York and California, which are among the eight American states that bar pet stores from selling some popular pets.
New York’s ban is one reason New Jersey is pursuing its own, said Mukherji, arguing the prohibition had led to some New York pet stores relocating across the Hudson River.
“New York beat us to it, and now that’s pushing the unconscionable commerce south of the border, and we should be standing up for New Jersey’s dogs, cats, and rabbits,” he said.
The legislation would fine pet stores that violate the ban on cat, dog, and rabbit sales $1,000 for each animal sold. If a store accumulates three violations, the bill would require courts to revoke its license.
And it would allow judges to permanently bar a pet store with three or more violations from operating in New Jersey.
Gov. Phil Murphy has expressed some support for limiting pet stores’ ability to sell dogs, cats, and rabbits. Speaking on News12 New Jersey Friday, Murphy said he supports the bill’s intent but stopped short of saying he would sign the measure.

authorities, has died in a Natchez, Mississippi, hospital. 
In the months leading up to his death on Dec, 14 , Rodriguez had been held in the Adams County Correctional Center, which is run by Core Civic Inc. 
Rodriguez is one of four immigrants who have died in ICE custody within a four-day period from Dec. 12 to Dec. 15. A spokesperson for ICE did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication of this story, and the warden’s office in the Adams County Correctional Center did not respond to a voicemail.
“On Dec. 4, 2025, Adams County Detention Center medical staff responded to an emergency medical call. During the emergency response, Rodriguez did not respond to staff and did not have a pulse,” a notification by Immigration and Customs Enforcement says. Rodriguez was then transferred to the Merit Health hospital in Natchez, where he died. 
An Enforcement and Removal ICE agent had arrested Rodriguez in Dillon, Colorado, on Sept. 25. 
Representatives of the Adams County Sheriff’s Department did not respond in time for publication when asked whether they are looking into Rodriguez’s death. 
Since 2018, Congress has required ICE to report all in-custody deaths within 90 days. ICE’s website shows 15 deaths until September 2025. The Washington Post reported that the total number of detainee deaths this year is 30. 
Jarvis Dortch, executive director of the ACLU of Mississippi, expressed concern about the recent deaths and conditions in ICE detention facilities across the country. 
“Detained individuals, the majority having no criminal record, are due humane conditions, proper medical care, and access to counsel and legal resources,” Dortch said. “This legal standard applies to federal actors as well as their partners in state and local law enforcement.” 
While the state of Mississippi and the state Legislature do not have jurisdiction over federal facilities such as the one where Rodriguez died, Rep. Robert Johnson, a Natchez Democrat, said some state lawmakers are planning to raise the issue of detention center conditions, for detainees and employees, once the next legislative session begins in January. 
“As a federal prison in a remote county, I don’t think it has the requisite amount of oversight and attention that it needs,” Johnson said about the Adams County facility. 
Among Democrats in Mississippi, Johnson said there has been “very little attention to that issue. Not because we don’t care, but we have some very serious and urgent issues that deal directly with the people that we represent right now.” 
ICE crackdowns in the South have increased in recent months, and there has been a ripple effect on immigrant communities in Mississippi, leading to fear and uncertainty. Some groups in the state, such as the Immigrant Alliance for Justice and Equity, El Pueblo and the Party for Socialism and Liberation have begun to organize in response. 
“The PSL here in Mississippi is dedicated mainly at the state level, ending the collaborative processes between federal agencies and our local law enforcement,” said Terron Weaver, a member of the Party for Socialism and Liberation. “Rodriguez’s death highlights  the carelessness that our politicians and law enforcement officers have approached implementing their agenda with. It is clear they don’t care for anyone’s health, or for due process.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/22153655/Screenshot-2025-12-22-at-1.22.02-PM.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Attorneys for Abrego Garcia would then be able to respond to the government next week, with a decision coming in the new year. Xinis expressed frustration with the Trump administration Monday, as she has throughout the monthslong case that has highlighted the nationwide crackdown on immigration.She said she would “happily” consider a lawful request from the administration to detain Abrego Garcia under a different section of law than the one she has already rejected. But the government has not given her the assurance that they would pursue a different authority to detain him again.“But the problem is, you want me to lift the (temporary restraining order) so that we don't know what's going to happen,” she said. “Why should I give the respondents the benefit of the doubt in this case? Why should I do that here? Show your work. That’s all.”DOJ lawyer Ernesto Molina objected to a restriction on the government’s ability to detain Abrego Garcia.“There's no period during which an alien cannot be detained under the appropriate circumstances,” he said.Move to Costa Rica?Abrego Garcia’s lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told reporters following the hearing that Abrego Garcia, who is married to and the father of U.S. citizens, would be with his family for the holidays.“As of right now, Mr. Abrego Garcia is going to return to his home with his wife and his children and his family members in Maryland,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said. “And he will be at home through Christmas and New Year.”Sandoval-Moshenberg also blamed the federal government for keeping Abrego Garcia in the country, rather than allowing him to self-deport to Costa Rica.Costa Rica has agreed to accept Abrego Garcia, who entered the United States without legal authorization in 2011. The Trump administration has rejected deportation to the Central American country, instead proposing he be removed to several African nations to which he has no relationship.Abrego Garcia “remains willing” to move to Costa Rica, Sandoval-Moshenberg told Xinis. If not for the government’s actions to pursue criminal charges in Tennessee and to reserve the right for future immigration enforcement in Maryland, Abrego Garcia would now be out of the country, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.“It's the government that's preventing him from doing so,” he said. “He's literally in a double bind. …. He's got two ankle bracelets.”Abrego Garcia after his deportation was imprisoned in a brutal prison in El Salvador and returned to the United States to face criminal charges in Tennessee stemming from a 2022 traffic stop. After he was ordered released from U.S. marshals’ custody by a federal judge, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained him again at an appointment at the Baltimore, Maryland, ICE field office.In mid-December, he was released from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania.

Jim Pillen talking at St. Teresa Catholic School in Lincoln on Sep. 29. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — On the same day the Greater Omaha Chamber released a report seeking updates to Nebraska business incentives, Gov. Jim Pillen announced plans Monday to restore funding to a state program that invests early in local startups.
Pillen’s proposal to restore funding to $15 million for the state’s Business Incentive Act — which provides seed capital for local businesses — reverses course on state money he previously proposed cutting. He originally proposed trims of $5 million a year and directed his Department of Economic Development to evaluate the program’s effectiveness.
Earlier this year, the Legislature accepted most of Pillen’s proposed cut. During budget negotiations, lawmakers restored about $1.25 million a year after statewide testimony from business leaders.
The state also briefly paused grants under the program late last year, spurring concerns from Nebraska’s startup community.
Research backs funding
Pillen on Monday said his team’s research now backs up what many in the business community had told him about the return on state investment, which strengthened his support for the program. 
One twist: He wants to shift the state support for the program from general funds to cash funds, which would help the state avoid increasing bottom-line spending tallies in a tight budget cycle. The “general fund” is the state’s main checkbook, mainly sales and income taxes.
Pillen said he wants the state to take a greater role in seeding such public-private partnerships with solid returns. The program returns nearly $6 private investment dollars for every $1 of state funds spent, he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A 2020 study of the program by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Bureau of Business Research found that the program’s investments had created more than 1,100 jobs at an average wage of $67,000.
“It’s important to continually assess the performance of any government program to ensure it is making good use of taxpayer dollars,” Pillen said. “We did so, and the result is that we are going to significantly enhance and strengthen this program.”
Chamber grateful
Heath Mello, president and CEO of the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, applauded the state’s embrace of the program. His group released a report this week calling on the state to modernize its business tax incentive programs, including this one.
The chamber and other business groups say the Omaha and Lincoln areas must grow faster if Nebraska wants to provide meaningful tax relief. They argue that growth needs state help.
“We have appreciated the governor’s willingness to collaborate on this issue,” Mello said in a statement. “Nebraska has seen an incredible ROI with this program and this expanded commitment will only accelerate that impact.”
Pillen did not directly address the chamber’s push to modernize state incentive programs. He has said previously that he does not want the state to fund what he believes private companies could do themselves.
The next legislative session starts Jan. 7.

July 16, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers has sued tech company Resideo alleging  “deceptive and unfair business practices,” saying that some of the video surveillance cameras that it sells risk to Nebraska consumers “ intimate images and private locations vulnerable to exploitation and intrusion by foreign actors.”
The 33-page lawsuit was filed in Lancaster District Court on Monday, and it claims the company has “deceptively marketed” security products that have “major security vulnerabilities,” including “deceptive statements and material omissions when advertising and selling products manufactured” by Chinese equipment makers Hikvision and Zhejiang Dahua Technology. 
The lawsuit alleges Resideo and its global distribution network, ADI, failed to disclose the vulnerabilities and national security risks associated with products made by the two Chinese companies. The lawsuit cited a British Broadcasting Corp. investigation that “showed that Hikvision engineers embedded backdoors which allowed unauthorized access to camera feeds.”

“When a company tells Nebraskans that their video cameras are private and secure, when in fact those cameras have known security flaws that tie back to the Chinese Communist Party, that is both a violation of state law and a national security risk,” Hilgers told Fox News. 
Hikvision and other Chinese surveillance equipment are banned from being used by federal agencies. The Federal Communications Commission pushed to tighten its restrictions on Chinese electronics due to national security risks. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said earlier this year that “internet-connected cameras made in China are giving the Chinese government the ability to conduct espionage or disrupt US critical infrastructure.” 
Resideo and Hikvision had no immediate comment. 
According to the Attorney General’s office, the lawsuit seeks to stop Resideo and ADI from misleading consumers and address the serious privacy and security risks posed by the cameras sold in Nebraska, and seeks injunctive relief, civil penalties and other relief for violations of Nebraska’s Consumer Protection Act and Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act.
Hilgers has sued other tech companies with ties to China, including Chinese e-commerce platform Temu and security camera manufacturer Lorex.

La administración Trump ha presentado una demanda para bloquear una nueva ley de California que prohibiría a los agentes federales usar máscaras durante su servicio. Esta ley surgió a raíz de la preocupación por el uso de máscaras y pasamontañas por parte de agentes de inmigración en Los Ángeles.


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Una serie de redadas de inmigración en California en 2025 tenían una cosa en común: la mayoría de los agentes federales que detenían a las personas llevaban máscaras cubriéndoles las caras.
En enero, el estado de California y su condado más grande prohibirán a los agentes del orden cubrirse el rostro, con algunas excepciones, lo que pondrá a la policía local y estatal en conflicto con los agentes de inmigración enmascarados.
La ley estatal ofrece a los agentes del orden una opción: si se cubren el rostro, pierden la posibilidad de invocar la “inmunidad cualificada”, la doctrina que protege a los agentes de la ley de la responsabilidad individual por sus actos. Esto significa que pueden ser demandados por agresión, lesiones, privación ilegal de la libertad, arresto injusto o procesamiento malicioso, y la ley añade una cláusula que establece que la pena mínima por cometer estos delitos con mascarilla es de 10.000 dólares.
 El asambleísta Mark González, demócrata de Los Ángeles y coautor de la ley, dijo que era necesario controlar a los agentes federales anónimos.
“Al principio teníamos entendido que solo se enfocaban a personas que no eran ciudadanas”, dijo González, “y luego, con el tiempo, te das cuenta de que no les importa quién eres, te atacan sin importar nada, sin el debido proceso”.
 La administración Trump ha interpuesto una demanda para bloquear el proyecto de ley, y más de un siglo de jurisprudencia federal la respalda. Un caso de la Corte Suprema de 1890 establece que un estado no puede procesar a un agente del orden público federal en el ejercicio de sus funciones.
 La administración Trump dijo en su escrito ante el Tribunal de Distrito de Estados Unidos para el Distrito Central de California que obligar a los agentes a revelar sus identidades los pondría en riesgo.
Durante las “acciones” de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas, “se puede escuchar a personas amenazando con revelar información personal y averiguar quiénes son los agentes y sus familiares y dónde viven”, afirmaron los abogados de la administración en el escrito del 17 de noviembre. “Incluso hay sitios web públicos que buscan y publican información personal sobre los agentes del ICE y otros agentes federales para acosarlos y amenazarlos a ellos y a sus familias”.
 Erwin Chemerinsky, decano de la Facultad de Derecho de UC Berkeley, afirmó que el asunto podría no ser tan claro como uno o dos casos de la Corte Suprema. Mencionó una decisión de 2001 del Tribunal de Apelaciones del Noveno Circuito que permitió que el caso de un francotirador federal que mató a una mujer durante el enfrentamiento de 1992 en Ruby Ridge, Idaho, fuera a juicio.
 “Básicamente, dice que un agente federal puede ser procesado penalmente por acciones irrazonables”, dijo Chemerinsky. “Los agentes federales, por su condición de agentes federales, no gozan de inmunidad ante todas las leyes civiles y penales estatales”.
 Brian Marvel, presidente de una organización que representa a los sindicatos policiales de California, afirmó que la ley dificultará la vida de los policías locales y los agentes del sheriff del condado. Las organizaciones que representan a jefes de policía, sheriffs, agentes de la Fiscalía General y oficiales de la Patrulla de Carreteras de California también se opusieron a la ley.
 “Creo que el estado nos ha puesto en una posición precaria con esta batalla que están librando con la administración Trump”, dijo Marvel, de la Asociación de Investigación de Oficiales de Paz de California. “No queremos estar en medio de esta pelea. Pero desafortunadamente, con el deseo de mayor reconocimiento y de ganar elecciones en 2026, decidieron crear cosas mucho más políticas y no orientadas a problemas legítimos de seguridad pública”.
 Marvel dijo que otro inconveniente de la ley es dar “una falsa sensación de esperanza a la comunidad inmigrante en California” de que la ley obligará a los agentes federales a abandonar el estado.
Los supervisores del condado de Los Ángeles también aprobaron una prohibición local del uso de máscaras por parte de las fuerzas del orden en las áreas no incorporadas del condado, una medida que entrará en vigor a mediados de enero, a menos que una decisión judicial llegue antes.
González señaló que las mascarillas han desempeñado un papel importante en la historia reciente de California. Primero, durante la pandemia , California impuso temporalmente el uso obligatorio de mascarillas en público y en el trabajo. Un par de años después, una oleada de robos con violencia se volvió más difícil de resolver porque todos los sospechosos llevaban máscaras . Ahora, California se encuentra en su tercer tira y afloja sobre el uso de mascarillas.
 La ley prevé exenciones para el uso de mascarillas N-95 o de grado médico para prevenir la transmisión de infecciones y permite que los agentes encubiertos utilicen mascarillas.
 “Esto está dirigido específicamente a los agentes federales porque tenemos que combatir estos secuestros de alguna manera”, dijo González, “y esta fue nuestra manera de entrar”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125-Socal-Raid-PR-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Photo by Getty Images),"After opting out of the program for two years, Iowa will participate next year in the federal summer feeding program for kids, which loads money for groceries on an electronic benefits card or EBT. (Photo via Getty Images)Eligible Iowa households can receive a monthly allotment to spend on certain food items at the grocery store throughout the summer now that Iowa plans to participate in the federal summer feeding program. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Monday the decision to participate in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s SUN Bucks, or Summer EBT, program, which the state has opted out of the past two years. 
Key to Reynolds’ decision to adopt the program for summer 2026 was the USDA’s approval of a waiver that would align the summer feeding program with the state’s changes to eligible foods under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
As it did for several other states, USDA approved a waiver in Iowa that prohibits SNAP recipients from spending their nutrition assistance allotments on sugary drinks, candy and other sweetened snacks. The Healthy SNAP program, as it is called in Iowa, takes effect Jan. 1.
“Food assistance programs that are nutrition focused do more to help low-income Iowans by addressing both hunger and health,” Reynolds said in the news release. “Now, with the USDA’s approval of our waiver to align the SUN Bucks program with Iowa’s new Healthy SNAP guidelines, we can provide healthy food plus convenience for children and families.” 
The SUN Bucks program distributes $40 each month during the summer, per child, to households that already participate in SNAP, are eligible for free and reduced-price school lunch or have a qualifying income. These funds are loaded directly to Electronic Benefit Transfer, or EBT, cards and can be used at authorized retailers. Under Iowa’s waiver, these funds cannot purchase the same sugary drinks and snacks that are not allowed under the state’s SNAP waiver. 
Reynolds said the SUN Bucks program has “lacked a focus on nutrition” which is why the state launched its own summer feeding program, Healthy Kids Iowa, last summer. 
Rather than loading funds on an EBT card, Healthy Kids Iowa provided qualifying households with a box of $40 worth of food each month during the summer. These boxes were packed and distributed by food banks and pantries around the state which reported some logistical challenges with the program. 
Advocates in the anti-hunger sphere in Iowa have been opposed to the state’s summer feeding program, arguing it left federal funding on the table and wasn’t as accessible to food-insecure Iowans. 
Paige Chickering, the Iowa state manager with Save the Children Action Network, said the Monday announcement to participate in SUN Bucks was unexpected, but “tremendously exciting.” 
“We’re really just overjoyed that this is being implemented in our state and that we’re following suit with so many other states across the country who are utilizing this fantastic hunger fighting program and ensuring that kids are getting the food that they need in the summer months,” Chickering said.
Feedback from Iowans 
In November, Chickering and volunteers submitted a petition to the state, with hundreds of signatures, urging it to participate in the SUN Bucks program. 
“We’re just massively excited that our advocacy efforts have really paid off,” Chickering said. “I think the governor has listened to what Iowans want to see, which is kids being fed in the summer months in a way that will be super accessible, easy, equitable, feasible for their families, and that’s what we get with Summer EBT.” 
The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services posted Monday the results of an evaluation of the Healthy Kids Iowa pilot program from the summer, as was required by the USDA waiver. 
More than 80% of Iowans who were surveyed and used the program said they were satisfied with the program, with the variety of food, the quality of food and the nutritional value of the food, according to the published evaluation. 
Despite satisfaction within the program, 57% of respondents said they would prefer the Summer EBT program instead of Healthy Kids Iowa. A quarter of respondents preferred the state program, according to the results. 
Chickering said the federally funded program has the capacity to serve 245,000 children across Iowa this summer. Results of the Healthy Kids Iowa program show it distributed boxes to more than 65,000 children. 
Regarding the Healthy SNAP restrictions on the Summer EBT funding, Chickering said her organization continues to believe that Iowans should “be able to make the right food choices for their families.” She said it is “not necessarily surprising” the state wanted to include the same requests it has made to USDA on other feeding programs. 
“Overall we really feel that the best possible choice we can make for Iowa’s children though is to be opting into the summer EBT program,” Chickering said. 
According to the release, enrollment and eligibility information will be available online early in the new calendar year.

The news, rumored for days, was greeted with shock and despair in Missouri, where hopes were high that a $1.5 billion incentives package approved by state lawmakers would be enough to keep the team in Arrowhead Stadium.
In the end, a much more lucrative package from Kansas won out.  
“This is a painful day for everyone in Missouri who loves our Chiefs,” said state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat. 
“A lot of us in Missouri, we feel like we’ve been incredibly loyal to the Chiefs despite all of the frustrations over decades,” Nurrenbern added. “We stuck with the Chiefs every step of the way. So this is so disappointing. I can imagine that Lamar Hunt today is rolling in his grave.”
Kansas City Chiefs will leave Missouri for a new stadium in Kansas

House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, echoed the disappointment, saying Missouri entered into stadium negotiations at a disadvantage. 
“I think money was part of it, but I think it’s also the opportunities available in Kansas,” Patterson said. “You know, Arrowhead can’t do a Super Bowl. Arrowhead can’t do a Final Four. If you have a dome stadium, those things are all possibilities, and I think that’s probably what ultimately led to the decision to move.”
Missouri wasn’t able to put its best foot forward, Patterson said, because “leadership was very fragmented.”
“Kansas leadership was very united and professional, and they just took advantage of a once in a lifetime opportunity,” he said, adding: “It would be deliciously satisfying to start pointing fingers, but I hope we can avoid that right now and just look forward.”
State Rep. Mark Sharp, a Kansas City Democrat, was not ready to be so magnanimous. 
He said years of bad decisions led to Monday’s news. Specifically, he pointed to former Jackson County Executive Frank White, who was recently removed from office after a recall vote. 
White, Sharp said in a social media post, “presided over a deeply dysfunctional and adversarial approach to our professional sports teams.” 
Sharp also cast blame on former Gov. Mike Parson for not responding to Kansas’ efforts to poach the Chiefs before leaving office and Kehoe for waiting until nearly the end of this year’s legislative session before presenting a stadium plan. 
“This crisis did not happen by accident,” he said. “It was the result of a series of preventable leadership failures.”
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, called it “legislative malpractice” that Kehoe waited until the final days of the legislative session in May to offer a counterproposal to Kansas. 
Kehoe said he remained hopeful throughout the process, and that negotiations with the Chiefs’ management continued into last week. His administration has been in constant communication with both the Chiefs and the Royals, and it wasn’t until Monday morning that he was informed by the Chiefs that the team was leaving.
“Harry Truman once said ‘The Buck Stops Here,'” Kehoe told reporters at a press conference. “It’s not fun to be at the top when something like this happens, but you certainly want to try to figure out what the lessons learned here are, and moving forward, we will obviously be doing a post mortem analysis.”
This is certainly a setback, Kehoe said, “but we’ll work together to recover.”
Jackson County Legislator Manny Abarca said he expects elected officials in the county, where the team is currently located, to take a closer look at how taxpayer money is spent during the remaining years of the Chiefs’ and Royals’ contracts to play at the Truman Sports Complex. Jackson County currently charges a ⅜-cent sales tax for stadium upkeep, generating millions a year.
“Honestly, at this point they’re like a bad ex-girlfriend. They won’t go away,” Abarca said of the Chiefs. “And so the reality that they want to try and go play second fiddle in Kansas and try and lure a deal that’s not written down on paper, good luck to them, best of luck. At this point, our taxpayers in Jackson County deserve a whole lot better commitment than what we’re getting.”
The Chiefs’ decision is “incredibly disappointing, said state Sen. Patty Lewis, a Kansas City Democrat. But it’s also a symptom of a larger problem. 
“There are no winners in a border war, just losses on both sides,” she said. “Companies moving back and forth across the state line to reap massive tax breaks while creating no real net job growth is bad for families, bad for the region and bad for both states.”
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, was among the lawmakers who openly opposed the incentives package for the Chiefs and Royals when it passed the legislature this summer.
“Don’t want to say ‘I told you so,’ but I warned the legislature this would happen just as it did with the Rams,” he said.
Schroer said he will be filing legislation this week “to get rid of the asinine classification of the Chiefs as Missouri’s official NFL team as it was passed just a few sessions ago. Similarly I will be getting rid of the asinine ‘handshake’ border-war resolution which says we will play nice with our neighbors next door.”
The Chiefs lease on its Kansas City stadium, which has been the team’s home since 1972, will expire after the 2030 season. 
Missouri governor signs Kansas City stadium funding, St. Louis disaster aid

Missouri lawmakers reconvened during a special legislative session this summer to approve a spending package that would have allocated state taxes collected from economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman to bond payments for renovations at Arrowhead and a new stadium for the Royals in Jackson or Clay counties.
Estimated at just under $1.5 billion over 30 years, the funding would pay for half the costs — compared to 70% in Kansas — and included a requirement for additional local government financing. 
The Royals first announced an intention to leave Kauffman Stadium in November 2022. The move was pitched as a way for the Chiefs to remain in Arrowhead, demolish Kauffman and build a covered entertainment center.
Officials in Jackson County and Kansas City began scrambling to figure out how to keep the Royals from leaving Missouri. By the spring of 2023, Clay County leaders announced interest in building a stadium in North Kansas City that could become the Royals new home. 
The Royals solicited proposals for a downtown Kansas City and North Kansas City site a few months later, and released renderings of possible stadiums at both locations in August 2023. 
Soon after, a poll was leaked to the media showing 70% of Clay County voters opposed a new sales tax to fund a stadium in North Kansas City. Despite weeks of media speculation, no one claimed credit for the poll, which was widely seen as an attempt to shake the confidence of Royals ownership in the viability of a Clay County proposal. 
Critics, who called the survey a “push poll” meant to deceive the public, decried the move at the time, arguing that sabotaging any potential Missouri site would increase the chances one or both teams end up in Kansas.
It wasn’t until more than a year later that documents provided to The Independent revealed it was a political action committee formed to support Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas that paid for the Clay County polling. A staffer using a Lucas campaign email address requested the poll be commissioned, and his top aide obfuscated the spending by requesting it be referred to in disclosures as “research” instead of “polling.”
Jackson County voters were eventually presented with a proposed sales tax increase to fund a Royals stadium in Kansas City. Lucas threw his support behind the measure, but it was resoundingly rejected by voters. 
The failed push to pay for a new Royals stadium in Missouri left the door open for Kansas lawmakers, who quickly put their own package of incentives together to lure the teams across the state line. 
Lucas said negotiations with the team ran up until last week, and that the offer Missouri put forward was “very fair, but very responsible.” He worked closely with the governor and other local and state officials, and that work will continue as Missouri strives to keep the Kansas City Royals from leaving as well.
“While the Chiefs aren’t going far away, and aren’t gone yet, today is a setback for a Kansas Citian, a former Chiefs season ticket holder and a lifelong Chiefs fan,” he said.
As Missouri mourns the loss of the Chiefs, the fate of the Royals remains in flux.
The team is rumored to be eyeing a new stadium in Overland Park, Kansas. Lucas said Monday his hope is for a downtown baseball stadium, while other Missouri officials continue pushing for a North Kansas City site.
Nurrenbern and Patterson both said that, as far as they were aware, negotiations with the Royals are still ongoing.
News of the Chiefs decision to leave Missouri comes almost exactly 10 years after the state lost the St. Louis Rams. 
Then-Gov. Jay Nixon was pushing for a $1 billion plan to build a new St. Louis stadium for the Rams, much to the chagrin of the legislative leadership. 
Both sides tussled in the media and the courts, but the fight between the Democratic governor and GOP-dominated General Assembly fizzled after the Rams announced an intention to move to Los Angeles two days before the 2016 legislative session began. 
NFL owners overwhelmingly agreed to let them do it soon after.

Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office on Monday unveiled a budget recommendation for the upcoming fiscal year that includes increased spending for universal child care, along with additional funding to compensate for federal cuts.","Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham gestures during her State of the State address on Jan. 21, 2025. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office on Monday unveiled a budget recommendation for the upcoming fiscal year that includes increased spending for universal child care, along with additional funding to compensate for federal cuts.
Lawmakers will convene for 30 days in Santa Fe beginning on Jan. 20 to craft a budget for the upcoming fiscal year.
The governor’s $11.3 billion budget recommendation represents a $502.8 million increase over the budget for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. During a news conference, Lujan Grisham’s chief of staff and several cabinet secretaries attributed the proposed increased spending largely to the governor’s universal childcare initiative, as well as funding changes related to HR1, commonly known as Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
The proposed budget calls for an additional $160.6 million for the state Early Childhood Education and Care Department’s universal childcare program, which began in November. That brings the overall cost of childcare to $606.4 million, according to the executive budget recommendation.
“Even as we confront unprecedented federal funding challenges, we remain in the strongest financial position in state history. This budget puts that strength to work for families, students and communities across New Mexico,” Lujan Grisham, who’s entering her final year as governor, wrote in a statement. “I look forward to working with the Legislature to pass a budget that reflects our shared values.”
Under the proposed budget, the state would keep about $3.4 billion in reserves.
“We feel strongly that this is a responsible budget. We have seen massive increases over the years. This is definitely slowing down from those,” said Daniel Schlegel, Lujan Grisham’s chief of staff. “Thirty percent reserves, I’d reiterate, is a very big cushion for us moving forward.” 
State spending is often categorized as “recurring” — creating new staff positions at state agencies or paying for employee health care premiums — and “non-recurring” — one-time expenses like road construction projects. The slowed growth reflected in the proposed budget primarily affects recurring spending.
State economists earlier this month briefed lawmakers on the state’s economic outlook. They said New Mexico is “treading water,” while much of the nation is in or near a recession, and attributed the stalled revenue to lower oil prices and corporate income taxes codified in HR1. They also predicted further revenue declines amid federal cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP.
“My expectation is that the Legislative Finance Committee will come in a little bit lower than this budget, which happens pretty much every year,” Schlegel said. “We’ve been driving toward universal childcare and universal pre-K since the start of this administration, and that’s no secret. That’s something that we have as a shared priority with the Legislature. I think that figuring out a way to fully fund it is going to require some creativity between us and the Legislature.”
He said the governor’s staff believe the program should fall under recurring spending as a top priority for the state, but said he expects “productive negotiations” in the 30-day session around finding ways to consistently fund it into the future. 
Sales taxes are expected to be the state’s largest source of general fund revenue next fiscal year at $5.5 billion, according to the proposed budget. 
Schlegel acknowledged the challenges that come with the slowed growth, but said the state remains in a strong position to spend on non-recurring projects.
He offered the governor’s 50-year Water Action Plan, which Lujan Grisham announced last year amid reports that the state’s water supply will decline by up to 25% in the coming decades, as an example. Monday’s budget recommendation would devote $232 million across several state agencies in non-recurring spending to implement the plan. That $232 million would go toward restoration programs in the New Mexico Environment Department, the Office of the State Engineer’s Water Rights Settlement Funds, programs aimed at conserving water in agriculture at New Mexico State University and more.
The budget proposal includes $57 million to implement a wage scale and career mobility framework in the childcare, early intervention and prekindergarten workforce across the state. It also recommends directing $16.5 million to the Children, Youth and Families Department’s Juvenile Justice Service Division because of the increased number of children detained across the state.
It also includes a recommendation to spend $13.5 million on public safety pay raises that would apply to law enforcement personnel and fire response hotshot crews. The governor’s office previously confirmed to Source NM that public safety will be on her legislative agenda in January.
 


				The budget also calls for $1.7 billion in spending on non-recurring projects, including: 

$200 million for the Federal Reimbursement Revolving Fund, which helps to pay for responses to natural disasters
$100 million to select, acquire and build a new State Fairgrounds, if necessary
$100 million for State Fairgrounds revitalization projects
$100 million for statewide road construction and maintenance projects
$65 million for statewide affordable and attainable housing initiatives 
$65 million for the Strategic Water Supply Fund
$60 million to the New Mexico Match Fund, which helps New Mexico locales leverage federal grants 
$49.3 million for the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative
$45 million for statewide homelessness initiatives
$38.5 million for career and technical education
$35 million Indian water rights settlements
$30 million for a reading intervention program
$25 million for a health professional loan repayment program
$22.5 million for complying with the terms of a settlement agreement in a lawsuit over the Rio Grande’s water supply
$22 million for aquifer monitoring

(Photo by mirror-images/Getty Images)Jefferson County is the target of a federal lawsuit involving allegations of slander, unfair hiring practices, electronic eavesdropping and paramedics having sex in the county’s ambulance barn.
Former county paramedic Judy Heisel is suing Jefferson County Attorney Chauncey Moulding, Jefferson County Ambulance Service Medical Director Dr. Amanda Moreno, former county supervisor Dee Sandquist, and county supervisors Lee Dimmitt and Susie Drish.
Court records indicate that in October 2023, Jefferson County created a public ambulance service to provide residents with emergency medical services. In May 2023, the board hired Heisel as the county’s ambulance service base manager with a starting salary of $65,000. Heisel then reported to Ambulance Director Brian Thomas, who earned $85,000 at the time. In April 2024, Thomas resigned and Sandquist asked Heisel if she would step into the role as interim director.

The lawsuit alleges that on April 29, 2024, Heisel became aware that EMT Damien Wimmer of the Jefferson County Ambulance Service had engaged in conduct outside his scope of practice and that she immediately reported the violation to Jack Reed of human resources and to Moreno, the medical director. Wimmer was then suspended for two weeks, according to the lawsuit.
Moreno allegedly assured Heisel she would take care of reporting the matter to state regulators with the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of EMS.
According to the lawsuit, Wimmer, while working as a Libertyville first responder in May 2024, again engaged in EMS work that fell outside his scope of practice.
Heisel alleges she reported that incident to Reed and Moreno, as well as the state’s regional EMS coordinator.
Shortly thereafter, Heisel allegedly learned that Moreno had not formally reported the first incident with Wimmer to DHHS as required. On June 21, 2024, Heisel reported both incidents and Wimmer was terminated as an EMT with Jefferson County Ambulance Service the same day. The lawsuit alleges Wimmer and Moreno “have been close friends for several years.”
The lawsuit claims Moreno did not want Heisel to be hired as ambulance director due to Heisel’s reporting of Wimmer’s conduct.
State disciplinary records indicate Wimmer had been previously sanctioned for exceeding his authorized scope of practice. In November 2013, the bureau issued Wimmer a letter of warning for representing himself as a paramedic while certified as a less-qualified EMT.
In March 2014, Wimmer was alleged to have exceeded his scope of practice by initiating an intravenous line on a patient, and attempting to do so on a different patient. The bureau suspended his certification for one month and placed it on probation until April 2017.
In November 2015, he was again accused of using an intravenous line on a patient, exceeding his scope of practice. As a result of those allegations, the bureau suspended his license for two months and again placed it on probation for two years.
State records indicate the bureau has taken no public action against Wimmer as a result of the 2024 allegations.
Allegations of sex in the workplace 
According to Heisel’s lawsuit, Supervisor Sandquist appointed Moreno and Reed to serve on the “hiring committee” to fill the position of ambulance director. Heisel was the only internal applicant for the job, the lawsuit alleges.
On June 20, 2024, Sandquist, Reed and Moreno conducted, via Zoom, Heisel’s first interview for the ambulance director’s position.
Four days later, Supervisor Dimmitt, while in Heisel’s office, had a phone conversation with Supervisor Drish, about the hiring process, with Drish on speakerphone so Heisel could participate in the conversation.
According to the lawsuit, Supervisor Dimmitt expressed frustration with the hiring process, claiming Sandquist did not tell her fellow supervisors who any of the outside applicants were, and Dimmitt and Drish each voiced support of Heisel.
On June 26, 2024, Heisel’s second interview took place with Moreno allegedly participating via Zoom due to her being at the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri, vacationing with the recently fired Wimmer, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleges that about 30 minutes into the interview, Moreno stated that nobody was addressing “the elephant in the room,” which she described as the “internal Dumpster fire” that was the ambulance service.
According to the lawsuit, Moreno then asked Heisel specifically what had happened with Brian Thomas, the former ambulance director, and then clarified that she was “referring to Heisel having sexual relations with Thomas.”
In her lawsuit, Heisel alleges she responded by stating that she was not going to discuss her personal life, to which Moreno replied the issue wasn’t her personal life but that Thomas had been her boss.
Moulding, the county attorney, allegedly advised the board members it was their interview and they could ask whatever questions they deemed appropriate, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit states a heated discussion between Dimmitt and Moreno ensued, during which the medical director said the county was being put at risk, adding that she’d “heard that Heisel and Thomas were having sex in the ambulance building,” and that people were telling her that Heisel was abusing prescription drugs.
“Dr. Moreno said something like we can’t have people abusing prescription substances or being put on EKGs and getting IVs at work — all in reference to Heisel,” the lawsuit states.
Electronic eavesdropping charges filed
On July 11, 2024, Reed, from human resources, allegedly had a phone conversation with Heisel in which he stated Moreno had opened up a floodgate of potential liability for Jefferson County based on the statements she had made during the second job interview.
The board subsequently voted to offer the ambulance director job to one of the outside candidates, Josh Hemminger, who accepted the offer and was hired at a salary of $85,000.
Immediately after an Aug. 5, 2024, meeting that formalized Hemminger’s hiring, the lawsuit alleges, county officials made “a theoretical job offer” to Heisel, although it did not provide her with the proposed job title, duties or pay and told her she had to accept the offer immediately or she’d no longer be employed.
“The county then presented her with severance paperwork, suggesting that the offer of employment was not bona fide,” the lawsuit claims. “Heisel rejected the severance package,” and Moulding indicated she should “pack up her belongings and leave that very day.”
According to the lawsuit, a few hours after Heisel left the county’s ambulance building, Fairfield police were dispatched to the building on a report of destruction of property. Moulding allegedly informed the officers the county’s information-technology staff had notified him there had been a network intrusion of the computers at the ambulance building. It was reported that computers appeared to be “factory reset,” resulting in the loss of all the information storied on the computers.
No one was arrested as a result of the police complaint, the lawsuit alleges.
On Aug. 13, 2024, a formal complaint was filed with the Iowa Public Information Board alleging the board violated Iowa’s Open Meetings Law when two of the three county supervisors discussed the hiring process on June 24, 2024.
Attached to the complaint was an audio recording of the phone conversation, which IPIB forwarded to Moulding, the county attorney.
The IPIB complaint was then resolved with an “informal resolution” in which the parties agreed the county could be found in violation of the law. According to the lawsuit, Moulding then signed an affidavit alleging Heisel had recorded her end of the Aug. 5, 2024, discussion about her future with the county in violation of Iowa law, then forwarded that affidavit to the Washington County Attorney’s Office for consideration of criminal charges.
The lawsuit claims that in his affidavit, Moulding alleged Heisel was asked to show Hemminger around the building, at which point the two left the ambulance director’s office. Moulding, Drish and an assistant county attorney allegedly remained in the director’s office where, at some point, Moulding noticed Heisel had left her cell phone on her desk. Moulding allegedly waved his hand above the phone, activating the screen, which indicated the conversation in the room was being recorded.
In January 2025, Fairfield police criminally charged Heisel with felony interception of communications and misdemeanor electronic and mechanical eavesdropping. On June 6, 2025, a jury found Heisel not guilty of both charges.
Heisel’s lawsuit, which was recently transferred from state court to federal court, seeks unspecified damages for alleged slander, malicious prosecution and abuse of process, as well as alleged violations of the Iowa Civil Rights Act through gender discrimination, Iowa’s law prohibiting retaliation against employees for engaging in protected activity, and Heisel’s Fourth Amendment rights as it relates to the county attorney’s actions with her phone.
The county has yet to file a response to the allegations. The county’s attorney in the matter, Holly Corkery, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)I wear many hats every day. I’m a social worker, a mom raising two young children, an adult daughter with a parent living in a nursing home, and a public health advocate. Each of those roles shapes how I see the world — and all of them leave me deeply concerned about what’s happening right now with vaccine access in Louisiana.
I think about my kids when I send them to school, trusting that the adults around them have done what they can to keep classrooms safe. I think about my mother, living among other vulnerable elders, relying on the protection that comes from a community doing the right thing. And in my work as a social worker, I see suffering compounded by social determinants of health like access to resources, poverty, racism, and health disparities that are often out of people’s control. When missed days at work or an unexpected hospital bill already means the difference in being able to make ends meet, we don’t need to thrust a preventable disease into the mix.
Right now, our collective protection against preventable diseases is weakening. Vaccination rates are dropping, and growing confusion and hesitation are leaving our communities exposed. When our communities aren’t protected, these illnesses can spread quickly and cause serious harm, especially to babies, seniors, and people with compromised immune systems.
Vaccines remain one of the safest and most effective tools we have to protect one another. But routine vaccination rates are falling, and that should concern all of us. In 2025 alone, over 1,600 cases of measles have been reported nationwide – the most documented cases in three decades. Nationwide, only 92.5% of kindergarteners received measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine for the 2024-2025 school year. This rate falls below the critical 95% threshold needed for community protection.
Here in Louisiana, the percentage of vaccinated kindergartners has fallen from 96% for the 2020–21 school year to only 91.65% for the 2024-25 school year. Only 64% of Louisiana children under age 2 had completed the full recommended seven-vaccine series in 2024. Adult vaccination rates have also not rebounded, leaving gaps in protection across entire communities.
This past May, 42 Louisianans – 75% of whom were not up to date on their immunizations – were hospitalized for whooping cough. More than two-thirds of those hospitalized were children under a year of age. By the end of September, there were over 387 cases reported in the state. It’s clear we need to take serious action to get Louisiana residents and families caught up on vaccines.
Louisiana is currently leading the nation in flu cases. With vaccine uptake already low and continuing to decline, we face increased infections, hospitalizations, and deaths — along with the very real risk of overwhelming our healthcare system.
According to the CDC, only 28.8% of Louisiana children ages 6 months to 17 years have received a flu vaccine this season, compared to 40.8% nationally. Among adults, just 37.9% are vaccinated, still below the national average of 41.9% and far short of what’s needed to prevent serious outcomes. As of Dec. 6,, the U.S. has already recorded an estimated 2.9 million flu illnesses, 30,000 hospitalizations, and 1,200 deaths — well ahead of last year’s pace.
Declining vaccination rates are being worsened by shifting and confusing federal guidance about which vaccines are recommended and when. Just this month, a federal advisory committee reversed long-standing guidance on the hepatitis B birth dose, ending a universal policy that had reduced infant infections from 20,000 cases per year to fewer than 20. This reversal sends a troubling signal and underscores the need for strong state and local leadership.
When vaccination levels fall below what’s needed for community protection, diseases once kept in check return. We are already seeing this across the country with a surge in measles cases. In Louisiana, dozens of people — most of them infants too young to be fully vaccinated — have been hospitalized with whooping cough. These children relied on the rest of us for protection.
Conflicting guidance has left many families unsure about how, when, or where to get vaccinated. That uncertainty makes clear, science-based state policies more important than ever — policies that expand access to vaccines rather than create new barriers.
The good news is that people across our state, regardless of political affiliation, have been clear about their strong support for vaccination. According to a recent survey, more than two-thirds of Louisiana voters believe childhood vaccines are essential and provide significant health benefits. More than 80% support policies like making vaccines easy to access at local pharmacies and fully covered by insurance. Louisiana families want to protect their health – our state leaders should make that easier, not harder.
Taking care of our neighbors is a core Louisiana value. We show up after hurricanes, bring food when someone is sick, and check on our elders. Vaccination is another way we live out that commitment — quietly, responsibly and with care.
Families should talk with trusted healthcare providers about recommended vaccines. But individual action alone is not enough. We also need strong leadership and clear policies to ensure vaccines are available, affordable, and accessible. Without decisive action, preventable diseases will continue to spread, and more Louisianans will suffer unnecessary harm.
We cannot afford to move backward. Vaccines have protected our communities for decades, saving lives and keeping families whole. Keeping Louisiana healthy will take all of us — parents, caregivers, healthcare providers, and lawmakers — working together to protect our neighbors, ourselves, and our future.

NE23 provides the opportunity for U.S. military personnel to sharpen their skills; to practice tactics, techniques, and procedures; to improve command, control and communication relationships; and to develop cooperative plans and programs. (U.S. Air Force photo by Capt Lindsey Heflin)The United States is currently building a fleet of at least 100 B-21 Raider bombers at a cost of $692 million each. 
According to the Air Force, “The B-21 will form the backbone of the future Air Force bomber force consisting of B-21s and B-52s. Designed to operate in tomorrow’s high-end threat environment, the B-21 will play a critical role in ensuring America’s enduring airpower capability.”
OK, fine, but I have a modest proposal. Would 99 B-21 Raider bombers do? I don’t know how the Air Force arrived at the determination that they need at least 100 of these bombers, but could they get by with a minimum of 99? That’s just one less bomber. 
Perhaps a high-level Air Force fellow might agree and say:
“You know, we really only need 99 B-21 Raider bombers to ‘ensure America’s enduring airpower capability.’ After all, in 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower said, “Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.” We could save $692 million by producing one less bomber and give it back to the people who paid for it. We’ll start with the people of Alaska and see how it goes.”
And so the good governor of Alaska would unexpectedly get a check in the mail for $692 million, including a short note from a highly-placed fellow in the Air Force extending the denizens of Alaska his best wishes. Now what?
We have a few issues in Alaska that could benefit from $692 million. How about day care for example. In 2023 the Alaska Child Care Program Office Conducted a market price survey report. They ultimately surveyed a bit over half of the known 443 child care providers in the state. The survey found that these providers had around 8,900 kids in child care or on the waitlist. 
In addition the surveyors found that the average annual cost of licensed day care was about $11,600. Because the survey only used a bit over half the providers, let’s say it missed about half the kids and call it 18,000 children in daycare or on the wait list. So, it would cost about $208,800,000 to pay for day care for every child in Alaska. Yeah, I know this is very back-of-the-envelope but, still, that bomber could pay for child care for every Alaskan kid that needed it for several years. An excellent use, in my humble opinion, of one less bomber. 
Or how about housing. According to the Builders Patch Housing Count for 2024, Currently, the state is short over 6,737 low-income housing units. In addition, the 2024 Point-in-Time count, a federally mandated one-night snapshot, identified 2,686 people experiencing homelessness across the state of Alaska. So, back of the envelope, let’s say we need about 9,000 housing units for low-income families and homeless persons. 
Based on recent purchases in Anchorage, the per-unit cost for hotel conversions averages approximately $65,000 per unit. And tiny homes cost about $50,000 each to set up in Anchorage. So, using the conservative figure of $65,000 per unit, one less bomber could buy 10,646 economy apartments or tiny homes. That’s enough to solve both the low-income housing and the homeless housing shortages in Alaska for a full year and then some.
Finally, a quick word on a free college education for Alaska residents. The annual cost for an undergrad in the UA system is around $24,400 including tuition, fees, double room, and meals. In the fall of 2024 about 18,800 students registered. One less bomber would pay all expenses for all those students plus another 9,560 students who may have been too discouraged to apply because they couldn’t scrape up the cash. 
These are illustrations of the very real benefits Alaskans could achieve if the Air Force built just one less bomber. Perhaps we could paraphrase the Air Force statement and say that this never-built bomber “will play a critical role in ensuring Alaska’s enduring civilian capability.”

Frank)A Lewis and Clark District Court judge has ruled that Montana’s current wolf hunting and trapping season can continue, despite several conservation organizations submitting a petition to halt the season they allege could spell disaster for the state’s wolf population. 
The decision on Friday by Judge Christopher Abbott came down against the conservation organizations that had sought an injunction against the state, arguing that the statewide harvest quota of 458 wolves is too high, threatens the survival of gray wolves in Montana and violates the state constitution. 
“We are deeply disappointed that Montana’s wolf eradication agenda will continue,” Lizzy Pennock, carnivore coexistence attorney at WildEarth Guardians, said in a statement. “Wolves, and anyone who values them and the ecosystems they support, will pay the price. While we lost this battle, our lawsuit is far from over, and we will not stop fighting to protect this essential, intelligent wildlife.”
The emergency petition seeking an injunction was filed this fall against Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and the Fish and Wildlife Commission, which sets department policies and regulations. Conservation groups WildEarth Guardians, Project Coyote, Footloose Montana, and the Gallatin Wildlife Association argued against the increased wolf quota as the latest part of a larger ongoing lawsuit about the state’s management of the species. 
A spokesperson for FWP said that the department does not comment on ongoing litigation.
Also this fall, a pair of Republican lawmakers and two sportsmen’s organizations filed an opposing lawsuit in Sanders County arguing that the state was not complying with laws intended to reduce the wolf population and should raise the quota. The sportsmen’s organizations filed as intervenors in the petition over hunting quotas Abbott ruled on last week, but their other suit is still pending.
The latest court action is a continuation of arguments that played out during the 2025 legislative session — and statewide for more than three years — pitting legislators and advocates for reducing the state’s population of roughly 1,100 wolves against those seeking to preserve and protect the species. 
At the heart of the most recent legal action are the 2025 wolf hunting and trapping regulations, adopted by the Commission in August, which set a statewide harvest quota of 452 wolves, plus two additional three-wolf quotas for hunting areas outside Yellowstone National Park. An additional 100 wolves are authorized for removal by the department for cases of conflict with livestock or humans.
Hunters and trappers killed 297 wolves last season, while the most killed in a season was 326 during 2020. The quota for wolf harvest has not been met by hunters and trappers in recent years. A total 348 wolves were killed through hunting and trapping or management removals in 2024.
According to FWP’s latest population survey, there are an estimated 1,091 wolves in Montana, a dozen fewer than the 2023 population estimate and slightly lower than the 10-year average of 1,138 wolves. 
The state population of wolves is a major point of contention in the lawsuit filed by the conservation groups. 
State wildlife managers use an “integrated patch occupancy model,” or iPOM, methodology to determine wolf abundance. The method has drawn criticism from some researchers who say it is an inexact count based heavily on wolf sightings by hunters, as well as from traditional field work. 
Conservation groups have often said relying on iPOM greatly overestimates population numbers, and therefore a high mortality rate due to hunting and trapping could have a greater impact on wolf numbers than anticipated. 
Although the judge said the quota could stand, he also raised questions about the state’s methods for determining wolf numbers.
“The court decision also underscored that serious and valid questions exist about the reliability of how the Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP) estimates wolf populations, and that these problems could potentially result in inadequate protection of Montana’s wolves over time,” according to a press release by the plaintiffs. 
The conservation organizations have been battling the state through the court system since 2022 over the state’s management of wolves and the hunting and trapping regulations. 
In seeking an injunction against the latest iteration of regulations — with the increased wolf quota — the plaintiffs used a claim that increased wolf killing infringed on the state’s constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment. 
But the state, and sportsmen’s groups that intervened in the suit, argued that a clean and healthful environment “does not reach wildlife regulation.”
Abbott agreed with the conservation organizations, saying that it is likely “wolves are sufficiently integral to the ecosystem that their continued existence at a level sufficient to sustain their population in perpetuity and positively contribute to the ecosystem forms part of the ‘environmental life support system’ of the state as contemplated by the Constitution.”
However, he also wrote that the plaintiffs had not successfully argued that wolves “are on the verge of irreparable injury based on current estimated numbers,” and halting the current hunting and trapping regulations could cause harm to individuals and businesses that have made plans for the season. 
The conservation organizations, in a press release, said that denying the emergency petition will “allow the state to kill over half the estimated wolf population.” 
“Although this ruling is a severe setback for Montana’s magnificent wolves, the resulting slaughter will only strengthen our ongoing case for the protection of this vital species,” said Connie Poten, board chair of Footloose Montana. “The fight for wolves is deep and broad, based in science, connection, humaneness and necessity. Wolves will not die in vain.”
While the request for an injunction was denied, Abbott did allow the conservation groups to amend a previous complaint to allege the state’s 2021 wolf statues and regulations also infringe on the right to a clean and healthful environment, calling it “not untimely,” and opening the door for further arguments under that claim.
“The proposed amended causes of action are but a riff on the themes that have already run throughout this litigation,” Abbott wrote, adding that “little would be accomplished by denying amendment.”
The overarching lawsuit is expected to go to trial in 2027.

Laura Kelly holds a Chiefs jersey with team owner Clark Hunt ahead of a news conference Dec. 22, 2025, at the Kansas Docking State Office Building in Topeka, Kansas (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector).TOPEKA, Kansas — The Kansas City Chiefs are moving to Kansas with a deal to use taxpayer funding to help build a domed stadium, entertainment district, new team headquarters and a training facility, Kansas officials announced Monday.
The announcement followed a closed-door meeting by legislative leaders who then voted unanimously to issue STAR bonds to finance the project.
More information about the deal is expected at a news conference called by Gov. Laura Kelly, who appeared with Chiefs owner Clark Hunt before talking to reporters.
“This agreement to bring the Chiefs to Kansas takes our state to the next level,” Kelly said in a statement as the news conference began. “With this new stadium, we’re creating thousands of jobs, bringing in tourists from around the world, attracting young people, and most importantly, we’re continuing to make Kansas the best place in America to raise a family. This is a game-changer for Kansas, and it’s a signal to America and the world that our state’s future is very bright.”
The Legislative Coordinating Council, which consists of Republican and Democratic legislative leaders, booted a standing-room-only crowd out about three minutes into its Monday meeting and returned in less than 30 minutes to vote on the STAR bonds deal. They didn’t discuss the plan in an open meeting or with reporters.
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, said in a statement that “Kansas won the Super Bowl.”
“This is a big win our state really needed,” Masterson said. “As someone who loves watching the big game every week, I can tell you this will make the football experience better for Chiefs Kingdom. The overall fan experience will be greatly improved with this new stadium: better seats, enhanced tailgating, and smoother traffic flow to and from games.”
The state has been trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs football team and Kansas City Royals baseball team across state lines. The Legislature passed a law during a special session in 2024 to use STAR bonds to pay for up to 70% of a development project with a minimum investment of a billion dollars. The bonds would be paid through liquor sales and retail sales tax revenue in the development area, with a window up to 30 years.
Chiefs flags lined the street leading into the Docking State Office Building, and a lone Topekan sat outside to show his support of bringing the team to Kansas.
Steve Bushnell said he has made the trip to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, many times. He was excited at the idea of moving the team to the Sunflower State.
“It’s certainly a little bit bittersweet with the nostalgia of Royals stadium, Kauffman Stadium and Arrowhead Stadium,” he said.
But, he said, when he heard Chiefs leaders were going to be in Topeka for the news conference with the governor, he “jumped at” the opportunity to be part of this “historic event.”
Inside, red and yellow balloon pillars welcomed an expected 400 guests, according to a spokesperson for the governor.
Kelly, legislative leadership, Chiefs president Mark Donovan, Hunt, U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran and Lt. Gov. David Toland, who is also the Kansas commerce secretary, convened at the Docking building ahead of the news conference to commemorate the deal by posing for photos.
Kansas City, Kansas, Mayor Christal Watson and Olathe Mayor John Bacon were also present.

Norma Hatfield, a longtime advocate for kinship care families who, like herself, are raising minor relatives, addressed officials with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services Monday morning about the proposal. The regulation says the state must consult the child, if the child is able to communicate, on where they would like to go. It also says the child’s custodian needs to provide a list of potential placements for children.
A representative for Republican Auditor Allison Ball also said during the hearing she has concerns about the proposal, believing it to be “unconstitutional.” 
Eligible families also get a once-per-placement stipend “to facilitate the child’s placement,” according to the regulation. A placement of one child would result in a $350 stipend, two children would double that and so on. 
Hatfield, who is the president of the Kinship Families Coalition of Kentucky, told the cabinet the regulation should be clearer on conversations social workers should have with children about placement, saying that “there’s inconsistency in the interpretation of policies from county to county, sometimes even social worker to social worker.” Hatfield also added that she hopes social workers document a child’s list of the people they would like to be placed with for future reference. 
The purpose of the hearing was for the cabinet to accept feedback, rather than give an immediate response to those who spoke Monday. 
The regulation added language required from Senate Bill 151, the unfunded 2024 law that was drafted to help kinship care families but hasn’t been implemented due to a funding dispute between the legislature and the governor. The Beshear administration has said it cannot implement the law unless the legislature appropriates the needed funding. 
“To the extent the General Assembly appropriates state general funds necessary for the cabinet to implement the services under (the law) within 120 days of receiving temporary custody or upon a verifiable qualifying event, a relative or fictive kin caregiver may submit a request to the cabinet for the purpose of pursuing a change in custody of a child in his or her care,” the regulation says. “Upon placement of the child in the custody of the cabinet, the relative or fictive kin caregiver shall pursue foster parent approval.” 
Hatfield said that she was “disappointed” after conversations with the cabinet in the fall of 2023 and early 2024 about the regulation and that ultimately there was “no coordination” with Kentucky Youth Advocates, a group that lobbies on children’s and families’ issues. 
“My goal here is just to make sure that we do right by kinship families, and that we have the right policies in place, and that we follow the intent of the legislation,” Hatfield said. 
Alex Magera, the general counsel for Auditor Allison Ball, spoke on her behalf during the meeting. Ball, who has long fought Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration over the issue, thinks the proposal is “unconstitutional, unlawful and just plain wrong,” he said. 
Magera said 6% of children in Kentucky are being raised by kinship caregivers, which is about twice the national average. 
Magera accused Beshear and the cabinet of not properly helping kinship caregivers, saying that the administration has had a “failure to properly inform caregivers of the benefits and drawbacks of their custodial options.” He also referenced Ball’s lawsuit against the Beshear administration that seeks to have the cabinet implement Senate Bill 151 and cooperate with an investigation. That’s now in front of the Court of Appeals.  
Ball believes the governor’s administration has money to fund the state law, Magera said. The auditor previously urged Beshear to use funding from a study that did not take place to implement Senate Bill 151. Magera also added that the auditor’s office has reviewed “at the very least questionable expenditures” that could have been used for kinship care as part of its review. 
“We were hopeful that Gov. Beshear and the Cabinet were finally going to give Kentucky’s kinship caregivers their legally entitled 120-day decision making window,” Magera said. “But that help quickly dissipated after reading the proposed regulation itself.”
The scope of the issue 
In 2024, there were around 55,000 Kentucky children being raised with a non-parent relative, according to a report from Kentucky Youth Advocates. These families often make hasty decisions about taking in a minor that leaves them without needed financial support. 
When the state removes a child from a home, grandparents and other family members often choose to take temporary custody rather than have the child go into state custody. State custody is the first step toward foster care. That first decision is permanent under current law which has excluded kinship caregivers who take temporary custody from ever receiving the $750 a month that foster parents receive for each child, the Lantern has reported.
Senate Bill 151 is supposed to give kinship caregivers 120 days to apply to become foster parents for their minor relatives and allows children who are being removed from homes to request their preferred familial caregivers, if they are able. 
Kentucky Youth Advocates in 2024 released a report that showed kinship care families need better assistance with food, clothing, school supplies, finances, housing, information technology, peer support, respite care, mental health care and legal assistance.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sensoryexercises-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Photo courtesy of the Office of the Governor)As scrutiny intensifies over how fraudsters in recent years bilked Minnesota safety net programs out of hundreds of millions of dollars, officials in Gov. Tim Walz’s administration have been meeting monthly to share data and develop best practices in an effort to prevent fraud in public programs, they said during a briefing Monday.
The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension highlighted the duties of the Office of Inspector General Coordinating Council, which Walz established through a September executive order.
Officials held the briefing days after a federal prosecutor estimated that fraud in state-run Medicaid programs since 2018 could total over $9 billion. Since then, Walz and officials with the Department of Human Services — which administers the Medicaid programs — have cast doubt on the prosecutor’s estimate.
On Friday, Walz said the $9 billion fraud estimate was “sensationalized,” publicized without evidence and a number created by the Trump administration.
“You’re seeing a weaponization. We’ll continue to fix (the fraud). They’re going to continue to come up with numbers that don’t have it there, and it’s sensationalized. I don’t expect anything different from this administration,” said Walz, whose campaign for a third, four-year term has been severely complicated by all the fraud revelations in the past 18 months or so.
BCA Superintendent Drew Evans, who chairs the new council, said they are facilitating better communication among state agencies, discussing emerging issues that the departments are seeing and creating statewide improvements.
“The goal of this work and this council is to really look towards a prevention framework,” Evans said.
DHS Inspector General James Clark was also on the call, and reporters asked him about the estimated $9 billion in fraud since 2018 throughout 14 “high-risk” Medicaid programs being audited by the state.
“Nothing I’ve seen indicates the $1 billion of fraud or the $9 billion of fraud figures that have been cited,” Clark said. “I do have concerns that people will repeat that figure as fact.”
In July, the Reformer asked Walz at a news conference whether he agreed with the federal prosecutor’s then-$1 billion fraud estimate, and the governor said “yes.”
State agencies, according to a new state law, must report incidents of suspected fraud involving state-funded programs with losses of $10,000 or more to the BCA.
Evans said the BCA since last year has received about 200 reports of suspected fraud from state agencies. Most are related to Medicaid, Evans said, and the BCA is actively investigating about a dozen of those cases.
This year was the first year this reporting requirement was in place, and a report will be published in February documenting more about these incidents, according to the BCA.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54916277197_74d814f6e6_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

HEALEY’S initial framework for new statewide high school graduation standards is a first draft, it needs serious revisions for the final version to meet the needs of our students and schools.  
The report comes after voters resoundingly rejected a state-imposed standardized exam and after extensive input about what stakeholders want students to know and be able to do. Changes must be made for the state to do more than pay lip service to demands for a whole child, 21st century education, as well as flexibility, educator autonomy, and student agency. 
Despite voters’ clear rejection of the MCAS graduation requirement and many calls for multiple pathways to graduation, the interim report of the state council lays out a multilayered set of graduation requirements, with the emphasis on standardized end-of-course assessments to be designed, administered, and scored by the state. On top of these will be a state-defined capstone or portfolio requirement and requirements for students to complete a rigorous course of study that aligns with higher education admissions requirements.  
The state is piling on more graduation requirements than we have had in the past. Piling multiple layers of new requirements on our students will create new obstacles rather than providing opportunities for them to increase their life skills and pursue their individual goals. Districts should be able to provide a range of alternative pathways for their students, not require them to check every box.  
Much like occurred with MCAS as a graduation requirement, state-created and scored end-of-course tests will likely result in narrowing of the curriculum, teaching to the test, and taking the joy out of learning, without providing meaningful information on what many of our diverse students know and are able to do.  
As the decades-long record for the MCAS graduation requirement demonstrated, a high-stakes standardized instrument does not promote or measure the range of what stakeholders want students to know and be able to do.  
Hundreds of participants in Citizens for Public Schools-led forums on graduation readiness in Cambridge, New Bedford, Worcester, Greater Boston, Lowell, and on Zoom said they want students to develop a wide range of capacities, most not measurable with standardized exams.  
Participants in both these forums and the governor’s Graduation Council listening sessions have expressed many common themes and goals: They said students preparing for adult life need higher-order abilities like critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and collaboration skills. Participants also said they wanted students to be literate in math, English language arts, science, and history.   
The appendix to the state’s recommendations lists 20 responses to the question, “What should students know and be able to do?” Fifteen — including the top four — are not measured on standardized tests. Those four, in order, are: 
• Communicate effectively verbally • Exhibit critical thinking• Interact respectfully with people from diverse backgrounds• Identify credible sources of information.
The responses were similar among parents, educators, students, and employers; across races and ethnic groups; and for students with disabilities or students whose first language was not English. 
Out of six ways students should demonstrate their competence, portfolios were the clear favorite. “Assessment or test” was the least favored. That was especially true of students with disabilities and their parents, and for those whose home language was not English. We suspect that if the category had specified “state-administered standardized test,” it would have been even more unpopular. 
Based on the will of voters as expressed in the victory of Question 2 on the 2024 ballot, and the input from hundreds of participants in our People’s Forums, we propose the following course of action to assess graduation readiness: 

Districts should adopt multiple ways for students to demonstrate graduation readiness, including capstones, portfolios, and other ways to assess both skills and content knowledge. 
New statewide course requirements can be considered but must be flexible enough to allow exemplary and interdisciplinary ways to teach content, including with career technical education, International Baccalaureate schools, and other innovative programs.  
The state’s role should be to support local efforts through professional development funds and sharing information, not to issue top-down edicts. 
Any new requirements must allow enough time for educators and their students to make the changes, with adequate funding for professional development and experimental programs. 

The state must not repeat the mistake of the high-stakes MCAS, which over 20-plus years failed to improve education quality or close gaps in opportunity and was overwhelmingly rejected by voters.  
Did the state really hear those who spoke at its listening sessions, or was it an exercise in selective listening to reaffirm a desire to impose a reboot of its failed model? It’s time for some serious revisions and a new blueprint for the future of our students.  
In her closing remarks at a December 1st press conference announcing the initial framework of new graduation requirements, Gov. Healey said, “We’re going to take our time here and really get this right.”  I say amen to that. Citizens for Public Schools and other education stakeholders will be paying attention and speaking up to ensure that is the case.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning)The conservative groups that sued Maine over a voter-approved law that established stricter regulations on money in elections filed their rebuttal on Monday, claiming it violates free speech.
In 2024, Maine voters overwhelmingly passed a law that set a $5,000 limit on contributions to political action committees that independently spend money to try to support or defeat candidates, commonly referred to as super PACs. 
Shortly after, two PACs — Dinner Table Action, which was founded by state Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) and activist Alex Titcomb, and For Our Future, which is run by Titcomb — sued the state. 
However, those behind the law welcomed the lawsuit as it was a key part of their ultimate goal: to get the U.S. Supreme Court to regulate super PACs. 
After the Maine district court ruled in July that the law was unconstitutional, two appeals were filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. One of the briefs is from Attorney General Aaron Frey on behalf of the state of Maine. The other is from the committee behind the referendum and the non-profit Equal Citizens, spearheaded by legal scholar Lawrence Lessig, who has been attempting to bring this issue to the high court for years. 
Latest filings in campaign finance court battle argue Maine has legal right to regulate super PACs

Both make the case that the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission actually allows for super PACs to be regulated, because of the possibility for  donations to a committee that makes independent expenditures to be coordinated with a candidate, meaning there’s a risk of quid pro quo corruption, or a favor for a favor, which can be regulated by Congress. 
But the plaintiff’s counsel, Charles Miller of the Institute for Free Speech, said, “You don’t prevent somebody from doing something that’s truly independent because somebody else may do something that’s coordinated.”
Pointing to existing state law that bans coordination, Miller said, “We think that the state should lean into enforcing those rules, instead of trying to stop truly independent speech.” 
The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects free speech, and specifically, Miller said, “it protects people’s right to speak on their own. We call that independent speech — or independent expenditures in this context.” 
The 2024 law also requires the disclosure of all donors who contribute toward independent expenditures, regardless of amount. Miller argues there’s no chance for corruption in those cases and pointed to Maine law that already requires disclosure for those that spend more than $250 in any one candidate’s election. “People really need to have the ability to make small anonymous contributions,” he said.  
The brief from Lessig’s group also made a second argument they characterize as an originalist and typically conservative one: that the original meaning of the First Amendment would not have blocked state legislatures or the people from limiting the size of contributions to political action committees. 
Lessig believes the argument would fare well with the current conservative-leaning Supreme Court. He also believes that’s why the plaintiffs want to prevent that argument from getting out of the First Circuit. The plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the interveners from the case in October, which the court has yet to rule on. 
But the plaintiffs say that argument isn’t really an originalist one, noting that the term “corruption” doesn’t appear in the Constitution. 
“When you’re looking to interpret the Constitution and find out original meaning, you should be looking for definitions of the terms that are actually in the free speech clause,” Miller said. 
He points to Justice Clarence Thomas’ comments in Nixon v. Shrink Shrink Missouri Government PAC, which upheld that federal limits on campaign contributions also applied to state limits on campaign contributions to state offices. “I would subject campaign contribution limitations to strict scrutiny,” Thomas wrote. 
Miller said, “in legal parlance — that’s the whole game. What that means is he would treat contributions the same as he treats expenditures.”

The city arranged a tax break for the relatively unknown company developing the project. The vote was seen as a formality as most expected the project to easily pass. But then the public got wind of the plan.
Within days, locals quickly organized and city councilors reported they were inundated with “by far” the most messages they had ever received on any issue. Hundreds of people showed up in person to the council meeting. Instead of sailing through, the deal was unanimously voted down.
With proposed projects in Lewiston, Wiscasset, and Limestone, Maine may soon be entering the national data center construction boom, driven by investors ($60 billion in 2025 alone) who need the centers to power AI technology. 
Locals are right to be wary: these centers consume a horrifying amount of resources. A typical AI-focused hyperscale data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households and consumes 5 million gallons of water — as much as a town of 50,000 people. These jaw-dropping stats are expected to rise with the construction of newer centers, which require even more power and water to run. Communities in Virginia and Maryland have seen their electric bills rise as much as 25% thanks to AI. 
The Lewiston City Council vote shows there is a clear energy in Maine to push back against Big Tech, the forced adoption of AI, and the raw deal of data centers. It’s time our political leaders take note. Given our busy election year, you might expect that candidates in a crowded gubernatorial race in particular would spot the opportunity to stand out. So far, people who care about this issue are without a champion.
Of all the Democratic candidates running for governor, none have discussed AI on their campaign website or included it in their platform. In fact, only Republican Jim Libby, a legislator who served on the governor’s AI task force, has mentioned it as part of his platform.
Few others have shared any statements about the issue on Facebook. I hope we’ll see this change, because tech policy touches every other issue we’re facing in Maine.
There’s a tendency to assume that discussions around tech policy need to be framed in tech terms — that to truly be an “expert” in emerging tech, you have to understand every single aspect of the technology itself. That’s baloney. To deeply understand the implications of a technology, you need to first have a grounding in the power and motivations behind who owns the technology. 
The current motivations behind the companies that are building the data centers and pushing broad-scale adoption of AI in every single industry are clear: move fast, force adoption, and don’t worry about breaking the rules in the process. 
We can compare the local debate around AI to the Central Maine Power corridor — the transmission line that voters overwhelmingly opposed in a 2021 referendum that was later deemed unconstitutional by the Maine Superior Court. If the corporation moves fast enough, it doesn’t really matter what the people think: the project will get built anyway. Let the public into the process right at the end, and the whole “democracy” part will just be a formality with no ability to affect the outcome.
The adoption of AI and the building of data centers elicit such strong reactions and responses from a broad group of people for a very specific reason: we, the people, haven’t been consulted. 
We are told that AI will do many incredible things, but we’re never asked if we want those things. No one asked if Mainers wanted a data center in Limestone. We just saw in the news that it’s happening. Case closed. 
Google and Spotify and all of the other companies didn’t ask if we wanted AI features — they just added them anyway and hid the ability to turn it off. Residents in Wiscasset, where there’s another large-scale data center being proposed, can’t even find out who is behind the project, let alone any estimates on water and energy use. 
This lack of transparency and local input is intentional. If the public is asked about whether we want AI, I believe the overwhelming answer is that we don’t. The proliferation of AI is, at its core, an anti-democratic process to create a deeply authoritarian world. The lack of public input to this process is a feature of this technology, not a bug. 
Here’s where it gets more scary: Large language models like ChatGPT and others are trained on vast amounts of data, everything from Reddit forums to individual website content to social media posts, emails, and even the wholesale theft of books and art. Data is the currency that these models are trained on, without which they will flounder. Our public institutions hold a lot of data. 
Public institutions that have been hollowed out by decades of underfunding are particularly vulnerable to being co-opted by AI. Absent strong digital privacy safeguards and in-house tech expertise, we may soon find that the solution to understaffing is to feed the data entrusted to these institutions — everything from food stamp eligibility to student homework, criminal records, and even historical documents — into an AI system. This new tech will be sold as an efficient, cost-saving tool to “fix” a medley of deeply entrenched societal and political ills.  
The result of an AI takeover isn’t efficiency. Several studies have shown that the introduction of AI doesn’t save time, isn’t delivering value, and can serve to hide new modes of extraction. The end result of this technology is a reality controlled by tech monopolies. 
It sounds like science fiction but the next level of AI looks like predictive policing models trained on racist data that identify “probable criminals” based on the color of their skin. It looks like people getting denied food stamps, housing assistance, or jobs because of data or activity that used to be siloed, protected, or private. It also looks like people being charged more for car, home, or health insurance premiums because our insurance company can now buy data on all of our activities, movements, and motions.
The world enabled by AI is not a world we want to live in. Mainers know this. It’s time our political leaders catch up.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GloriaMendoza-TheEnvironmental-Impact-of-Data-Centers-in-Vulnerable-Ecosystems-2560x1706-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
This is the second arrest ICE agents have made in the Ashland/Bayfield area since July when an individual was arrested at Washburn Iron Works in the city of Washburn.
The Ashland City Police Department issued a statement Friday, Dec. 19 saying that ICE and U.S. Border Patrol officers had informed the police department that federal officers had a federal warrant for two individuals at the “Ashland Family Restaurant.”
The police department noted the federal officers had “picked up” one employee in the morning, and then returned after requesting that a city police officer be present because “the restaurant staff was very upset with them the first time they were there.”
A Dec. 15 police dispatch report notes that Officer Mark Campry was requested at 12:04 p.m. to the restaurant. 
According to the police statement, when the federal officers returned with the local police officer there was a request to open the doors and a second person was taken into custody.
The police did not say what type of warrant ICE had to make the arrest. ICE has not yet responded to a request for that information.
Alexandra Guevara of Voces de la Frontera, an immigrant workers’ rights organization, says there is an important difference between judicial warrants, signed by judges in cases where individuals are wanted for a crime, and ICE administrative warrants, which lack the same force.
“Nobody should open their doors for an ICE warrant. It’s an illegal instrument,” Guevara said.  “When we do our Know Your Rights trainings, it’s the first thing we tell people — you have to be able to get a warrant that is actually signed by a judge, that includes your address, that includes your name, your official name, and you have the ability to get that warrant, send it to a lawyer, send a picture to a lawyer, and ask, ‘Should I open the door or not?’”
Reporters for the Ashland Daily Press said they also were told by an employee of Deltco, a plastics manufacturer, that an employee at the plant was taken in custody by the federal officers Monday. Deltco management did not return calls from the Wisconsin Examiner attempting to verify whether an employee had been arrested.
Voces de la Frontera has identified one of the restaurant employees, a cook, as Luis Davids Coatzeozon Gomes, but has not been able to find out where he is being held.
“One of the things that happens with some of these detentions is that they’re detained and immediately sent somewhere else,” said Guevara, “so they don’t need to report them. And I mean, that creates a lot of confusion, that makes it impossible for their families to find them. It also makes it very difficult for lawyers to represent them, because they need to be in one place to be represented by a lawyer who can have access to them.”
She added, “We know that the ACLU has been dealing with that, talking all over the nation about how difficult it is now to trace where people are being taken because they’re being moved every two to three days, sometimes crossing state borders, like even being sent to places as far as Florida from here. And that makes it very, very difficult to know exactly how many people have been detained because they’re not being reported here.”
Guevara said most ICE detainees in Wisconsin are held, at least temporarily, in the Dodge County Jail. However, nearby Douglas County also has an agreement to hold ICE detainees. The ACLU reported in September that the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office had billed ICE for detaining 111 persons since the beginning of 2025.
State Rep. Angela Stroud, (D-Ashland) questioned why a city police officer accompanied the federal officers making an immigration arrest.
“My view on this is, if there’s probable cause that someone committed a crime, then you know, that’s a reasonable thing for the police to be involved in, because clearly, fighting crime is part of what we want to happen in our communities,” she said.
In answer to a question about the police involvement in the arrest, Ashland City Police Chief Bill Hagstrom sent the Ashland Daily Press a citation from the city’s police manual, 416.6 “Federal Request for Assistance” that states: “requests by federal immigration officials for assistance from this department should be directed to a supervisor. The Department may provide available support services, such as traffic control or peacekeeping efforts.”
Rep. Stroud also expressed concern about taking workers from employers struggling to maintain adequate staffing during a labor shortage in a city of fewer than 8,000 people.
“We have problems finding people to work generally around here,” she said, “and you know, we have an aging population. We have a lot of workforce shortages. What is the big picture goal here, and how does it help our community? How does this help our community?  I would like someone to explain that. And I recognize people need to, you know, follow immigration laws, but we’re seeing more and more that even people who do follow the law are being deported. And it’s just irrational. I don’t understand the big picture goal, except maybe to terrorize communities, and that’s, needless to say, is completely unethical.”
She added, “Unfortunately, we’re seeing these large raids and sweeps of people who are working and, you know, sometimes we’re even finding people who are American citizens getting caught up in that. So I recognize that people have a lot of strong feelings on this topic.”

Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton, stands with Pastor Brandon Huber after the court hearing. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Brandon Huber, a pastor and Realtor who alleged religious discrimination by the Missoula Organization of Realtors after being accused of violating a professional code of ethics, said a settlement has cleared his name in the industry.
The case brought the threat of a U.S. Department of Justice complaint of religious bias against the Missoula Organization of Realtors.
In a news release on his social media page, Huber said he was declaring victory in the case that started when he, as then-pastor of the Clinton Community Church, broke ties with the Missoula Food Bank and Community Center in 2021 because of its support for LGBTQ+ people.
A third party — a community member who was not a real estate client —  alleged to the Realtors that his announcement of that break was “hate speech” in violation of the ethics code of the National Association of Realtors.
Huber’s lawyer argued his comments weren’t hateful under any reasonable definition (see Huber’s letter in sidebar below).
Huber also alleged the policy in question, part of the national Realtors’ code the local Realtors enforce, violated the Montana Constitution’s protection of his religious speech.
The case played out legally in Missoula County District Court, but also administratively with the Missoula Organization of Realtors.
Huber said the settlement lifts all the sanctions the Realtors imposed against him. The settlement came after a demand letter to the local and national Realtors from Liberty Counsel alleging religious discrimination.
Liberty Counsel is a national Christian organization that defends religious freedom and the First Amendment. In the letter, the group threatened to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice if the penalties were not lifted.
“Today is the day that God gets all the credit,” said the announcement on Huber’s social media page. “After four years of legal battle, perseverance, and unwavering faith, Pastor Brandon Huber and the Missoula Organization of Realtors have reached an agreement that affirms religious liberty and restores Pastor Huber’s standing in the real estate community.”
Friday, the Missoula Organization of Realtors declined to comment on the case. However, in a previous statement, a lawyer for the Realtors said the group’s interest was in preventing discrimination.
“Missoula Organization of REALTORS and the National Association of REALTORS has a deep commitment to non-discrimination, and we take any alleged violation of the Code of Ethics very seriously,” the lawyer said in part.
The settlement took place after the U.S. Department of Justice took notice of the dispute, according to legal counsel for Huber. In his post, Huber thanked the agency and President Donald Trump.
“Thanks be to God, and with appreciation for the support and advocacy aligned with President Trump’s Department of Justice, we can officially declare victory for Pastor Brandon Huber,” said the news release on Huber’s Facebook page.
In 2022, Huber lost his fight in Missoula County District Court, but not on the merits. The judge said he couldn’t weigh in on the discrimination allegations yet because Huber still had administrative remedies he could pursue internally with the Realtors.
But Huber wasn’t successful in the administrative process either. After a preliminary finding that Huber’s statements violated the Realtors’ hate speech prohibition, the Realtors fined Huber $5,000.
In 2022, a hearing panel found Huber’s social media post noting an event at his church would “expose the LGBTQ Agenda that Controls our Lives and Kills our Liberty” violated a provision against discrimination in the Realtors’ Code of Ethics — subject of a separate complaint against Huber. The panel said it disagreed with his action to break ties with the Food Bank and post about it, but it didn’t find the action was an ethical code violation.
In a phone call Friday, Huber said he didn’t appeal the fine, nor did he plan to pay it. As a result of his nonpayment, he said, the Realtors took away his access to a real estate database that’s essential for doing the work.
For the last four years plus, he said, he has been without access to that database. However, Huber said his license as of Friday was showing as active, and he’s working for a Missoula real estate firm.
The news release said the settlement means the Missoula Organization of Realtors rescinded all fines and fees and class requirements — he’d been ordered to take a diversity, equity and inclusion course, which he declined to do — and overturned disciplinary action to fully clear Huber as a Realtor.
In a social media post, Liberty Counsel said the local Realtors also waived Huber’s membership dues in both the local and national Realtors groups through 2027 and “reinstated his good standing.”
Although the Missoula Organization of Realtors declined to comment, Richard Mast, senior litigation counsel with Liberty Counsel, explained Friday the reason the Realtors might have had an incentive to settle with Huber.
For one thing, he said, Liberty Counsel learned the U.S. Department of Justice had taken an interest in the case.
He said one trend across the country has been that licensed professionals have seen groups on the left “weaponize licensure complaints” if they disagree with a person’s speech.
Mast said those moves seek to eliminate people’s ability to support themselves and punish them for expressing their beliefs. In Huber’s case, he said, the speech wasn’t about his work at all.
“It had nothing to do with his services as a Realtor,” Mast said.
Mast said he did not know if the DOJ ever took action in the Missoula case, but President Donald Trump had signed an executive order in support of religious freedom and created a DOJ task force to stop anti-Christian bias.
Additionally, Mast said, the National Association of Realtors had earlier clarified the policy in question to state that it was never intended to apply to private religious speech — speech outside the context of actual real estate transactions and activities (see sidebar for policy).
The demand letter from Liberty Counsel described the changes as “a tacit admission that the provision was overbroad and intruded on constitutionally protected speech and conduct.”
Mast said the case offers a lesson in tolerance.
“In order to have a free society, we have to allow others to express ideas even if we disagree with them, and not try to take their livelihood and have them cancelled,” Mast said.
He said the right to free speech is protected in the First Amendment, and religious exercise is a fundamental right, and it’s inappropriate to mischaracterize the religious beliefs of people of faith, as he said happened with Huber.
But he said Huber’s case shows the tide is turning.
“The American people have had enough of attempts to silence people of faith, especially under spurious ethics allegations,” Mast said.
Lawyer Matthew Monforton represented Huber in the Missoula County District Court lawsuit, and he praised the result on Friday.
“Pastor Brandon’s courage and steadfastness ensures that no other Christian realtors will lose their livelihood because of their faith,” Monforton said in an email.



 Original statements from Huber

The lawsuit Huber filed said the Clinton Community Church declined to participate in a free lunch program after it found the Missoula Food Bank included an LGBTQ “Pride” insert, a coloring page, in the lunches.
In a 2021 letter to the congregation, Huber explained the decision: “This has been a great honor for us to be able to support the kids and families in our community with these meals throughout the summer months.
“This past week, we found printed material in the lunches that we were handing out that went against our Biblical doctrine. After conversations with the food bank, we have found that our beliefs and that of the Missoula Food Bank do not align.
“Due to this, Clinton Community Church has decided to end our partnership with the Missoula Food Bank effective today, July 2, 2021.”
The church launched its own lunch program, and Huber described its position and goal in his social media post, which is quoted in the lawsuit: “Clinton Community Church wants our community to know that we love and support each and everyone of you, no matter your background or where you are in life. As a church, we strive to show the love of Jesus in all we do throughout this community, while standing up for Biblical principles, Biblical truths, and our beliefs. It is our goal to continue to serve the FREE lunches to kids in our community.”
 National Association of Realtors’ Code of Ethics and Standard of Practice

Part of the code from the Realtors says this following:
“Standard of Practice 10-5: REALTORS®, in their capacity as real estate professionals, in association with their real estate businesses, or in their real estate-related activities, shall not harass any person or persons based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity. As used in this Code of Ethics, harassment is unwelcome behavior directed at an individual or group based on one or more of the above protected characteristics where the purpose or effect of the behavior is to create a hostile, abusive, or intimidating environment which adversely affects their ability to access equal professional services or employment opportunities. (Adopted and effective November 13, 2020, Amended 1/23, Amended and effective June 5, 2025).”
A corresponding explanation of updates from the Realtors said the association made changes in part to ensure the code applies to Realtors “operating in their professional capacity.”
“These amendments are intended to reduce risk to state and local associations and their volunteer leadership who administer and enforce Article 10 while preserving and re-enforcing the obligations of Standard of Practice 10-5,” the explanation said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_1795-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Justin Garcia/Las Cruces Bulletin) A federal judge last week ordered the federal Education Department to resume funding mental health services for more than 5,000 New Mexico students, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez announced Monday.
Torrez was among 18 attorneys general nationwide who sued President Donald Trump’s administration in June over the Education Department’s abrupt late-April announcement that it would cease funding multi-year federal grants to expand the number of mental health professionals in high-need schools. 
Congress in 2022 approved more than $1 billion for the effort in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act after the school shooting in rural Uvalde, Texas, that year that left 19 students and two teachers dead. 
The legislation aimed to place 14,000 counselors in schools nationwide and showed early signs of success. According to early results of a study Torrez’s office cited from the National Association of School Psychologists, participating schools saw a 50% reduction in suicide risk, as well as better attendance and improved engagement between students and staff.
School districts in seven New Mexico counties, including Silver Consolidated School District in Silver City, received funding through the program. Another recipient was the Central Region Educational Cooperative, a group of rural school districts in central New Mexico, according to court records.
NM joins lawsuit over mental health funding for students

The congressional legislation enabled the districts to re-apply for the funding every year based on their performances and other federal requirements, according to Torrez’s office. 
But on April 29, the Education Department issued boilerplate notices to recipients, saying that they were discontinuing the funding because the program reflected the “prior Administration’s priority preference and conflict with those of the current Administration,” according to court records.
The lawsuit Torrez and other attorneys general filed argued the Education Department’s basis for ending the program was illegal, saying differing political priorities are not adequate reason to stop funding a program Congress approved. 
On Dec. 19, U.S. District Judge Kymberly Evanson in the Western District of Washington granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, agreeing the Education Department had acted unlawfully and ordering parties to agree on a timeline for the department to legally consider each grant recipient’s application for renewal. 
She concluded in her ruling that nothing in the law allows “that multi-year grants may be discontinued whenever the political will to do so arises.” 
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), who spearheaded legislation creating the counseling program, called Evanson’s ruling a “major victory” in a statement. 
“It restores funding that never should have been taken away in the first place,” he said. “School-based mental health services are essential to helping our kids learn, stay safe, and succeed.”
Torrez in a statement also touted the ruling as proof that, “No one—regardless of politics—wants to deny our kids access to the mental health support they need to learn, grow, and thrive.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Kevin Stitt, pictured June 5, 2025, sent a letter to the Oklahoma Ethics Commission pushing for decisive action on the state's campaign finance system. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In an unusual move, Gov. Kevin Stitt wrote a letter leaning on a state ethics board ahead of a key vote to take action on the future of Oklahoma’s campaign finance system after it had been offline for months. 
Stitt voiced his concern in a letter dated Thursday that the Oklahoma Ethics Commission should not be taking on additional responsibilities while not performing its “basic transparency function,” according to a letter obtained by Oklahoma Voice on Monday.  
“Oklahomans deserve full transparency in our elections, yet the online Guardian system, the state’s critical tool for tracking campaign finance reports, has been down for months, plunging our state into unnecessary darkness since June,” he said in a letter. “This outage means everyday citizens cannot see campaign donations flowing to PACs, candidates, and other accounts.”
Friday’s meeting agenda included public hearings for several rule changes, and Stitt wrote it was “inappropriate” for the Commission to take on new authority. It is common for state agencies to propose rule changes every year for the Legislature to consider during session. 
The day after Stitt’s letter, the Ethics Commission voted to terminate a contract with RFD and Associates, the vendor that was supposed to launch a new Guardian system. They voted to reinstate the original Guardian system operated by the previous vendor, Civix. The Commission entered a $217,000 contract with Carahsoft, a partner of Civix, that lasts three years.
The original Guardian system was online within hours of Friday’s vote. 
RFD and Associates’ chief operating officer, who attended Friday’s meeting, did not immediately respond Monday to an email requesting comment. 
The old Guardian system was initially taken offline in September and was set to launch in October, but officials previously said there were “unforeseen” delays in the data conversion process. Delays in the launch left candidates, lobbyists and political action committees unable to submit some reports and documentation amid the approaching 2026 election cycle.
The board also authorized the Oklahoma Attorney General to pursue legal action against RFD and Associates and potentially recover damages. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, and Justin Meek, chair of the Commission, responded with their own letter after Friday’s meeting and said the Commission did not delay in acting to address issues with the launch of Guardian. 
The proposed rule changes are part of the Commission’s statutory requirements and additional agenda items have not “delayed or detracted” from taking the steps to restore full public access to campaign finance information, the letter reads.
“We have witnessed the Commission’s focus and expansive efforts to obtain a solution,” the letter reads. “As such, it is important to clarify that the Commission has not been weighing whether to act. For months, the Commission has been exploring solutions to restore continuity. The Commission wanted to ensure accuracy, reliability, and protection for both filers and the public before arriving at a hasty solution.” 
The Commission proactively requested assistance from the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services as problems continued, according to the agency’s response letter. 
Following the re-launch of the original Guardian system, the Ethics Commission sent an email out announcing that the system had been restored and announced new reporting deadlines for candidates, political action committees and lobbyists.  
“Some filers entered information into the Guardian 2.0 system during the transition period,” the email read. “Because Guardian 2.0 will not be used for filing, information entered in that system will not carry over to the legacy Guardian platform and will need to be re-entered. We recognize that this may create additional work for some filers, and we appreciate your patience. This step is necessary to ensure that all filings are submitted in a single, stable system and reflected accurately and consistently in the official public record.”
Bruce Boone said many filers don’t have a lot of information to transfer to the original Guardian system. 
“Unfortunately, given the nature of the termination – there will not be a quick and easy opportunity to get any data from Guardian 2.0,” she said. “Our team took a great deal of time, knowing this was a possibility, downloading as much information as possible from Guardian 2.0 so that we could assist as needed.”

“The Mission of the University of Dubuque aligns directly with the LearningWell Coalition values,” said Adam Hoffman, University of Dubuque vice president for academic affairs, in the release. “As an institution we are deeply invested in cultivating inclusive, high-impact learning environments that support wellbeing and meet the evolving needs of our students and communities. This represents an excellent opportunity to join forces to continue to support holistic student education and formation.”
Membership to the coalition will aid in two initiatives at the University of Dubuque, the release stated, with one already in prelaunch with pilot events under its belt.
A grant awarded to the university this summer and the coalition partnership are helping to support “Pathways to Purpose,” which will expand “character development opportunities” to all students at the university, the release stated. The program was previously limited to just students in the Wendt Center’s Character Scholars program.
Faculty are also getting involved in strengthening character education, according to the release, with the future launch of the Character Learning Outcome Faculty Development Initiative. Designed to aid faculty in “developing and assessing meaningful character learning outcomes across disciplines,” the release stated the initiative will change curriculum so students can connect their classroom teachings with “the values and virtues that prepare them for life beyond UD.
The pilot for the faculty initiative will begin in summer 2026.
“The University of Dubuque brings a rich tradition of purpose and character to the coalition,” said LearningWell Coalition executive director Keith Buffinton in the release. “Through the Wendt Center’s innovative programs and commitment to whole-person education, UD is modeling how institutions can integrate student formation into every dimension of student life. We are thrilled to have them as partners in advancing this work nationally.”

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas City Chiefs are moving to Kansas with a deal to use more than a billion dollars in taxpayer funding to help build a domed stadium, entertainment district, new team headquarters and a training facility, Kansas officials announced Monday.
The announcement followed a closed-door meeting by legislative leaders who then voted unanimously to issue STAR bonds to finance the project.
“Today, we are announcing an agreement to bring our beloved Kansas City Chiefs right here to Kansas,” said Gov. Laura Kelly, speaking at a crowded event at the Docking State Office Building. “For the rest of the nation, I say take heed. Kansas is not a flyover state. We are a touchdown state.”
“In my seven years as governor, I’ve had the privilege of making some really big announcements, but none bigger than this. It’s truly historic,” she added.
Kelly said the agreement between Kansas and the Chiefs protects Kansas taxpayers.
“The state portion is coming from revenue generated by the stadium, entertainment venues, STAR bonds and lottery funds,” she said. “Not with new taxes.”
The $3.3 billion project includes a stadium and entertainment district located near the Legends district in Wyandotte County and a new Chiefs headquarters and training facility in Olathe, said Clark Hunt, chairman and CEO of the Chiefs.
“The stadium we estimate will be approximately $3 billion,” Hunt said. “The practice facility will be approximately $300 million and then we have committed to do a mix-ed use district that will have at least $700 million invested both in Olathe and Wyandotte County, and it could go up from there.”

The split between public monies and private investment dollars will be 60-40, he said, with private monies covering 40% of the $3.3 billion bill.
The deal has been years in the making, transcending truces between Kansas and Missouri leaders to end the economic border war between the states. Kelly said to reporters following the event that the deal has nothing to do with the border war.
“This is a sports team versus a corporation,” she said. “It’s very different.”
Design is expected to take two years, and construction could take three with a planned opening in the fall of 2031. Lt. Gov. David Toland, who is also the Kansas commerce secretary, said planning will begin “probably tomorrow.”
Hunt said the decision to leave Missouri and Arrowhead stadium was not an easy one. It came down to needing to make a decision, he said, as building a new stadium will take five years and the Chiefs are approaching the five-year mark on their lease of Arrowhead.
“We had a great dialogue with Missouri, all the way through the end of last week,” he said. “Frankly, not everything was resolved that needed to be resolved. The big difference is we were working with one party here, the state of Kansas, and in Missouri, we were working with the governor’s office, the county and also the city.”
“We all have a bunch of really great memories at Arrowhead, but this decision is really about the future,” he added. “We’re going to be investing in a stadium that can last for multiple generations of Chiefs fans.
Experts doubt the benefits of using public subsidies for stadium deals.
“Every deal is different,” Toland told Kansas Reflector, “but this one we’ve done an extensive economic impact study that shows this is a huge net positive for the state of Kansas.”
The deal relies on the Sales Tax and Revenue Bond program, also known as STAR bonds, to lure the multibillion dollar football team 20 miles away from their current home at Arrowhead Stadium. Toland called the deal “the largest economic win in Kansas history.”
The incentive package offers the Chiefs unprecedented support, covering up to 70% of the stadium’s cost by redirecting the sales tax revenue from the new stadium and surrounding areas to pay off construction debt.
Last month, the Chiefs advertised a request for domed stadium design proposals located near the Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Kansas.

The Legislative Coordinating Council, which consists of Republican and Democratic legislative leaders, booted a standing-room-only crowd out about three minutes into its Monday meeting and returned in less than 30 minutes to vote on the STAR bonds deal. They didn’t discuss the plan in an open meeting or with reporters.
The state has been trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs football team and Kansas City Royals baseball team across state lines for years.
Chiefs and Royals representatives encouraged Kansas legislators in 2024 to expand tax incentives to sweeten a move across state lines. Despite those incentives, which were passed during a special session that summer and signed into law shortly thereafter, neither the Chiefs nor the Royals had promised to build in Kansas. Until now.
The Chiefs join a growing list of professional sports teams that have clinched expensive new stadium deals. The Buffalo Bills and the Tennessee Titans both will play in new stadiums beginning in 2026.

The announcement followed a closed-door meeting by legislative leaders who then voted unanimously to issue STAR bonds to finance the project.
“Today, we are announcing an agreement to bring our beloved Kansas City Chiefs right here to Kansas,” said Gov. Laura Kelly, speaking at a crowded event at the Docking State Office Building, next door to the Statehouse. “For the rest of the nation, I say take heed. Kansas is not a flyover state.

The split between public monies and private investment dollars will be 60-40, he said, with private monies covering 40% of the $3.3 billion bill.
Kelly said the stadium will generate 20,000 jobs and more than $4 billion in economic impact during construction.
The deal has been years in the making, transcending truces between Kansas and Missouri leaders to end the economic border war between the states. Kelly said to reporters following the event that the deal has nothing to do with the border war.

In a survey completed last year, Hunt said, fans made it clear that they wanted a loud stadium and a “really great” tailgating experience. Both those elements will be part of the design plan for the new stadium, he said.
Experts doubt the benefits of using public subsidies for stadium deals.
“Every deal is different,” Toland told Kansas Reflector, “but this one we’ve done an extensive economic impact study that shows this is a huge net positive for the state of Kansas.”

Last month, the Chiefs advertised a request for domed stadium design proposals located near the Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Kansas. A domed stadium would allow the team to host a Super Bowl.
The Legislative Coordinating Council, which consists of Republican and Democratic legislative leaders, booted a standing-room-only crowd out about three minutes into its Monday meeting and returned in less than 30 minutes to vote on the STAR bonds deal.

Chiefs flags lined the street Monday leading into the Docking State Office Building, and a lone Topekan sat outside to show his support of bringing the team to Kansas.
Steve Bushnell said he has made the trip to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, many times. He was excited at the idea of moving the team to the Sunflower State.
“It’s certainly a little bit bittersweet with the nostalgia of Royals stadium, Kauffman Stadium and Arrowhead Stadium,” he said.
But, he said, when he heard Chiefs leaders were going to be in Topeka for the news conference with the governor, he “jumped at” the opportunity to be part of this “historic event.”
Inside, red and yellow balloon pillars welcomed an estimated 400 guests, according to a spokesperson for the governor.
The Chiefs join a growing list of professional sports teams that have clinched expensive new stadium deals. The Buffalo Bills and the Tennessee Titans both will play in new stadiums beginning in 2026.
Hunt said the 2031 football season will bring change.
“But some things won’t change,” he said. “Our fans will still be the loudest in the NFL. Our games will still be the best place in the world to tailgate. Our players and coaches will be ready to compete for championships because on the field or off the field, we’re big dreamers, and we’re ready for the next chapter.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC220319-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:59:04.795544

(File photo courtesy of Scott Dean/Coastal Carolina)COLUMBIA — Republican candidates for governor will face off in at least three debates hosted by the state GOP before voters choose a nominee in the June primaries, South Carolina’s dominating party announced Monday.
Next year represents the “first truly open” governor’s race in 16 years, said state GOP Chairman Drew McKissick. 
“We’re looking forward to creating an opportunity for all South Carolinians to hear from our candidates as they consider who to support in the coming campaign,” he said in a news release.  
The first debate is set for March 17 at Coastal Carolina University in Conway. The next two will follow in five-week intervals: April 21 at the College of Charleston and May 26 at Wofford College in Spartanburg, according to the state Republican Party’s announcement.
The primary is two weeks later.
The fourth debate will be June 16 at the Newberry Opera House in the likely event of a runoff. That’s mid-way between the June 9 primary and June 23 runoff.
Five Republicans have announced bids for the Governor’s Mansion: Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell, U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, and Attorney General Alan Wilson. 
In South Carolina, runoffs are required if no candidate wins at least 50% plus one vote in a primary.
The last time there was no Republican incumbent on the ballot for governor was 2010, when then-Rep. Nikki Haley ultimately won a four-way GOP race in a runoff with then-Congressman Gresham Barrett.
In January 2017, then-Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster ascended to the Governor’s Mansion when Haley left her second term early to become President Donald Trump’s first ambassador to the United Nations. McMaster has won two terms since, becoming the longest elected governor in state history.
The state GOP is partnering with broadcast company Gray Media for the debates. They will be moderated by the stations’ “on-air talent” and “conservative media personalities,” according to the party’s release. A spokesperson declined to be more specific.
Coastal Carolina President James Winebrake said the public university is proud to “serve as a forum where ideas are exchanged and democracy is strengthened.”
In February 2024, Trump held a rally at Coastal Carolina ahead of the state’s presidential primary with Haley, which he won by more than 20 percentage points.
The debates can be watched on the following stations in South Carolina and their online platforms:

(Photo by GracedBytheLight/Getty Images)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma and Arkansas officials are denouncing a federal judge’s decision that found poultry companies responsible for polluting a key watershed in both states and also ordered them to pay millions to remediate it.
The officials, including Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the judgment will create unnecessary harm for poultry producers in both states who operate along the Illinois River Watershed, which runs through Eastern Oklahoma and the Northwest Ozark Mountains in Arkansas. 
But supporters, including Oklahoma’s current and former attorney generals who had aggressively pursued the 20-year-old court case, backed the decision. Rather than appeal the decision, Attorney General Gentner Drummond encouraged the companies to “meet the State at the negotiating table” to address cleanup requirements and ensure the watershed is safe. 
U.S. District Judge Gregory K. Frizzell ruled Friday after negotiations failed that several poultry companies are responsible for polluting the Illinois River Watershed in Oklahoma and Arkansas and must fund remediation efforts. The judge found the companies liable for fixing the damage caused by spreading poultry waste on the land, leading to phosphorus pollution. 
He ruled that the companies, including Tyson, Cargill, George’s, Simmons, Cobb-Vantress, and Cal-Maine, are responsible for cleanup efforts and imposed restrictions on how the land can be used. Frizzell previously determined in June, following evidentiary hearings, that poultry farm runoff was still harming the Illinois River, Lake Tenkiller and connected waterways. 
Frizzell ordered that a “special master” be appointed to oversee remediation efforts and provide updates to the court on a regular basis, according to the ruling. The individual will serve for at least 30 years and will be paid for by the poultry companies with an evergreen fund that will start with a balance of $10 million, according to the judgment.
Frizzell also issued an injunction which restricts the land application of poultry waste, with the rate limited to two tons of waste per acre. 
The poultry companies are also responsible for paying $10,000 per violation to the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality Revolving Fund as well as attorney fees. All companies had multiple violations, except George’s, which only had one, according to the judgment.

The poultry companies did not return emails seeking comment. The lawsuit notes that Peterson Farms and Cal-Maine Foods no longer operate in the watershed area, but the judgment names all companies jointly and separately responsible for cleaning up the damage.
Simmons Foods on Sunday ran a full page ad in The Oklahoman newspaper stating that Drummond should “hang up” his cowboy hat and stating that his actions are not pro-agriculture. 
“Real farmers stick together. Put an end to this attack on agriculture today,” the ad says. It was signed by over 200 people who live in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. 
Drummond, a Republican, pursued the lawsuit, which was initially filed in the Northern District of Oklahoma in 2005 by then-Democrat Attorney General Drew Edmondson. 
Drummond said in a statement that he will help facilitate negotiations for a path forward to clean the watershed and support Oklahoma farmers. 
“This judgment has significant ramifications for the industry,” he said. “These consequences underscore why we have focused on the importance of negotiations with the poultry companies before getting to this point. A robust poultry industry and clean water can and must coexist.”
Edmondson said he was “very pleased” to have finality in the case and that it was a “long time coming” to have this final ruling in favor of the state. He said the ruling was welcomed. 
The poultry companies had not appealed the judgment as of Monday morning, according to court records.
Stitt said Drummond had years to negotiate a “responsible” settlement.
“These family farmers did everything the right way,” Stitt said in a statement. “They got the permit, followed the rules, and they’re still getting sued. … Instead, this judgment delivers a direct punishment to producers by stripping them of ownership of their litter as a lawful source of revenue.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt speaks at the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma on Oct. 29, 2025. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)
He called the appointment of a special master an “unaccountable, court-run shadow regulatory agency.” 
Stitt previously fired a member of his Cabinet for appearing in a court hearing for the lawsuit on the side of Drummond, which the governor said was in opposition to Oklahoma farmers and landowners.
Arkansas officials also spoke against the federal judge’s decision. 
“This again shows the negative impact of a ridiculous lawsuit that has gone on for far too long and continues to create unnecessary harm to hardworking Arkansas poultry growers,” said Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. 
The state’s Attorney General Tim Griffin said the ruling is a “dangerous precedent” that threatens the “constitutional balance between states.” He said he will be seeking opportunities to help Arkansas farmers appeal. 
“It is deeply disappointing to see the Oklahoma Attorney General seek political opportunity at the expense of hard-working Arkansas poultry farmers,” said U.S. Rep. Steve Womack, R-Arkansas, in a statement. “Many of these growers have been operating in the Illinois River Watershed for generations, and this judgement will do irreparable harm to their livelihoods and families. Supporting these growers remains of the utmost importance to me.”
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Farm Bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Provided photo)Fishers-area realtor and small business owner Catherine Torzewski is the latest candidate to enter the race for central Indiana’s Senate District 31 seat.
Torzewski, a Democrat, announced Monday her plans to run for the politically competitive district that spans the northeastern corner of Indianapolis and parts of Fishers in Hamilton County. 
The seat is currently held by Sen. Kyle Walker, R-Lawrence, who announced earlier this month that he will not seek a second term.
Torzewski is the latest candidate — and second Democrat — to announce a run for the open seat. 
Last week, term-limited Marion County Sheriff Kerry Forestal said he would seek the District 31 seat, setting up an early contest in one of the state’s few closely divided Senate districts.
On the Republican side, Hamilton Southeastern School Board President Juanita Albright has announced her plans to run and  and Fishers City Councilor Tiffanie Ditlevson formed the exploratory committee.

Torzewski said her platform is focused on public education, safety and less political division.
“Voters in Senate district 31 are tired of the polarizing politics. They want lawmakers to get back to Hoosier values, values that prioritize public school funding, safety, and a comfortable life for all,” she said in a statement announcing her candidacy. “I’m committed to a different kind of politics, one that is transparent and authentic. I’m raising my kids here, I’m doing business here, my friends and family all live here. Indiana is home, and I want to make it the best place it possibly can be.”
Torzewski grew up on the east side of Indianapolis and attended Saint Simon Catholic School and Scecina Memorial High School, according to her campaign release. Her mother worked as a local librarian and her father was a Sheet Metal Workers Local 20 union member. Torzewski credited her upbringing with “forming her sense of community and pride.”

Josh Stein speaks to reporters in Raleigh on Oct. 20, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The National Telecommunications and Information Administration has approved North Carolina’s proposal to use federal funds to bring broadband internet access to unserved areas, Gov. Josh Stein announced Monday.
Under the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, North Carolina can award more than $300 million to projects aimed at expanding high-speed internet service to more than 93,000 homes, businesses, and other community institutions across the state. BEAD allocated $1.53 billion overall for broadband expansion in North Carolina. 
“Reliable high-speed internet opens doors of opportunity,” Stein said in a statement. “Broadband empowers students to learn, helps businesses grow, supports our health care system, and strengthens our economy. With this additional funding, we’re moving one step closer to connecting every household and community in the state.”
These projects will begin in mid-2026. In the meantime, the American Rescue Plan Act has contributed $670 million towards broadband projects that will support faster internet service to more than 250,000 homes and businesses statewide by the end of 2026.
Following this approval, North Carolina will have more than $1 billion remaining in its BEAD funding. Stein wrote a letter to the Secretary of Commerce and the NTIA Administrator encouraging flexibility for using reserves to implement high-speed internet and connectivity.
The state could use this funding to address online safety and cybersecurity, advance workforce development and artificial intelligence, and improve infrastructure resiliency. By removing household barriers to connectivity, the state could also improve access to services like telehealth.
“This federal approval is a critical step in launching more high-speed internet projects across primarily rural areas to change people’s lives,” North Carolina Department of Information Technology Secretary and State Chief Information Officer Teena Piccione said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3910-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293
,DC,2025-12-22 19:25:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration pauses major East Coast offshore wind projects,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-pauses-major-east-coast-offshore-wind-projects,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s administration said Monday it’s halting leases for five large-scale offshore wind projects under construction along the East Coast due to national security risks.The Interior Department paused the projects — off the coasts of Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Virginia and New York — due to analysis from reports that have “long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference,” which poses a national security risk, according to a department release.“Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement alongside the announcement. The Interior Department said “the clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of the wind projects.” The department said leases for Vineyard Wind 1, off Massachusetts; Revolution Wind, off Rhode Island and Connecticut; Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind; along with Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind 1, off New York, have been paused “effective immediately.” The department noted that the pause would give it, the Defense Department and other agencies “time to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects.” The moves are part of the administration’s continued attacks against the renewable energy source, which have spilled into courts. A federal judge found this month that Trump’s January order halting permits for offshore wind projects was unlawful. ‘Desperate rerun’ The action drew swift backlash from major environmental advocacy groups and Democratic officials. Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. clean energy at Environmental Defense Fund, said in a Monday statement the administration is “again unlawfully blocking clean, affordable energy.”The administration has “baselessly and unlawfully attacked wind energy with delays, freezes and cancellations, while propping up aging, expensive coal plants that barely work and pollute our air,” Kelly added.Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, described the move as a “desperate rerun of the Trump administration’s failed attempt to kill offshore wind — an effort the courts have already rejected.” She added that many of the projects had already won approvals through “rigorous review” and court challenges.“Trying again to halt these projects tramples on the rule of law, threatens jobs, and deliberately sabotages a critical industry that strengthens, not weakens, America’s energy security,” she said. U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also weighed in, saying in a Monday social media post Trump was “trying AGAIN to kill thousands of good-paying union jobs and raise your electricity bill.”  The New York Democrat said he’s “been fighting Trump’s war against offshore wind — a war that threatens American jobs and American energy” and vowed to continue fighting “to make sure these projects, the thousands of jobs they create, and the energy they provide can continue.” Rhode Island lawmakers slam pause Lawmakers in Rhode Island were also quick to blast the administration’s effort, which affects the Revolution Wind project off its own coast.

Rep. Seth Magaziner said that “at a time when working people in Rhode Island are struggling with high costs on everything, Trump should not be canceling energy projects that are nearly ready to deliver reliable power to the grid at below-market rates and help lower costs.” The Rhode Island Democrat rebuked the administration’s claims that Revolution Wind and the other offshore wind projects present national security concerns as “unfounded,” noting that “the Department of Defense thoroughly reviewed and signed off on this project during the permitting and approval process.” Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said in a statement Monday that Revolution Wind “was long ago thoroughly vetted and fully permitted by the federal government, and that review included any potential national security questions.” Whitehouse, the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the move “looks more like the kind of vindictive harassment we have come to expect from the Trump administration than anything legitimate.” “This is President Donald ‘Stop Work’ Trump trying to keep affordable, clean energy off the grid, without a care about how many working people have to lose their jobs to keep his fossil fuel billionaires happy,” he said. In a statement Monday, Sen. Jack Reed noted that amid an increase in energy prices, policymakers should be promoting new energy sources.“Trump’s repeated attacks on offshore wind are holding our nation back, increasing energy bills, and hurting our economy,” the Rhode Island Democrat said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Between a trade war with China, rising costs for farming equipment and supplies and low prices, farmers have seen a perfect storm of economic uncertainty. 
“It’s been a doozy of a year for agriculture,” said Rob Baker, a Mississippi soybean farmer and Director of the American Soybean Association. 
Soybeans are the second-largest agricultural product in Mississippi behind chickens. Valued at around $1.6 billion a year, almost all of the state’s soybeans are destined for international markets. 
China is the world’s largest importer, but in May, it stopped buying soybeans in response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. China did not place its first order until October, just before Trump met with China’s President Xi Jinping. This period of uncertainty left American soybean farmers in limbo.
The White House has said that China committed to buying 12 million metric tons of soybeans from the U.S., but so far it has only bought 332,000 metric tons. This has led to concerns about whether it will keep its promises, but Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said that China is still on track to keep up its end of the deal. 
This year’s tariffs alone didn’t cause the challenges but they did exacerbate existing problems soybean farmers were facing. In fact, farmers are still experiencing impacts of a 2018 trade war.
In May, Will Maples, an assistant professor of agricultural economics at Mississippi State University Extension Service told Mississippi Today that some of the economic challenges soybean farmers were facing were “kind of a holdover from the last 2018 trade war we had with China.”
The 2018 trade war saw some of the lowest levels in soybean purchases in the last 10 years. China has steadily invested in developing partners in other countries such as Brazil, putting further pressure on American farmers.
Even apart from global trade relations, farmers have struggled with historically high input costs for everything from seed and fertilizer to labor. On top of that, prices have dropped for soybeans and other row crops. High costs and low crop prices mean farmers face slim-to-no profit margins.  
In October, Duane Dunlap, president of DNS Commodities, told the Mississippi Senate Agriculture Committee, “It’s a real dilemma for us  in Mississippi and the Delta trying to decide where we go from here with our soybean crop.” 
Baker says the industry is looking for “more diverse uses for soy and new trading partners.” Some ideas include biodiesel, using soybeans in tires and more. 
Crop diversification presents its own challenges. Despite the challenges, soybeans are slightly better off than other row crops, such as cotton. Diversification isn’t as easy as just planting something new. It requires infrastructure to transport it and support the industry, which would take time and money to build.
While there are national and global forces at play, there are some ideas for what can be done in Mississippi. One idea that was floated at a recent state agriculture legislative committee meeting was building a processing plant in the state to create more demand and expand capabilities. 
In early December, the Trump administration announced a $12 billion bailout for farmers with funding coming from the Department of Agriculture’s Farmer Bridge Assistance program. The aid will help farmers mitigate their losses from this year and get loans to buy supplies for the next planting season. While many details haven’t been released, Baker says that the package is “a good start.” 
While 2025 has been a rough year, Baker says that he’s “starting to see a little bit of optimism” among soybean farmers who are hoping to return to profitability in 2026.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/06213500/IMG_0328.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Updated 4:22 p.m.
Rutland County State’s Attorney Ian Sullivan has issued a Brady letter against retiring Rutland City Police Chief Brian Kilcullen and retired Rutland City Police Commander Sam Delpha, accusing them of suppressing a report critical of officers’ actions in a deadly chase.
Sullivan’s letter stated that the two had improperly failed to disclose the findings of the internal affairs report that sharply criticized police officers for their roles in the vehicle pursuit that killed a fellow officer and led to a murder charge against the fleeing driver.
The prosecutor’s letter was sent Monday to defense attorneys in Rutland County. Often termed a “Brady” or “Giglio” letter, the names refer to national court cases. The letters are filed when an officer’s credibility is called into question, and can often effectively end a law enforcement career because prosecutors may decide not to take cases the officer had investigated due to the credibility concerns raised in the letter.

The internal affairs report became public through a court filing by the lawyer for the Salisbury man, 22-year-old Tate Rheaume, facing an aggravated murder charge in the death of the officer, 19-year-old Jessica Ebbighausen, during the high-speed chase in Rutland in July 2023. 
The action Monday by Sullivan comes two days after the Rutland City Police Commission held a special meeting where it announced that Kilcullen, who had been city police chief since 2015, would be retiring early, effective March 1. 
According to the public statement Saturday from the commission, supervisory oversight of the department has been passed to Rutland City Police Commander Matthew Prouty, who will serve as interim police chief with Kilcullen providing support to him during the transition.
The internal report, conducted and authored by Delpha, found that Ebbighausen’s death was “preventable” if police had followed proper procedures. Ebbighausen had only joined the department a few weeks earlier as a new recruit.
Rheaume, who was driving the vehicle pursued by police that day, has been held in jail without bail awaiting trial on a murder charge in Ebbighausen’s death. 
VTDigger reported on the investigation’s findings earlier this month, and Seven Days reported that Kilcullen had known about the report but had not discussed its contents with the police commission, the civilian panel charged with providing oversight of the police department.
According to Sullivan’s letter, despite assurances that his office would be kept “in the loop” about the completion of the internal investigation, he wasn’t told when it was done. 
Kilcullen, a footnote in the letter stated, had reported to the Rutland City Police Commission that the report was finished in March 2025. 
“Despite the numerous requests for information about the timing of completion of the internal investigation and a commitment by the former City Attorney to do so,” Sullivan wrote, “Chief Kilcullen did not inform the State’s Attorney’s Office that the internal investigation was complete in March of 2025, April of 2025, May of 2025, June of 2025, July of 2025, August of 2025, or September of 2025.”
Also, according to Sullivan, Kilcullen did not disclose to the police commission the contents of the report or its findings. The findings only became public when David Sleigh, Rheaume’s attorney, subpoenaed the report and eventually filed it in court as part of a defense motion.  
In his letter, Sullivan wrote that at a meeting of the police commission earlier this month, a commissioner asked Kilcullen why he withheld the report, and Kilcullen allegedly replied, “to avoid potentially impacting” the criminal case against Rheaume.
“The prosecution did not tell Chief Kilcullen that suppression of evidence favorable to the defense is acceptable,” Sullivan wrote in his letter. “Quite to the contrary, we sought the internal investigation materials so we could disclose them to the defense.”
The prosecutor added that Kilcullen’s statements to Seven Days and the police commission “demonstrate that he suppressed evidence favorable to the defendant in a criminal case in an attempt to shape the trial.”
“Despite reaching conclusions that were favorable to a criminal defendant, retired Commander Delpha did not provide this information to the Rutland County State’s Attorney’s Office,” Sullivan wrote.
Neither Kilcullen nor Delpha, who retired earlier this year, could immediately be reached Monday for comment.
It’s not clear what, if any, role Sullivan’s letter played in Kilcullen’s decision to retire early. Kilcullen’s most recent contract was extended in June and was set to expire in 2027.
Sullivan said in an interview Monday he didn’t notify Kilcullen ahead of time that he would be issuing a Brady letter. He said that last week he did “convey” to Rutland City Mayor Michael Doenges the same concerns he raised in the letter.
“I said I would be taking further action, or words to that effect,” Sullivan said he told the mayor.
Asked what impact the Brady letter would have on the ongoing prosecution of the criminal case against Rheaume, Sullivan replied, “I can’t offer any additional comment.” 
Also Monday, Sleigh, Rheaume’s attorney, wrote an email to several entities, including to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, regarding Kilcullen. 
Kilcullen “deliberately withheld exculpatory evidence to influence the outcome of a murder case and to prejudice the Defendant’s right to a fair trial,” Sleigh wrote in the email, adding, “I am asking each of you to investigate, prosecute and discipline the former Chief formally and thoroughly.”
Lauren Jandl, the attorney general’s chief of staff, said in an email Monday that the office had received Sleigh’s request. 
“As the concerns identified in the email relate to an ongoing criminal case, we would refer you to the Rutland County State’s Attorney’s Office,” Jandl said.

Patrick Morrisey moves forward with efforts to more than triple West Virginia’s electric generating capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050 — dubbed the “50 by 50” generation plan — the state Office of Energy is seeking public comments to help shape the policies, according to social media posts from the agency.
Public comments on the proposed energy policies are due by 5 p.m. on Dec. 26. According to the Office of Energy, all comments must be limited to five pages and should not include any supporting documents, including scientific studies or data sets. Any comments longer than five pages will be entirely disregarded. 
Comments can be submitted via email to WVOEInfo@WV.gov or sent by mail to the West Virginia Office of Energy, c/o Energy Policy Comments at 1900 Kanawha Blvd. East, Bldg. 3 Ste 500, Charleston, WV, 25305. Contact information should be included in all comments submitted.
The public comment period opened on Dec. 9. No official announcement of the public comment period has been made outside of the agency’s social media channels, which have limited followings. Its Facebook shows 211 followers, with two posts made about the public comment period receiving four total shares. Its X account has 27 followers, and the platform shows relevant posts received 35 total views. The office’s LinkedIn reports 836 followers and posts about the comment period received 34 “likes” but no shares.

The West Virginia Office of Energy’s posts soliciting public comments for the state’s 50 by 50 power generation plan. Requests for public comments on the policy have only been made via the office’s limited social media channels.
The plan being commented on is relatively conceptual, as it doesn’t rely on existing or proposed legislative rules or code. Generally, the proposed policy would see West Virginia increase its electric generating capacity from 15 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts over the next 25 years. Morrisey’s attempt to increase the state’s energy production comes from expected rises in demand on the PJM, which is the massive power grid network that West Virginia feeds into.
PJM predicts that, by 2030, peak demand on the grid will grow by 32 gigawatts. By 2045, Morrisey told reporters earlier this year, that need could grow to 70 gigawatts. That is partially due to nearly 40 gigawatts of the PJM’s generating capacity being slated to be retired by 2030.
A majority of the forecasted increases in peak demand — which could mean higher utility rates and less reliability for customers that depend on the grid for power — are due to the addition of data centers. By 2030, for example, all but two of the 32 gigawatts in increased peak demand is estimated to come from data centers being added to the grid.
The limited specifics that have been made available regarding Morrisey’s 50 by 50 generation plan do not include details on the development of data centers or concerns over their outsized power needs. In September, when Morrisey unveiled the plan, he did not mention how data centers were largely responsible for the increased power demand that the 50 by 50 plan is attempting to confront. 
Instead, he said that data centers will be necessary developments in West Virginia in order to stave off growing energy and technological threats from China. The state, he continued, will partner with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to assist with “crafting our data center development strategy.”
The components of Morrisey’s plan that the Office of Energy is requesting comment on are as follows:

Transmission line plans that will “serve as a blueprint” for how potential future power generation will flow through the state from where it is generated to where it is most needed. This will include where natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines will be built to transport the new base generation, with an emphasis on providing more electricity in areas that lack sufficient service in order to increase potential economic development.
The “State Energy Security Plan,” a newly created strategy meant to increase resiliency and security throughout the state’s power grid. The plan, per the Office of Energy, aims to “provide resilience against physical and cyber threats” on the grid and stabilize costs while ensuring electricity remains reliable. Specifically, the plan will include taking inventory of energy resources and “critical energy infrastructure,” identify emergency response protocols, coordinate partnerships with federal and state resources as well as the private sector and conduct “regular tabletop and field exercises” to simulate responses to grid disruptions or attacks.
Separate strategic development plans for all of the state’s energy resources — namely coal, natural gas, geothermals, nuclear, hydroelectric, hydrogen, wind and solar — to show how they will grow over the next 25 years. The plans will touch on numerous topics, including how the energy sources will increase generation capacity, contribute to economic development opportunities, build up workforces, construct necessary infrastructure and impact the environment, among other topics.

One new addition to the state’s energy profile could be nuclear energy, which Morrisey said he wants to see the state explore in coming years. West Virginia currently has no nuclear energy developments operating. In 2022, however, lawmakers passed a bill repealing the state’s previous ban on nuclear energy, paving the way for future generation. 
Morrisey said earlier this year that while all forms of energy in the state need to be embraced, opportunities for renewable energy — like solar and wind — will be limited. Instead, he said, natural gas and continued use of coal will likely dominate the state’s energy economy under his proposed plan.
He told reporters that he not only wants to keep the state’s current coal plants operational, but he also plans to explore options for newly created coal-generated power plants.
“We will never turn our backs on our existing coal plants and we will work with the federal government to pursue new coal-fired generation,” he said in September.
Most of the state’s existing coal plants were commissioned decades ago and upgraded since then to remain operational. No new large coal-fired power plants have been commissioned in West Virginia or elsewhere in the United States in over 10 years.
Coal is one of the dirtiest and the most expensive forms of energy. Reliance on it has made electricity more expensive for consumers — especially in West Virginia.
According to a 2022 review of electric utilities across the country, West Virginians paid the third highest total household electricity costs as a percentage of their income. Alabama and Mississippi, according to the study from the consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, were the only states where prices outpaced that of the Mountain State.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Monday that federal funding is available for local, tribal and state governments and certain nonprofit organizations that offer essential services for emergency work, repairs or replacement of damaged infrastructure.
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly requested from Trump in September a major presidential disaster declaration after severe storms from July 17-22 hit Barton, Comanche, Edwards, Hodgeman, Logan, Morris, Ottawa, Rawlins, Saline, Stevens, Sumner and Wyandotte counties.
“I am grateful that this request for federal assistance has been approved,” Kelly said in a Monday news release from the Kansas Adjutant General’s Department. “These federal funds will go a long way in supporting these counties as they rebuild their infrastructure.”
Kelly has requested an additional major presidential disaster declaration for severe storms and flooding that occurred from Sept. 8-10 in Ellsworth, Lincoln, Ottawa and Saline counties. She also declared on Thursday a state of emergency disaster for wildfire danger, which allows the state to assist counties and local responders. Unseasonably warm temperatures and strong winds created high fire danger across the state, the adjutant general’s department said in a Thursday announcement.
Bill Waln, fire management officer with the Kansas Forest Service, said conditions are expected to remain favorable to wildfires.
“We ask the public to limit activities that could produce a spark, helping reduce the risk of new fires and allowing first responders to spend the holiday season with their families rather than fighting fires,” Waln said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gettyimages-2251825336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

The affordability crisis plaguing the American economy continues to grow more serious, and if there is a most visible sector of the economy for which soaring prices are causing the most havoc, it has to be housing. Across the country, the skyrocketing cost of housing – both for purchase and rent – is conspiring to swell the ranks of Americans who are inadequately housed, or even completely homeless.
What’s more and quite maddeningly, this disastrous trend is being abetted by the Trump administration and its congressional allies, who have made it a priority to abandon the federal government’s proven “housing first” policy in favor of a mishmash of poorly funded alternatives and coercive tactics that some advocates characterize as an attack on homeless people. And recently to learn more about where things stand and what advocates are doing to push back, Newsline caught up with the executive director of the North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness, Dr. Latonya L.

When veteran journalist and advocate Bob Phillips took over as executive director of Common Cause of North Carolina a quarter century ago, he was the organization’s sole staff member and the work he pursued to fight for fair elections, voting rights and honest government could often be a lonely effort. Today, as he prepares to retire next month, he’s no longer quite so lonely – with a staff of 15 Common Cause North Carolina is now the organization’s largest state affiliate – but many of the battles he fights remain daunting and uphill affairs.
Especially when it comes to elections and combating the gerrymandering that allows politicians to rig their outcomes, Common Cause and its allies continue to face stiff headwinds from President Trump and his allies in Congress, state legislatures and the federal courts. And yet, as Bob reminded Newsline when we talked last week, there remain simple and doable fixes that could return fairness to our elections, and there are many reasons to believe caring and thinking Americans will be able to make them a reality in the not too distant future.

 Gov. Greg Gianforte requested the presidential declaration on Dec. 16, seeking federal funds and assistance from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to support emergency response costs in Lincoln and Sanders counties and the Blackfeet Nation.
“Thanks to President Trump’s quick response, Montana is securing the additional resources our communities need to respond to this emergency,” Gianforte said in a statement. “While we assess the damage caused to critical infrastructure, this federal support will ensure the continued health and safety of all Montanans affected.”
 Montana’s U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy and U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke had also signed onto a letter to Trump urging him to approve the request for an emergency declaration.
President Trump’s approval of the emergency declaration allows up to $5 million in federal funds to become available for emergency response measures, according to the governor’s office.
As additional damage assessments are completed, Montana Disaster and Emergency Services will coordinate with the governor to request a major disaster declaration. A major declaration request is required to cover disaster related costs that exceed this initial support.

In Libby, the municipal water supply remains under a boil water order.
Late Thursday afternoon, Montana DEQ received and reviewed the Libby water sample test results for inorganics (heavy metals), according to an update from the county. The test did not detect any contaminants of concern in the municipal water system that would require a do not consume advisory, according to Lincoln County Health Department.
However, because turbidity due to the flooding continues to be an issue with the water source, the boil order will remain until further notice. The county health department said residents should plan on the boil order remaining in place for “some time.” 
Tap water should be boiled for drinking, cooking, brushing teeth, and food preparation unless using bottled water. The county will share updates as soon as conditions change and the boil water order is lifted.
Bottled water is available for residents who need it and is being distributed at the Red Cross Shelter located at the Memorial Center, 111 E. Lincoln Boulevard in Libby.

The purpose: Block construction of a large warehouse on a bucolic former corporate campus near a legislator’s home in Middlebury.
Two years later, lawyers for the would-be developer allege in a federal lawsuit that the legislation targeting his project and overruling local zoning was unconstitutional, a “brazen” violation of the equal protection clauses of the U.S. and Connecticut constitutions.
The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of Southford Park LLC, the owner of the targeted property, seeks millions of dollars in damages from Middlebury, claiming the Waterbury suburb illegally relied on the unconstitutional language to stop the project and devalue the land’s worth by 90%.
The General Assembly, which generally has immunity against claims for civil damages, is not a defendant, but the behind-the-scenes actions of lawmakers could come under rare scrutiny as the claims against Middlebury are pursued.
“We think that the intent that legislators had and the process that they followed to enact the statute is going to be relevant to those claims,” said David R. Roth, a partner with the law firm, Wiggin & Dana. 
Roth filed the suit on behalf of Southford Park — whose principal is David Drubner — and an adjacent property owner, Route 188 LLC. Assisting Roth is Jed Rubenfeld, a constitutional scholar on the faculty of Yale Law School.
The suit asks the court to consider the “rat,” the colorful term for a favor snuck into an unrelated piece of legislation, an “abuse of the legislative process” that “arbitrarily and irrationally deprived Southford Park and Route 188 of their protected property interests.”
Together, the lawsuit says, damages could exceed $27 million.
Drubner had a contract to sell the site for $25 million, contingent on final zoning approvals for what he called “an intermediate storage warehouse,” to Flint Development of Kansas, a builder and operator of industrial logistics facilities. The rat and Middlebury’s subsequent denial killed the deal, he said.
Neither Drubner nor Flint had a tenant lined up for what opponents had mischaracterized as a distribution center akin to an Amazon fulfillment facility Drubner said.
“They’ve characterized this as a distribution center like the Amazon thing. We specifically do not have approval for that. It’s just an intermediate storage warehouse,” Drubner said.
Defendants in the lawsuit include Middlebury, its Zoning Board of Appeals and zoning enforcement officer, and its new chief elected officer, First Selectwoman Jennifer A. Mahr, who easily won the open seat last month as an unaffiliated candidate in a three-way race against a Democrat and a Republican.
Mahr is being sued only in her official capacity — as are the other individual defendants — meaning any liability rests with the town of 8,000 residents. But she has had a prime role in thwarting Drubner’s project as a founder of the Middlebury Small Town Alliance, a group that sued the town to stop the project.
She could not be reached for comment about the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday and was expected to be served Monday on Middlebury. Her long-serving predecessor, Edward B. St. John, a Republican who supports the Drubner project as needed to expand a limited tax base, declined comment on the litigation.
Rep. William Pizzuto, R-Middlebury, acknowledged to the Connecticut Mirror two years ago he sought the legislative intervention as his neighbors and other opponents failed to stop the project through more conventional means, including an appeal of the local planning and conservation approvals in court.
He said Friday he sees nothing wrong in the General Assembly involving itself in a local zoning controversy after local options were exhausted.
“I don’t think anything was done improperly, except to say we’re here to represent the people of this town,” said Pizzuto, who lives about 100 yards from the bottom of the long drive leading to the proposed construction site, the former corporate headquarters of the Timex Group. 
As Pizzuto acknowledges and the plaintiffs’ lawyers assert, the one-sentence rat now ensconced as Section 8-3m of the Connecticut General Statutes was drawn to block Southford Park without naming it. 
“By design, on the date it was enacted into law, the text of § 8-3m fit the Southford Road Warehouse Project like a glove, because the statute was enacted precisely and specifically to block the Project,” the lawsuit reads.
The language bans communities with populations between 6,000 and 8,000, as determined by the 2020 census, from permitting any warehouse or distribution facility exceeding 100,000 square feet on any site that is smaller than 150 acres, has more more than five acres of wetlands and is within two miles of a school.
While the estimated population of Middlebury now could exceed 8,000, the 2020 census pegged it as 7,574. The size of the site and proposed facility fall within the parameters, it had 7.2 acres of wetlands as originally proposed, and is within one mile of a school.
The lawsuit says “the statute arbitrarily combines a hodgepodge of wholly unrelated factors and criteria” with no rational purpose.
It notes the only use banned by Section 8-3m are warehouses and distribution centers, not presumably more impactful things such as “chemical production facilities, pharmaceutical production facilities, bus terminals, truck terminals, pig farms, oil refineries, leather tanning facilities, prisons, commercial dry cleaning facilities, sewage treatment facilities, or even nuclear waste storage facilities.” 
The references to wetlands and a school are similarly suspect, the suit says, as the language ”would permit any of these intensive, dangerous, environmentally hazardous facilities to be approved on property consisting entirely of wetlands located right next door to an elementary school.”
Keith R. Ainsworth, the lawyer who successfully sued to block the project on behalf of the Middlebury Small Town Alliance, said Section 8-3m will be judged by whether it meets constitutional standards, not the messiness or machination surrounding its origin story.
“The Constitution doesn’t regulate how the legislature formulates its rules. It just looks at, ‘Is the rule compliant with the Constitution?’ Whether the legislature does it with some robust debate, or they don’t do it with a debate, or they do it through some clunky legislative process, that’s not subject to question,” Ainsworth said.
The process doesn’t have to be pretty, he said. 
“I mean, we as citizens may look at that and go, ‘That’s a crazy-ass way to make laws.’ And that’s a legitimate way to feel about it,” Ainsworth said.
Ainsworth said even if the law is deemed unconstitutional, demanding damages from Middlebury is overreach, “a money grab.”
“If you take as face value that the law is unconstitutional, they may well be entitled to injunctive relief, but to say that the town is now liable for damages for following the law seems to be” without basis, he said. “They didn’t illegally apply the law. They applied the law as it was written.”
There is precedent for striking down a Connecticut law aimed at blocking a specific project. In 2001, the Connecticut Supreme Court found that an environmental law drawn in 1997 to stop the expansion of a recycling facility in Stamford had no rational basis and violated constitutional equal protection standards.
As originally drafted, the Middlebuy rat — that would have applied to any community with fewer than 8,000 people — prompted a furious complaint from Rep. Tami Zawistowki, R-East Granby. Her town of 5,215 would have been affected, killing the potential development of distribution facilities in a community close to Bradley International Airport.
Zawistowski said she wanted the entire rat killed. Instead, it was revised to limit its reach by exempting communities of fewer than 6,000, sparing East Granby and dozens of other small towns. A distribution center has since been proposed on a site in East Granby similar to the one in Middlebury, unaffected by 8-3m because its population was 785 people shy of 6,000 in the 2020 census.
Who precisely drafted the language never was publicly disclosed, and the lawsuit might test whether the constitutional notion of legislative privilege protects lawmakers from disclosing the origin.
Pizzuto has acknowledged asking House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, to help stop the project with a line inserted in the budget. Candelora said legislative privilege should not be asserted.
“I don’t think we should be hiding anything,” Candelora said.
Candelora said at least one of the two state Capitol lobbyists who live in Middlebury spoke to him about it, but no one has claimed authorship. To get the line in the budget required the assent of the governor’s staff and the four legislative caucuses.
Candelora said he was sympathetic to Pizzuto and his constituents, because the project required a text change — lifting the height limit in Middlebury’s industrial warehouse zone from 35 feet to 50 feet — and he believed that local zoning authorities too readily make text changes without public input.
“I think there always is a tendency to solve issues,” Candelora said Friday of the legislative action. “I don’t think the legislature acted with malice.”
Drubner’s project would redevelop the former headquarters of the Timex Group, a corporate descendant of the Waterbury Clock Company, founded in 1854. Timex sold the 93-acre site to Drubner and another entity in 2023 and moved to its present leased headquarters in Shelton.
Timex built the hilltop headquarters, dubbed Watch Hill, in 2001, about the same time that homes were popping up nearby on what had been farmland and hardwood forest, creating a constituency that later would prove unhappy with changes to the site. The Timex building was set into a drumlin, an elongated hillside formed by a retreating glacier. 
It won plaudits for its architecture and sensitive landscape design, and a newly created group, Save Historic Middlebury, filed an application last year to place the site on the National Register of Historic Places. It was denied, falling short of the 50-year age typically required to be considered a historic place.

Drubner’s plan calls for demolition of the building. With a moribund commercial office market, there is little demand for an iconic corporate headquarters on a sprawling suburban campus. Similarly, a larger complex vacated by a downsizing IBM in neighboring Southbury has not found a buyer. 
Drubner thought he had found a workaround to Section 8-3m. By downsizing the proposed facility, originally planned for about 720,000 square feet, to 669,000 square feet, the developer also could shrink the land necessary for the buildings, drainage and parking.
After making lot line adjustments, the construction site had 77 acres and only 3.8 acres of wetlands — under the five-acre wetlands reference in 8-3m.
Middlebury Small Town Alliance and several individuals challenged the legitimacy of the change made by Drubner.
“He irrationally subdivides the property and cuts out the wetlands so that doesn’t apply,” Ainsworth said. “So, he was playing exactly the same game that he’s now saying was inappropriate.”
On Jan. 31, 2025, a Superior Court judge agreed, ruling that the limits imposed by 8-3m still applied to the project. Mahr, who had been elected to the Board of Selectmen in 2023, running on her opposition to Drubner, opposed the town filing an appeal.
Her critics alleged a conflict of interest, and the local ethics commission later agreed. Mahr, in a business filing to the secretary of the state’s office on Nov. 26, notified the state she no longer was a managing member of the entity that sued the community she now leads.
Last month, Middlebury’s zoning enforcement officer denied final approval of Southford Park. The explanation, according to the lawsuit, was “while the Project was fully entitled to approval under all other applicable law, it could not be approved under § 8-3m.”
Southford Park LLC appealed the Superior Court decision to the state Appellate Court on Dec. 8, saying the judge misread the law. It is now asking a federal court to strike down 8-3m in its entirety.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1628-2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

The Department of the Interior made the announcement, referencing “national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports.”
The announcement applies to the Vineyard Wind 1 project that has been moving ahead off the Nantucket coast and is currently delivering about 400 megawatts of energy to the New England electric grid.
The Trump administration said the pause will give agencies time “to work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects.”
“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement. “Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers.”
The Interior Department said following leases are paused:

Vineyard Wind 1 (OCS-A 0501)
Revolution Wind (OCS-A 0486)
CVOW – Commercial (OCS-A 0483)
Sunrise Wind (OCS-A 0487)
Empire Wind 1 (OCS-A 0512)

The pause was announced in a press release that cited “risks inherent to large-scale offshore wind projects.”
“Unclassified reports from the US Government have long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference called ‘clutter,’ ” the release said. “The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of the wind projects,” the release said. “The Department of Energy in a 2024 report stated that a radar’s threshold for false alarm detection can be increased to reduce some clutter, but an increased detection threshold could cause the radar to ‘miss actual targets.’ “
The Conservation Law Foundation noted that a federal judge in the State of New York v. Trump last week issued a judgment invalidating the Trump administration’s moratorium on offshore wind permitting.
“This is a desperate rerun of the Trump administration’s failed attempt to kill offshore wind – an effort the courts have already rejected,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at CLF. “Many of these clean energy projects passed years of rigorous review, were upheld in court, and are moving forward. Trying again to halt these projects tramples on the rule of law, threatens jobs, and deliberately sabotages a critical industry that strengthens, not weakens, America’s energy security.”
The Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance said the wind projects “should be shelved in the best interest of ratepayers.”
“Gov. Maura Healey and her administration have championed offshore wind but that doesn’t change the fact that it is one of the most expensive forms of energy in America,” alliance director Paul Craney said. “Massachusetts and New England ratepayers desperately need inexpensive, clean, reliable, American natural gas to help drive down costs, not more expensive offshore wind energy and arbitrary climate mandates.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Vineyard-Wind-turbine-edited-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Former Kansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Lawton Nuss joined about 50 counterparts around the country to establish the Alliance of Former Chief Justices, a nonpartisan group dedicated to promoting the rule of law and judicial independence.
In a conversation for the Kansas Reflector podcast, Nuss outlined the mission of the new alliance and talked about threats he faced before retiring from the bench in 2019.
“The alliance is designed to repair whatever damage there may have been done to the rule of law in the United States, and we’re going to try to repair that by speaking on podcasts such as this, giving speeches, writing op-eds, aligning with some civic organizations and giving presentations to remind people about our three branches of government and how they all work,” Nuss said.


Nuss said the alliance was interested in restoring the balance of power among judicial, executive and legislative branches. The alliance is supported by Keep Our Republic, which works to preserve democracy.
The dangers range from threats of physical violence, like one left on a voice mail for Nuss while he served on the court, to public comments about how judges should rule, to efforts by other branches of government to exert their influence.
“There are pressures brought to bear on courts, judges,” Nuss said. “Somebody may be trying to poison things or to influence the judge before the decision is made by spouting off to the media or sometimes writing letters to the judge in chambers, or an example that is very terrible in my mind is the judge gets a pizza delivered to the judge’s home, and the message is, I know where you live.”
Nuss is a Salina native and Marine Corps veteran who earned his law degree from the University of Kansas. He practiced law in his hometown for 20 years before Republican Gov. Bill Graves appointed him to the Kansas Supreme Court in 2002. He became chief judge in 2010, during an era when Republican Gov. Sam Brownback and the Legislature repeatedly clashed with the judicial branch.
Nuss pointed to several examples where he believed Brownback and the Legislature presented a danger to the rule of law.
In one example, the Legislature passed a law to change the way chief justices were selected for district courts and threatened to defund the judicial branch if it was struck down. A chief justice filed a lawsuit, the Supreme Court found the law unconstitutional, and the Legislature had to hurriedly pass a funding bill.
In another example, the Legislature considered a proposal to expand the grounds for impeaching Supreme Court justices. The law would have allowed justices to be removed for trying to take power away from other branches, reckless conduct or poor performance reviews.
“As I read that in the media, I thought, ‘That’s a new one on me, and I’m not sure where this is going to end up,’ ” Nuss said.
The bill didn’t pass.
The Legislature’s threats became a topic of conversation at national conferences Nuss attended.
“I would have other chiefs come to me and say: ‘Lawton, you need to clarify this. I’m hearing from our colleagues here that this and this and this and this is going on in Kansas. Certainly that is just a rumor, and that’s too ridiculous to be true.’ And I would say, ‘No, that’s what’s going on.’ And then they’d want to talk about it, and they’d shake their heads and say, ‘I don’t get it,’ ” Nuss said.
Earlier this month, the Alliance of Former Chief Justices issued a founding statement that outlined the importance of preserving judicial independence and keeping judges separate from the politics of the other two branches of government.
The justices said people with strong policy views “chafe under this system.” But attacks on the system, their statement said, “undermine the integrity of the rule of law” and “upset the careful balance” the Founding Fathers envisioned when they wrote the U.S. Constitution.
“Elected members of the executive and legislative branches serve the public by seeking to enact or implement their campaign promises,” the statement said. “Judges, however, have only one constituent: the rule of law. By their oath, judges promise equal justice to all without regard to means, position, background or social standing — and certainly without regard to politics.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC190971-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-22 16:07:16+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump administration pauses offshore Revolution Wind project — again,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/22/trump-administration-pauses-offshore-revolution-wind-project-again/,The administration said it's pausing leases for 5 large-scale offshore wind projects due to unspecified national security risks identified by the Pentagon.,"This story has been updated.
For a second time, the Trump administration ordered a halt in construction of the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project on Monday, this time as part of a larger offensive against five offshore wind farms along the East Coast. 
In an announcement Monday, the Interior Department said it was pausing federal leases for the five offshore projects, effective immediately. The agency said the pause would give its officials, along with the Department of Defense, more time to evaluate national security concerns and work with developers to come up with potential solutions. 
“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement explaining the decision. “Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our east coast population centers.”
In addition to Revolution Wind, the four other impacted projects are Massachusetts Vineyard Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind and two projects in New York, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.
The action marks the second time this year that the Trump administration has brought work on Revolution Wind to a standstill. 
The multibillion-dollar project is a collaboration between Danish energy company Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables. Ørsted is also the developer behind Sunrise Wind. In a statement Monday, Ørsted said it was complying with federal orders to suspend offshore activities on both projects. 
“Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously, together with its partners,” the company’s statement said. “This includes engagement with [the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] and other permitting agencies as well as the evaluation of potential legal proceedings.”
In August, BOEM issued a stop-work order that cited similar national security concerns. The project’s developers sued along with the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and eventually obtained an injunction from U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth, which allowed construction to resume. 
In a statement Monday morning, Attorney General William Tong called the administration’s latest action a “brazen” and “lawless” attempt to circumvent that ruling.
“The project has been vetted and approved through every layer of federal and state regulatory process, including a careful review of the issues raised in this announcement,” Tong said. “Every day this project is stalled is another day of lost work, another day of unaffordable energy costs, and other day burning fossil fuels when American-made clean energy is within reach.”
The attorney general added that his office is “evaluating all legal options.”
Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at Conservation Law Foundation, said in an emailed statement that the action, “is a desperate rerun of the Trump administration’s failed attempt to kill offshore wind — an effort the courts have already rejected.”
Federal officials said Monday that unclassified reports from the U.S. government have long found that the movement of massive turbine blades and the highly reflective towers create radar interference called “clutter.” The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of wind projects, the Interior Department said.
An Interior spokesman on Monday did not immediately respond to a request to provide the reports cited as rationale for the agency’s decision. 
President Donald Trump is a vocal critic of wind energy and has repeatedly made false and misleading claims about the impact turbines have on birds, whales and even diagnoses of cancer among humans. 
On his first day in office, Trump issued a moratorium on new offshore wind leases and ordered the Department of Interior to review its existing leases. In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, Secretary Burgum said that his office and defense officials had completed that task and determined that offshore turbines create “genuine risk for the U.S., particularly related to where they are in proximity to our East Coast population centers.”
Supporters of offshore wind projects, meanwhile, have cast doubt on the government’s claims. Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of BOEM, told the Connecticut Mirror earlier this year said that potential national security concerns were reviewed by several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.
“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” Klein said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”
Judge Lamberth, the Reagan appointee who ordered work to resume on Revolution Wind in September, also said in his ruling that the federal government had failed to provide evidence supporting its claims. 
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, released a statement Monday pointing out that both Congress and the Department of Defense have rejected claims that offshore wind projects negatively impact national security. 
“The Trump Administration promised to cut energy prices in half,” Courtney said. “We know that President Trump has a longstanding personal vendetta against offshore wind. Pausing these projects without any real justification will do nothing but increase costs for rate payers and eliminate good paying jobs for the building trades.”
Much of the work on Revolution Wind is taking place at the State Pier in New London. There, more than 100 workers are assigned to the project’s staging area offloading massive turbine blades and tower components and then hoisting the parts onto specially-designed ships to be taken out to the assembly area off the coast of Block Island. 
Offshore construction is already 85% completed, according to the developers. In earlier filings with the court, Ørsted officials said the previous stop-work order cost the project more than $2 million a day and that canceling it altogether would incur over $1 billion in additional costs. (Another project targeted in Monday’s announcement, Sunrise Wind, is also being staged at the State Pier.)
If completed, Revolution Wind would supply enough electricity to the New England electric grid to power roughly 350,000 homes. The cost of that electricity is to be supported by power purchase agreements with utility customers in Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
Keith Brothers, the president of the Connecticut Building and Construction Trades Council, said he was monitoring the situation at the State Pier but was not aware of any immediate layoffs of unionized workers as a result of Monday’s actions.
“We would hate to see the members get a Christmas gift like that, you lose your job,” Brothers said. “This isn’t the time of the year to do that.” 
In addition to the 1,200 jobs directly supported by the project, Brothers said the offshore wind industry employs thousands of longshoremen as well as crews building turbine-installation vessels at a shipyard in Texas. 
“It’s kind of a domino effect, when you stop one thing, you’re stopping four or five different industries,” Brothers said. “This thing is rolling. You don’t stop a building when it’s halfway to three quarters of the way done. You keep going, right?”
In a statement Monday, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said the state will “stand up to the Trump administration” and ensure the project keeps going. 
“This is yet another erratic, anti-business move by the Trump administration that will drive up the price of electricity in Connecticut and throughout the region,” Lamont said. “At a time when my administration is working tirelessly to ensure Connecticut has a diverse energy supply and lower utility costs for families and businesses, the White House continues to be an obstacle.”

In late 2023, an unlikely state in the country’s industrial heartland passed nation-leading climate laws—Michigan. The “bold” and “ambitious” plan drew praise for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a potential Democratic 2028 presidential candidate.
But the laws, which require Michigan to generate all of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040, are likely going to be derailed.
Soon after they were signed, Whitmer backed tax incentive bills for energy-hungry data centers. An “off ramp” provision in the climate laws allows fossil fuel plants to stay online or be built past 2040 if clean energy can’t meet demand. The data centers are already poised to trigger the off ramp and utilities are planning new gas plants.
“Anything positive was effectively undone by the data center tax credits, and we’re seeing that now,” said Dylan Wegela, a Democratic Socialist state representative.

Though many Democrats pushed for requirements for data centers to generate their own renewable energy and save the climate law, Whitmer publicly did nothing to preserve her signature environmental measure. The apparent lack of interest “shows where the priorities are,” said Christy McGillivray, previously a lobbyist with Sierra Club Michigan, which fought to save the climate laws.
Wegela echoed that: “Not saying anything is also saying something in another way.”
The likely death of Whitmer’s climate bills is emblematic of the broader frustration and tension in how Whitmer approached environmental issues. Her 2018 win generated optimism in the wake of the environmentally disastrous era under former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder that culminated in the Flint water crisis.
But when conflicts between the interests of polluters who served Whitmer’s economic agenda and public health arose, the governor virtually always sided with industry, which often included large campaign donors, sources said. Nearly 25 legislators, environmental activists, attorneys and residents spoke with Inside Climate News for this story.
“You’re either going to fight for the environment or you’re not, and she didn’t,” said a former legislator who introduced environmental bills that did not move. They did not use their name to speak freely without retribution.
As Whitmer approaches her final year in office, virtually every major item on environmental groups’ wish list remains.
Among those: “polluter pay” legislation, community solar, fixing hobbled regulatory agencies, water affordability, addressing air pollution in overburdened neighborhoods, protections from data center pollution, killing Enbridge’s Line 5 oil pipeline and water infrastructure repairs to protect metro Detroit from climate change-induced flooding.
Perhaps most frustratingly for advocates, dozens of measures aimed at reforming the deeply unpopular monopoly utilities, DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, failed.
“It’s really been disappointing overall in terms of thinking about what could have been accomplished but wasn’t,” the former legislator said.
Though sources criticized the Whitmer administration, all agreed it has managed the environment better than any previous GOP administrations. And they pointed to positives—the repeal of a Snyder-era law that prohibited the state from putting in place stricter pollution limits than the EPA, a law that requires lead filters in schools and moderately stricter regulatory oversight of utilities by Whitmer appointees.
A Whitmer spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Sources also said the Whitmer administration was not solely to blame, and pointed to pro-business Democrats in the legislature and industry influence across the state government as significant obstacles to the environmental agenda. Michigan’s campaign finance laws are lax, dark money flows with little oversight and many of Whitmer’s biggest donors staunchly opposed environmental priorities. Among those are DTE Energy, and groups that represent major polluters, like the Michigan Chamber of Commerce and Michigan Manufacturers Association.
DTE Energy, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce and Michigan Manufacturers Association did not respond to requests for comment.
“The pattern in Lansing has been when something is going to cause the big corporations to pay, environmental proposals will stall,” said Jenn Hill, a former Democratic state representative from Marquette in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.
Whitmer’s environmental inaction may also have to do with potential political ambitions, said Chris Gilmer-Hill, policy associate with the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition.

“The lane that she sees for herself is a pro-business moderate that ‘brought manufacturing back to Michigan,’ and she sees that path as involving working with corporations and giving them handouts so she has a record of economic development to run on,” Gilmer-Hill said.
Whitmer has touted her job creation progress spurred by astronomical levels of corporate subsidies. Through April, the administration during its tenure had promised $2.46 billion in tax incentives to businesses. About $1 billion had been paid, and about 80 percent of the promised jobs never materialized, an analysis by the nonprofit newsroom Bridge Michigan found. The jobs that were created cost taxpayers about $76,000 per job, and economists across the political spectrum questioned their value.
The jobs came at the expense of environmental and public health needs, like water infrastructure, advocates and lawmakers say.
“The governor wasn’t out here working hard on those issues or focusing on them at all,” said Rachel Hood, a former Democratic legislator from the Lansing area. “These are causing real harm to real people in the state who are carrying an undue burden.”
 Fixing the “Damn Roads,” but Not Regulatory Agencies

The tension between business interests and overburdened communities during the Whitmer era often played out in battles over arcane regulatory rules and the permitting process. The administration had many chances to make decisions that would have reduced pollution in communities, but often sided with business, public health advocates say.
From the beginning of her campaign, Whitmer’s tagline has been “Fix The Damn Roads,” but fulfilling that promise requires boosting concrete production. In its laser focus on roads, the Whitmer administration often allowed concrete producers to emit higher levels of dangerous toxins in largely low income and majority-Black neighborhoods, advocates say.
Central in battles over the concrete plants are permitting decisions made by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), the state’s main environmental regulatory agency. Permitting is a highly consequential step in environmental regulation.
In 2022, just outside Flint, EGLE approved a permit request to allow a new asphalt-mixing plant to be built and emit sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and lead, just 1,500 feet from public housing, and next door to a community center. The EPA and HUD raised civil rights concerns and advised against the permit’s approval in formal comments.
Still, EGLE approved it.
Earthjustice and others filed federal civil rights complaints, and, as part of that negotiation, EGLE was poised to improve its permitting practices, said Debbie Chizewer, an Earthjustice attorney. But Republican attorneys general were at the time challenging the legality of the Biden EPA’s civil rights enforcement, and EGLE saw an opening to scrap the new protections at the last minute, Chizewer said.
“It was part of a broader pattern of when given an opportunity to really protect communities from disproportionate exposure to air pollution, EGLE did not do it,” Chizewer said. The residents near Flint are still exposed to the plant’s sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and lead.
Similarly, concrete giant Edward C. Levy Co. proposed a slag-grinding facility for a heavily polluted southwest Detroit neighborhood that air monitors showed would cause the region to violate federal air-quality standards.
To get around the violation, Levy and EGLE used data from air monitors six miles away in an area where the air was cleaner. The readings in the cleaner area made it appear as if Levy would not violate EPA limits.
These situations are not isolated. State regulators similarly circumvented EPA rules and best practices to approve air pollution permits across the state on almost every major project from 2016-2023, a recentGuardian investigation found.
In Michigan, EGLE has long faced criticism for not enforcing environmental rules and laws. The problems in part trace back to Republican Gov. John Engler’s 1991 executive orders that gutted and restructured the agency to serve polluters instead of regulating them, said the former Sierra Club lobbyist McGillivray.
Engler largely shifted pollution permit decisions from trained civil servants with technical expertise to political appointees who may be susceptible to industry pressure, McGillivray said. It is impossible for the public to know exactly where and how in the agency decisions to grant a permit are made, but she added “there’s a pattern here, and it’s systemic.”
“And there’s a paper trail that shows exactly what John Engler did, which is reorganize the agency to create the situation that we’re in today,” McGillivray said.
Whitmer has not responded to calls to make structural changes at EGLE to repair the Engler-era damage, McGillivray added.
The Engler changes—and Whitmer inaction—has a direct connection to the acrid air Theresa Landrum breathes in southwest Detroit, not far from Levy’s concrete plant. The Whitmer administration invited the environmental activist to serve on the Michigan Advisory Environmental Justice Council so she could advise on environmental justice issues, but the governor has failed to curb pollution in the area, Landrum said. Still, Landrum remains hopeful, and she pointed to the stalled out Protecting Overburdened Communities Act as a good starting point.
“I don’t feel that the governor has been strong enough on EJ, but, in her last year, I hope that she will take a harder stance with supporting communities that are overburdened,” Landrum said.

 Failing to Fix DTE Energy and Consumers Energy

Less than a month into Whitmer’s first term in January 2019, a frigid blast of arctic air dropped temperatures as low as -43 degrees in some areas, forcing school and workplace closures while confining residents to their homes.
Amid the freeze, Consumers Energy issued an emergency alert over Michiganders’ cellphones, urging them to turn down their heat as the grid strained. Several days later, about 200,000 would lose power when an ice storm hit. That summer, a strong storm in DTE territory knocked out power to 100,000 customers, leaving some in the dark and exposed to high heat for over a week.
The outages ignited simmering frustration with the utilities. DTE had not adequately maintained its grid for decades, leaving it vulnerable to storms that are growing increasingly frequent and strong as the climate changes. Simultaneously, Michigan’s energy rates were increasing faster than in 48 other states.
Whitmer’s election brought hope for change. But the same problems largely persist, and Michigan still has among the nation’s highest rates and worst reliability.
Dozens of bills aimed at strengthening the grid, protecting consumers and pushing utilities toward renewables during the Whitmer era died. Among those were bills that would have required credits for residents who endured long outages and bills that would have required renewable distributed generation. The latter would have established small-scale, community-level solar and wind generation, which decentralizes the power system and improves reliability.
Another bill that would have boosted the rate utilities paid residents for small-scale renewable energy production, like rooftop solar, failed. Rooftop solar still does not provide a major financial benefit for those who install panels.
Legislation that would have prohibited utilities from making campaign contributions and to require disclosure of dark money contributions also died, as did bills that would have allowed customers to buy clean energy from a company other than the monopoly utility.
Sources in part blame the utilities’ vast political spending. DTE and Consumers Energy have given nearly $1.8 million to the governor via PACs or affiliated dark money nonprofits since 2018, an analysis by energy industry analyst Energy and Policy Institute show. That does not include direct donations from executives or employees.
“DTE has a sweet deal in the state of Michigan because they’ve bought so many politicians, including the governor,” said Betsy Coffia, a Democratic state representative from Traverse City.
In a statement, DTE said the company is “committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and complies with all applicable laws regarding corporate donations and political contributions.”
“The political contributions the company makes are supported by the DTE voluntary employee PAC or DTE shareholders—not from customer revenue,” a spokesperson said.
Though Whitmer never publicly opposed utility reform, she also never called for it despite public outrage, the danger in the outages and rapidly increasing rates. Multiple legislators said the administration and party leadership told Democratic lawmakers not to introduce legislation that DTE opposed during the 2023 session, when Democrats held full control of the government, until lame duck. But the bills would not end up moving in lame duck.
Ultimately, the corporations’ interests did not align with those of consumers and the environment. As with other environmental legislation, Whitmer largely sided with donors and corporations, said Gilmer-Hill.
“If there was one thing that I was to hang my hat on in terms of killing environmental legislation, it would be the monopoly utility influence,” Gilmer-Hill said.
However, there were some bright spots. The Michigan Public Services Commission, which is now run by three Whitmer appointees, has required DTE to take steps to strengthen its grid, move toward renewables and limit rate increases.
But when a MPSC commissioner was viewed as too strong of a clean energy and consumer advocate, Whitmer replaced her with a former legislative staffer who is viewed as an industry ally.
“That was the governor’s very deliberate choice,” Coffia said.
 A Democratic Trifecta Squandered

During Whitmer’s first term, environmental proposals faced a virtually insurmountable obstacle: a hostile GOP that controlled part of the legislature. But in the 2022 midterms, Democrats, for the first time in 46 years, took full control, winning the House, Senate and governor’s office.
But environmental legislation still did not move. Throughout 2023 and most of 2024, legislators who were proposing a range of bills to strengthen environmental protections said they were told by the administration and party leadership not to introduce bills opposed by DTE. Similarly, measures with broad public support, like polluter pay, stalled. Some legislators said they were told to wait until the lame duck period at the end of the session.
Advocates in part blame Joe Tate, the pro-business former speaker of the House, for blocking environmental bills from moving, but Whitmer was largely silent on most environmental legislation during the trifecta, advocates noted. Tate did not respond to a request for comment.
“Without ascribing motivations and who knew what when, you can put up a list of what moved and what didn’t,” said McGillivray, the former Sierra Club lobbyist. “It is incredibly notable that when Democrats achieved their first trifecta in 42 years, and they had the power to enact their environmental agenda, very little of it moved.”

Throughout 2024, a fight over the inclusion of consumer protections and renewable energy to the data center bill—a measure opposed by big tech lobbyists—bitterly divided the caucus. That culminated in December 2024 in a dramatic intra-caucus lame duck fight.
Polluter-pays legislation, bills on tougher utility regulation, changes to the law that would empower EGLE to take on polluters, new hazardous waste rules, community solar incentives and more died.
Whitmer, however, signed a tax-incentive bill for data centers that will likely derail her climate plan.
“The outcome of all this is that regular people are hurting and the state of Michigan has not done enough to help,” McGillivray said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/unnamed-2023-11-28T153338.662-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

HOST: Michael Jonas
GUESTS: Patrick Tutwiler, Massachusetts Secretary of Education







PATRICK TUTWILER, Gov. Maura Healey’s secretary of education, is a forward-looking guy.  
While he and Healey both opposed the 2024 ballot question that did away with the requirement that students pass the 10th grade MCAS exam in math and English to graduate from high school, Tutwiler says the council he now co-chairs to figure out what to put in its place has a chance to rethink high school in ways that will enrich the experience and help set students up for success after it.  
“Gov. Healey really saw this as an opportunity, as did I, and the former history teacher in me would sort of lift up the well-known saying that in every difficulty there’s an opportunity. And so we’ve wrapped our arms around that,” Tutwiler told CommonWealth Beacon’s Michael Jonas on a new episode of The Codcast. That reimaging of the high school experience, he said, was already underway before the MCAS ballot question emerged.  
Earlier this month, the 32-member council that Tutwiler co-chairs issued an interim report that begins to outline what a new graduation requirement will look like. It starts with embracing a course sequence that students will have to follow – something Massachusetts has not required of all districts. The council is considering requiring that students follow MassCore, the state’s recommended – but currently not mandated – high school course sequence, which includes four years of math, four years of English, three years of lab science, three years of social studies, and two years of a world language.  
In terms of an assessment of student performance, the report anticipates a hybrid system of standardized tests required at the end of certain courses along with portfolios that show a range of a student’s work or a capstone project they complete at the end of high school. The report also anticipates having all students map out their post-high school plans and requiring them to complete the federal or state applications for financial aid in higher ed.  
Lots of details remain to be spelled out. The report has not homed in on exactly how the end-of-course assessments would figure into meeting a new graduation requirement.  
The council has been clear, Tutwiler said, that “no single assessment will prevent a student from graduating.” At the same time, he said, “They do need to matter.” Whether based on the 15 years he spent as an educator in Massachusetts high schools or as the parent of a 16-year-old, Tutwiler said, “I’ll tell you definitively, if it doesn’t matter or it doesn’t count in some way, [there’s] a strong unlikelihood that the students are going take it seriously.”  
He said we saw that clearly with the dip in last spring’s 10th grade MCAS results, the first time the assessment was given since the ballot question removed passing as a requirement to graduate.  
Unlike research on MCAS scores, there is no clear evidence that performance on end-of-course assessments or portfolio or capstone projects predicts longer-term outcomes like degree completion in higher ed or earnings in the labor market. Tutwiler said there is evidence, however, that the MassCore course sequence is associated with higher rates of matriculation in higher education and persistence once there. 
The state’s commitment to student success in high school and beyond, Tutwiler said, starts with the administration’s focus on universal access to pre-K seats across the Commonwealth, starting in Gateway Cities. (He said they’ve hit that mark in 19 of 26 Gateway communities so far.) He also voiced strong support for ensuring that schools are employing evidence-based approaches to reading instruction in early grades, a contentious issue that has drawn pushback from those who question whether the research on the issue is fully settled.  
“We really know what to do,” said Tutwiler, arguing that research going back decades has shown that “the most impactful strategy is anchored in phonics-based instruction.”  
As for the rethinking of high school, the graduation council has “heard substantively from students. They want more relevance, they want more engagement, they want a stronger connection between what they’re learning and whatever it is they want to pursue when they leave high school,” said Tutwiler. “So when I say this is an opportunity, this is a grand opportunity, part and parcel of an existing effort to reimagine high school.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Supreme Court Decision seen as rebuke of judicial overreach, restores shareholder-approved compensation
WILMINGTON, Del. — The Delaware Supreme Court on Dec. 19 unanimously reversed a lower-court ruling that had voided Elon Musk’s landmark compensation package at Tesla, restoring a shareholder-approved agreement that had been struck down earlier this year by the state’s Court of Chancery.
The high court ruled that the Chancery Court went too far when it rescinded Musk’s 2018 performance-based pay plan, valued at roughly $50 billion at the time and potentially far more today. While acknowledging procedural shortcomings in how the package was approved, the justices said canceling the deal outright was an excessive remedy that disregarded both shareholder intent and the extraordinary value created during the period in question.
The ruling reinstates the compensation package in full, while awarding only nominal damages of $1 and attorney’s fees — a clear signal, legal observers say, that courts should exercise restraint when second-guessing corporate governance decisions ratified by shareholders.
Shareholder Vote Central to Decision
At the heart of the case was whether Musk should be treated as a “controlling stockholder,” a designation that triggers Delaware’s most demanding legal standard, known as “entire fairness” review. The Supreme Court concluded he did not meet that threshold, noting that Musk did not own a majority of Tesla shares and lacked unilateral control over the board.
The court emphasized that Tesla shareholders had overwhelmingly approved the compensation plan, which was tied to aggressive performance milestones that many analysts credit with helping transform Tesla into one of the world’s most valuable automakers.
Legal Community Weighs In
Former Delaware Attorney General Jane Brady said the ruling reflects a recognition by the state’s highest court that the Chancery Court’s approach was overly punitive.
“The Supreme Court recognized that the Chancery Court remedy was too extreme,” Brady said. “The Supreme Court also recognized that further information should have been permitted — information that could have added context and justification for the pay rate that was approved by shareholders.”
Reversal of Chancery Court Remedy
The decision overturns a January ruling by Kathaleen McCormick, who described the package as an “unfathomable sum” and concluded that Tesla’s board had not acted independently enough in approving it. Her ruling wiped out Musk’s compensation entirely, despite Tesla’s dramatic growth during the six-year period covered by the plan.
The Supreme Court disagreed, finding that while the approval process was imperfect, the punishment did not fit the offense. Eliminating all compensation, the justices said, effectively left Musk uncompensated for leading Tesla through a period of historic expansion.
Response From Plaintiffs
Attorneys representing shareholder plaintiff Richard Tornetta had not issued a public comment on the ruling as of publication.
Broader Implications for Delaware
The ruling comes amid growing concern that Delaware’s status as the nation’s corporate capital is facing increased competition. Musk previously announced plans to move Tesla’s incorporation to Texas following the Chancery Court decision, citing concerns about Delaware’s legal climate.
Supporters of the Supreme Court ruling say it restores balance to Delaware corporate law, reinforces respect for shareholder votes, and sends a message that courts will not retroactively undo business agreements simply because their outcomes appear large or controversial.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/chancery-court.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Voters in parts of Lexington, Greenville, and Spartanburg counties will fill three vacancies in the Statehouse on Tuesday.
But ballots for only one of the three special elections indicate an actual contest.
In an email blast last week, state Democratic Party Chair Christale Spain called the upcoming Statehouse elections — three on Tuesday and a fourth on Jan. 6 — “our chance to show real power.”
She pointed to the Dec. 2 special congressional election in Tennessee as an example for Democrats. In a race that attracted millions of dollars and national attention from political heavyweights in both parties, Republican Matt Van Epps ultimately won by nearly 9 percentage points for a district, as Spain said in her email, “few would’ve called competitive.”
That momentum, she said, is what Democrats are “building right here in South Carolina.”
But in South Carolina, there’s no Democrat on the ballot in two of the four special elections.
In Lexington County, Democrat J. Chuck Hightower and Republican John Lastinger are vying for the state House seat spanning the area between Cayce, Red Bank and Gaston.
The winner of the ruby red district will replace ex-Rep. RJ May, who resigned in August ahead of pleading guilty to distributing videos of children being sexually abused.
Firebrand former SC senator wins back Upstate seat in special election

The other two elections Tuesday feature Republican Dianne Mitchell for a Greenville County seat in the House and former Sen. Lee Bright returning to the Senate seat he lost in 2016 representing parts of Spartanburg and Greenville counties.
Their wins are nearly guaranteed, though two Democrats have recently launched write-in campaigns: Dexter Reaves in the House and Steve Evered in the Senate.
Asked about the lack of a contest on those ballots, Spain encouraged Democrats to support the write-in candidates.
“Voting is the best way to send a message to Republicans, loud and clear,” Spain told the SC Daily Gazette. “Every vote counts, and this is the way to make your voice heard.”
Special elections are generally low-turnout events anyway. Lastinger, pastor of The Edge church in Springdale, acknowledged that the timing of this week’s race, just two days before Christmas, presents extra challenges.
It also required some changes to his normal Christmas schedule: His family’s annual Christmas breakfast was Monday instead of Dec. 23.
“We’re doing the same thing we’ve done for the primary and runoff, but just a little harder,” he said of his campaign’s get-out-the-vote efforts. “We’re conscious of the challenges and trying not to leave one stone unturned.”
Hightower did not return messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
Lastinger won the GOP nomination in a runoff last month in what started out as a four-way race. Hightower, a retired Army colonel, was the only Democrat to file, so no primary was needed in that party.
May was a founding member and spokesman for the hardline Freedom Caucus that has been feuding with the majority House GOP Caucus. He remains in the Edgefield County jail ahead of his sentencing next month. He faces between five and 20 years in prison for each of five counts.
Lastinger again said Monday he hasn’t made a decision on whether to join the Freedom Caucus that May helped launch in 2022, should he win.
“I’m hoping to bring unity and not division,” he said. 
As for May, Lastinger said, the healing process for the people of District 88 begins with the election.
“We may not forget the past, but it doesn’t have to be an anchor that holds us back either,” he said.
A special election Jan. 6 for a state House district representing Dorchester County will ensure the 2026 session opens a week later with all 170 Statehouse seats filled.
That race features two Air Force veterans: Republican Greg Ford and Democrat Sonja Ogletree-Satani.

When Ravina Turner, 53, started working for Michigan’s Home Help Program around 2015, she was just grateful to get paid. For years, she’d missed work to care for her daughter, Davina, who has Crohn’s disease and colitis.
At first, the Home Help Program, run by the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, paid her about $300 a month for her work, allowing her to scale back her hours as a nursing assistant. By last year, she had become a full-time caregiver for Davina, and her wages had risen to $15.88 an hour. That is still well below the $35.59 per hour living wage for a single parent in Dearborn Heights, outside Detroit, according to the MIT Living Wage Calculator.
“This is a job and we deserve benefits,” said Turner, who’s picked up a gig as a personal care assistant at a nearby assisted living facility. “We deserve health insurance as well as life insurance. We deserve vacation … because if I was punching a clock, I would get all those perks.”
Turner thought she just had to endure low wages, no benefits and no paid time off, she said, until a canvasser knocked on her door and talked to her about how much less Michigan home health aides made compared to aides in states such as Washington, where in 2023 starting rates were set at $21 per hour. She suggested Turner join the Michigan Home Care Workers United campaign, an effort from the Service Employees International Union to get union recognition for home care workers paid through Medicaid. Turner decided to join. (Disclosure: SEIU is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)

This October, Turner was among 32,000 Michigan home care aides who became union members after 73% of voting home care workers voted to join the union. They are currently working towards negotiating a contract with the state. And their victory, say observers, achieved something politicians increasingly need to pull off: building coalitions across political divides by speaking to material concerns.

Michigan Home Care Workers United launched in March 2024, around the time that the canvasser came to Turner’s door. Their efforts were aimed, initially, at getting care workers the right to form a union — which was successful, with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signing a bill granting Home Help workers state employee status for the purposes of collective bargaining last October.
Then they turned to the difficult work of organizing a union vote across the state. Currently, at least 11 other states, most of them Democratic strongholds like California and New York, have laws that recognize home care workers as public employees for the purposes of forming a union. The Michigan home care worker election was the first under President Donald Trump’s second administration. It was also only the second success in a state that went twice for Trump.
Kevin Reuning, a political science professor at Miami University of Ohio who tracks nationwide union elections, said the Michigan home care worker win was a “rare” victory given the feat of workers at that scale.
“It is statewide … that poses such an incredible difficulty because you don’t have all your workers in a single location. It just makes the actual organizing hard,” said Reuning, who is also the creator of UnionElections.org.
As activists began to talk with care workers across the state, demands emerged: higher wages and benefits, access to training, and a registry to connect workers with clients in need of care.
“Hundreds of home care workers have had boots on the ground for a very long time,” said Gabriella Jones-Casey, executive vice president of home care and staff development for SEIU Healthcare Michigan.

Home care workers are predominantly female, older and racially diverse, and they have long experienced stagnant wages, no benefits and limited access to training. At the federal level, workers are embattled; in July, the Trump administration issued a proposal rolling back federal minimum wage and overtime protections for home care workers.
“This is a serious rollback, and it’s going to exacerbate shortages,” said Catherine Ruckelshaus, legal director at the National Employment Law Project. “It’s pretty much a disaster.” Locally, home care workers are facing cuts to Medicaid, which funds Michigan’s Home Help Program.
The rapidly growing profession already battles significant issues with retention. Although long-term home health care is expected to grow by 17% over the next decade, rates of turnover were nearly 75% nationally in 2024.
When the election results came in, those were the issues on workers’ minds — wherever they were. That included Michigan’s cities and suburbs, where most of the state’s Black and brown workers live and where voters lean Democratic, as well as its rural areas, which are generally white and voters are heavily Republican.
The organizers’ success came from the unit’s ability to speak to broad concerns about wages, working conditions, and respect, said Jones-Casey.
“We represent workers all across the state from the UP [Upper Peninsula] down,” said Jones-Casey. “The challenges that arise might be different across the urban areas versus the rural versus suburban, but that’s kind of the beauty of this unit. They are representative of the entirety of Michigan.”

Workers say there is power in finding common ground between disparate places and political landscapes.
Erika LaFountain, a home care worker involved with the union, lives in Jackson County, a conservative stronghold about an hour west of Detroit. It is 82% white, and Trump won it by more than a 20-point margin in 2024. It is just the sort of place SEIU needed to win over.
LaFountain said she’d never thought of herself as an activist. When a canvasser came to her door, she said, “I’m like, I don’t think that’s me,” said LaFountain. “I think you’re talking about nurses and, like, people with degrees.”
LaFountain started in home health care after she helped a wheelchair-bound neighbor, Ricky Johnson, get into his home without a ramp. At first, LaFountain cared for Johnson in her free time, unpaid. When his family said they needed more help, LaFountain joined the Home Help Program. As had been true for Turner, the little bit of state money helped LaFountain — but it wasn’t enough to live on.
It’s been powerful, said LaFountain, to share her story.
“I started just telling Ricky’s struggles,” LaFountain said, as well as “our story and our struggles, and how if there was health insurance, that I wouldn’t have to be on Medicaid.”
LaFountain poses for a portrait taken by Ricky Johnson, with some support holding the camera.
Turner, who lives in deep-blue Wayne County, which Kamala Harris won by almost 30 points in 2024, agreed completely. “I learned that there’s power in numbers … strength in numbers,” she said.
Overall, Turner said, she felt lucky. “I take care of my daughter, and she does have good moments when I’m able to leave for a couple of hours.” But she knows not every caregiver has that freedom. “The ones that can’t leave … those are the ones that I was really fighting for,” she said.

Williams, a former Virginia adjutant general, has been tapped by Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger as Virginia’s next secretary of veterans and defense affairs. (Photo courtesy of Office of Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger)Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger on Monday announced she has selected retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Timothy Williams to serve as Virginia’s next secretary of veterans and defense affairs, tapping a longtime military leader who spent nearly four decades in uniform and led the Virginia National Guard through some of its most demanding recent missions.
Williams, who retired in 2023 after 38 years in the armed forces, served for nine years as Virginia’s adjutant general under three governors. In that role, he oversaw the Virginia Department of Military Affairs, which provides leadership and administrative support to the Virginia Army National Guard, Virginia Air National Guard and Virginia Defense Force.
“With Virginia having one of the largest veteran populations in the United States, we must have steady, experienced leadership focused on the health, education, and employment of our neighbors who have served our country and our commonwealth,” Spanberger said in a statement. 
She said she worked closely with Williams during her time in Congress on issues affecting the Virginia National Guard and praised his “decades of experience at every level of the military” and his career supporting veterans nationwide.
Spanberger said that experience would benefit Virginia’s veterans and service members, including those transitioning out of active duty.
Williams said he was honored by the appointment and emphasized his focus on serving Virginia’s more than 600,000 veterans.
“I am humbled by Gov.-elect Spanberger asking me to serve as the Virginia secretary of veterans and defense affairs, and it would be an absolute honor to continue to serve and support my fellow Virginians,” Williams said. 
He said he looked forward to working with Spanberger and the Virginia Department of Veterans Services to ensure veterans “receive the benefits, care and services they earned.”
Williams also highlighted the importance of readiness and public safety, saying he shares Spanberger’s focus on ensuring communities have the resources they need to keep residents safe. 
He said maintaining a ready Virginia National Guard would remain a priority, particularly for rapid responses to severe weather or security threats, and pledged to work to protect Virginia’s military infrastructure.
As adjutant general, Williams led the Virginia National Guard during an unusually high operational tempo. That included more than 460 days of support to Virginia’s COVID-19 response, with Guard members assisting in vaccinations, testing and logistical and planning efforts across the state. 
Guard personnel under his leadership also deployed to Washington, D.C., following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and remained in place to support security operations for the inauguration of President Joe Biden.
During Williams’ final two years as adjutant general, more than 2,000 Virginia National Guard members mobilized on federal active duty in the United States and overseas, the third-highest total in the past century, according to the announcement.
Since retiring from the Guard, Williams has served as an adviser to the chief of the National Guard Bureau on intergovernmental affairs, helping coordinate policy development and legislative priorities across the bureau’s joint staff, the Army and Air National Guard, and adjutants general in all states, territories and the District of Columbia.
A lifelong Virginian, Williams graduated from Virginia Tech in 1984 and earned his commission as a field artillery officer. He later built a parallel career as a federal civil servant, culminating as director of training support and doctrine at the Combined Arms Support Command at Fort Lee.
Williams holds a bachelor’s degree in management science from Virginia Tech, a master’s degree in management from Webster University and a master’s degree in strategic studies from the U.S. Army War College. 
He and his wife, Cheryl, have been married for 39 years and have three children and three grandchildren.

Acquisition cements Del-One’s status as a leading full-service financial institution for Delaware’s business and personal banking communities.
DOVER, Del – When Del-One Federal Credit Union finalized its acquisition of Louviers Federal Credit Union in November, the transaction marked far more than a balance-sheet milestone.
For Del-One, the state’s largest credit union, the acquisition represented a strategic investment in long-term stability, technology, and community reach. For Louviers, a smaller but deeply rooted institution with more than six decades of service, it offered continuity — preserving jobs, honoring legacy, and ensuring members would continue to receive the personalized service they value in an increasingly competitive financial landscape.
Together, the unification reflects a broader national shift reshaping the credit union industry, while reinforcing a distinctly Delaware-centered approach to financial services — one built on member ownership, local decision-making, and reinvesting capital back into the community.
“This was never about size for size’s sake,” said Dan McCarthy, president and CEO of Del-One Federal Credit Union. “It’s about scale with purpose — being large enough to compete, but still small enough to care.”
A changing credit union landscape
Across the United States, the number of credit unions has declined dramatically over the past two decades. Once numbering more than 10,000 nationwide, today there are fewer than 4,500. The decline is not a reflection of failure, but of mounting pressure — rising compliance costs, rapid technological change, and competition not only from banks, but from fintech companies offering mobile-first financial services.
“Scale matters now more than it ever has,” McCarthy said. “The cost to run a safe, sound financial institution — compliance, cybersecurity, technology infrastructure — it’s enormous. And then you add customer expectations. People want instant loan decisions, best-in-class mobile banking, seamless digital tools.”
Those pressures disproportionately affect smaller credit unions, many of which face difficult choices: make major investments, find a partner, or risk falling behind.
Louviers Federal Credit Union found itself at that crossroads. Publicly, the credit union cited two key factors in its decision to seek a merger partner: leadership succession and the rising cost of technology and marketing needed to remain competitive.
“They could have gone out and hired new executives,” McCarthy said. “But rebuilding leadership teams while also making massive technology investments is a heavy lift. They asked a smart question: who can help us protect our members, our teammates, and our mission?”
Del-One, with its Delaware roots and expanding footprint, emerged as the right fit.
What makes credit unions different
Unlike banks, credit unions are financial cooperatives. Their customers are also their owners — referred to as members — and profits are reinvested rather than distributed to shareholders.
“It fundamentally changes how decisions are made,” McCarthy said. “There’s no push and pull between shareholders and customers. Our members are both.”
Amy Resh, Del-One’s vice president of administration and marketing, says education is often the biggest hurdle.
“Most people understand banks,” she said. “They don’t always understand credit unions or how different the model is. We’re full-service — anything a bank can do, we can do — but the motivation is different.”
Founded in 1960, Del-One has grown into the largest credit union in Delaware by assets, membership, and branch network. Today, more than 100,000 Delawareans — roughly one in every ten residents — have a direct banking relationship with Del-One.
“We still joke about lollipops at the counter,” McCarthy said, referencing the old-school image many people associate with credit unions. “And yes, we still have them. But we also have sophisticated consumer, business, and digital products that can go head-to-head with any major bank.”
A merger focused on people, not just numbers
The acquisition became legally effective on November 1, 2025, though operational integration will not be completed until August 3, 2026. Until then, Del-One and Louviers members will continue using their respective branches and systems.
That phased approach, leadership says, is intentional.
“Nothing about a merger is ever truly seamless,” Resh said. “Communication is everything — with teammates and with members. We’ve been very upfront about timelines and what people should expect.”
For Louviers employees — about 30 teammates prior to the acquisition — Del-One leadership emphasized that the merger was about “we,” not “us versus them.”
“I’ve been on the other side of mergers,” McCarthy said. “Where the mothership comes in and treats you like a second-class citizen. That was never going to happen here.”
The combined organization now employs more than 200 Delaware-based teammates, opening the door to expanded compensation, benefits, and career advancement opportunities — both horizontally across departments and vertically within leadership structures.
“We’ve mixed teams across branches intentionally,” McCarthy said. “Not to impose culture, but to share it.”
That approach appears to be resonating.
Ann Duling, a loan specialist who spent more than 40 years with Louviers before the acquisition, said the energy feels familiar in the best way.
“Since the merger, the credit union feels more like it did when I first started,” Duling said. “There is genuine care and concern, and a mission to do what’s best for the members and the employees. I honestly wish I was at the beginning of my career instead of nearing the end because I’m so excited for the future of this credit union.”
What the acquisition means for members
With the addition of Louviers’ locations, Del-One now operates 16 branches statewide — placing nearly 90% of Delaware residents within a 15-minute drive of a branch.
That physical presence complements significant investments in digital banking, including mobile tools, online account management, and an AI-powered digital assistant designed to handle everyday banking needs.
“Our North Star is to be the easiest place to work and do business — period,” McCarthy said. “Not just the easiest financial institution. The easiest business.”
For members, that translates into faster loan decisions, more automated services, and expanded product offerings — without sacrificing local access or personal service.
“We don’t believe it has to be either-or,” McCarthy said. “You shouldn’t have to choose between great technology and people who know your name.”
Del-One currently manages nearly $1 billion in assets, placing it larger than more than 90% of credit unions nationwide — while remaining deeply local.
A commitment to community investment
One of the defining characteristics of Del-One’s growth has been its emphasis on reinvesting locally.
Nearly $700 million in loans are currently circulating back into Delaware’s economy, including approximately $70 million in business lending. Unlike national banks, where deposits may be deployed elsewhere, Del-One leadership emphasizes that member funds stay in-state.
“When you bank with us, your money goes right back into your community,” Resh said.
That philosophy extends beyond lending.
Through the Del-One Foundation, the credit union raised and donated $65,000 to local charities in 2025 alone. More than 190 teammates participated in the annual Del-One Community Service Day, supporting 10 organizations across the state.
Del-One is also a founding sponsor of the Delaware Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and a partner of the Delaware Black Chamber of Commerce — commitments that go beyond financial contributions.
“Del-One’s partnership is comprehensive,” said Ronaldo Tello, president and CEO of the Delaware Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. “They invest both treasure and the time of their diverse, bilingual staff to remove barriers facing Hispanic entrepreneurs and expand access to capital, financial literacy, and homeownership.”
Del-One was the first credit union in Delaware to receive the national Juntos Avanzamos designation, recognizing its commitment to serving Hispanic and immigrant communities through programs like ITIN lending. That achievement led to March 28, 2024, being designated Del-One Federal Credit Union Day by then–New Castle County Executive and now Governor Matt Meyer.
Recognition from inside and out
Internally, Del-One’s culture has earned consistent recognition. The credit union has been named a Top Workplace for four consecutive years — an honor based entirely on employee feedback.
In 2024, Del-One received the Manager’s Award, recognizing exceptional leadership support and employee development. That same year, it ranked third in its size category among all Delaware employers.
“You can’t buy those results,” McCarthy said. “We’ve paid the fee before and didn’t win. This comes straight from what our teammates say.”
National recognition, combined with Delaware-based roots, has positioned Del-One as a model for what modern credit unions can become.
Looking ahead
While the Louviers integration remains the immediate focus, Del-One leadership is already looking toward what comes next.
That includes expanded business banking and treasury services, faster automated consumer lending, and a forthcoming partnership to offer financial planning services directly to members — a new capability for the credit union.
“There may be more mergers in the future,” McCarthy said. “But never just for growth. Only if it benefits members, teammates, and the community.”
As credit unions nationwide continue to consolidate, the Del-One and Louviers acquisition offers a case study in how growth can preserve — rather than dilute — local values.
“We started as a credit union for highway workers,” McCarthy said. “And even as we grow, we haven’t lost that commitment to Delaware. That’s our superpower.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/75b3130c-bec7-45a9-aefd-2681c4e1989c.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware’s Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force is still in its early stages, but its focus is sharpening as concerns mount over electric reliability, rising demand, and the state’s ability to compete for energy-intensive economic development.
During A Better Discussion on December 22, hosted by M. Jane Brady, energy executive Ken Reuter warned that Delaware faces a widening gap between electricity production and consumption — a shortfall he said could limit growth and increase the risk of future power shortages.
Reuter, a member of the task force created by the General Assembly, said Delaware produces only a small share of the electricity it uses and relies heavily on imported power from the regional grid operated by PJM Interconnection.
“We produce about 420,000 megawatts in the state, but we consume more than 11 million,” Reuter said. “That puts Delaware in a position of real risk.”
Task force work moves forward
The Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force was established to evaluate whether nuclear power — including emerging technologies such as small modular reactors, or SMRs — could play a role in Delaware’s future energy mix.
Reuter said the task force includes utility executives, nuclear engineers and technical experts, though it is still in its formative phase.
“There is a desire to move the ball forward,” he said. “The challenge is getting consensus and deciding how to get there.”
Brady said the task force reflects a growing recognition that the state must examine firm, “baseload” generation — power that can run continuously — as opposed to relying primarily on intermittent sources such as wind and solar.
Energy supply tied to economic growth
The discussion also linked energy capacity to Delaware’s broader economic outlook, particularly its ability to attract data centers and other power-intensive industries.
Reuter said demand from data processing is accelerating across the region and that states unable to guarantee reliable electricity risk losing investment opportunities.
“Every time you use your phone or send a message, that data has to be processed somewhere,” he said. “Data centers are here to stay, and they are huge energy users.”
Brady said expanding in-state generation could help Delaware improve productivity and attract higher-paying private-sector jobs.
“If we don’t have the capacity to generate power,” she said, “we’re effectively shutting ourselves out of major economic opportunities.”
Costs and timelines shape the debate
Reuter outlined cost and construction timelines for various energy options discussed by the task force, emphasizing the need for realistic planning.
He said combined-cycle natural gas plants remain the fastest and least expensive option to deploy, while nuclear power offers carbon-free, round-the-clock generation but requires longer lead times. Offshore wind, he argued, carries higher costs and operational complexity due to marine construction and maintenance demands.
“We’re behind,” Reuter said. “If we want to bridge the gap between today and future nuclear generation, planning has to start now.”

What is an SMR?
A small modular reactor (SMR) is a newer form of nuclear power plant designed to generate electricity on a smaller scale than traditional reactors.
Unlike large nuclear facilities built entirely on site, SMRs are manufactured in factories and shipped for installation. Each unit typically produces up to 300 megawatts of electricity, and multiple units can be combined to meet higher demand.
Key features include:


Baseload power: Operates 24/7 regardless of weather


Carbon-free generation: No greenhouse gas emissions during operation


Scalability: Capacity can be added incrementally


Shorter timelines: Estimated three to five years once approvals are secured


Siting flexibility: Smaller footprint allows placement at former or existing power sites


Supporters view SMRs as a more flexible path to nuclear energy, while critics point to regulatory hurdles, cost certainty and public acceptance as unresolved challenges.

Laura Kelly nominates child care expert as the state's first director of the Office of Early Childhood, a post created with bipartisan legislation.","Christi Smith,  executive director of Child Care Aware of Kansas, is the nominee  of Gov. Laura Kelly to serve as the first director of the Kansas Office of Early Childhood. The agency will launch in July and consolidate programs scattered among several state agencies. (Submitted)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly nominated the leader of a Kansas organization working to connect families with quality and affordable child care to serve as the first director of the state’s Office of Early Childhood.
Kelly recommended the Kansas Senate confirm Christi Smith, who works as executive director of Child Care Aware of Kansas. The organization leads a statewide child care resource and referral network. She has been in the early childhood and family service field for more than two decades.
“I am confident that Christi’s years of impressive experience along with her passion will provide the leadership necessary to ensure the office successfully delivers on its charge,” Kelly said. “I look forward to her work to align our early childhood investments, develop a world-class early childhood system that benefits Kansas children and families, and secure a brighter economic future for our entire state.”
The Office of Early Childhood begins operation July 1, 2026, and Smith would serve in an acting capacity pending Senate action. The Senate is likely to take up the nomination after the 2026 session begins in January.
Under a bipartisan state law adopted in 2025, the Office of Early Childhood would be responsible for administration of the state’s early childhood care and education system. House Bill 2045 outlined a path to greater efficiency and better service delivery in areas that included child care licensing, child care assistance, home visiting programs and the Kansas Children’s Cabinet and Trust Fund.
The law signed by Kelly would consolidate into one office nearly 20 existing state programs serving young children and families. One of the office’s duties would be to develop a statewide strategy for expanding access to child care.
“Working alongside families, the child care workforce and leaders across the state, I will focus on breaking down silos and strengthening partnerships to ensure our early childhood system helps children and families thrive,” Smith said.
Before leading Child Care Aware of Kansas, Smith was executive director of Alpha Delta Kappa, a nonprofit professional association for women educators. She also worked as director of family preservation at DCCCA, a Douglas County-based social services organization.
She earned a bachelor’s degree at Missouri State University and a master’s degree in organizational leadership from Ellis College of New York Institute of Technology.
In April, Kelly signed the compromise bill assembled during negotiations with members of the House and Senate. The bill cleared the House on a vote of 99-23 and passed the Senate by a 30-10 margin.
The governor called it the most consequential early childhood education and care legislation enacted in Kansas in 15 years and vowed the state’s early childhood system would “no longer be bogged down by inefficiencies and bureaucratic red tape.”
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican running for state insurance commissioner, said Kansas had an urgent need for affordable child care. He said the reform law would address bottlenecks in the system that “quite frankly suppress availability and drive up cost.”
“These are real solutions that will immediately increase slots by reducing overly burdensome regulations, streamlining support services for providers and families, and addressing underserved and rural shortages by increasing flexibility for home-based providers,” he said.
The consolidation was among recommendations of the Early Childhood Transition Task Force established in 2023 by an executive order issued by Kelly. A bill related to the Office of Early Childhood was debated by the 2024 Legislature, but wasn’t approved.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Smith-early-childhood-director.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Trump administration on Friday affirmed a controversial federal Cook Inlet oil and gas lease sale held at the end of 2022, asserting that impacts to endangered beluga whales and other resources were adequately considered and no changes in the leasing plan are needed.
In a Federal Register notice scheduled to be published on Monday, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced its decision to uphold Lease Sale 258 as held. The decision “balances the national policies mandated by Congress to expeditiously and safely develop the natural resources of the (Outer Continental Shelf), subject to environmental safeguards, in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of competition and other national needs,” the notice said.
The lease sale, mandated by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, offered 193 blocks over nearly 1 million acres, but it drew only one bid. The sole bid was from Hilcorp, the dominant oil and gas operator in the inlet.
The auction went through a tumultuous history and remains a subject of debate.
Planning for the sale started in 2020, but two years later, the Biden administration canceled it, citing a lack of industry interest. The sale was resurrected by a provision in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that was inserted by then-Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia. That provision required Lease Sale 258 to be held by the end of 2022; it was ultimately held on Dec. 30 of that year.
Environmental groups that sued to block the sale secured a victory after it was held. U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ruled in July 2024 that pre-sale studies failed to properly analyze impacts to endangered Cook Inlet beluga whales and other resources. Gleason ordered BOEM to do the new analysis of beluga and other resource impacts, putting the sole lease that was sold into suspension.
In response to Gleason’s order, BOEM compiled a supplemental environmental impact statement, completing that work in three months. The agency did not release any draft for public review, held no public meetings on the subject and took no public comment.
The agency considered three additional alternatives that would have increased protections for belugas and other resources, but it rejected those and kept the original plan in place, according to the document.
“As LS 258 has already occurred, selecting any alternatives other than those described above would not affirm that lease sale and would void the one lease issued as a result of it,” the Federal Register notice said.
In its supplemental environmental impact statement, BOEM asserted that the risks of leasing and the development that would result from it are minor for Cook Inlet belugas and other marine mammals.
“The likelihood of a large oil spill affecting Cook Inlet marine mammals is relatively low, but the consequences could affect some populations. Sea otters face the highest vulnerability from a large spill due to their dependence on fur for insulation, resulting in a moderate impact level. Cook Inlet beluga whales are at risk due to the small population size, but geographic and temporal factors substantially reduce the risk of exposure to a large spill, yielding a minor overall impact level,” the document said.
The agency’s impact statement also describes impacts of noise as minor. While Cook Inlet belugas are highly dependent on hearing other whales’ calls to navigate the murky waters, ship and industrial noise that would drown out those calls “are expected to be temporary, with anticipated localized effects on beluga behavior and no anticipated long-term effect on survival or fitness.” Additionally, no injuries to belugas are expected from lease-related activities, the document said.

	The three new alternatives that BOEM considered would have added new protections for marine mammals and for subsistence and commercial fishing. Those alternatives would have reduced the available leasing territory in different increments, ranging from about one fifth to nearly half, according to the document.
The environmentalists who sued to overturn the lease sale criticized the decision and the lack of public participation leading up to it.
“BOEM’s decision to conduct the whole process in secrecy represents the federal government’s new approach to cutting the public out of decisions about our waters, and favoring the billionaire class and giant corporations over the people who call this place home. We are disgusted by this rushed and sloppy process on this final SEIS,” Bridget Maryott, co-executive director at Cook Inletkeeper, said in a statement, referring to the agency’s just-published supplemental environmental impact statement.
Hannah Foster, an attorney for Earthjustice, the environmental law firm that represented the plaintiffs, called the process leading to the decision a “black box.”
“We won our challenge against this lease sale because Interior failed to adequately consider sale alternatives and the impacts to the endangered beluga whales that will be harmed by blaring vessel noise and other oil industry operations. Yet BOEM has now reaffirmed the sale without seriously considering new alternatives or imposing any new measures to protect belugas,” she said in the statement.
Foster said Earthjustice and its clients are still reviewing the information about BOEM’s decision.
Including the lease sold in 2022, there are currently eight active leases in federal waters of Cook Inlet, all held by Hilcorp.
The Trump administration has already started planning a new Cook Inlet oil and gas lease sale, the first of six nearly annual sales mandates for the inlet through 2032 under the sweeping budget bill that was called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Additionally, the administration included five Cook Inlet lease sales among the 21 it has proposed for federal waters off Alaska through 2031. Those 21 sales are proposed in the administration’s five-year outer continental shelf oil and gas leasing plan, released last month. It envisions oil development in nearly all federal waters off the state’s coasts.
The five-year plan drew praise from Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally.
“Once again, the Trump Administration is leading the way to American energy dominance by restoring confidence in the federal government’s offshore leasing policies,” Dunleavy said at the time in a post on the social media site X.

You can kill someone with your car in California and not even have a point on your license. 
A criminal justice reform bill passed in 2020 allows judges to effectively erase a misdemeanor case from existence, shielding people accused of “low-level” crimes from the stigma of having a conviction on their record, something that can limit work and housing opportunities. 
But CalMatters investigative reporters Robert Lewis and Lauren Hepler found that the new misdemeanor diversion program has also had an unintended consequence: It allows some people charged with vehicular manslaughter to keep the case off of their driving record. 
That means you could face more penalties for a speeding ticket than for running someone over.

Allison Lyman, whose 23-year-old son, Connor Lopez, was killed when a woman hit his motorcycle in April: “I’m 43 and I will have to live the rest of my life without my son. But there’ll be no record of it for her?”

It’s part of a larger anger and frustration Lyman has at how the system is treating her son’s death. She said she was talking to police and one of the officers kept referring to the case as “low-level.”

Lyman: “She took my son’s life, but that’s how they’re seen — low-level.”

The 2020 law went further than typical diversion programs, which normally let a judge pause a case and order a defendant to meet certain requirements. The law allows judges to order diversion for almost all misdemeanors, with few, if any, requirements that defendants have to fulfill, and over the objection of a prosecutor.

Aetna to cover fertility benefits for LGBTQ members


Under a new class action settlement, Aetna will cover fertility treatments for its LGBTQ members. Photo via iStock




Health insurer Aetna will cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples following a preliminary agreement approved last week by a federal Northern California judge. The landmark settlement, stemming from a class action lawsuit, is the first to require a health insurer to apply this policy nationally across all of its enrollees, reports CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
To qualify for fertility treatments — such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization — Aetna previously required enrollees to partake in up to 12 months of “unprotected heterosexual sexual intercourse” without successfully conceiving, according to the class action complaint. The policy allowed for women “without a male partner” to access benefits only after undergoing up to 12 unsuccessful cycles of artificial insemination.
The judge sided with lawyers who argued that the policy treated LGBTQ members differently and denied them access to the benefit. An estimated 91,000 Californians will benefit from the terms.

Judge blocks federal cuts to permanent housing for homeless

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s administration from going through with its plan to drastically cut the amount of federal funds that can be spent on permanent housing for homeless individuals. The Trump administration wants to put that money toward emergency shelters, especially those that require people to stay sober or adhere to other limits on their behavior.
Two lawsuits have challenged Trump’s proposed funding shift. California is a plaintiff in one, and Santa Clara County and San Francisco are plaintiffs in the other. After those lawsuits were filed, the federal government withdrew its proposed funding changes, but said it would issue a new, revised funding notice.
The judge who issued the temporary block last week agreed with plaintiffs’ arguments that Trump’s last-minute changes would have forced people out of housing and back onto the streets in the middle of winter, according to NPR.



CA’s mask ban on ICE agents begins January

Beginning January, California and Los Angeles County will ban local and federal law enforcement officers from covering their faces, with some exceptions, writes CalMatters’ Nigel Duara. California passed the law in response to federal immigration raids over the course of the year carried out by masked agents.
Citing that it threatens the safety of federal agents, the Trump administration is suing California to block the law. Organizations representing California law officers also opposed the legislation as it made its way through the Legislature, arguing that it would put “unnecessary burdens” on officers. The law will require local and county police to enforce the mask ban for federal officers. But California police leaders say the new law is likely unconstitutional, so it’s unclear if police in the state can enforce the new provision.

To help more first-generation, low-income students get into college, California should use revenue from a state tax that could be levied on owners of secondary homes valued at $1 million or more, writes Alondra Martinez, senior at Stanford University.
And two reader reactions to a recent California Voices piece about biomass energy:

State regulators should extend — not end — the subsidy program for biomass energy, because bioenergy is a critical tool for preventing wildfires, combatting climate change and reducing emissions, writes Gary Bradford, Yuba County Supervisor.
Bioenergy should be eliminated not only because California has other clean energy options, but also because, more importantly, the state already has an unsafe amount of hazardous forest waste, writes Matt Dias, president and CEO of Calforests.

Re: Biomass is a money pit that won’t solve California’s energy or wildfire problems
Shaye Wolf is right about one thing: California has affordable clean energy options like solar and wind. But her op-ed ignores an urgent, critical reality on the ground: we are in a wildfire crisis and California is drowning in hazardous forest waste with nowhere to put it.
Biomass energy is not about cutting healthy forests or replacing solar and wind. It’s about the fact that California is in a wildfire emergency, and the state faces a dangerous accumulation of forest fuels with limited safe disposal options. Policy decisions must reflect this operational and public-safety reality, not just theoretical comparisons among energy sources.
Evaluating biomass solely on cost per megawatt-hour or facility-level emissions misunderstands its role in a fire-prone landscape. The relevant policy choice is not biomass versus other renewables, but whether unavoidable forest material is handled through controlled, regulated facilities or disposed of through open burning, piling, or unsafe accumulation near communities and infrastructure.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/092324_Sunset-LA_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Alondra Martinez
Alondra Martinez is a senior at Stanford University studying political science and communications. 


Getting into college is harder than ever. Every year, Americans spend about $500 million on “educational consultants” who help students navigate applying to college. Most first-generation, low-income students don’t have access to those resources. 
California should fund an effective college pipeline program for these first-generation students to ensure they all get a shot at college.
In the U.S., college consulting is booming. Tutoring for the SAT or ACT can cost up to $1,000. One-on-one coaching can range from $50 to $100 an hour. 
For students seeking the Ivy League, Lakhani Coaching in New York says its average customer spends $58,000 — and 20% of its clients invest more than $100,000 — on college coaching services.
First-generation, low-income students like myself struggle just to pay the costs of submitting college applications — if fee waivers aren’t available. 
In my case, had it not been for USC’s Bovard Scholars program, I wouldn’t be attending Stanford University. Bovard is a selective program where high-achieving students receive free support in test preparation and in applications to top universities.

Again, most first-generation, low-income students don’t have access to that support. 
There are a lot of us in California, where Black and Latino families make up 44% of all households but 55% of the poorest families and 12% of the richest. By contrast, White and Asian families make up 52% of all households, 40% of the poorest and 83% of the richest. 
When looking at who goes to college soon after high school, 85% of Asian students are enrolled, as are 68% of white students. But only 55% each of Black and Latino students enroll within a year of graduating and enrollment is lowest among all low-income students, at 54%.
The numbers show Cal State schools have higher acceptance rates and are highly attended by Black and Latino students. On the other hand, UC schools tend to have lower acceptance rates and more often enroll Asian American and white students. Similarly, Stanford University is the 21st most attended school among Black students and 39th among Latino students. 
Cal State schools promote economic mobility, while the UCs and other elite universities open doors to powerful places in society, said Anthony Lising Antonio, a Stanford professor who specializes in higher education equity. He was quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle. 
California already offers some college-going support services to groups of disadvantaged students, such as the Educational Opportunity Program  and the Early Academic Outreach Program, but these programs are not accessible to every student.  
The state should establish a broad program that provides students with college support. Call it the Earl Warren program, honoring the Californian and Supreme Court Chief Justice who wrote the historic desegregation opinion in the Brown v. Board of Education case. 
The new program could be open to all students and give them access to workshops, college-readiness counselors, test prep and support with writing and submitting college applications.
The program wouldn’t fall under “DEI initiative” scrutiny by the Trump administration because it wouldn’t target a particular ethnic or racial group, though it could focus on an income range, first-generation status or some other disadvantage.
Rather than federal dollars, the new effort would be funded with revenues from a state tax that could be levied on owners of secondary or part-time homes valued at $1 million or more. 
It would be similar to Rhode Island’s “Taylor Swift tax,” which affects people who live most of each year elsewhere. This proposal would exempt full-time residents, while providing resources to help students thrive. 
In a state where many people enjoy the benefits of California, non-resident homeowners should contribute to programs that make its communities strong.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/100323-UC-Davis-E-Bikes-Scooters-MG-CM-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Aetna will provide equitable fertility benefits to LGBTQ members, including 91,000 Californians, under the terms of a class action lawsuit settlement.


Like many young girls, Mara Berton and June Higginbotham both knew from an early age they wanted families and to become mothers. But as lesbians, they were excluded from accessing the same fertility treatment insurance benefits offered to heterosexual peers.
Instead, like many other same-sex couples, Berton and Higginbotham, who live in Santa Clara County, had to pay $45,000 out of pocket to conceive while heterosexual colleagues with the same insurance plan had many of those costs covered.
“We knew it wasn’t right,” Berton said in an exclusive interview with CalMatters. She joined a class action lawsuit challenging the policy. “What we’re fighting for is about family building and having kids…It was really important to both of us, I think, that other couples not have to do this.”
Last week, in a landmark settlement, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California Haywood Gilliam, Jr. approved a preliminary agreement for the class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples — like artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization — as they do with heterosexual couples. It is the first case requiring a health insurer to apply this policy nationally across all of its enrollees. An estimated 2.8 million LGBTQ members will benefit, including 91,000 Californians.
Under the settlement, Aetna will also pay at least $2 million in damages to California-based members who qualify. Those who may be eligible must submit a claim by June 29, 2026.
“I truly hope that this is the first of many insurers to change their policy,” said Alison Tanner, senior litigation counsel for reproductive rights and health at the National Women’s Law Center. “We were looking at that as an issue of inequality — that folks who were in same-sex relationships were being treated differently.”
Roughly 9 million additional Californians will soon have access to mandated fertility benefits under a new law taking effect in January. The law applies to state-regulated plans — which Aetna is not in this case — and amends the definition of infertility to include same-sex couples and single people.
Prior to the settlement, lawyers argued LGBTQ members were excluded from fertility benefits, which required in part six to 12 months of “heterosexual intercourse” to qualify. Photo via iStock
Previously, Aetna’s policy required enrollees to engage in six to 12 months of “unprotected heterosexual sexual intercourse” without conceiving before qualifying for fertility benefits, according to the class action complaint. The policy allowed for women “without a male partner” to access benefits only after undergoing six to 12 cycles of artificial insemination unsuccessfully depending on age.
Lawyers argued that the policy fundamentally treated LGBTQ members differently and effectively denied them access to the benefit, which can be prohibitively expensive for many people.
In an email, Aetna spokesperson Phillip Blando said the plan provides infertility benefits in accordance with each member’s plan, coverage rules and applicable law.
“Aetna is committed to equal access to infertility coverage and reproductive health coverage for all its members, and we will continue to strive toward improving access to services for our entire membership,” Blando said.
Medical infertility definition includes LGBTQ
Berton, who was the lead plaintiff in the case, said she was blindsided by the policy. She had consulted with a fertility clinic and decided to move forward with donor sperm and artificial insemination, when a representative from Aetna called and said she did not meet the definition of infertility. 
She appealed the decision multiple times; she was rejected. The experience felt “dehumanizing,” her wife Higginbotham said. 
Insurance had dictated Berton attempt 12 rounds of artificial insemination before she would be eligible for benefits. Her doctors recommended no more than four rounds. 
Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said a policy like that could only be designed to dissuade people from accessing their health benefits. Doctors typically recommend three to four cycles of artificial insemination before IVF, but Tipton said there have also been studies showing it is more efficient and cost effective to go straight to IVF.
In 2023, the society updated its medical definition of infertility to include LGBTQ folks and individuals who don’t have partners. They did so in part to stop insurers from denying claims like Berton and Higginbotham’s. 
“The driving force was a realization that it takes two kinds of gametes to have kids,” Tipton said. “Regardless of the cause of that absence, you have to have access in order to be treated for a fertility issue.”
Since the definition changed, Tipton said more employers and insurers are covering benefits for LGBTQ folks or single people. They have also leveraged the definition to enact statewide benefits expansions, including California’s upcoming fertility benefits mandate.
Berton and Higginbotham said they also worried about running out of donor sperm that matched Higginbotham’s Jewish and Native American heritage – and was limited in supply.
“I don’t feel like your insurance should be involved in those types of decisions and kind of determine your journey,” Berton said. 
The couple pulled together money from family members and decided to proceed even without coverage. After four unsuccessful rounds of intrauterine insemination, they moved on to IVF, partially to give themselves the best chance of conceiving with the donor they chose. 
The experience was “all consuming” and emotionally difficult as Berton endured hormone injections, egg retrievals and a miscarriage. But today, she and Higginbotham have two healthy twin girls whose favorite thing is to play on the swings and “take every book off of their shelf” for their mothers to read.
The couple achieved their family dreams before the lawsuit concluded. Even so, Higginbotham said she hopes the settlement will help other LGBTQ couples across the country. 
“I know people that don’t have children, that wanted children, because the stuff isn’t covered. I know people that their timeline was delayed and maybe they have fewer kids than they wanted,” Higginbotham said. “The settlement is such a huge step forward that is really righting a huge wrong.”

(Courtesy of Fervo)An ongoing geothermal project in southern Utah has the eyes and the money of big companies searching for cleaner energy sources — including tech giant Google.
Fervo’s Cape Station project has been under construction in Beaver County since 2023, drilling what’s expected to become the largest enhanced geothermal system in the world. The first phase of the project goes online in 2026, and a $462 million private investment announced this month is keeping that goal on track. 
Infrastructure supporting about 500 megawatts of energy is currently under construction in the state. However, Sarah Jewett, senior vice president of strategy at Fervo, said the company’s permit with the Bureau of Land Management allows it to build to produce two gigawatts.

“Not only do we love Utah, we love southwest Utah, really, specifically, it’s been a really terrific place to construct a project,” Jewett said. “And I think more and more we’re leaning into Utah being the hub of the geothermal revitalization that is happening right now.”
The company has already signed contracts with California customers for the planned 500 megawatts after the California Public Utilities Commission mandated utilities to procure 1,000 megawatts of geothermal and 1,000 megawatts of long-duration storage.
In 2024, Fervo announced two 15-year agreements with Southern California Edison for 320 of those megawatts, which have the capacity of powering 350,000 homes in the area. Another 31 megawatts are committed to Shell, and 18 megawatts to Clean Power Alliance.
While Google isn’t on that public list of energy customers from the Cape Station project, the company has been drawn by the potential of a carbon-free energy resource that could be turned on and off on demand. In 2021, Google announced a partnership with Fervo to help launch its commercial pilot in Nevada.
“I think Google’s interest is really materializing now as its first-time contribution to the corporate equity at Fervo because they are really showing their long-term interest in geothermal, and their belief that geothermal is going to be a big part of their energy future,” Jewett said.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has expressed deep interest in geothermal, especially after launching Operation Gigawatt, his plan to double the state’s energy production in a decade. According to Jewett, the project fits into his goal of exporting energy from the state.

“We would be excited to ultimately sell power into the state of Utah once we’ve been able to bring down costs,” she said. “But there are really high volume power demands all over the American West and I think Utah understands that being the source of the generation is not a bad thing.”
The project has also had a substantial impact on the local economy, creating new jobs and making an effort to localize its supply chain as much as possible, Jewett said.
The state wasn’t a part of this funding series, said Emy Lesofski, director of the Utah Office of Energy Development, but is excited about its prospects.
“Our state is lucky to have a unique geography that brings with it a lot of geothermal energy potential,” Lesofski said in a written statement. “Geothermal is a sustainable source of baseload power, and we welcome projects that further develop our geothermal resources.” 
During recent legislative sessions, lawmakers focused largely on establishing a framework to develop nuclear resources in the state. They have also taken steps to protect fossil fuel power, praising it for being available at all times, and have discussed further regulating solar and wind projects, criticizing them for their intermittency. 
But, they also approved $1.7 million for geothermal research and next general session may consider other geothermal-related bills, including one determining who has a claim to geothermal rights in Utah.
Jewett says every state entity that has collaborated with Fervo “has been an absolute dream to work with.”
“Of course, building any large infrastructure project is hard, but we found people in Utah to be incredibly committed to ensuring that the project gets built in the right way, both for the state of Utah and for the people in the surrounding area,” she said.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A state lawmaker has prefiled two bills for the 2026 session of the Alabama Legislature that would reduce the number of people on death row and end the practice altogether in the state.
HB 70, sponsored by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, allows the resentencing of inmates sentenced to death by a judge over a jury’s recommendation of life without parole. England also introduced HB 76 to amend the Alabama Constitution to ban the use of capital punishment in the state altogether.
“The conversation around the country, in terms of introducing legislation to create more death penalty crimes outside of murder, and discussions the ways that we kill people, instead of moving in that direction, maybe we should figure out if it is something that we still want to do or not,” England said in an interview on Wednesday.

The bills are unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled Legislature, where there will be at least two efforts to expand capital punishment in the 2026 session: one to create a capital offense to commit murder while “knowingly creat(ing) a great risk of death to multiple persons;”  the other to extend the death penalty to child sexual assault.
Until 2017, Alabama allowed judges to impose the death sentence in capital cases, even if a jury had recommended life in prison. That year, the Alabama Legislature approved a law filed by former Sen. Dick Brewbaker, R-Pike Road, that prohibited the practice, known as judicial override. The bill was not retroactive, and about 30 of the 155 inmates on Alabama’s death row, sentenced before the 2017 law, could be covered by the bill.
The state has executed at least 12 people who were sentenced to death despite a jury’s recommendation of life in prison, according to findings from the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit based in Alabama that focuses on criminal justice reform.
England introduced legislation similar to HB 70 in previous legislative sessions in the quadrennium. In 2024, the House Judiciary Committee rejected HB 27 that would have allowed resentencing for death row inmates sentenced under judicial override.
HB 76 would amend the constitution to prohibit the use of capital punishment.
“No crime shall be punishable by death, and the Legislature, by general law, shall prohibit the death penalty for the commission of any crime,” the proposed amendment in England’s bill states. “Any general law authorizing any individual to be punished by death shall be deemed void.”
England filed HB 76 as the number of people executed in the United States in 2025 reached 48. That number could rise by the end of the year, due to pending executions.
Lawmakers in several states, particularly in the South, have introduced bills that expand the application of the death penalty for crimes other than murder. However, the use of the death penalty is now confined to a handful of conservative states like Alabama. Nationally, public support for capital punishment has declined for over three decades.
“What is interesting is executions are going up but the amount of people getting sentenced to death is going down,” England said. “It appears that across the country there may be a trend developing that the death penalty is not as acceptable as it once was.”
The Alabama Legislature will begin the 2026 regular session on Jan. 13.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Chris-England-April-1-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Western states that rely on the Colorado River have less than two months to agree on how to manage the troubled river – and pressure is mounting as the federal government pushes for a compromise and a troubling forecast for the river’s two biggest reservoirs looms.
Top water officials for the seven Colorado River Basin states — Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming — gathered for the three-day Colorado River Water Users Association conference at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas last week.
Colorado River states have until Feb. 14 to reach a new water sharing agreement before current operating rules expire at the end of 2026 —or the federal government will step in with their own plan.
Despite the fast-approaching deadline, states reiterated many of the same issues they did during previous years at the conference, namely, which water users will need to sacrifice more water to keep the Colorado River stable as overallocation, climate change, and rising demand sucks the river dry.
Nevada’s chief river negotiator and general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority John Entsminger offered a succinct but sharp assessment of the negotiations during a panel discussion Thursday.
“If you distill down what my six partners just said, I believe there’s three common things: Here’s all the great things my state has done. Here’s how hard/impossible it is to do any more. And here are all the reasons why other people should have to do more,” Entsminger said.
“As long as we keep polishing those arguments and repeating them to each other, we are going nowhere,” he continued.
The seven states that share the river’s flows have been deadlocked for nearly two years over how to govern the waterway through the coming decades — even as water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell are forecasted to reach record lows after two straight years of disappointing snowpack across the West.
The Colorado River’s headwaters saw a weak snowpack last winter, contributing to one of the worst spring runoff seasons on record. Water flow into the river this year was only 56% of average, leading to significant reductions in Lake Powell, according to the Interior Department’s Bureau of Reclamation.
Federal officials also released a troubling forecast of expected flows for the river in 2026, which were significantly lower than previous predictions. Projections from the Bureau of Reclamation found the Colorado River’s inflow next year would likely be 27% lower than normal, with worst-case scenarios predicting even lower flows.
Without a strong winter snow season, it’s possible Lake Powell’s levels could drop low enough to cease hydropower production by next October — a scenario that would also limit the department’s ability to send water downstream to Arizona, California and Nevada.
The federal government has refrained from imposing its own plan for the river, preferring the seven basin states reach consensus themselves. But the Interior Department has ramped up pressure on states to reach a deal.
The Bureau of Reclamation’s Acting Commissioner Scott Cameron said he and other federal officials have intensified efforts to bring states to a consensus, flying out West every other week since early April to meet with the seven states’ river negotiators.
“The expiration of the current agreements is not a distant horizon. It’s less than a year away. The time to act is now,” said Cameron.
Within the next few weeks, the Bureau of Reclamation will release a range of proposals to replace the river’s current operating rules, but said they would not identify which set of operating guidelines the federal government would prefer
During the conference, negotiators for the seven states repeated that they are still committed to finding a consensus despite missing previous deadlines. California’s biggest water districts said they were willing to “set aside many of their legal positions” in order to reach a seven-state agreement.
However, a long-term multidecade strategy for managing low river flows is likely out of reach.
“I went into this process…advocating strenuously for a 20- to 30-year deal,” said Entsminger. “I no longer believe that’s possible with the time we have left and with the hydrology that we’re facing.”
Entsminger said the “best possible outcome at this juncture” is a short-term five-year deal that sets new rules around water releases and storage at Lakes Powell and Mead.
During a panel of state negotiators, states highlighted water conservation efforts they have undertaken to reduce water use and protect the river, but all explained why their state can’t take on more cuts.
“Our savings accounts are totally depleted,” said Utah’s’s river negotiator, Gene Shawcroft. “Reserviours were full when we started this process. They’re empty now.”
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use during dry years.
The Lower Basin – Nevada, Arizona, and California – have agreed to take the first 1.5 million acre-feet in water cuts needed to address deficits and evaporation that are reducing flows in the river, but say any additional cuts during dry years must be shared with upstream states. Under the current agreement, Lower Basin states must take mandetory cuts when water levels in Lakes Powell and Mead are low.
The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under the current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts during shortages.
Any more cuts to water users in downstream states during dry years will be politically perilous, explained Arizona’s top negotiator, Tom Buschatzke. Arizona requires the state legislature to approve any changes to Colorado River management rules impacting the state.
Buschatzke called for the Upper Basin – Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, and Utah – to split any additional water cuts with the Lower Basin states 50-50.
“We need conservation in the Upper Basin that is verifiable and mandatory,” Buschatzke said, during the panel.
“I have to go to my legislature and get that approval,” he continued. “And I will say right now, I do not think there is anything on the table from the Upper Basin that would compel me to do that today.”
New Mexico’s river negotiator, Estevan López, responded, “I think we’ve been pretty clear. We are unwilling to require additional mandatory reductions on our water users.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC09044-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Senior Californians in rural communities are dying by suicide at troubling rates—struggling with pain, cut off from doctors and mental health care, with guns at hand. Access to care and safety planning would help, experts say. 


By the early afternoon of her 59th birthday, Kelly Frost had a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. She had lunch with girlfriends near her home in Douglas City — a rural community nestled among the ponderosa pines of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in Northern California. But she kept thinking about her “Daddy-o,” Jeffrey Butler, her 81-year-old father. He was not returning her calls. 
As she drove home around 4 p.m., she stopped to check in on him. Her dad lived in a two-bedroom cabin just up the road from her place. “I was kind of feeling angry with him because he hadn’t answered all day,” Frost said. 
When she opened the door, she glanced at the “Papa chair,” his favorite recliner, the spot where she usually found him. He wasn’t there. That’s when she noticed his feet on the kitchen floor. He was slumped over on his right side, a pool of blood around his head. 
Frost’s first thought was that her dad had taken a fall. She blew an air horn that she and her dad kept around in case they ever needed help. A neighbor met her promptly, and it was he who noticed the revolver.
“He said, ‘No, Kel, there’s a gun on the counter,’ and then I realized that he had shot himself,” Frost said.
Butler died on Dec. 18, 2024 from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head. His death is part of a dark reality — a public health crisis that often goes overlooked: older adults are increasingly turning to guns to end their lives. 
In California, 5,825 adults aged 70 or older died by gun suicide between 2009 and 2023,  according to mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided by the Gun Violence Data Hub. The numbers are especially stark among older white men in rural areas. 
In Trinity County – population just over 15,600 – at least eight men 70 or older, including Butler, died from an apparent firearm suicide between 2020 and 2024, incident reports from the Trinity County Sheriff’s office show.

Trinity County isn’t alone. Rural Northern California counties have some of the nation’s highest rates of gun suicides among older adults. Over the course of 15 years, the gun suicide rate of adults 70 and older in Trinity, Tehama, Plumas, Lassen, Glenn, Calaveras, and Amador was 35.6 deaths per 100,000, more than triple the statewide rate. 

Across the country, adults over 70 have the highest suicide rate of any age group. Experts say these deaths may get little attention because society empathizes with struggling older adults who want to control how their lives end. 
“I think we sometimes don’t talk about them because I think people sort of brush it off as like, it’s understandable or it’s not preventable, and I think that’s the real piece of the narrative that we need to change,” said Dr. Emmy Betz, an emergency medicine doctor and a firearm injury prevention expert at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. 
Behind the deaths are a number of factors, according to research and law enforcement incident reports. These include loneliness and social isolation, depression, financial struggles, illness and pain, and feeling like a burden. 
In rural areas, easier access to guns is also a key contributor.
Unresolved pain
For more than a year before his death, Butler had been in pain. It radiated through his abdomen, making the simple act of urinating an ordeal, Frost said. Last year, in February, a CT scan revealed the problem: a crystal blockage in his urethra. He found a urologist in Redding, one county over. Each visit to the specialist required navigating the hour-long descent down Highway 299, scenic but winding. Frost drove him to the appointments. 
A Bay Area native with Oklahoma roots, Butler had retired early to Trinity County, nearly 40  years ago. He had worked for large companies, including Hanes and Hostess, and done well in the stock market. Alongside the Trinity River, renowned for its steelhead trout and salmon, he bought cabins for himself and his daughter.

It’s here where Frost’s kids grew up. Butler’s granddaughter Michaela Frost grew up to be a horse lover like her Papa. His grandson Jake Ritter said he could spend hours talking and fishing with his grandfather. His Papa was happiest fishing.
But the last months of his life brought Butler little joy.
In July of 2024, Butler had surgery in Redding to remove the blockage in his urethra. But the pain and discomfort continued through the summer. In September, he was admitted for three days to the emergency room in nearby Weaverville with a severe urinary tract infection. Frost said that during this time she tried to call her dad’s urologist several times to reschedule a follow-up appointment he missed while in the hospital, but she could only reach an answering machine.
Butler’s physician assistant in Weaverville called several times too, but no luck, Frost said. The physician assistant “literally threw her hands in the air and said, ‘I can’t get any response.’” That was one of the few times Frost saw her dad cry. “My dad never cried. He was a cowboy.”
After his death, first responders found an undated note in Butler’s home. It began:
The pain???????!!!!!!!!!!To much to standNo Help
By mid-fall, the infections, desperation and heavy antibiotics use were changing her dad’s mental state, Frost said. He wasn’t interested in fishing. Or watching his 49ers. Or spending time with his wild mustang, Spade, or with the guys down at the Tangle Blue Saloon, where he would order a shot of whisky with a coke back. 
His cabin grew darker; he no longer drew his camo-print curtains open. Frost estimates that in the span of about a year, Butler lost almost 100 pounds, transforming him from a stout 230-pound man to a fragile version of himself.
Older adults are likely to plan suicide more carefully, and their attempts are more likely to be fatal, according to the National Council on Aging. In California, older women are more likely to overdose, while most older men will use guns, according to state public health data. 
Pain and health issues are a common thread among older adults who die by gun suicide. State data show that 55% of people 70 and over who died this way had a contributing physical health problem, and 27% had a diagnosed mental health condition. 

Among the eight older men that died by gun suicide in Trinity County between 2020 and 2024, two struggled with respiratory conditions. One had recently discovered a bladder tumor. One man’s antidepressants were found near his body, and another had reportedly been speaking about suicide for some time but did not meet the requirements for an involuntary psychiatric hold, according to incident reports.
The rural divide
Trinity County holds a deep beauty: the rush of the Trinity River, the rising fog on a chilly morning, the sprawling pines that make the rugged mountain sides their home.
But large supermarkets are a county over, a steep and twisty road away. And so is most of the medical care.

“We have more limited access to essential services and resources compared to the rest of California,” said Cathy Tillman, a health services program manager at Trinity County Health and Human Services. “We have to travel further for all services, which plays a role in the ability for people to get their needs met.” 
California’s rural counties have more older residents: about 25% compared to the state average of around 17%, according to the SCAN Foundation, an advocacy and research organization for older adults. By 2040, the 85-and-older population in rural California is expected to grow 50 times faster than the working age population. But access to medical and social services for seniors lag significantly when compared to larger, urban regions. 
Trinity County has one 25-bed hospital, and a handful of clinics, largely in Weaverville, the county seat. But even reaching Weaverville from other Trinity County communities could take 30 minutes to an hour. For anything more specialized, residents here usually travel an hour to Redding, or two hours for providers in Eureka and Chico. With a small population, Trinity County can’t easily support specialists — like a neurologist or urologist — setting up practice. 
Going further for care means people often miss appointments, or delay them, and live longer with pain. 
Arina Erwin, deputy director of the county’s health and human services agency, said even some general practitioners who come to Trinity don’t stay long. 
“Living in a small community and a frontier community can be a challenge on its own,” Erwin said. Doctors and specialists have student loans to repay, making cities where they can earn a significantly higher income seem more attractive. For years, the hospital and clinics in Trinity have reported trouble replacing retiring doctors. Even virtual care here can be a challenge, because broadband is spotty, especially in pockets with only a few dozen residents, Erwin said.
People who live in rural areas also foster a cultural barrier — a rural spirit of sorts. Tillman said they tend to be more independent, and used to doing things on their own terms; they may also be less likely to seek help. 
Frost said that sounds familiar. She saw first-hand how her proud, self-reliant, sometimes stubborn father lost his independence as the pain took hold. 
Remembering Papa
In Frost’s living room – with the sun shining through the large windows on a December afternoon – memories of Butler, called Papa by his grandkids, stirred both laughter and tears. 



First: A photograph of Jeffrey Butler is displayed next to holiday items at Kelly Frost’s home. Last: Jake Ritter takes a moment to remember his grandfather, Jeffrey Butler in Douglas City on Dec. 4, 2025. Photos by Salvador Ochoa for CalMatters
As a kid, grandson Jake Ritter would get up before sunrise to go fishing with his Papa — sometimes begrudgingly — but by lunchtime they’d be happily eating their catch. He remembers cruising on Butler’s riding lawnmower and watching old westerns with him. 
Ritter and his sister, Michaela, loved listening to his stories, like the time he shot a bobcat as it launched toward him while he was out deer hunting. He had the bobcat stuffed to prove it. Or how, as a teen in San Pablo, Butler chased and tackled a man trying to rob the Lucky store where he worked. The family still has the news clipping.
Michaela is glad her papa got to meet her first-born, Blake, and wishes her three-month-old, Daniella, could have as well. 
Butler’s suicide left his family in turmoil and with so many questions. Ritter felt angry at his papa for the way he decided to go. Why do this on his mom’s birthday? Frost often wonders: What were her dad’s last thoughts?
After a suicide, families are more likely to experience a complicated grieving process, with feelings of guilt, confusion, shame, anger and trauma, research shows. 
In the year since Butler’s death, Frost’s family has largely relied on each other through their grief. Ritter said his anger at his grandfather has subsided; he is now coming to terms with his Papa’s decision. 
“I’m sad that he didn’t get the help that he needed, and I’m sad that he felt so strongly that this is the road that he chose,” Ritter said.
Frost said she gave herself a year to navigate the feelings on her own, but now with the encouragement of friends is considering seeking professional help. 
Warning signs and storing guns
In Trinity County, health officials are preparing to launch an injury and suicide prevention program, said Tillman, the county health services program manager. A big component of the county’s strategy will be education to help reduce the stigmas associated with suicide and mental health. Tillman said the plan is to find and train trusted messengers in the small pockets where people live.
Dr. Amy Barnhorst, a psychiatrist and associate director of the Centers for Violence Prevention at UC Davis, said that recognizing a sense of independence and self-reliance common to rural communities is essential to prevention programs.  Education around safe gun storage is also key, she added.
“You can’t discount the fact that having access to a firearm, period, all other things being equal, increases the risk that somebody will die by suicide by a factor of more than three,” Barnhorst said. 
She helps lead a state-funded curriculum at UC Davis called The BulletPoints Project, which trains health providers on how to identify at-risk patients and speak to them about gun safety.
The project also trains people applying for and renewing concealed carry weapon permits. Under state law, that category of gun owners must complete at least an hour of mental health training. 
The course aims to help these gun owners identify a mental health crisis. People who already own guns – like Jeff Butler – never had to take a course like this. 
Kelly Frost said she doesn’t know if her dad would have accepted mental health help. It was not something they talked about. His will to live wrestled in the words found in his house, the note she still clings closely to. It ends:  
What would you do?End it???The pain not life
Since her dad’s passing, Frost has had many sleepless nights, pondering questions and thoughts. She feels she tried her best to get him care, but wishes access had been easier. What signs did she miss? But mostly: Why hadn’t she taken away the guns?

Growing up around guns, it never crossed her mind that her Daddy-o would one day turn his revolver on himself. 
“Had I known that he was capable of this, I probably would have worked a little harder to make sure that the guns were not accessible,” Frost said. 
This Dec. 18, the one year anniversary of Butler’s death and Frost’s 60th birthday, she had a shot of Canadian whisky from the last bottle she gave him. His guns are now in a safe.

It was shaped by concerns over masked immigration agents in Los Angeles.,"In summary
The Trump administration is suing to block a new California law that would ban federal law enforcement officers from wearings masks on duty. It was shaped by concerns over masked immigration agents in Los Angeles.


A series of immigration raids across California in 2025 had one thing in common: Most of the federal agents detaining people wore masks over their faces. 
In January, the state of California and its largest county will ban law enforcement officers from covering their faces, with a few exceptions, putting local and state police at odds with masked immigration agents.
The state law gives law enforcement officers a choice: If they cover their faces, they lose the ability to assert “qualified immunity,” the doctrine that protects officers from individual liability for their actions. That means they can be sued for assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest or malicious prosecution, and the law adds a clause that says the minimum penalty for committing those offenses while wearing a mask is $10,000.  
Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, a Los Angeles Democrat who co-authored the law, said it was necessary to rein in anonymous federal agents.
“We initially were under the understanding that, oh, they’re only targeting folks who were not citizens,” Gonzalez said, “And then actually over time you learn they don’t give a shit who you are, they’re attacking you no matter what, with no due process.”
The Trump administration has sued to block the bill, and more than a century of federal court precedent is on its side. An 1890 Supreme Court case provides that a state cannot prosecute a federal law enforcement officer acting in the course of their duties. 
The Trump administration said in its brief to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that forcing agents to reveal their identities would put the agents at risk. 
During Immigration and Customs Enforcement “actions, individuals can be heard threatening to doxx and find out who officers and their family members are and where they live,” the administration’s lawyers said in the Nov. 17 brief. “There are even public websites that seek and publish personal information about ICE and other federal officers to harass and threaten them and their families.”
Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law, said the issue may not be as cut-and-dried as one or two Supreme Court cases. He pointed to a 2001 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that allowed the case of a federal sniper who killed a woman during the 1992 Ruby Ridge, Idaho, standoff to go to trial. 
“It basically says that a federal officer can be criminally prosecuted for unreasonable actions,” Chemerinsky said. “Federal officers, by virtue of being federal officers, do not get immunity from all state civil and criminal laws.” 
Brian Marvel, president of an organization that represents California police unions, said the law will make life harder for local cops and county sheriffs’ deputies. The organizations that represent police chiefs, sheriffs, agents in the Attorney General’s office and California Highway Patrol officers opposed the law, too.
“I think that the state has put us in a tenuous position with this battle they’re having with the Trump administration,” said Marvel of the Peace Officers Research Association of California. “We don’t want to be in the middle of this fight. But unfortunately, (with) the desire for higher name recognition and elections in 2026, they decided to create things that are much more political and not geared toward legitimate public safety issues.”
Marvel said another drawback of the law is giving “a false sense of hope to the immigrant community in California” that the law will force federal agents to leave the state. 
Los Angeles County supervisors have also approved a local mask ban on law enforcement for unincorporated areas of the county, a measure that will go into effect in mid-January, unless a court decision comes sooner.  
Gonzalez noted that masks have played a significant role in recent California history. First,, during the pandemic California temporarily made masks mandatory in public and at work. Then, a couple of years later, a rush of smash-and-grab robberies were harder to solve because the suspects all wore masks. Now, California finds itself in its third back-and-forth over face coverings.

Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, greets a crowd at an Alabama Republican Party fundraiser on Aug. 4, 2023. Tuberville last week called for the forced deportation of Muslims. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)Tommy Tuberville’s escalating attacks on Muslim Americans culminated last week in a demand for their mass deportation.
We’ve seen this from Alabama’s senior U.S. senator before.
Tuberville once said that Black Americans “do the crime.” He called most immigrants “garbage.” He compared residents of inner cities to rats.
The former Auburn coach has made it clear over his term in the U.S. Senate that he works for a very white, very Christian and very wealthy sliver of the population of Alabama — this is a man who recently called for federal aid for forest owners — while viewing the rest of us with contempt.
A contempt so profound that he would violently remove some Alabamians from their homes and communities for the way they worship God.
I know the tendency in this state to wave away the bile that comes out of our politicians’ mouths. Pretending it’s performative. Or even grimly funny. Maybe that’s a coping mechanism for living under a decidedly undemocratic government.
But no one should treat this as one of Tuberville’s many stupid, provocative statements with no follow-through. This man, running to lead 5 million Alabamians, considers large numbers of people who live here aliens or threats to public safety. If he is elected governor, he will have access to law enforcement resources and the ability to act on his paranoia.
Just the threat of that should give you pause.
It won’t matter if our already-compromised federal courts try to stop him. The damage done to innocent people — financial, psychological, maybe even physical — will have been done.
Tuberville is pursuing the standard online strategy of pretending his critics are overreacting. “Pearl-clutching,” as he tells it. If so, he can clear that up with a straightforward, unambiguous statement that he has a responsibility to serve all Alabamians. And that he will not prosecute the people who live in this state for their faith.
I’m not holding my breath. This is a man who took many months to issue a grudging acknowledgment that white nationalism is racism.
What does that say about us?
The first vote for Tuberville in 2020 didn’t pay Alabama any compliments. Here was a political neophyte who may not have lived in Alabama, who ducked all but the softest questions and interviews, and had no agenda beyond nodding vigorously at everything Donald Trump said.
But then, lots of Alabama Republicans in 2020 ran on a platform of ‘I am Trump as Trump is me and we are all together.’ Perhaps — perhaps — one could have voted for him without anticipating what was in store.
That’s no longer the case. You know what this man is about.
And you know what he does with one of the most important jobs in the country. He chases clout with some of the most pathetic, obnoxious people around. He’s using the public trust to become an influencer.
As for his actual duties, he barely promotes infrastructure and has embraced trade policies that ruin business here. Tuberville’s apparent hatred of immigrants is a serious roadblock to what (so far) appear to be sincere efforts by Republicans in the state to boost Alabama’s low workforce participation rate.
But he’s the favorite. Because he will be at the top of a ballot most people won’t study past the “Democratic/Republican” box on the top.
Tuberville is counting on Alabamians not caring. He wants the voters of this state to check the box and tune out every promise he makes to terrorize your neighbors and waste law enforcement resources on right-wing hallucinations.
Many, many people who live here will embrace a man who wants to hurt the people who live here.
And they will do it claiming that they are upholding some vague set of values.
But deeply-held principles don’t put a person like Tommy Tuberville in a position of power. He gets to the top because of a deep cynicism about government and power.
Alabamians have good reason to feel their state government fails them. But all too often, that feeling curdles into a belief that government always fails. No matter where it is, what it does or who runs it.
It’s understandable. But if citizens believe politics can never deliver adequate schools, opportunity or health care, every vote becomes a protest vote. Every election becomes a search for blame.
That’s perfect for someone who has nothing to offer but targets. No plan, no hope, no way forward. Just a vent for pointless rage that leaves us worse than before. And wounding many innocent people in the process.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tommy-Tuberville-Aug-4-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Common Cause NM and two NM registered voters say the federal government's push for New Mexico voter roll data threatens voting rights in the state. (Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Nonprofit good government group Common Cause, along with two New Mexico residents, have filed a motion to intervene in the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit against New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver.
Lawyers from the ACLU National Voting Rights Project and ACLU of New Mexico are representing them.
As Source NM previously reported, the federal agency began asking state election officials for their voter rolls last July. Toulouse Oliver told Source at the time her office was “reviewing whether or not we are legally able to prevent sending the private data, which would be Social Security, all dates of birth and driver’s license numbers.”
Ultimately, the New Mexico Secretary of State says it provided the federal government with publicly available data roll information, which excluded Social Security numbers and full dates of birth.
On Dec. 2, the US DOJ announced it was suing New Mexico and several other states for not providing the requested data.
In the filing arguing for the right to intervene in the case, Common Cause contends that it has more than 9,000 members and supporters in New Mexico “whose personal data will be provided to the federal government if DOJ prevails in this lawsuit.”
In addition to Common Cause, proposed intervenors include registered New Mexico voter Claudia Medina, who has lived in the state for more than three decades. Born in Colombia, Medina moved to the United States to attend graduate school and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1995, the suit says, and registered to vote the same day. “She has voted regularly in local, state, and federal elections ever since.”
Rocking the Vote

However, the filing notes, Medina “is concerned about how DOJ might use her sensitive voter data, particularly in light of widely reported recent examples of the federal government’s provision of data to unvetted members of the Department of Government Efficiency …without adequate guardrails or privacy protections.” As such, Medina “fears that the federal government’s efforts to gain voters’ sensitive information will make eligible voters—especially naturalized citizens like herself— ‘less likely to register to vote or even just to vote..’”
Another proposed intervenor, Justin Allen, is described in the filing as a registered New Mexico voter and lifelong New Mexico resident. 
“As a young gay man, Mr. Allen’s family did not accept his homosexuality, which led him to engage in ‘self-defeating behaviors such as substance abuse,’ resulting in criminal felony convictions and his incarceration,” the suit says. 
While incarcerated, Allen “came to understand the importance of using his voice and exercising his rights, and after his release, he registered to vote when he became eligible to have his rights restored. He also became “a leading advocate for New Mexico’s Voting Rights Act, including the provision focusing on restoration of formerly incarcerated people’s right to vote.”
Allen doesn’t feel safe “knowing that there is a chance” the Trump administration will have his data “and the data of every other registered New Mexican voter,” and he believes that formerly incarcerated people, “despite their voting rights having been restored, will either not register to vote or not vote if the Trump Administration has access to their voter registration information.” 
According to a news release, Common Cause previously filed a lawsuit in Nebraska to protect state voter data and has similarly joined with the ACLU Voting Rights Project to file motions to intervene as defendants in DOJ lawsuits against Maryland, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota.
“Unelected bureaucrats in Washington have no business accessing New Mexicans’ sensitive personal information,” Common Cause New Mexico Executive Director Molly Swank said in a statement. “Handing this data over to the federal government violates the law and would put voters’ private information in the hands of dangerous election conspiracy peddlers. Common Cause is fighting to protect the rights of New Mexico voters and to prevent the potential misuse of their data.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1263-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Department of Defense photo by U.S. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza)This story was originally published by Grist.
Pete Hegseth, who has taken to calling himself the Secretary of War, says the Defense Department “does not do climate change crap.” Just last week, he asserted that the agency  “will not be distracted” by climate change or “woke moralizing.”
But a new report suggests that the Pentagon is engaging with the issue in one serious way: As it stockpiles dozens of critical minerals, it is threatening the energy transition by hoarding resources that could be used to decarbonize transportation, energy production, and other sectors.
President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $7.5 billion to bolster the Pentagon’s reserves of critical minerals like cobalt, lithium, and graphite that are held in six depots nationwide, an effort supervised by the Defense Logistics Agency. Such materials are used in everything from jet engines to weapons systems, and often are mined or processed in China or other nations. The materials in the stockpile are only accessible during times of declared war, or by order of the Undersecretary of War, a Defense Logistics Agency spokesperson said.
The report on potential peaceful uses for those materials was released by the Transition Security Project, which analyzes the economic, climate, and geopolitical threats posed by the U.S. and British military. Lorah Steichen, a strategist who prepared the document, said America is essentially facing a choice between missiles and buses. The Pentagon’s planned cobalt and graphite stockpiles (7,500 metric tons and 50,000 metric tons, respectively) could electrify 102,896 buses — dwarfing the 6,000 or so currently operating in the U.S. Or they could be used to produce 80.2 gigawatt-hours of battery capacity, which is more than twice the energy storage the country has now.
The International Energy Agency also has said such minerals could be used for peaceful ends, like building the batteries and wind turbines and other technologies underpinning the green transition. But designating a mineral as “critical” allows the government to fast-track mining and procurement for military ends. “The term ‘critical minerals’ originates out of military stockpiling – the criticality of a mineral is linked, in part, to its significance to national security,” Steichen said.
The last time the Pentagon hoarded non-fuel materials was during the Cold War, when the government sought to create storehouses of industrial raw materials (like metals and agricultural supplies) and limit dependency on other nations. By the late 1990s, the United States began to see other countries – particularly those in the Caribbean – as generally reliable suppliers, and by 2003 the stockpile was reduced to nearly nothing. During Joe Biden’s presidency, there was some movement toward reviving the stockpile specifically to fight climate change. (That plan, according to a DLA spokesperson, never came to fruition.) This year, however, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill allocated $2 billion for expansion of the hoard, and $5.5 billion toward the supply chain infrastructure needed to secure those minerals.
Even some military and governmental experts have agreed that expanding the government’s stash is concerning. A Department of Defense report from 2021, for example, said that if the supply chain for rare earth elements — a subset of critical minerals — is disrupted, “the civilian economy would bear the brunt of harm.”
“The point here is to push back against some of the bellicose associations of critical minerals and the different assumptions that go into that,” Steichen said. “What are the materials that are actually necessary for the energy transition, compared to this other definition of criticality?”
Militaries aren’t required to report their greenhouse-gas emissions — and the US military, in particular, is the single largest institutional emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and accounts for about 80 percent of the U.S. government’s overall emissions. They also generally aren’t required to report the quantities of minerals they’re procuring and using.
Julie Klinger, a geographer at the University of Wisconsin who studies extraction and resource frontiers, says these things deserve more scrutiny. “Particularly as we’re moving into a time where there is much more overt taxpayer funded support of critical mineral mining and processing projects, the taxpayer does need to have quite a bit more information,” she said.
The Defense Logistics Agency made an unusual admission when it released exactly how much cobalt and graphite it is working to procure. Often, Steichen said, such information isn’t easily available to the public. Some numbers are known – for example, a single F-35 warplane reportedly requires about 920 pounds of rare earth minerals for its engines and weapons-tracking systems. But across the Pentagon’s vast web of suppliers, it’s not clear where all the minerals are going.
“It creates an accountability gap, and obscures a clear understanding of military resource use,” Steichen said. “We know this is the amount they’re seeking to stockpile – but we don’t know the specific volume of those materials going into different military sectors, or to different military contractors.”
The Pentagon has been investing in mines that produce some of these minerals, in places like Alaska, Idaho and Saudi Arabia. Right-wing think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and Rand have spent the past five years urging the government to stockpile these materials to ease its reliance on adversaries like China, which currently dominates the global critical minerals market.
Researchers like Klinger question the federal decision to prioritize military stockpiling – in part because most critical minerals like graphite have the potential to be recycled when they’re used in batteries, but are lost when made into, say, bombs. One thing sustaining demand for fossil fuels is the fact they are consumed through use, Klinger said. Critical minerals like lithium and cobalt, on the other hand, can, when used for civilian purposes, be reclaimed or recycled.
“The one application of critical minerals that destroys them through use is literally blowing them up,” she said. “Are these critical minerals going into energy technologies, which then have a whole host of societal benefits, or are they simply being dug out of the ground in one place to be blown up in another place?”

utilizing the public-private partnership model.
CADP is the latest former government agency to adopt this model that has been deployed successfully around the state by Greenville, Myrtle Beach, Florence, Laurens, Chester, and Sumter counties to effectively leverage collaboration and financing within the public and private sectors in an effort to grow and expand economic opportunities.
Harnessing the power of this model will drive opportunities and shape the future of not only the regions where it is deployed, but for the state of South Carolina as a whole.

In the few months that CADP has utilized the public-private partnership model, it is already producing results.
In early November, the partnership model was evident in the opening of the Cornerstone: Economic Development and Workforce Training Center on Midlands Technical College’s campus in northeast Columbia.
This state-of-the-art, 41,000-square-foot regional training facility is the result of a joint effort between key local and state government and educational partners: Richland County, state Department of Commerce, state Technical College System, its readySC division, and Midlands Technical College, facilitated by the leadership of CADP.
Public sector dollars paid for the creation of Cornerstone, and private sector investments will sustain it as companies pay to use this facility.
The Cornerstone concept emerged from a conversation with officials at readySC, who needed a place to hire and train Scout’s workforce while its Blythewood plant is being constructed.
While the concept began before CADP’s official launch, the effort utilized the public-private partnership model to bring industry leaders to the table with government and education officials to develop an innovative solution that would provide a facility to meet Scout’s immediate need while creating a resource for other companies looking to locate or expand in the Columbia area in the future.
This collaboration among public and private sector entities exemplifies the power of the model.
Hiring begins for the employees who will maintain Scout Motors’ SC assembly lines

It enables entities like CADP to be more nimble and responsive than a traditional government economic development office. Involving private companies in the planning maximizes expertise and allows for the most efficient use of resources and capabilities.
In the instance of Cornerstone, we were able to renovate an existing office building in just 13 months to create a hub for industry hiring and workforce training on time and within our $5
million budget.
This was a win-win situation for all the entities involved, and it also has positive ripple effects for the community.
Economic development isn’t just about dollars and cents; it is about people. In the Columbia area, our greatest asset is our residents who fill the jobs and make our companies and our communities grow and thrive.
The Cornerstone facility will train up to 20,000 local residents annually to prepare them to take on the high-paying, skilled careers created as our manufacturing sector continues to grow.
Because of this, it is easier to attract new and expand existing industries that will fuel our economy and keep jobs local.
In addition to the workforce training facility, CADP’s public-private partnership model has aided in recent development announcements like Vulcan Real Estate’s plan to build the Grand Willow Hotel in Columbia’s historic BullStreet District and Core Spaces’ new ōLiv retail and student housing development on Columbia’s Main Street.
A new era of opportunity in SC’s Midlands

Since July, the Columbia area has reported a drumbeat of new industry investments including Scout Motors’ $300 million supplier park in Blythewood and Pontiac Solar‘s $112.5 million solar energy farm in Eastover.
None of these announcements would have happened without collaboration and partnerships.
Think of CADP as the conductor who brings the various entities, public and private, together to orchestrate a powerful harmony.
The public-private partnership model at the heart of our work is important for our long-term success.
In a rapidly growing area like Columbia, the model is built to keep up with the growth.
This synergy between the public and private sectors brings innovation in infrastructure and technology and operational efficiencies, which all lead to better long-term prospects for economic development in the region.
CADP is excited about what lies ahead as we build on our successes and continue to enhance the opportunities for all of our residents.

Here's a look at some of them.,"Connecticut will kick off 2026 with nearly two dozen new laws that are slated to wholly or partially take effect on Jan 1.
The laws touch a range of areas in the state, from farming to pharmaceuticals to housing to the justice system.
Connecticut laws are passed by the General Assembly during the legislative session each year — this year’s ran from Jan. 8 to June 4 — or in a special session. They typically take effect on Jan. 1, July 1 or Oct. 1.
Here’s a look at some of the laws that will be implemented on day one of the new year.
Wide-ranging housing bill
Most of H.B. 8002, a sweeping, contentious housing bill, will take effect on Jan. 1. 
The bill’s major goal is to make it easier to build more housing in Connecticut. It requires towns to create housing growth plans with goals on how many units they’ll plan and zone for, changes minimum off-street parking requirements and incentivizes towns to take steps to allow more housing, among other measures.
It also expands the number of fair rent commissions — a government body that can hear complaints about rent increases and make decisions on whether to change that rental increase number — and bans “hostile architecture,” or the use of things like armrests in the middle of benches or spikes to make it harder for people experiencing homelessness to lie down.
The bill was a modified version of H.B. 5002, which Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed during the 2025 legislative session, saying he wanted to get local leaders on board with the measure. Behind the scenes, he and advisors fretted over the political implications of signing the measure as they received thousands of calls from opponents and Lamont considered a third-term run next year.
Lawmakers passed H.B. 8002 during a two-day special session from Nov. 13-14, and Lamont signed it into law on Nov. 26.
Solar panels on condo units
Condo complexes can no longer enforce provisions in their bylaws that “prohibit or unreasonably restrict” owners of single-family detached units from putting solar panels on their roofs under a new bill that also creates a solar panel approval process for condo unit owners and their associations to follow.
Existing condo associations can opt out of these requirements if at least 75% of their board of directors votes to do so. However, that vote would need to occur by Jan. 1, 2028.
Connecticut already restricts planned community associations from prohibiting solar panels. The new law is essentially an expansion to include condos as well.
Driver’s license applications
Learner’s permit holders must take an eight-hour course prior to getting their driver’s license under existing law, and Connecticut currently allows students to take it both in-person and through distance learning. Beginning Jan. 1, anyone taking the class remotely must keep their camera on, and driving schools can now charge up to $200 for it (the previous limit was $150).
Under that same law, as of Jan. 1 many applicants for a driver’s license or learner’s permit — as well as drivers convicted of violating highway worker safety laws — must complete a program administered by the Department of Motor Vehicles on highway work zone and roadside vehicle safety awareness. 
All 16- and 17-year-old driver’s license applicants who get a learner’s permit beginning Jan. 1, 2026 must take the program, as well as adult driver’s license applicants who meet certain requirements (like having not previously held a Connecticut license or not currently holding a valid license issued by another state, territory or country).
Minimum wage increase
On Jan. 1, Connecticut’s minimum wage will increase by $0.59, from $16.35 per hour to $16.94 per hour.
That increase comes from a law signed by Gov. Ned Lamont in 2019 that, as of 2023, pegs the state’s minimum wage to the federal employment cost index.
Connecticut currently has the fourth highest state minimum wage, behind $16.66 in Washington and $16.50 in California and most of New York. Massachusetts and Rhode Island require a minimum wage of $15.
The Borinqueneeres 
The Connecticut DMV will begin issuing commemorative license plates that recognize “The Borinqueneers,” the U.S. Army’s 65th Infantry Regiment made up largely of Puerto Rican servicemembers who served with distinction in the Korean War. 
The plates will cost $60. They will be designed in consultation with the Hispanic-American Veterans of Connecticut Inc., and that group will receive $45 from the sale of each plate for bilingual services and assistance to the state’s veterans and current servicemembers.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_071-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Photo by Sophie Nieto-Muñoz/New Jersey Monitor)A bill that would give New Jersey businesses months to deplete their inventory of intoxicating hemp products is nearing final passage in the Legislature, weeks after Congress closed a federal loophole that had allowed for their sudden proliferation.
The measure, which is scheduled for votes before the state Senate and Assembly on Monday, is legislators’ latest attempt to address what bill sponsor Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) calls a “crisis” of retailers selling sketchy hemp products to children.
“We’re creating a framework in the space of public health,” Ruiz said last week when the Senate’s budget committee advanced the legislation.
New Jersey Senate president seeks to revamp cannabis law

The bill seeks to align the state’s hemp laws with new federal definitions of hemp. A provision in the federal spending bill that ended the government shutdown in November bans hemp products with a total THC concentration of more than 0.4% starting next year. THC is the chemical compound that gets users high.
Under the New Jersey bill, hemp products cannot include more than 0.3% total THC, while hemp-derived products like gummies and vapes would be limited to 0.4 milligrams of THC per container. Products exceeding those limits would be treated as cannabis and be regulated by the state’s cannabis agency, meaning you would need a cannabis license to manufacture and sell them.
New Jersey’s measure would force some businesses to sell their products before the federal ban on intoxicating hemp products goes into effect in November 2026.
Hemp farmers have objected to the bill, saying they support state efforts to target retailers selling the kinds of hemp products Ruiz has railed against, but that the bill as written would amount to a blanket ban that would hurt family-owned hemp farms and manufacturers.
Kristen Goedde of cannabis testing lab Trichome Analytical urged lawmakers to await further federal action before restricting small hemp farmers who aren’t making products targeted to teens. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) has introduced a bill to overturn the new federal hemp restrictions, while Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) has said he’s working on similar legislation but acknowledged it will be difficult to get it through Congress.
“I understand that the federal limits created the issues that are mirrored in this bill, but there are significant efforts on the federal side to revise the definition of hemp,” Goedde told the Assembly’s appropriations committee last week.

New Jersey lawmakers have for years attempted to regulate the hemp industry, ever since a change in federal law in 2018 gave a boost to the hemp industry but also led to the rise of myriad low-THC hemp products.
Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill last year to address concerns about children buying hemp products with high levels of THC at bodegas and gas stations, but much of the law never went into effect due to a legal challenge.
Last month’s changes at the federal level led New Jersey lawmakers to pivot to the current bill up for approval.
Under the bill, businesses would have some time to get rid of products that exceed the new definitions. Shops must liquidate their inventory by April 13, 2026, and liquor stores with hemp beverages on the shelves could sell their products until Nov. 13, 2026. Beverages sold during this period would be limited to 5 mg of total THC per serving or 10 mg of total THC per container.
After those dates, businesses could face fines of $100 for the first offense, $1,000 for the second offense, and $10,000 for subsequent offenses.
Beginning in November 2026 — when the federal ban goes into effect — any beverages that exceed hemp’s federal definition would be regulated as cannabis items, and can only be sold by businesses licensed by the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission.
Another major federal change could be coming after President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week loosening federal restrictions on marijuana. The order directs officials to work with Congress to update the definition of hemp to “allow Americans to benefit from access” to those products.
Bill Caruso, a cannabis attorney and acting president of New Jersey CannaBusiness Association, compared the bill up for approval Monday to the state’s cannabis legalization effort, which allowed people in the legacy market — meaning those who sold weed when it was illegal — to obtain cannabis licenses and open stores once it was legalized. That same kind of action will be applied to the hemp industry, he said.
“It’s going to provide a clear regulatory framework, and it’s going to put a banner and a beacon in the sky: If you’re in this game and you want to continue selling in one of the richest markets in the world, there’s a way to do it now,” he said.

Hospital revenue decisions are stripping statewide communities of essential care.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Julie Wasserman: Hospital care is in Vermonters’ best interest.","This commentary is by Julie Wasserman, MPH ,of Burlington. She is an independent health policy advocate who worked for Vermont state government for over 25 years..



First and foremost, hospitals need to be responsive to the needs of their community. As non-profit tax-exempt entities, Vermont hospitals are obliged to provide essential services such as maternity, pediatric and primary care. Yet, hospitals are making decisions that deprive their community of critical services as they prioritize revenue generation over needed care. Hospital care in the public’s interest requires structural changes that explicitly address local community needs.
Vermont hospitals are eliminating essential services, in part, because such services do not generate “enough” revenue. Three examples come to mind. Despite strong community opposition, Copley Hospital eliminated its popular long-standing Birthing Center, creating a “maternity care desert,” where pregnancy, childbirth, post-partum services and reproductive care are no longer available. People must now drive long distances to receive care, and emergency roadside deliveries could become more common. Birthing in Copley’s ER? Unanticipated c-sections? Loss of pediatric backup for newborns and infants? These measures constitute unacceptable care in a hospital setting.

Loss of Copley’s birthing center further deprives this region of essential primary care, which is already in short supply. Copley’s nurse midwives provided low-cost, high quality, easily accessible primary care because they routinely addressed overweight, hypertension, diabetes, mental health and substance use. (Pregnancy can be a motivator for healthy choices.) Adding insult to injury, closure of the birthing center dramatically increases the cost of care since patients will now receive services at more expensive locations such as UVM and Central Vermont.
Copley, a small rural hospital in Morrisville, employs five orthopedic surgeons, whose combined yearly salaries total more than $4 million. Copley’s 2026 Budget includes a new fourth operating room, which increases hospital expenses by 7.9%.  Note the loss of the birthing center reduces expenses by a mere 2.4%. The five surgeons and the new operating room are both costly and revenue-enhancing.
UVM Health/Central Vermont Medical Center shuttered CVMC’s Mad River Family Practice, a primary care clinic with a waiting list of more than 500 people seeking to become patients.
Rutland Regional Medical Center’s original decision to eliminate its pediatric inpatient unit offers a third example. Rutland pediatricians, nurses and parents protested this loss of essential hospital care for infants and children who would now be served in the emergency room or sent to UVM Medical Center or Dartmouth. All are more expensive options that further traumatize families and strand those lacking adequate transportation and resources. The hospital has subsequently withdrawn its request, circumventing the regulatory Green Mountain Care Board, and instead will work with the Agency of Human Services.
Will continuation of this “maximizing revenue” approach lead hospitals to cease serving their local communities and further increase Vermont’s healthcare costs, which is one of the highest in the nation? How many more healthcare “deserts” will appear before we address this trend of hospital revenue maximization at the expense of basic healthcare services?
Hospital revenue maximization poses a veiled threat to primary care, an essential service that can prevent expensive hospitalizations. In an effort to improve affordability, the legislature and the Green Mountain Care Board have recently imposed a variety of hospital budget constraints (Act 55, Act 68, Act 49). As a result, hospitals’ low-priced, high-value care appears vulnerable to budget cuts. Individual hospitals may benefit from eliminating low-volume services, but the overall cost to the system rises, along with insurance premiums, while local communities lose access to basic care.
As Erinn Mandeville, a former nurse midwife at Copley noted, “Somehow we live in a world where, if it makes financial sense, that’s all you need to justify a completely unethical decision.” Such decisions cannot be made in a vacuum or left solely to local hospitals focused on their bottom line, especially given looming federal cuts. Moreover, these decisions do not make financial sense for the system as a whole. 
Basic essential hospital services cannot be optional. Instead, they need to be broadly available in accordance with Vermont statutes. The State should consider the following: 

Declare a moratorium on hospital service reductions until the state has completed its statewide plan. Otherwise, what is the point of a plan if many of the changes occur before the plan has been formalized? 
Adopt guidelines to guide hospital budget decisions, ensuring affordable and accessible essential services in each hospital service area, which may differ from one region to the next.

The goal is sustainable Vermont hospitals who engender trust, promote goodwill and ultimately endure while providing essential and affordable services to their local community.

Ensler announced his campaign for lieutenant governor Friday morning and said that he would use his limited powers to facilitate health debate in the Alabama Senate. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Phillip Ensler is running for lieutenant governor in part because Doug Jones is running for governor. 
In an interview Friday, Ensler, a Democrat from Montgomery, said that the former U.S. senator strongly encouraged him to enter the race. Jones confirmed that on Friday morning, saying the first-term state representative proved himself to be an effective campaigner and legislator.
“I think he is the kind of individual that works across the aisle. He works within his own caucus to try to get some things done, and he has a great reputation across the state,” Jones said. “I’ll put his experience and his abilities and intelligence up against anybody.”

Ensler is the first Democrat to join the lieutenant governor race, joining five Republicans, who include current Secretary of State Wes Allen, Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture Rick Pate, businesswoman Nicole Wadsworth, former gubernatorial candidate Dean Odle and sheriff’s deputy Patrick Bishop. 
Ensler said Friday he would try to use the relatively weak office to facilitate healthy debate in the Senate, citing his work with Republicans in the House. 
“I would want to be there to help use, as they call the ‘bully pulpit’, as a voice from the position to advocate for issues that appeal to both Democrats and Republicans,” Ensler said. 
There is little else to do in the position. The lieutenant governor becomes governor if the office becomes vacant; presides over the Senate and has some appointment powers. 
The office once held powers equivalent to the Alabama House speaker, but Democrats who controlled the Legislature shifted those to the Senate president pro tem after a weeks-long standoff with Republican Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, a Republican, in 1999. Since then, lieutenant governors have been largely powerless.
In his first term in the Legislature, Ensler advocated for a statewide ban of Glock switches, devices that can turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic ones. A version of the bill sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, became law in the spring as part of Gov. Kay Ivey’s public safety package. The bill was the first firearm restriction legislation to pass the Alabama House of Representatives since 2010.
Ensler said Friday that his leadership and ability to work across the aisle — a necessity for Democrats in a chamber where Republicans hold 27 of the 35 seats — on the Glock switch ban will carry through to the lieutenant governor position. 
“I approached it knowing that we weren’t going to agree on every way to address gun violence, but that there was common ground through many, many hours of conversations,” Ensler said. 
He announced this summer that he would not seek re-election for House District 74 so he could move back to his home state of New York to be closer to family. He said Friday the decision had not felt right since he made it.
“It has been harder, geographically, physically, to be away from family, because most of my family is there, and that is where I grew up. But Alabama has become a home,” Ensler said. “There had not been any Democrat that announced they were running for this race, and there was just a strong feeling that someone with a good record of service should give it a try.”
Since his summer announcement, Austin Smith and Jasmyne Crimiel, both Democrats, have filed to run for Ensler’s legislative seat. He said he did not want to disrupt that race.
Jones said that Ensler entering the race is a relief to Democrats.
“It’s getting a little bit late for folks to express interest, and I think Phil’s entry into the race is a relief for so many folks,” Jones said. “We have a really strong, experienced candidate out there that can help carry the Democratic ticket and attract votes from all ends of the state.”
The Republican nominee will likely be the favorite to win the race. No Democrat has been elected lieutenant governor since 2006, when former Gov. Jim Folsom Jr. won.   
“I have no illusions about the odds of winning this race. I am undoubtedly the underdog and have enormous challenges to overcome. Yet people are tired of the status quo,” Ensler said in a statement on his website. “They are hurting from politicians focused on everything but the day-to-day issues actually impacting their lives.”
Ensler said that he would not be running against the GOP nominee, but for the people.
“Whoever emerges from that field, my attitude is not that I’m running against someone, but I’m running for something,” he said. “I’m running for access to good public schools, access to good affordable health care, access to better economic opportunities, and ensuring safer neighborhoods.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Phillip-Ensler-April-29-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Getty Images)As the year comes to a close and we look to brighter days ahead, I find myself thinking about wishes. Not the grand kind you’d buy if you had billions of dollars — the quiet type that grows in the chest, that takes the shape of a friendly face or a neighbor’s help that arrives at the exact moment you need it.
My wish for 2026 is simple enough to say, but stubborn, like all good hopes: That we keep choosing each other.
What I see in our community is not people waiting to be rescued. It’s working folks carrying one another through storms that never really made the headlines. The teacher who keeps granola bars in her desk because she knows who will come to school hungry. The retired electrician who snow-blows half the block without being asked. The parent juggling two jobs and still somehow managing to coach their child’s sport. The cashier who remembers your mom’s name.
None of them have billions of dollars. Most don’t even have the cushion they deserve. But they know a secret the rich keep trying to spend their way around:
Joy isn’t a luxury good. It’s a practice. A stubborn, daily rebellion against despair. And it thrives best in community.










May we keep insisting on the good life, not the glossy version on a billboard, but the real one.


And I’ll tell you how I talk about this with our kids. When we talk about wealth, I don’t reach for numbers; I reach for the good stuff. Some days, we are rich in beaded bracelets. Other days, we are rich in pick-up hugs. Many days, we are rich in dad jokes, which makes us equally wealthy in eye rolls. This, I tell them, is real wealth: the kind you can’t deposit, can’t hoard, and can’t lose to the stock market. The kind that grows only when shared. And the sort of stuff that keeps us motivated when it is time to roll up our sleeves and get back into the fight for everyone’s opportunity to earn and thrive. 
So my wish for 2026 is that we square up to that truth with both feet. That we stop pretending any of us has to deny someone else’s humanity to survive. We don’t. We never did. The lie that we must fight over scraps while a handful hoards the rest is wearing thin and people are beginning to see the threads now.
And yes, I also carry a quieter, harder wish. That the people who harm this community through peddling this false narrative, who wield their unprocessed wounds like weapons, find the healing they so desperately need. May they learn to sit with themselves instead of taking their unmet needs out on the public. May they rediscover the center they lost somewhere along the way, the reason they once felt called to public service. Before power became something to hoard, before they forgot that leadership was supposed to be a lantern, not a bludgeon.
Healing doesn’t excuse harm. And none of us is immune to committing it. But without healing, the harm just keeps circling. And we are long past the time for the cycle to break.
My hope, audacious as it sounds, is that class solidarity becomes our neighborhood reflex. That we talk plainly about power: who has it, who doesn’t, and how we reclaim what was always meant to be shared. That taking care of one another stops being framed as idealistic and starts being understood as the oldest survival strategy in the human story.
May we keep insisting on the good life, not the glossy version on a billboard, but the real one:

A life where families have time instead of fear.
Where workers have dignity instead of exhaustion.
Where leaders earn trust instead of demanding loyalty.
Where we measure wealth in safety, in rest, in laughter, in the knowledge that someone down the street would show up for you and you’d show up for them.

This season, I’m holding tight to the belief that we can build that future — not through miracles, but through the small, unglamorous, everyday work of being decent to each other.
We do what we can, where we can, with what we have. And somehow, astonishingly, it adds up.
Here’s to a year of choosing each other. Here’s to a community that remembers its own power. Here’s to the quiet, ordinary wish that might just change everything.

In another building, dozens more — largely from Latin American nations — participated in online court hearings and met with attorneys.
The 550-plus men currently being held on the sprawling campus about 65 miles north of Indianapolis also have access to two chow halls, indoor recreation space and religious services.
“We are making sure we are giving detainees the resources they need,” said Indiana Department of Correction Commissioner Lloyd Arnold.

And he is “absolutely confident that it’s not going to cost state of Indiana’s taxpayers a dime.”
He and Warden Brian English last week gave the Capital Chronicle an hour tour — the first news media inside the facility. No photos were allowed behind the walls.
The state is now in its third month of a two-year contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Indiana officials approved $16 million for facility upgrades in September after the state signed an agreement allowing up to 1,000 immigrants to be held there. The state will receive a daily payment of $291 per detainee — almost four times the $75 daily per-person cost for inmates at the Miami Correctional Facility.
It is a high-medium security prison holding only men.
At that meeting, Democratic legislators expressed concerns about civil rights and access to legal services. Since then, faith groups and nonprofits have gathered for monthly prayer vigils outside the prison along U.S. 31 near Grissom Air Reserve Base.
“We pray for those being detained and also the immigrant community overall,” said Senior Pastor Matt Landry of the Castleton United Methodist Church. “We want to raise concerns for how detainees and families are treated in the system.”
The next event is set for Jan. 26.
Inside the facility
The state received an initial $6 million payment from the federal government but nothing since then. DOC billed for October, but the payment was delayed due to the federal shutdown. November billing goes out soon.
The immigration detainees are kept separate from about 1,800 state prisoners who are held in an identical set of buildings.
As of Wednesday, about 811 detainees have moved through the center with a current census of 558. But it is constantly changing as ICE brings in more men from around the nation and sends others back to their home countries.

Arnold said none of the men have pending criminal cases; otherwise, they would be in county jails awaiting trial. They are there for immigration violations, though he acknowledged some of them served “serious time” in other jurisdictions, at other points in their lives.
Miami is considered a long-term facility by ICE, holding the men for three days or more. The average stay was expected to be about three weeks but is running at about a month now.
English, the prison’s warden, said he declined detainees a few times as operations with ICE were ramping up in October. But now buses come from the Indianapolis International Airport daily. The facility receives about 20 detainees a day and releases about seven a day.
English expects to be fully operational by summer, which largely depends on staffing.
Among the upgrades was the creation of an intake center out of a storage area. Buses pull directly up to the back of the building and the men are processed. That includes health screenings.

While the detainees aren’t allowed access to educational services, there is an area for religious services, like a Catholic Mass in Spanish. Visitors are allowed up to one hour a week.
If detainees are in their cells, they have televisions and computer tablets. The tablets can be used to call family, communicate with attorneys, order from the commissary, listen to controlled music and watch select movies. Prisoners have the same tablets.
The detainee cells open out onto a large area with tables where the men can socialize and play games. They get up to five hours of recreation time per week.
The outdoor basketball court is currently covered in snow, but an indoor court and billiards tables are available.
The recreation building also contains a large, locked area for detainees’ personal property.
English said because the men are being removed from the country, they bring many more belongings than traditional inmates.
He also thinks the detainees have a different outlook than the prisoners set to serve decades behind bars who might feel hopeless about their futures.
Bad reputation
Miami’s prison operations have been criticized for excessive violence and drug trafficking in recent investigations by the Indianapolis Star.
But English could think of only two fights in the immigration detention space.
“Every now and then bunkees get mad at each other,” he said.
Jeff Migliozzi, communications director at Freedom for Immigrants in Washington, D.C., said its hotline has received nearly 70 calls from people inside the Miami Correctional Facility since Dec. 1.
“People detained here are raising urgent issues that are inherent to the immigration detention system, including severe medical neglect, poor food, and physical abuse by guards,” he said.
DOC said it’s equipped to handle such concerns and provided this response to the general allegations:
“Transition into any facility can be stressful for detainees, and we expect concerns will be raised as a natural part of that process,” Arnold said. “The department has established grievance and reporting processes to ensure those concerns can be communicated and reviewed in accordance with policy. We remain committed to maintaining safe, secure, and humane conditions for all individuals housed at the facility.”
Migliozzi wasn’t surprised by the long average stay, noting President Donald Trump’s administration “is shifting many of ICE’s policies in an effort to hold more people indefinitely.”
“It’s important to note that while conditions are worsening amid a record number of people in ICE custody, these systemic issues inside detention have long predated this administration,” he said. “Immigration detention undermines our shared values of justice, freedom, and human dignity, which is why we must end this cruel practice.”
Staffing issues continue
Landry, the pastor, said one thing the faith coalition always prays for — in addition to the detainees and family members caught in the immigration quagmire — is the overburdened staff at Miami.

One of the reasons the state had 1,000 open beds to offer up is that it couldn’t find enough prison guards and other staff members to operate the entire facility. The ICE contract boosts correctional officer pay from $24 to $28 an hour. DOC anticipated needing temporary staffing quarters on site, but it hasn’t been necessary yet. English said hiring has picked up — with 31 new officers currently approved and in the training process.
It takes about 150 staff members to run the detainee side every day.
The initial $16 million earmarked for upgrades, also went to more video equipment. The detainee side is averaging about 15 attorney appointments per day, and 30-plus court hearings.
English said most of the men have been in the country long enough to communicate in English but interpreters are available if needed.
“It has gone as well as we could expect,” he said.

(Courtesy of Washington State Patrol)Washington state troopers stop and search drivers of color more often than white Washingtonians, new data shows. 
Washington State Patrol’s total traffic stops statewide dropped slightly in 2024, but remained well ahead of 2022 figures. Infractions issued climbed significantly in that period. The findings come as police accountability advocates have pressed state lawmakers unsuccessfully for new restrictions on when police in Washington can pull drivers over.
“Traffic stops really remain one of the most common forms of police-civilian contact, and it’s also one of the riskiest,” said Jazmyn Clark, the Smart Justice policy program director at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington chapter. “For many people of color, a traffic stop is often the most dangerous moment of police interaction.”
Black and Hispanic drivers were much more likely to be stopped last year than white drivers, according to state patrol data presented to lawmakers this month, with the rate of stops for Black drivers nearly double the rate for white motorists. 
Black drivers were pulled over 154.6 times per 1,000; Hispanic drivers 102.8 per 1,000; and white drivers 82.5 per 1,000, according to the data. Two years ago, those numbers were 146.7, 89.3 and 73.2, respectively. 
Vancouver police killed Nickeia Hunter’s brother, Carlos, during a traffic stop in 2019. Hunter, an advocate from the Coalition for Police Accountability, called the state patrol data “beyond troublesome.”
Speaking to the Joint Transportation Committee this month, state patrol Capt. Deion Glover told lawmakers that the agency “remains committed to fair, unbiased and professional policing statewide. That’s our goal.”
Analyzing traffic stop data from 2015 to 2019, a Washington State University study in 2021 found “no evidence of systemic bias in the decision to stop” drivers. 
Disparities with searches, too
Disparities carry over to searches, as well. While Native Americans are less likely to be stopped, they are much more likely to be searched by troopers. 
Native Americans were four times more likely than whites to be subjected to a high-discretion search in 2024. These searches refer to when troopers use their judgment to search a person or their car while remaining within constitutional bounds. They’re rare. Last year, there were only 320 statewide, but that’s up from 246 two years prior. About half of them over the past three years turned up contraband, Glover said.
“We really have to have some reasonable suspicion or high level of thought that this person is involved in some type of criminal activity,” Glover said.
Black and Hispanic drivers were also more likely to be searched than their white counterparts, but not to the same degree as Native Americans. 
The use of low-discretion searches, used in the case of arrest warrants, vehicle impounds and arrests, also indicated disparities. Black drivers were nearly four times as likely as white drivers last year to face these types of searches, which are also on the rise, with more than 9,000 in 2024.
Push for new restrictions falters
This racial data isn’t perfect, as troopers track the demographics of people they pull over based on their own perception, Glover noted. He said the agency recognizes it has work to do. 
“Those are definitely some numbers that we need to work on and dig into and learn why are these disparities happening,” Glover said.
For years, police accountability advocates have pushed legislation to limit when police can stop motorists. Under the proposed Traffic Safety for All Act, law enforcement in Washington would have been barred from stopping drivers solely for nonmoving violations, like expired tabs or a broken headlight, that advocates say disproportionately affect people of color. 
Clark, with the ACLU, said “there is likely no other reform that would be more effective” at reducing racial disparities in traffic stops.
“The biggest driver of disparities is what officers are legally allowed to stop for, and when the law allows for broad discretion, bias is going to show up,” Clark said.
But the measure hasn’t made progress in the Legislature. Police officials have opposed the idea amid a dramatic increase in traffic deaths on Washington’s roads. And supporters say they are setting the idea aside for 2026. 
Training and other efforts
In the wake of mass racial justice protests in 2020, state lawmakers passed a suite of police accountability measures. 
More recently, they’ve shied away from the issue, especially after their move to restrict when police can pursue drivers drew such staunch pushback they had to roll the law back. 
Glover noted cadets and troopers are required to take ethics and bias training. The state patrol has also recently done a four-hour “tribal liaison training” on working with tribal governments. 
“This training supports better decision making by our troopers and helps reduce disparities amongst traffic stops and other issues as they’re out there working,” Glover told lawmakers.

The agency also has outreach programs to strengthen relationships with the state’s Latino and Indigenous communities.
In 2021, consultants found the state patrol had failed to diversify its ranks, with one key reason being that the department’s psychologist was failing more job candidates of color than white applicants. Glover said “95%” of the recommendations from that report have been implemented.

This scenario has played out several times, but during this late-night phone call, the person on the other end urgently asked her to translate.
“They’re at the hospital, and you can hear that they’re scared,” said Chavez, the founder and CEO of Columbus-based nonprofit Saving Grace Mission, remembering one of several such calls she has received. “They’re intimidated, and you can hear the frustration from the doctors on the other end.”
Hospitals, once protected against immigration enforcement, have increasingly become sites of anxiety and fear after President Donald Trump rescinded a long-standing policy in January that allowed immigrants access to health care providers, along with schools and churches, without fear of apprehension. Combined with heightened federal immigration enforcement in recent months, the change has left many immigrant families afraid to visit hospitals or attend routine medical appointments, health professionals and advocates told Mississippi Today. Some are skipping care altogether.
These new challenges are layered atop the barriers that immigrants already face accessing health care, such as language divides and limited access to public health insurance. More recently, experts say, federal funding cuts and changes to immigration policy have further reduced resources available to immigrant communities. 
Maria, a Biloxi resident who immigrated from Honduras and asked that her last name not be published, told Mississippi Today she and her two children have missed routine doctor’s appointments because they are “terrified” to leave the house amid an increased presence of federal immigration officers. Her husband, who has authorization to work in the U.S., was detained for two months earlier this year. 
Both of her children are U.S. citizens. 
“We haven’t taken them for their vaccinations,” she said in Spanish. “No, they haven’t had their annual checkups and things like that,” she said.  
Michael Oropeza, the director of El Pueblo, a nonprofit serving low-income immigrant communities, said the organization has witnessed families delay care, cancel children’s check-ups and go without refilling medication because they worry they could be detained by immigration officials.

“It’s not because they don’t value their health, it’s because they don’t feel safe,” Oropeza said. “When hospitals and clinics are no longer that safe place, people withdraw trust that took years to build up. It can disappear overnight.” 
Immigration officers descended on New Orleans Dec. 3 as a part of the latest federal immigration crackdown, dubbed “Catahoula Crunch.” Early reports showed the campaign aimed to arrest roughly 5,000 people in Louisiana and southeastern Mississippi. Though arrests in Mississippi have been more sporadic than in nearby Louisiana, fear has swiftly rippled through immigrant communities in the state.
Some health care providers said they have seen a sudden drop-off in immigrant patients seeking care.
The Good Samaritan Medical Clinic in Columbus provides free primary health care services to residents of the Lowndes County area. The health center saw an influx in patients from immigrant communities in the beginning of the year, said Board Chairman Dr. William Rosenblatt.
Most of the new patients the clinic was seeing were seeking “non-trivial” medical care, such as very high blood pressure and blood sugar levels, Rosenblatt said. The clinic was building trust with the patients.
“We were able to really, I felt like, do some good,” he said. “And then, radio silence.” 
By the summer, visits from immigrant communities tapered off, he said, falling to zero in the past three to four months.
The chronic diseases the clinic was previously treating may not have immediate consequences, but will if they are left untreated, he said. 
“With a lot of these uncontrolled chronic diseases that we were seeing and the magnitude of how uncontrolled they were, it’s just sad to think about,” he said.

When people delay routine care, it can put stress on emergency rooms, which are required by federal law to treat all patients, regardless of their immigration status or ability to pay. 
“When these folks do end up with these awful end stages of the disease — they have a massive stroke, they have a massive heart attack — they’re coming to our ER, right?,” he said. “They’re going to get emergency care. And what an additional strain that is on the healthcare system when we could have intervened with some prevention.”
Verba Moore, the clinic manager for Bethel Clinic, a free walk-in clinic in Biloxi, said staff members have observed fewer Hispanic and Vietnamese patients at the health center than usual over the course of the last four to six months. 
Since President Trump took office in January, the number of immigrant adults who reported skipping or postponing health care has increased, according to a recent survey from KFF and The New York Times. Four in 10 immigrant adults – and nearly twice as many likely undocumented immigrants — say immigration-related worries have spurred negative health impacts, including anxiety, difficulty sleeping or eating, and worsening health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure. 
Among those who said they went without care, about 1 in 5 cited immigration-related concerns as reasons for delaying care. Even more — 63% — cited cost or lack of coverage.
Affordability and health insurance coverage are some of the most significant barriers to accessing health care immigrants face, said Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for public health insurance programs, like Medicaid and Medicare, and some immigrants who are lawfully present in the U.S. are not eligible for the programs.

Fewer lawfully present immigrants will be eligible for Medicaid or Affordable Care Act Marketplace financial assistance as a result of changes made in the federal budget reconciliation law signed by President Donald Trump in July. These changes, which will begin in 2026, will impact refugees, people granted political asylum and victims of domestic violence and trafficking. 
Cuello said some people who are eligible for public benefits may choose to disenroll in health insurance for fear of information being shared with immigration officials. The Trump administration provided deportation officials with personal and health data, including immigration statuses, of millions of Medicaid enrollees earlier this year despite concerns about privacy violations. In August, a federal court in California temporarily blocked the data sharing in 20 states that filed suit over the data sharing. 
In November, the Trump administration took steps to reverse a policy that prevented federal officials from considering a person’s use of certain public benefits, like Medicaid, when determining whether they might become a “public charge,” or person reliant on government assistance. Federal officials are allowed to deny entry to people they determine are likely to become a public charge. 
Research shows that some immigrant families disenrolled themselves and their children from benefits they were eligible for after the first Trump administration in 2019 broadened the scope of programs the federal government would consider in public charge determinations to include previously excluded health, nutrition and housing programs.
The change impacted many children and U.S. citizens, Cuello said. About 1 in 4 children in the U.S. have at least one immigrant parent, and many rely on Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program benefits. 
“When mom or dad is afraid to enroll in health coverage or enroll for food benefits, you are impacting a lot of people who are U.S. citizens and kids,” said Cuello.

Maria’s children, who are U.S. citizens, previously qualified for Medicaid, but she disenrolled them three years ago out of concern that using public benefits would jeopardize her family’s residency applications, she said. The family now pays for their children’s care out-of-pocket. 
Cuello noted that the effects of these federal policy changes extend far beyond those who are targeted. 
“The chilling effect associated with it is gargantuan,” he said. 
Federal funding cuts have also impacted immigrant communities’ access health care in Mississippi. 
El Pueblo, which has locations in Biloxi and Forrest, previously operated a community health worker program in Columbus. The program helped transport people to doctor’s appointments, complete forms and find affordable health care. 
But their contract with the Mississippi State Department of Health was terminated in March 2025 as a result of cancellations of hundreds of millions of dollars in grant funding allocated for COVID-19 pandemic relief and used for a number of other public health initiatives. The nonprofit closed its Columbus office as a result. 
“That was basically loss of access to health care for the immigrant community,” Chavez said. “And that was the first time that we ever had access to health care for the immigrant community here.”
Rosenblatt said for him, it is a loss to be unable to serve those communities in the Columbus area. 
“They’re literally building our community,” he said. “And we’re no longer able to give them the support they need, and yeah, it breaks my heart a little bit.”

Mississippi Today reported in June that the University of Mississippi Medical Center’s electronic health record system included a field for “citizenship.” The medical center declined to comment on whether the hospital system asks for this information when patients are admitted, or whether the hospital has a policy about how to respond to federal immigration enforcement at the hospital. Mississippi does not require hospitals to collect citizenship information from patients.
Alicia Carpenter, a spokesperson for Merit Health, said this month the hospital system works to serve the medical needs of its patients while complying with the law. 
“If an ICE agent arrives intending to apprehend a patient or another person suspected of being undocumented, we will treat the agent in the same manner as we would any other law enforcement agency,” Carpenter said. “Our staff will not resist or interfere with efforts by law enforcement agencies to apprehend or question the individual.”
Baptist Memorial Hospitals also work to balance commitments to patient privacy and compliance with state and federal law, said spokesperson Kimberly Alexander in an email. 
Singing River Health System spokesperson Samantha Fletcher declined to answer questions about its policies regarding immigration enforcement. 
Once it feels safe to attend doctor’s appointments again, Maria said her top priority will be seeking mental health care to address the stress her family has endured. Her children cope with worry daily about what could happen to the family amid increased federal immigration enforcement, even though the parents hold visas and their children are citizens. 
“They come and ask us, ‘What’s going to happen?’” she said. “Because we also have two dogs, ‘What’s going to happen to the dogs?’ They don’t want to leave them because they adore their dogs.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/19142513/3X0A6831.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Jayme Anderson wore so many medals to his Forest Hill High School graduation that his mom, Angella, could hear him clanking as he walked across stage. At home in south Jackson, 18-year-old Anderson displayed a coffee table’s worth of awards: trophies, badges, plaques, rainbow-colored cords and a binder full of college acceptances. Anderson applied to more than 600 colleges and was admitted to 582, racking up more than $10 million in scholarship offers. He chose Pennsylvania State University. Anderson said he was driven by curiosity, free time, a desire to go out-of-state for higher education and a competitive streak. He also wanted to inspire other Jackson Public Schools students, who he said are often misunderstood and stereotyped, even by fellow Jacksonians. – By Mississippi Today Jackson Reporter Molly Minta

Stephen Brown is a hip-hop artist, producer and DJ – and the head of Briarwood Arts Center in Jackson. On any given night, the rooms of Briarwood Arts Center are filled with artists, creatives and dancers who have come to build community and hone their crafts. Before Brown moved into the neighborhood, the building had been abandoned – but he had a goal to recreate the local arts scene after several popular hangouts had closed, so he decided to lease the space. The center now offers events like line dancing classes, Kuumba (Swahili for creativity) Youth Night, GoodEDvice ACT Prep Club and Crochet Circle, and most of the events are free. His hope is that his persistence and dedication to creating safe spaces inspires others in Jackson to imagine what’s possible for their neighborhoods. – By former Mississippi Today Jackson Reporter Maya Miller

State Rep. Becky Currie of Brookhaven is a conservative Republican who has become an outspoken critic of health care services in Mississippi’s prison system and of VitalCore Health Strategies, LLC, the private company with a contract to provide those services. Currie, who is a registered nurse, began touring state prisons after becoming chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee in early 2024, and she found a disturbing dearth of medical care for inmates. “We’re paying $124 million to a company for health care and they are not doing it and they are keeping the money,” said Currie, who is pushing for reform and has been a centerpiece of Mississippi Today’s investigative series on prison health care, Behind Bars, Beyond Care. Currie said Dr. Raman Singh, VitalCore’s chief medical officer, told her and State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney in a private meeting that about 5,000 Mississippi Department of Corrections prisoners and some prison workers had contracted hepatitis C. Interviews and documents obtained by Mississippi Today show that only a fraction of Mississippi inmates diagnosed with hepatitis C receive treatment, which has allowed the treatable infection to develop into a life-threatening illness. – By Mississippi Today Political Reporters Michael Goldberg and Health Reporter Gwen Dilworth

Community activist Derrick Evans is working to protect his historic Turkey Creek neighborhood in Gulfport from the damage of climate change. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Global Change Research Program published reports in recent years that link social disparities in the Southeast to a higher risk of impacts from natural disasters. Evans’ ancestors were among the freed slaves who founded  Turkey Creek after the Civil War. The area in north Gulfport now sits in the fifth most vulnerable census tract out of over 73,000 in the United States. Evans sees Mississippi as a state where people love hunting and fishing but political priorities seem detached from that very culture. “A polluted stream, an environmental vulnerability, is actually an abrogation to what we might call the Southern way of life,” he said. – By Mississippi Today Environment and Data Reporter Alex Rozier

A local bike shop owner and the father of a son who died of an overdose, Moore has long worked to stop overdoses across the Pine Belt region. But in 2025, his advocacy was elevated to a new level. He was a recurring voice in Mississippi Today’s reporting that highlighted how Mississippi was spending its opioid settlement money – including that local governments and the state had spent less than 1% of the money thus far on addressing the addiction crisis – and as a member of a state committee tasked with advising the Legislature on how to spend the remaining hundreds of millions of dollars moving forward. – By Mississippi Today Mental Health Reporter Allen Siegler.

Cain hired Nowlin after she had served time in prison herself and made her his government affairs coordinator. The pair developed such a close bond that she came to view him like a grandfather. But now, she is speaking out about what she said is widespread medical neglect and mismanagement inside the agency and its facilities. Nowlin was a key source in an early  story in the Behind Bars, Beyond Care series revealing that in private, officials lamented the quality of medical services provided by Mississippi’s private medical contractor even as the company raked in hundreds of millions in public dollars.

Jason Reid, a physical education teacher in DeSoto County School District, has been teaching for 17 years. But in 2019, he also started moonlighting as a bus driver to earn extra money. Like Reid, many teachers in Mississippi often work multiple jobs – the state has the lowest teacher pay in the nation. And like many other educators, Reid said the worst part is the rising health insurance premiums – especially as a two-time cancer survivor. During his second round of treatment in 2022, his deductible was $13,000. He met the deductible early on, but still spent a huge chunk of money, he said. And as a teacher, there’s not an option to take paid medical leave. “We go on vacation … we’re not living paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “But we can’t live the lifestyle a lot of neighbors would live.” – By Mississippi Today Education Reporter Devna Bose.

The New York Times and other news outlets reported on the letter Nina Rifkind and her sister sent to the law firm her grandfather founded criticizing Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison for yielding to the wishes of the president. Trump had threatened various penalties against the firm because one of its former partners had worked in the Manhattan District Attorney’s office that investigated Trump. The firm agreed to various conditions to avoid those penalties. She wrote that her late grandfather would not have settled a dispute where an attorney was simply doing his job.”He would have above all sought to protect the independence of the bar, not just the firm,” she and her sister, Washington, D.C., attorney Amy Rifkind, wrote in the letter.

After her 22-year-old son was killed in her front yard in 2014, Lucinda Wade-Robinson wasn’t sure she would be able to cover the $8,000 funeral bill. She applied in Hinds County for help from Mississippi’s victim compensation program, a fund that each state has to reimburse victims of crime and their families for funeral expenses, medical costs, crime scene cleanup, execution travel and counseling, among other costs. But the state attorney general’s office, which administers the program, denied her claim, alleging her son was responsible for his death, a type of denial known as contributory misconduct. Mississippi’s definition of what kind of conduct contributes to one’s death is broader than most states, and a Mississippi Today investigation found that Wade-Robinson’s denial is not unusual. Mississippi has one of the highest rates of denials attributed to “contributory misconduct” when compared to other states, with about 6% of all applicants getting denied for this reason. – By Mississippi Today Education Reporter Leo Bevilacqua

(Photo courtesy of Department of Defense)On June 16th of this year, the University of Minnesota was planning a public launch party for the “National Security Research Institute” at the state Capitol. As a curious PhD candidate at the U, I weathered the traffic and construction on I-94 to make it to the event. Upon my arrival, I found an empty ballroom. The U had cancelled the event three days prior. There was no announcement of this cancellation — the website had simply gone down around June 13th. It was as if the whole thing was never meant to be seen.
This secrecy was, in fact, the point. In emails obtained by the Minnesota Daily through public records, the dean of the College of Science and Engineering, Andrew Alleyne, protested the overt naming of “security” related projects. He argued for more generic titles to avoid making the U “a target for activists, for curious people, etc.”
“It’s much better to be generic… ‘nothing to see here, move along,’” he wrote. 
When someone tells curious people to move along, it only makes them more curious. And upon closer inspection, I found a disturbing reality: the U is quietly becoming a contractor for a new arms race. These developments are in direct contradiction to everything a public university is supposed to stand for: openness, education and service to the public good. Instead, what is unfolding behind closed doors seems to serve the interests of defense contractors, not the people of Minnesota.
The University’s mission is “to generate and preserve knowledge… that benefits… communities across the state, the nation, and the world.” In reality, they plan to develop hypersonic missiles, using processes that will sap massive amounts of energy from the local community to create weapons that threaten civilians globally.
Its mission is to prepare students “for active roles in a multiracial and multicultural world.” In reality, it plans to prepare students for a new Cold War, with the goal of continued U.S. military supremacy.
Its mission is to “exchange knowledge between the University and society.” In reality, it plans to use publicly-funded academic labor to generate private knowledge for private weapons developers.
Since the early 2000’s, there has been an arms race ramping up in the area of hypersonics. Hypersonic missiles travel and maneuver at very high speeds close to the earth, and thus are very difficult to detect or counter. Despite having the biggest military budget in the world, the U.S. is seeking to expand its production of hypersonic missiles. Now, the resources of Minnesota’s public universities are being tapped to achieve these aims.
The local mechanism for this is the “Minnesota National Security Ecosystem,” a trade association that acts as an institutional link between the government, weapons contractors and university administrators. For a membership fee, companies gain access to a network of politicians and university officials. The board includes the U’s own vice president for research, alongside administrators from other universities as well as CEOs and former political staffers.
These developments offer a glimpse into the insidious privatization of public resources at our universities. Public funds and public intellect are being diverted from solving social problems like climate change, disease and inequality to serve the profit-driven needs of the military-industrial complex. 
While some argue that a new weapons development institute will produce jobs, the CEO of North Wind, the main contractor involved in the National Security Research Institute, acknowledged that the new $1 billion facility that they are building on former U land, aka, The MN Aerospace Complex, will produce just 40 long-term jobs. Furthermore, the claims that hypersonic technology has civilian or commercial uses are dubious at best. In the same email exchange in which Alleyne argued for more generic naming, he also acknowledged that “Unfortunately, there really is no dual use for hypersonics.”  
During a time when the public is rightly outraged that universities have been kowtowing to the Trump administration, U administrators know that the community doesn’t want this investment in missile development. This is why they have skirted democratic processes and conducted their business in secrecy. During the inception of the institute, emails show that administrators sought to obfuscate its function. When the Board of Regents sold 60 acres (and gave the right of first refusal of 100 more acres) to North Wind in May, they made an exception to their bylaws to exclude any public process. When curious community members started taking an interest in the National Security Research Institute, they cancelled the launch party without warning.  
The University of Minnesota belongs to the people of this state. Its purpose is to educate, to innovate for the common good, and to serve the public, not to be a corporate partner in war. We must demand transparency and a return to its true mission.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/240628-D-D0439-101-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Rural communities have fewer than one-fifth as many OB-GYNs per capita, and hospital care is more than twice as far away as in urban and suburban Missouri. Over the last decade, 12 rural hospitals have closed and more than half of those still operating are losing money.
To address these challenges, the Missouri Department of Social Services hopes to use a piece of a $50 billion federal program to empower rural communities to set their own health care priorities and overhaul the state’s Medicaid payment system.

Part of the One Big Beautiful Bill passed by Congress this summer, U.S. lawmakers touted the Rural Health Transformation Program as a counterweight to the law’s deep cuts to Medicaid and as a boon to struggling rural hospitals. 
Local and national experts praised the federal investment in long-term solutions for rural health care access and affordability. But they warned the funds will not make up for the revenue rural providers will lose as more patients become uninsured thanks to the federal law.
It’s unclear what Missouri’s share of the federal funding will be, though the Missouri Hospital Association estimated the state could receive between $1 billion to $1.25 billion. The U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services is expected to announce state award amounts by Dec. 31. 
“This money in any other time is super transformative,” said Heidi Lucas, executive director of the Missouri Rural Health Association. “This is the type of money that we…in rural health have been asking for for decades.”
But Lucas said that “most likely, none of this is going to help keep hospitals from closing or rural health clinics from shutting their doors.”
That’s because the federal law will narrow Medicaid eligibility by adding work requirements and twice-yearly eligibility recertifications beginning in 2027. By one estimate from Princeton University, 130,000 of the 1.25 million Missourians currently on Medicaid could lose coverage over the next decade. The expiration on Dec. 31 of enhanced premium subsidies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead more Missourians to go without insurance.
“Life happens,” Lucas said. “You could be in a car accident. You could fall down the stairs…. You’re still going to go to the hospital, and they’re still going to be required to give you care whether you can pay or not.”
Jess Bax, director of the state social services department, said Missouri’s plan can help sustain existing rural health facilities while expanding access and investing in long-term changes to how the state compensates health care providers.
“When you look at Missouri’s rural health plan, it is really focusing on all the aspects that affect that,” Bax told The Independent. “How do we get access today? How do we have the workforce for that access? What technology could we utilize to expand that access? And then, how do we build a payment model to make sure that access stays in place?”
But experts and health care professionals said the federal funding wasn’t designed to offset providers’ anticipated losses from increases in uncompensated care.
Toniann Richard, CEO of HCC Network, a group of Missouri clinics that uses federal grants to fund care for people with high deductibles or no insurance, said that when the federal program was first announced, she hoped the funding could be used to cover those losses.
But states can only spend 15% of their awards each year on provider payments, and only for services that can’t already be compensated.
“It became clear really early that that wasn’t the intent of it,” Richard said. “It was to improve the system so that over time, the unit cost of health care in rural communities would be driven down.”
Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer of the National Rural Health Association, said providers across the country are feeling the tension between federal investment in rural health care innovation and policies that will cause massive reductions in the payments that allow them to operate.
“We want to be able to invest in our future and enhance quality of life in rural areas,” Cochran-McClain said. “But we still need adequate reimbursement day to day to be able to make ends meet in our facilities and provide the services we need to our populations.”

With its plan, Missouri wants to expand a pilot program that sought to center local medical providers and community organizations in identifying health care priorities — and transform how the state compensates providers to support those goals.
“The primary goal of Missouri’s plan is to revamp the Medicaid payment system to guarantee the effective use of taxpayer dollars,” said Baylee Watts, spokesperson for the social services department, in an email to The Independent.
The pilot, ToRCH, or Transformation of Rural Community Health, was launched in 2022 and put rural hospitals in six counties in charge of “hubs” to coordinate care among medical providers and community organizations. The state obtained a waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services allowing reimbursement for services that Medicaid doesn’t usually cover but that enable people to be healthy, such as housing modifications or pest removal.
Lori Wightman, CEO of Bothwell Regional Health Center in Sedalia, which is one of the six hubs, said the pilot has helped keep people out of the emergency room.
Wightman gave the example of a man who was in the emergency room 40 to 50 times in one year due to flare-ups of his chronic illness. The heating and air conditioning in his home were broken, leading him to rely on electric heaters and window units. His electric bills had gotten so expensive, Wightman said, that he couldn’t afford his medications, which caused the flare-ups.
Using the pilot program, Wightman said, the hospital bought him a new HVAC unit through Medicaid.
“It’s now been six months, and he hasn’t needed to be back in the emergency department at all,” Wightman said.

The state’s application for federal funding proposes to establish 30 community hubs across 104 counties, with staff at the regional and state levels to coordinate partnerships and track outcomes. Each hub would include medical providers and community organizations offering services that keep people healthy, like food assistance or transportation.
Communities would be able to identify local needs such as medical transportation, Bax said, and request funding.
“They can say, ‘That’s a gap for us, and we think we could have an impact on health outcomes if we’re able to provide this,” Bax said.
Lucas said this plan “has a lot of upside.”
“If you’re offering wraparound services, figuring out how they can get nutritious food into their homes, how they get transportation to their appointments, that’s going to raise health outcomes,” Lucas said.
Alternative payment models, which pay providers based on the quality rather than the volume of services, would ensure the sustainability of these measures under Missouri’s plan.
Richard said alternative payment models have been part of conversations about how to sustain struggling rural hospitals and clinics for at least a decade. But getting payors and providers to agree on a model is complicated.
Keith Mueller, director of the Rural Policy Research Institute, said the infusion of federal funding could help.
“The excitement about the transformation fund is, ‘We have five years now with some support to really get this thing out there,” Mueller said.
Cochran-McClain said the federal program is “a once-in-a-lifetime, Blue Moon…opportunity to get at some of the longstanding challenges we’ve had in terms of underfunding in rural areas.”
Alternative payment models, Cochran-McClain said, could help “level the playing field” for rural providers who have high fixed costs like their urban counterparts but see fewer patients. Patients in rural areas are also more likely to rely on Medicaid or Medicare.
Bax said the state would seek to incentivize effective care, rather than a larger quantity of more expensive services, with the new payment models.
She gave the example of home-delivered, medically tailored meals to allow someone to be discharged earlier from the hospital. 
“They’re keeping people healthier, allowing them to be successful staying at home with just some hot meals delivered,” Bax said.
Richard said she thinks the federal funding will give Missouri “an opportunity to be innovative around what [alternative payment models] might look like.”
 Cautious optimism

But Richard and others said it’s unclear when rural providers will begin to feel relief from the long-term investments the federal funding was designed to support.
Bax said the “biggest piece of the funding” the state requested is for “provider transformation,” which includes renovations of existing facilities and investments in technology to help providers share medical records and referrals.
But other parts of the application, like alternative payment models, will take time to show results.
“We’re not going to see that return on investment in five years,” Richard said, “but if we continue to work beyond the fund, in theory it will drive down that unit cost.”

Wightman said she hopes some federal funding will be available to help Bothwell address pressing infrastructural needs. The roof leaks, she said, so the hospital has to shut down the operating room when there’s heavy rain.
Wightman said the hospital’s collaboration with the state’s social services department during the pilot has been successful. The only thing she worries about in the state’s application is the allocation of 100 full-time equivalent positions to work in state, regional and local offices.
“Only the people on the ground can identify partners and coordinate, not hub program coordinators,” Wightman said. “That’s not a roof over my operating room.”
Mueller said “the trick” will be for states to sustain key rural health providers during federal and state changes.
“Can you move those things fast enough that you’ve got the changes in delivery and in new payment methodology that make it possible to operate even with the cuts in Medicaid revenue?”
Despite the challenges, Lucas said she is “cautiously optimistic” about what the state can achieve with the funding.
“The health care system is broken,” Lucas said. “We all know that. So if we’re better able to support our communities, we are grateful for this money to be able to do that, because that’s never been a possibility like this.”

Why is healthcare so expensive in Vermont? BlueCross BlueShield says it’s, in part, the sheer cost of services from the biggest hospitals.

In a new public awareness campaign, BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont has joined four independent Chittenden County healthcare facilities in urging clients to seek less expensive care outside of Vermont’s large academic medical centers.
The newly launched website, VT Affordable Care, offers a simple cost comparison for common medical procedures in different settings across Vermont. An MRI, for instance, costs the insurer $6,520 at UVM Medical Center in Burlington, while Northwestern Medical Center in St. Albans charges $2,785. At an independent facility that same service would be $1,799. A laboratory test at UVM costs almost $100 more than it would from an independent facility, where a test could be just $18. 
By highlighting wide price gaps between hospital systems and independent providers, BlueCross BlueShield is urging Vermonters to see how the underlying cost of care shapes what they ultimately pay in premiums and frames patient choice as a key lever in keeping costs low.

“It should start people asking the question, ‘why?’ And when you start asking yourself the question of why, then you can start asking yourself other questions about, well, what can we do about it, and who is responsible? And is there a role I can play?” said Teresa Anderson, the insurer’s director of brand and engagement strategies.
The effort is part of a larger push by the insurer to bring more attention to what it sees as the roots of the state’s healthcare affordability challenge. The insurer has faced solvency risks as the cost of claims has soared beyond the revenue it brings in through premiums. In 2024, the insurer paid out an average $35 million a week in claims; it left them $62.1 million in the red that year. 
Vermonters spend a higher percentage of income on health insurance than any residents of any other state, according to a report published this summer. Vermont residents spent 19.6% of their income on insurance premiums in 2025; in New Hampshire that number is the lowest in the country, at 4%. The national average is 7.9% of income.
BlueCross wants people to better understand the cost of these premiums — and it is asking for Vermonters help in keeping them down.
“I think it’s important for people to understand that we’re all part of a pool, and the more responsibly we use resources ourselves, the better off the pool is,” said Andrew Garland, BlueCross BlueShield’s vice president of external affairs.
Often, this true cost of care becomes obscured in this pool, explained Alex Garlick, a professor of policy at the University of Vermont.
“Because insurance ends up picking up the bulk of the tab, consumers don’t really feel that cost, at least at the point of sale. It’s only later, in an aggregate sense, when premiums are going up and costs are going up, that patients feel this,” he said. 
Garlick sees this effort as the insurer’s way to better communicate what’s behind such high premiums, the point where people do ultimately face the costs of healthcare. 
“This is an effort to distance themselves from some accountability and saying, ‘you know, this is not a result of our profit margin,” Garlick said. 
The fact that the company has been facing such financial precarity adds some credibility to the fact that they are probably not the primary driver of this trend, he added.
The insurer instead points to the sheer cost of services as a driver of why healthcare does become so expensive here.
For Garland, a recent example hit close to home. While working on this project, he encountered a health challenge and needed to schedule an MRI. 
“I already met my deductible, so there’s no financial incentive for me to go to one place or another,” he said. 
Nevertheless, he said he made an appointment at an independent facility, which was able to see him a week later. 
“I saved my employer plan $3-4,000. That money, not being spent on this MRI, is now available for some other care. Every dollar we spend is going to end up impacting the rates next year,” he said.
But, at the same time, it’s not something he’d advise everyone to do. 
“It’s not right for everyone to get in the car and drive across the state,” he said. “I don’t want to discourage anybody from getting the care they need where they need to get it.”
UVM Heath has taken notice but is keeping its head down.
“We can’t really comment on BCBSVT’s marketing and advertising practices,” UVM Health spokesperson Annie Mackin wrote in an emailed statement. “We do support patients going to the lowest-cost setting that meets their care needs. And we believe that hospitals and insurance companies have the responsibility to work together to bring costs down for patients.” 
The state’s largest hospital and the state’s largest insurer have long had a “simmering and ongoing adversarial relationship,” as the state-appointed independent healthcare liaison Mike Smith put it in an August letter to the Green Mountain Care Board and the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation, which regulate hospitals and insurers, respectively.
Smith sat in on discussions between the two healthcare entities, during which they were meant to come to an agreement on lower commercial health insurance rates. 
In that letter, Smith describes that BlueCross BlueShield has been reluctant to push back on the hospital network and negotiate lower prices out of fear that the hospital will refuse to see BlueCross BlueShield patients. 
“Not providing care to BCBS-VT patients would be a disastrous situation for the insurance company, and it would be an equally disastrous situation for the (UVM Health network),” Smith wrote. 
The hospital network, for its part, denied the allegation that it threatened to drop BlueCross  patients. 
Part of the reason UVM Medical Center can have such leverage, explained Garlick, the UVM professor, is that it has a near monopoly on healthcare in the Burlington area. The three Vermont hospitals in the UVM Health network take in almost two-thirds of the total Vermonters spend at the state’s 14 hospitals, according to data from the Green Mountain Care Board. Dartmouth Hitchcock has its own relative monopoly for its service area, he added.
“It’s kind of shocking to see the major academic medical centers charging multiples of what smaller facilities are charging, but in many cases, the major hospitals charge what the market will bear,” he said. “There are very few restraints on them charging such high prices, because the patients are going to come either way.”
On the other side of the state, Dartmouth Health had yet to even learn of BlueCross BlueShield’s campaign.
“We were not aware of this campaign and have not spoken with VT BCBS specifically about it,” the hospital network’s spokesperson Audra Burns wrote in an email to VTDigger. She reaffirmed the network’s commitment to keeping costs low, while maintaining high quality care. Many of the hospital’s rates reflect the range of more complicated care it provides, some of which are reimbursed below their cost, according to Burns. 
She added that she and her colleagues did find the ad to be “ambiguous” regarding what types of independent facilities the insurer refers to that could even provide vaginal deliveries. Just this year, Vermont made it legal to build free-standing birthing centers, and an effort to erect the first is in the early stages of fundraising. 
It’s unlikely, Garlick thinks, that UVM Health or Dartmouth Health will bring their costs down. 
“So, how do you get out of this economic situation?” he asked. One pathway, he says, is through increasing competition and spreading some reliance onto other providers — exactly what BlueCross BlueShield is now pushing its beneficiaries to consider. 
Still, the insurer insists that truly pulling costs down will be a collective effort. 
“This is a problem that has been building for many, many years, and it’s not going to get fixed overnight,” Anderson said, citing needed action from within the health system, legislators and consumers. “It’s going to take all of those groups coming together to actually make a shift in what’s going on here in Vermont.”

Even setting aside the broader tumult of Trump 2.0, life inside the Missouri Capitol has been especially unforgiving for Democrats.
After years of infighting, Senate Republicans finally learned how to work together this year. Early in the 2025 legislative session, that newfound discipline broke through longstanding gridlock and cleared the way for a slate of high-profile bills to move swiftly through the chamber.
Democrats, who hold just 10 of the Senate’s 34 seats, admit they were caught flat-footed early on, reacting too slowly to the cohesion of the GOP supermajority and squandering what little leverage they had in negotiations. And when Republican leadership needed Democratic votes on key bills dealing with utilities and license fees, and they got them with few long-term concessions.
It was a mistake that would haunt Democrats by session’s end.
In May, Republicans invoked a rarely used rule to break a Democratic filibuster, clearing the path to repeal an expansion of paid sick leave and place a constitutional amendment banning abortion on the ballot.
That steamrolling resumed in the fall, when Republicans again voted to end a Democratic filibuster — this time to advance a gerrymandered congressional map and a constitutional amendment making dramatic changes to the initiative petition process.
Emerging from the wreckage, many expected Senate Democrats to close ranks and prepare for procedural trench warfare in 2026, using the few tools available to them to slow the chamber to a crawl and exact some measure of payback.
That strategy requires party unity and coordination. Instead, with the next legislative session just weeks away and Republicans rallying behind an agenda that includes eliminating the state income tax, Democrats appear more divided than ever.
Last week, the Senate Democratic caucus split evenly over whether to keep Sen. Doug Beck of Affton as minority leader or replace him with Sen. Stephen Webber of Columbia.
Webber initially secured six votes, but a last-minute switch left the caucus deadlocked, five to five. The impasse was resolved with an uneasy compromise: Beck will remain minority leader for another year, while Webber will assume the role of leader-elect and take over in 2027 (unless the caucus changes course again).
The complaints aired during the meeting went beyond personality or ideology. Beck faced criticism over allegedly poor communication and the absence of a clear, shared strategy for a caucus with little margin for error. Ironically, the gathering had been scheduled as a strategy session for the coming year — a conversation that never happened because of the leadership fight.
So Democrats enter another session in the superminority, not only outgunned, but uncertain about how to fight back. After the meeting, the caucus put on a happy face, posting a group photo on social media pledging to focus on “lowering costs for Missouri families and making sure our state is an affordable place to live, work and raise a family.”
Beck declined to comment on the upcoming session, saying in an emailed statement that he plans to spend the holidays with family and “will be happy to talk about session once it begins.” As for what that session will look like, he added, “everyone will have to wait and see.”
For a party trying to claw its way back to relevance, waiting may be the one luxury it can least afford.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_beck3-scaled-e1757547726290-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

The Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce today released a 24-page “Omaha Competes” report that urges major updates to the state’s key business incentive program and outlines strategies to help reverse what it says is a trend pushing quality jobs and talent elsewhere.
“Nebraska is at a crucial moment in its approach to economic development,” begins the report that included participation from the Omaha Mayor’s Office, Omaha Public Power District and numerous corporations.

The recommendations will be used to form legislative and policy proposals and guide the chamber’s outreach and programming over the next few years, said Heath Mello, president and CEO of the chamber, which represents corporate and business interests in the state’s largest metro area. 
Authors describe state business attraction efforts as having retreated since hitting a “high water mark” from about 2016 to 2019. That period, which the report described as one of “better jobs, stronger communities and more robust budget revenue,” was reflected in a three-year streak of winning Site Selection Magazine’s “Governor’s Cup.”
That award recognizes states with the most qualifying new and expanded facilities per capita, based on criteria such as capital investment and new jobs. The chamber said the business climate during that previous stretch, which was during the administration of then-Gov. Pete Ricketts, benefited from “alignment between the state’s executive branch, legislature and business community.” 
 Freeze, sweep, cut 

In more recent years, however, the report asserts that economic development efforts have taken a back seat to other priorities. It pointed out that the Nebraska Department of Economic Development has reduced staffing and asserted that DED has shifted away from its “historic role as a proactive, pro-growth partner.” 
The Nebraska Examiner has reported that the DED team responsible for economic development across the state dropped by 22 full-time employees over the past couple of months. 
Chamber officials said that at a time when other states have cranked up incentives, they have watched Nebraska freeze, sweep or cut resources in several economic development programs due to budget shortfalls. 
Gov. Jim Pillen’s administration has defended some of the program trims to find savings that helped balance the budget and provide support for other priorities, including property tax relief for Nebraskans.
He has said in appearances speaking to business groups that some of the state’s incentive programs are not needed, maintaining that the state should not be subsidizing activities that the private sector could handle on its own.

During recent conflict over a legislatively-approved incentive designed to help pay for sports complexes, Pillen said the state for too long has been “duped” in approving sales tax exemptions he believes only shift the burdens to property taxes. 
Supporters tout that Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act as a way to spur economic development. Pillen, whose green light is necessary to unlock the incentive for individual proposals, said he won’t consider approval of any further projects until after the next legislative session during which he hopes to see lawmakers pass property tax relief.
Pillen, a former University of Nebraska regent, has argued that the state should focus more attention on emphasizing its strengths in areas like agribusiness and logistics and helping homegrown businesses seed and grow in the state.
“The result is clear: Nebraska now trails its neighbors in both new job creation and population growth,” said the Chamber report, citing the annual “economic scorecard” it issued in September. The Aksarben Foundation has released separate studies with similar findings.
‘Brain drain’ alarm escalates: Omaha and business leaders flag job lag

Had Nebraska matched the growth in peer states, the chamber report said, Omaha and Lincoln would have roughly 68,000 additional jobs that would have produced about $11 billion in wages and up to $800 million of additional tax revenue.
 Fertile for growth 

The chamber is commissioning a deeper examination of “brain drain” — a term referring to the exodus of people with a bachelor’s degree or higher — that will be released early next year.  
Other related efforts are ongoing, including the Aksarben Foundation’s recent formation of the Strengthening Nebraska Families, a nonprofit expected to educate and stir action to elevate the state’s competitiveness.
In preparing the Omaha Competes agenda, the chamber assigned working groups to explore key areas: talent retention and recruitment, and business growth.
They found that despite a relative job growth lag, Nebraska still has  fundamental strengths required for long term success, such as high labor force participation, strong educational attainment and quality of life. 
The report makes numerous recommendations, urging, for example, an update and revamp of the state’s flagship business incentive program. That ImagiNE Nebraska Act, enacted in 2020, which replaced the Nebraska Advantage Act.

The chamber characterized elements of the program as “cumbersome.” Users told task force members they faced a “bureaucratic maze” in accessing the tax breaks and an average 10-month wait between application and approval. 
In contrast, the report identifies peer programs in competing states it says act quicker. “Other states are able to provide access to cash upfront.”
Highlighted in the report are successes in places such as North Carolina, Georgia, Kansas, Texas and Virginia — in program areas such as site development funding, discretionary closing tools, customized workforce training and biotechnology investment.
“The analysis recognizes that incentives are now basic table stakes and that Nebraska’s current structure is slower, less flexible and less valuable than those in many peer states,” the report said.
Mello, in a prologue, said “countless hours” of meetings and research informed Omaha Competes recommendations. He said goals are to have properties teed up for development, public incentives and a business climate that grows top-notch talent.
“States across the country are moving faster, building stronger systems and signaling that they are ready for the next generation of jobs and talent,” he said. “Nebraska must match that ambition.”
 Budget constraints

Chamber officials are in “constant communication” with the state DED, Mello said, adding that an “integrated partnership” is crucial to recruitment and retention of business.

A former state senator, Mello acknowledged that the state’s current budget shortfall limits what policy objectives can be won, at least in the short term. The projected state budget deficit stands at $471 million, which lawmakers must fill before the soon-to-begin 2026 legislative session concludes.
“We will be thoughtful about how and when we take certain proposals to the Legislature to be sensitive to those fiscal challenges,” he said.
Among changes the chamber report proposes: a public tax incentive to relocate employees to Nebraska to fill new jobs; increase credit values to levels competitive with other states; remove a cap that limits the ImagiNE program to 3% of gross receipts; make credits transferable; expand a revolving loan fund partly to help finance essential extensions of utilities to be repaid with ImagiNE credits. 
In addition, the task force groups called for reinstatement or full restoration of entrepreneurial tools such as the Angel Tax Credit, which was eliminated by legislation in 2019 during Ricketts’ tenure, and the Business Innovation Act, which funds entrepreneurial-centric programs but was reduced during the past legislative session. 
The chamber also urges new tools to finance “shovel-ready” industrial sites and the use of Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bonds. The report’s authors likened STAR bonds to tax-increment financing. Given the power, municipalities would issue such bonds to finance development of commercial, entertainment and tourism projects. Bonds are paid off through the sales tax revenue generated by the development.











States across the country are moving faster, building stronger systems and signaling that they are ready for the next generation of jobs and talent. Nebraska must match that ambition.

A section of the Omaha Competes report focused on the state’s persistent “brain drain” struggle, particularly among young professionals ages 20 to 34. 
From 2010 to 2020, the report said, Nebraska lost an average of nearly 6,000 residents annually to other states. While out migration improved in 2023, talent flight continues “to constrain employer growth and discourage new investment.”
To attract an educated workforce, the group is calling for state-supported relocation assistance and a unified rural relocation system modeled after a Kansas program.

For retention, it proposed such initiatives as a graduate transition and housing pilot modeled after West Virginia’s “First Ascent” program, which offers short-term housing, coworking space, mentorship and social integration for recent graduates to create a “soft landing” in the Nebraska.
The chamber report urged reinstatement of funding for InternNE — calling it the cornerstone of the state’s “brain gain” strategy. It referred to an interim study led by Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln this year, saying that findings reaffirmed the program’s importance.
Authors of the report urged the state to modernize a “fragmented approach to job training” and to look to North Carolina and Louisiana for examples. Those state programs work directly with employers and community colleges to design and deliver training from start to finish, the report said, producing a “proactive economic development tool rather than a reactive grant process.”
The Cornhusker state’s drift from a nationally recognized focus on economic development “was not an accident,” the report said, contending that it came as “posture shifted from assertive to reactive.” It urged a course that “reasserts” more emphasis on economic development. 
“Nebraska has led before,” the report stated. “With these updates it can again.”

(Dan Forer | Getty Images)Wisconsin property taxpayers are expected to see the largest increases in local government levies on their December bills since 2018, according to a recent report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum. 
Much of that increase is driven by levies from K-12 schools, which are estimated to increase by 7.8%. Preliminary data from the state Department of Revenue (DOR) shows the property tax levies for K-12 school districts are expected to rise by about $476.1 million to $6.58 billion on December tax bills. 
County property taxes are set to rise 3.1% — an increase more in line with recent years. 
According to the report, the increase in school levies is the result of decisions made in the last two state budgets, including increases to school revenue limits while keeping state general aid flat, as well as voter approval of school district referendum requests. 
During the 2023-25 state budget, lawmakers included a $325 increase to schools districts’ revenue limits in each year along with two years of funding for the increase. Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto allowed school districts to raise the additional $325 per pupil annually for the next 400 years, but did not include the funding.
Evers and Democratic lawmakers advocated for the state to provide additional state aid, but Republicans, who hold the majority, rejected those calls.
“Typically, a portion of the per pupil revenue limit increase is covered by rising state general school aids,” the report states. “This time, state leaders instead kept the funding for these payments flat, leaving property taxes as the sole means by which school districts collectively could access the allowed $325 per student increase.”
State leaders did provide additional funding to schools for their special education costs, though initial estimates show that the state money set aside will not be enough to bring the reimbursement rate to 42% of special ed costs as leaders promised in the budget.
The report notes that state leaders decided to use the state budget surplus to cut income taxes instead of  providing school funding to limit property tax increases. It said that is in line with “a trend since 2011 in Wisconsin of falling spending on K-12 education as a share of personal income” and “means that the responsibility for paying for local government services, especially schools, is shifting more heavily to property taxpayers this year than it otherwise might have.”
School districts get to make a choice about whether they take advantage of additional school revenue authority by taxing the maximum amount.
“Rising pressure on both revenues and expenditures, however, appears to have prompted many districts to levy at or near the maximum amount,” the report states. “These pressures include rising teacher salaries and inflation, revenue limit increases in recent years that lagged the rate of inflation, and decreased funding associated with declining student enrollment and the expiration of federal pandemic relief funds.”
According to the report, 28.7% of school districts have a levy increase of more than 10% in 2025. This includes some communities that have levy increases of more than 30% including Wauwatosa, a large suburban district, and Bruce and Markesan, which are small rural school districts.
One example highlighted in the report is the Beloit School District, whose levy tripled in 2025 from $5.6 million to $16.2 million.
The school district lost $9.8 million in state general school aids this year. The Department of Public Instruction reported in October that 71% of public school districts would receive less general school aid this year, which was in part because general state aid remained flat. Schools that lose state aid are able to make up for the reduction by increasing their levy.
The report notes that the “sharp rise in property taxes therefore does not represent a correspondingly sharp increase in core district revenue, which still only rose by the allowable increase under the revenue limit.”
School referendum requests are also making up part of the increase as school districts continue to turn to voters to help meet costs in lieu of state funding increases.
Wisconsin had the largest amount of school referendum requests passed in state history in November 2024, raising property taxes by over $3.4 billion that year. In 2025, Wisconsin voters also approved the largest number of school referendums in an off year since 2015. 
Madison Metropolitan school district’s levy increased by $81.1 million from the large referendum it passed in 2024. It also lost $11.9 million in state general aid, allowing it to increase property taxes to make up for that loss. The report notes that Madison’s increases alone make up 17% of the overall K-12 levy increase, though “without Madison’s increase, statewide tax levies would have increased by 6.9%, which would have been the third highest rate in the last 25 years.”
The report warns that property taxpayers could see similar increases to their property taxes in coming years.
“State law will provide another $325 per pupil revenue increase [next year] but again no increase in state general school aids or property tax credits. The increase in special education aid will also be smaller than this year,” the report states. “Absent some special action by the state Legislature and governor early next year, property taxpayers will likely see more of the same in December 2026.”
Some lawmakers want to get rid of revenue increase, others propose overhauling system
As property taxpayers receive their December bills, lawmakers have been proposing ways to prevent further hikes and cut property taxes, though it’s unclear whether the proposals will lead to concrete changes before the close of the legislative session next year.
Republican lawmakers are still seeking the elimination of the annual school revenue increases. 
A bill coauthored by Rep. Dave Maxey (R-New Berlin) and Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) would stop the $325 annual increases for school districts starting in the 2027-28 school year. It received a public hearing last week.
A memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau found that 58 school districts levied less than the amount they could — meaning that 363 of Wisconsin’s 421 school districts levied the maximum amount in 2025.
“To those who think districts aren’t going to automatically increase revenue limits each year, you are believing a lie,” Maxey said in written testimony. “The 400-year veto is going to be extremely destructive to almost every homeowner in the years to come.”
Maxey said the bill would “restore balance and accountability” by giving control to lawmakers and taxpayers.
“Decisions about raising property taxes should be made by the people who pay them, not imposed by executive action,” Maxey said.
Evers has stood by his partial veto, making it unlikely he would sign the bill.
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) is less bothered with the 400-year increase, calling it a “parlor trick” that “just provided the additional capacity for local governments to lean more on property taxes to fund education, which is inequitable.” Last week, he proposed a package of bills meant to overhaul the way Wisconsin K-12 schools and local governments bring in revenue as a way to cut property taxes. 
“I’m less inclined to demonize a $325 a year potential increase than to attack the actual problem, which is this over reliance on property taxes to fund K-12 education,” Clancy said. “The problem is distinctly Republican. The state has been starving schools of resources. It’s been starving local government of resources. When you do those things then schools and local governments have to ask for money in the way of property taxes, because that’s the only mechanism available to them.”
Clancy told the Examiner that he sees the state’s reliance on property taxes to fund schools “inherently inequitable” as it determines funding based on the size and costs of houses nearby.
“In Wisconsin, we have an extremely ridiculous and complex funding formula that tries to provide a little bit more aid to make up that gap, but it doesn’t fit the bill, and it’s really been kind of a terrible system,” Clancy said.
Clancy said that he’s heard from community members, especially from older adults on fixed incomes that they want to chip in to help with schools, but it’s getting to where they “cannot afford to live in this community anymore.”
“We’ve been talking to folks who have left Milwaukee and sometimes left the state because they cannot afford the property taxes on their homes that they worked their whole lives to afford, and in some cases, they’ve lived in these homes for generations, and yet, the property tax burden from our very regressive property taxes is just too much for a lot of people around the market,” Clancy said. “We can change that, and we should.”
Clancy’s package of bills aim to bring down property taxes by eliminating school districts’ reliance on property taxes by increasing income taxes on the state’s wealthier residents.
Clancy said the bill would lead to on average a 44% cut to people’s property taxes.
“Generally, if you look at the median across the state, 44% of your property tax bill goes to K-12 education. That percentage is actually a little bit higher in Milwaukee, so Milwaukee residents will see a greater savings from this,” Clancy said.
According to a draft, which is still being finalized, the bill would increase the tax rate for Wisconsin’s fourth income tax bracket to 8.85% by taxable year 2026. It would also create a new fifth tax bracket with a rate of 17.7% by taxable year 2026 on those making at least $750,000 for single taxpayers and $1 million for married couples filing jointly. The revenue from the income tax hikes would be used to pay for education costs including boosting the special education reimbursement rate to 90%.
“The problem of inequity in education is a massive structural problem. We’re not going to fix that by nibbling around the edges of it… We could do half measures. We could say, you know, a 5% reduction in property taxes,” Clancy said. “Ultimately, that doesn’t fix the problem.”
Clancy is also proposing allowing local governments the option to implement a local income tax and reimplementing the estate tax in Wisconsin, which would tax transfers of property that take place upon a person’s death.
Clancy said the proposal would address the ways “Wisconsin has been starving our municipalities and counties of their own share revenue for a long time now.”

(Photo by Kay McKinley)At a Wisconsin Assembly committee meeting in November to consider a proposal to extend the widely popular Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Grant program, Rep. Rob Swearingen (R-Rhinelander) complained that too much land in his district has been conserved through the program.
That sentiment has become increasingly common among a subset of Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature, most of them representing the far northern reaches of the state. The complaint they often make is that Knowles-Nelson has taken too much land off local property tax rolls, depriving already struggling local governments of important revenue. 
These complaints also go hand-in-hand with laments that the Wisconsin Supreme Court undermined the Legislature’s authority to conduct oversight of the grant program by ruling the Republican-controlled Joint Committee on Finance was unconstitutionally blocking stewardship grant projects proposed by the Department of Natural Resources. These Republicans say that their districts have borne the burden of Wisconsin’s land conservation goals for too long and some of that work should shift to southern parts of the state.
Because of this group’s objections in the Republican legislative caucus, the stewardship program is facing its demise next year.
Popular program hits roadblocks 
The Knowles-Nelson program was started in 1989 to fund land conservation in the state. Grants from the program to local governments and non-profits help cover some of the costs for purchasing and conserving land that can be used for recreation, preserving animal habitats and supporting local industries such as forestry. Polls have shown an overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites support the program. 
Despite that support, it is set to expire next summer and, so far, legislative efforts to extend the program have failed. 
In his initial 2025-27 state budget proposal, Gov. Tony Evers asked to extend the program for ten years with $100 million in annual funding. Republicans stripped that provision from the budget immediately. 
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) and Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) have authored a bill that would extend the program for four years at $28 million per year. The bill also includes a provision that would require the full Legislature to approve any land purchases that cost more than $1 million — a proposal that critics say would be far too slow for the speed at which real estate transactions need to move. 
A separate proposal from Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) would re-authorize the program for six years at $72 million per year and create an independent board made up of members appointed by the Legislature to approve large land purchases through the program.
Separately, Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) has introduced a proposed constitutional amendment that would require the full Legislature to approve any state spending on land conservation.
Data contradicts lawmakers’ complaints 
The complaints that Knowles-Nelson has conserved too much Northwoods land may prove fatal to the program in a Legislature that has been unable to find common ground on environmental issues. 
But an analysis of public lands data shows that the Knowles-Nelson program plays a comparatively small role in Wisconsin’s conserved land portfolio. Despite the claims of critics, the program’s land purchases have been made in all corners of the state. 
knowles nelson by assembly district
“Knowles-Nelson becomes like sort of the straw man argument,” says Charles Carlin, director of strategic initiatives at the land conservation non-profit Gathering Waters. “If legislators stood up and said, ‘I don’t think that we should have public land in the way that we do, we should reduce our public land portfolio,’ that would be a terribly unpopular position.”
The program has widespread support, he says.
“Public lands are the prized heritage of Americans, right?” Carlin says. “It’s one of the only things that we just largely agree on as a country, is that we are really proud of our public lands. And this is part of our national identity, and I think it’s certainly part of our Wisconsin identity.” 
Swearingen’s 34th district, which covers north central Wisconsin from Rhinelander up to the Michigan border, has more land conserved by the DNR than any other district in the state — almost 335,000 acres, nearly 24% of the district. That includes land set aside for state parks, natural areas, forests and similar uses. 
But only 4.7% of the district is conserved through Knowles-Nelson. Another 4.6% of his district is conserved by the federal government, and 8.6% is conserved county forest land. 
Despite the claims that Knowles-Nelson has devoured valuable land across the state, no Assembly district has had more than 5.1% of its land conserved through the program, data shows. The average amount of Knowles-Nelson conserved land across all 99 Assembly districts is 1.13%. 
Many small purchases
Ron Eckstein, a board member of Wisconsin Green Fire, says Knowles-Nelson is best equipped to help the state purchase smaller tracts to connect already conserved land across the southern part of the state. 
“Many state fish and wildlife areas, state parks, and state natural areas across the southern two-thirds of Wisconsin have private land inholdings within their property boundaries,” he said in an email. 
“It is very important to continue to purchase these inholdings so these state properties can meet their intended purpose: fish and wildlife habitat, rare species, game species, public access, recreation and recreational trails,” Eckstein said. “This means continuing the long-term, slow process of purchasing a 20-acre tract here and an 80-acre tract there to complete these state-owned areas and fulfill their public purpose.” 
state land by assembly district
Other DNR land and federal land take up hundreds of thousands more acres across the state. 
The 74th District, represented by Rep. Chanz Green and Sen. Romaine Quinn has the most Knowles-Nelson land at 5.1%. Nearly 11% of the district is other DNR land while 14.5% is federal land and 23.8% is county land.
Twenty Assembly districts have more general DNR conserved land than the 74th has Knowles-Nelson land. 
Across the five Assembly districts with the most federal land, 1,596,129 acres have been conserved. Across the five districts with the most Knowles-Nelson land, 413,453 acres have been conserved. 
The data also contradicts Republican claims that the northern parts of the state unfairly get too much land conservation attention. 
The Dane County districts represented by Reps. Mike Bare (D-Verona), Alex Joers (D-Waunakee) and Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison) are all among the 10 districts with the highest percentage of land conserved through Knowles-Nelson. Rep. Karen DeSanto’s Baraboo-area district, Rep. Chuck Wichgers’ suburban Waukesha County district and Rep. Scott Krug’s district south of Stevens Point are also in the top 10.
When divided by dollar amount, Knowles-Nelson is similarly disbursed. Since its inception, $1.2 billion has been given out through the program to all but one of the Assembly districts; the Milwaukee district of Rep. Supreme Moore-Omukunde (D-Milwaukee) is the only district to not receive any money. 
The 36th district, represented by Rep. Jeff Mursau (R-Crivitz), has gotten the most of that money — $102 million, which amounts to 7% of the total Knowles-Nelson purchases over the program’s lifetime. But districts have received an average of $13 million through the program. 
federal land by assembly district
“While we’ve done some really cool things with Knowles-Nelson, it’s largely been a drop in the bucket of our sort of overall public lands portfolio,” Carlin says. While some critics complain about the state’s total public land portfolio, he adds,  “Knowles Nelson investments are really targeted and strategic, and cumulatively not actually that big.”
Republicans defend focusing on Knowles-Nelson because they have limited control over the land conserved by the federal and county governments.  Legislators have authority over the program through the biennial budget process and the confirmation of members of the Natural Resources Board, but despite that, have put the stewardship program in the crosshairs. 
In the last several years, Republicans on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee began using passive review — an anonymous veto system — to selectively block some Knowles-Nelson projects, to the wide condemnation of members of the public and conservation groups. A 2024 state Supreme Court ruling, in a lawsuit filed by Gov. Tony Evers against the committee’s co-chair, Sen. Howard Marklein, found that the “legislative veto” was unconstitutional. 
“Until the Evers v. Marklein decision by the liberal Wisconsin Supreme Court, there was a good process in place for new stewardship land purchases,” Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) told the Wisconsin Examiner in a statement. “Those checks and balances between the executive branch and the Legislature ensured that it was a collective decision, and that the state did not overpay for stewardship land. Unfortunately, since this process was destroyed, the Legislature is forced to put even more scrutiny on the stewardship program.” 
County Forest by Assembly District
Carlin says the program has played an important role in helping local governments in more rural parts of the state invest in projects that help the local economy in the long term. Dane County’s recently passed 2026 budget includes $20 million for land conservation, which is not an expense most counties can afford. 
“But if collectively, we choose as a state to say this is an important priority, we’re all going to work on this together, then we can make meaningful investments in rural communities that wouldn’t otherwise be able to do it themselves,” Carlin says. 
“At a time when there is such incredible inequality of wealth and opportunity,” he adds, “what the data tells us is that Knowles-Nelson has been a really good democratizer of investments in conservation and recreation.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WP2-Oak-Bluff-Taylor-copy-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Swartz made the announcement in a statement posted to Facebook Saturday, saying she will seek election to Michigan’s 41st state House District, currently held by Rep. Julie Rogers (D-Kalamazoo), who declared her intent in July to seek the 19th Michigan Senate District seat in 2026. 
Swartz pointed to rising costs for families and criticized Republicans in Lansing, accusing them of prioritizing the “extreme wing of their party” over working people.

“No matter what seat I’m running for, I’ll always fight to make sure Michiganders choose their politicians — not the other way around,” Swartz wrote. 
She thanked volunteers, donors and supporters who backed her congressional bid over the past three years and said she will continue serving southwest Michigan despite no longer running for federal office.
Following Swartz’s announcement, state Sen. Sean McCann, a Democrat from Kalamazoo who is running for the 4th District seat, released a statement praising her campaign and commitment to public service.
“I’m deeply grateful to Jessica for stepping up to run and her desire to serve our community,” McCann said. “I greatly admire her dedication to fighting to protect our health care, support our veterans, and look out for Southwest Michigan families.”

McCann said he looks forward to working with Swartz in the coming year as Democrats seek to flip the seat, currently held by Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland Township). McCann said he remains committed to earning voters’ support and bringing change to the district.
The race for the 4th Congressional District has drawn attention from state Democrats, who see the seat as a potential pickup in their bid to regain a majority in Congress. 
Other Democrats seeking the nomination include cybersecurity professional Richard Aaron and former Congressional staffer Diop Harris in the Democratic primary. However, Gov.

The Trump administration will ""dismantle"" the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which operates a supercomputer in Cheyenne.
The post Wyoming scientists, tech advocates, fret over future of federal supercomputing center in Cheyenne appeared first on WyoFile .","Ever wonder what the weather holds in store? Or how much snow might pile in Wyoming’s mountain ranges, or when spring melt might begin?
Much of that vital information, including Wyoming-specific water and drought modeling, comes from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, and its Wyoming Supercomputing Center in Cheyenne. 
Now the fate of the institution — as well as the vital information it provides for the state’s agriculture, tourism and energy industries — is uncertain.
Last week, a Trump administration official announced that NCAR would be dismantled. In a social media post Tuesday, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought described NCAR as “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” and said the administration “will be breaking up” the institution. 
“A comprehensive review is underway & any vital activities such as weather research will be moved to another entity or location,” Vought added.
Days later, however, Colorado Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper — both Democrats — stalled the Senate’s budget process in protest of the move to dismantle NCAR.

If the Trump administration overcomes such efforts, it’s unclear what will happen to NCAR and its Wyoming Supercomputing Center. The Cheyenne facility, established in 2012, may be offloaded to “an appropriate operator,” according to an NCAR statement Thursday.
“The [U.S. National Science Foundation] will publish a Dear Colleague Letter that will inform the agency’s follow-on actions,” NCAR said. “Specifically, NSF will explore options to transfer stewardship of the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputer to an appropriate operator; divest of or transfer the two NSF aircraft that NCAR manages and operates; and redefine the scope of modeling and forecasting research and operations to concentrate on needs such as seasonal weather prediction, severe storms, and space weather.”
Renowned climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, a professor at Texas Tech University who serves as the Nature Conservancy’s chief scientist, referred to NCAR as “quite literally our global mothership.
“The National Center for Atmospheric Research,” Hayhoe continued in a social media post, “supports the scientists who fly into hurricanes, the meteorologists who develop new radar technology, the physicists who envision and code new weather models, and yes — the largest community climate model in the world. That too. Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet.”

Closer to home, University of Wyoming Geology and Geophysics Professor J.J. Shinker, who relies on both NCAR in Colorado and the Wyoming supercomputer, said, “Dismantling NCAR has implications for Wyoming, for our students, for our research and for Wyoming’s future well-being.”
NCAR and Wyoming
NCAR’s supercomputing center has maintained a close relationship with the state and the University of Wyoming since its inception, logging hundreds of “core hours” for “Wyoming-led projects in the atmospheric, earth system, geological and other areas of science of interest to Wyoming,” according to the university.
Shinker, her university colleagues and her students, rely on both the supercomputer and NCAR’s Colorado headquarters.

“I use NCAR data from that supercomputer for a class that I teach in the spring semester, and I’m really hoping that it’s not impacted,” Shinker told WyoFile. “NCAR and its resources — the data and the people — are integral to Wyoming’s economy.”
That’s particularly the case for drought monitoring — “a big issue in our state,” Shinker said. “Our agricultural industry, our ag suppliers — they require updated, real-time, quality-controlled data, and that is one of the things that NCAR provides with that supercomputer and with their personnel resources. Dismantling that would put Wyoming’s economy at risk.”
Even before statehood, Wyoming’s evolving economy has always been built around the “pulse” of its climate, Shinker explained. That’s particularly the case when it comes to the pulse of precipitation, winter snowpack and spring runoff. Understanding weather outlook modeling and larger precipitation, temperature and drought trends are vital to those who rely on water for everything from outdoor recreation to wildfire vulnerability and when to plant certain crops. 
“What’s crazy is, that supercomputer receives satellite data and data from buoys in the ocean that tell us about things like El Niño and La Niña, which I do research on,” Shinker said. “We’re not doing subversive research. We’re doing research that is in support of the well-being of the state of Wyoming, because most of the research that my students and I work on is about drought.”

In a more direct economic sense, NCAR’s Wyoming supercomputer helped launch Cheyenne’s growing tech and data center industry, Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins told WyoFile. Microsoft was among the first major tech companies to set up shop in Cheyenne, which Collins attributes, in large part, to the supercomputer. Today, Microsoft plans to expand its computing presence there. Meta, as well as a joint venture between Crusoe and Tallgrass, have also announced plans to build data centers in the area, mostly driven by demand for artificial intelligence computing.  
The growing industry provides “super high-quality jobs,” Collins told WyoFile, adding “these are philanthropic companies, so they’re giving a lot back to the community.” It would be a “huge loss” for the University of Wyoming and Cheyenne if the supercomputer was no longer an entity.
“Just the reputation of having NCAR and having Microsoft, having Meta — all the different [tech] companies that have chosen to be here really helps us in our reputation to bring other businesses here,” Collins said.
Beyond Cheyenne’s and Wyoming’s stake in the tech industry, Collins said the loss of NCAR’s work in atmospheric sciences would be a major hit.
“I see a lot of value in those kinds of things — the early warnings we get, which gives us the ability to protect our populations, and the academics and the stuff that comes from that, really does help our communities.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)For the first time in years, no recognized political party in Oklahoma will allow independent voters to participate in their partisan primaries. And while that’s their choice, it’s probably going to have some pretty oversized implications in the new year.
Independents, a rapidly growing bloc of voters in Oklahoma, may find themselves feeling disenfranchised during our state’s key partisan primaries that have turned into winner-take-all contests. 
Republicans have long excluded independents from casting critical votes in their primaries, but for the first time in a decade, independents now are barred from voting in Democratic primaries as well.
I suspect the decision to prohibit nearly 500,000 independent voters from all three parties’ (Libertarians being the third) primaries is going to be a major headache for establishment Republicans who are already attempting to fend off a state question that seeks to allow all voters to cast a ballot during primaries.
It’s also likely to pose a major problem for both supporters and opponents of a separate nonpartisan state question that is set to appear on June’s primary ballot that seeks to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2029. Both sides, I’m certain, were relying on independents, who often lean more moderate and tend to stay engaged politically, to weigh in.
But it is impressive, in a sad sort of way, that the party leaders’ inaction — or incompetence — has simultaneously managed to aggravate independent voters while pretty much guaranteeing our state’s already abysmal voter turnout rates will be even worse than normal.
I didn’t think any such thing was possible, but that’s exactly what the political elites in the Democrat, Republican, Libertarian parties have done by refusing to open their primary elections to unaffiliated voters.
Oklahoma is among nearly a dozen states that have a closed primary system, unless the members of a political party vote to open it to independent voters and notify the state Election Board within specified deadlines.
In many legislative races in Oklahoma – and elsewhere – general elections have largely become irrelevant. Races are won and lost during closed primaries. As our state legislative districts have become more politicized, primary winners on both sides of the aisle often don’t have a general election opponent, which is unfortunate because those are the contests that are open to all voters and have higher turnouts.
Earlier this month, the state Election Board announced no political party had notified them by the deadline that they had decided to open their primaries to independents.
In response, Oklahoma’s Democrat party leaders frantically insisted that they had intended to do so or thought they had done so, and blamed a “miscommunication” on the state Election Board not being notified. They said they were exploring their legal options.
But as Paul Ziriax, Oklahoma Election Board secretary put it, state law is “very clear” and “unambigious” on how and when that notification needs to happen. Democrats, he said, only notified him they wanted to change their party’s symbol from a rooster to a donkey on the ballot, not open their primaries.
The “miscommunication” on Democrats’ part coincidentally comes as a bipartisan group of Oklahomans is collecting signatures on the constitutional state question that would overhaul how Oklahoma’s partisan primary system operates.
If supporters can gather 172,993 signatures by Jan. 26, all voters will have the opportunity to determine if they like the current closed primary system. The state question would allow voters to choose one candidate for each office and the top two vote-getters, regardless of political party, would advance to the general election. Supporters believe it will increase voter engagement and create a more moderate slate of candidates.
Republican party leaders, of course, oppose the plan, arguing that it will “water down” the elections. They argue that if this was important it could have been done years ago when Democrats controlled our state government. Republicans, by the way, control all Congressional seats, statewide elected offices and hold huge majorities in the Legislature.
Democrats – or the Election Board, depending on who you ask – may give the citizen-led campaign a shot in the arm as they enter the home stretch of signature collection. And if Republicans want to stop this effort, the Legislature may have to take matters into their own hands and propose an alternative option.
Meanwhile, I suspect barring independents is going to dampen voter turnout during the upcoming primary election on June 16. That will likely hurt  a nonpartisan state question also on the ballot that day asking whether voters want to approve gradually increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an hour by 2029.
Because state questions are nonpartisan, all registered voters can cast votes about them.
But who wants to stand in line for hours during early voting or drive to a polling place on primary election day to vote on a sole issue?
As an independent voter, I know that I’m already thinking about sitting out the upcoming election even though I’d still be eligible to vote on one state question.
It takes time to vote, and unless I’m particularly passionate about an issue, I generally sit out elections where a single issue appears on the ballot.
I suspect I’m not the only voter thinking about avoiding the hassle.
So it’s going to require a lot of heavy lifting for both opponents and proponents of the issue to mobilize independent voters to weigh in. Based on their sheer numbers alone, I suspect those independents could be a deciding factor in the outcome of that issue.
I, for one, will be sitting on the edge of my seat watching as the political drama unfolds. It will be fascinating to see what happens over the next few months as a result of this accidental “miscommunication” and to watch how the dominos begin to fall.
Buckle up Oklahoma. Welcome to the start of what is already shaping up to be a messy election cycle.

Draft legislation to allow landowners to sell hunting licenses issued to them violates the principle of wildlife as public trust, write Bob Lanka and Tom Ryder.
The post Wyoming’s wildlife isn’t for sale, or at least it shouldn’t be appeared first on WyoFile .","Once again, the Wyoming Legislature is considering a bill to allow landowners to sell hunting licenses issued to them to whomever they choose. If enacted, this law would permit individuals, based solely on their status as private landowners, to personally profit from the private sale of state hunting licenses at whatever price the market will bear. This system allows those with deep pockets, without going through the public license draw, to move to the front of the line for coveted Wyoming hunting licenses so that they can pursue a public trust resource, wildlife, owned by all Wyoming’s citizens. 

Opinion

Similar legislation was considered in the 2025 legislative session. Public opposition killed that bill, as it has with previous proposals, but the idea just won’t die. 
What is the public trust? The Public Trust Doctrine holds that wildlife is not individually owned but rather held in trust by state or federal governments and managed for the benefit of all citizens. In the United States, the doctrine was first established in the Supreme Court decision Martin v. Waddell, which cites public stewardship tenets in the English Magna Carta of 1215 as part of its rationale. Clearly, wildlife held by government as a public resource managed for the benefit of all is not a new idea. 
Wyoming Statute 23-1-103 affirms this idea: “For the purposes of this act, all wildlife in Wyoming is the property of the state.” That language has been part of Wyoming law since 1937. 
State ownership of wildlife does not mean that further legislation couldn’t give some or all of the public’s ownership rights to private citizens. 
In early November, the House Joint Agriculture, State and Public Lands & Water Resources Interim Committee agreed to sponsor legislation in the upcoming 2026 budget session that would allow private landowners to: “transfer a hunting license issued under this subsection to any person.” 
Some might argue that the issuance of hunting licenses is a regulatory matter and the act of allowing landowners to sell landowner licenses to another is not granting ownership of wildlife. We are not qualified to offer a legal opinion on this topic, but we can apply some Wyoming logic and say that if it looks like a skunk and smells like a skunk, it’s probably a skunk. 
There is no doubt that private lands, and consequently private landowners, provide millions of acres of habitat used by wildlife. Included in these acres are a large portion of the winter, migration, breeding and nesting habitat critical to our wildlife. Simply stated, Wyoming would not have the abundance or diversity of wildlife it now enjoys without private lands. 
But one has to wonder, how many more public benefits must be offered at the altar of compensating for wildlife on private lands? 
Since colonial times, landowners have been able to charge whatever the market will bear for the right of access to their lands, including access to hunt. Wyoming has generously provided private agricultural landowners with numerous benefits. 
The Wyoming Legislature first authorized landowner licenses in 1949. Up to two licenses for deer, elk and pronghorn per qualifying parcel can be issued annually. Landowners pay the full fee for each license, but their licenses are drawn before the draw for other resident and nonresident applicants. Over the last three years, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has issued, on average, 1,173 nonresident and 2,534 resident landowner licenses annually. 
Since wildlife belongs to all citizens, U.S. courts have determined that states are not liable for damages caused by wildlife unless they choose to assume this burden. Wyoming chose to do so in 1939. Over the last three years, the department paid on average $811,283 in damage claims for deer, elk and pronghorn annually. Including the additional costs of damage prevention and program administration, the department spends approximately $1 million each year to mitigate deer, elk and pronghorn use of private lands. 
In 1939, the Wyoming Legislature also established the landowner coupon program. This coupon, attached to every deer, elk and pronghorn license, allows the landowner to redeem $16 for wildlife taken on their property. Over the past three years, the Department has, on average, annually reimbursed landowners $304,587 for these coupons.
Given the partial list above, one is left to wonder, how much is enough? For those who think this latest request will be the last item offered at the altar, the history of our state indicates otherwise. 
During the work of the Wyoming Wildlife Task Force in 2021-2022, a proposal was submitted to: “provide qualifying Wyoming private landowners with an allocated number of resident and non-resident hunting licenses for elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, and pronghorn antelope.”
This was not the first time the idea of allocating a portion of Wyoming’s hunting licenses directly to private landowners was brought up. Would some additional allocation beyond the two landowner licenses currently allowed be enough, or would that allocation simply set the stage for the next ask and the next until the only thing we, the public, have to give is private ownership of all wildlife? 
Wyoming is at a crossroads. You can influence which path it takes by providing respectful input to your local state senator and representative. 
Wyoming’s wildlife, and its status as a public trust resource, is an irreplaceable heritage passed down to each one of us by those who came before. In our view, it is the duty of this generation to prevent any attempt to carve off some of our heritage for the exclusive use of a few. It is our duty to pass on our heritage intact.

(Photo by Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)REXBURG — Idaho health officials aren’t sure that a Medicaid contractor’s cuts to critical mental health services will end up saving the state money in the long run.
But because Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered budget cuts across state government to try to avoid a projected budget shortfall — which is now estimated at $40.3 million this fiscal year, even after his cuts — the mental health cuts were needed to avoid other damaging holdbacks, Idaho’s top Medicaid official recently said in a federal lawsuit filing. 
If the Department of Health and Welfare were required by a court to pause cuts to specialized mobile teams that treat people with severe mental illness, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Sasha O’Connell wrote the agency “will be forced” to look at other cuts.
Idaho sheriffs worry Medicaid mental health cuts pose ‘significant public-safety concern’

That would include “more cuts for state run psychiatric hospitals; cuts to payment rates for private behavioral health hospitals, which would risk those private hospital(s) pulling out of participation in the Medicaid program; eliminating youth and adult mental health crisis centers and mobile crisis units; and cuts to other optional services,” she wrote in a declaration in response to a lawsuit by patients in federal court. 
Even with the state’s cuts to the mental health services for people with severe illness — which state officials argue still exists somewhat — “these changes may not be avoidable,” O’Connell wrote.
The state’s explanations come weeks after the cuts by contractor Magellan Healthcare to services for people with severe mental illness took effect. Mental health providers and sheriffs warn they will risk public safety. 
Idaho Sen. Julie VanOrden, a Republican from Pingree who chairs the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, said there’s preliminary talks to restore funding to cut programs, possibly by tapping into funds from settlements of lawsuits against tobacco and opioid manufacturers. 
She hopes that pans out, because other funding options are slim.
“Will the Legislature be willing to look at maybe using some of our ‘rainy day’ funds? Possibly, but it’s going to be very slim, if we even go in and do that at all,” she told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.

 A Republican legislator grilled Medicaid official on lacking data for the cuts

Weeks before the Idaho Legislature will reconvene for the 2026 legislative session, a panel of lawmakers stopped in Rexburg to meet with Medicaid providers for their feedback on the state’s transition to private companies running Medicaid benefits, which is called managed care.
But before the Legislature’s Medicaid Review Panel heard from providers, Idaho Sen. Kevin Cook, an Idaho Falls Republican, pressed for more details on the Medicaid mental health cuts.

The agency doesn’t have data to show the cuts will save costs long term, O’Connell, the state’s Medicaid director, told him. The programs themselves save money in other states, she said. 
“The department has seen some evidence in other states that suggest that both of those services lead to decreased costs in the long run for the state,” O’Connell told him. “But given the timeline that we have to pursue budget reductions and the limited choices that we have in the law today, those were the ones that were chosen.”
“I’m assuming you have data that explains that we cut this, and we will save money,” Cook said.
“No,” O’Connell replied. 
The agency needs data, Cook replied. 
“If we don’t have data that proves that our cuts are saving us money, that it possibly costs us more down the road, how on earth can we say I’ve got data to show that an (managed care organization) can come in and give us a good bid and take over all of our programs?” Cook said. 
When providers spoke later in the meeting about the cuts, Sen. VanOrden, the panel’s co-chair, cut them off. She said the meeting was about the state’s shift to managed care, not the cuts. 
Ric Boyce, who directs Mental Health Specialists in Pocatello and Blackfoot, was less than a minute into talking before he brought up the cuts — saying they have “already highlighted the vulnerabilities” of managed care.
After VanOrden told him the panel wasn’t discussing cuts at the meeting, Boyce kept trying.
“I don’t think we can talk about how I’d ever implement this without having some understanding of what’s just happened,” he said. 
 Providers, sheriffs worry the public faces safety risk from Idaho mental health cuts 

The day before Thanksgiving, staff in Boyce’s office called patients to tell them the services — the Assertive Community Treatment, or ACT, program for people with severe mental illness, and peer support specialists that aid people throughout treatment — would no longer be available, he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.
“We were scrambling to try and get hold of these guys to reassure them that we were not cutting them off,” Boyce said. “We were still going to do everything we could on our end to try to see them. But all of a sudden we had a whole bunch of people in crisis.”
State officials and Magellan say the services in the program are still available individually even though the cuts don’t let providers bill for them together in one “bundled” service. But already, Boyce said he’s had staff quit or cut hours. 
“The community is being told that the components of the programs are still there. But at the same time, they’re no longer the evidence-based programs at all,” he said.

The day the cuts went into effect, Idaho Sheriffs’ Association President Samuel Hulse warned the governor and state lawmakers that the cuts — caused by “self-inflicted” budget woes — would risk public safety.
Hulse, who is Bonneville County’s sheriff, told the Sun it’s clear that the Legislature “cut deep enough that they now have a problem.”
Sheriffs run the jails, which he said “are the default mental institutions of the nation.”
“Some individuals, a small percentage, need to be kept incarcerated because we can’t stabilize them. But that’s a very small percentage of people. The rest, with effective services, can be kept stabilized. The sheriffs know this because we live it every day,” he said. “… When you don’t have the other services provided in the community, we know they default into the justice system.”
 Idaho Medicaid has few options for cuts, official says

About 200 people in Idaho are on the Assertive Community Treatment, or ACT, program, Magellan Healthcare’s Idaho Executive Director David Welsh wrote in a declaration in response to a federal lawsuit by patients. 
Before the governor’s executive order for budget cuts in response to the projected budget shortfall, Magellan “had already received communications from the state’s private behavioral health hospitals indicating that they would pull out of the network or significantly reduce the amount of Medicaid members they serve absent a rate increase, effectively refusing Medicaid participants if Magellan decreased their reimbursement rates,” Welsh said.

Then after the governor’s executive order, he wrote that the Department of Health and Welfare “requested that Magellan identify services that could be reduced to achieve a 4% net reduction.”
His declaration didn’t address why specific services were targeted for cuts. The company also cut mental health provider pay rates by 4-15% that vary by service, after the Department of Health and Welfare cut pay rates for providers and managed care organizations by 4%. 
But the state Medicaid director, O’Connell, wrote that if the agency doesn’t proceed with its plans for cuts, it “must consider eliminating more optional Medicaid covered services.” And it has few options of programs to cut under current law, she wrote in the legal filing.
Heading into the next legislative session, VanOrden is worried about the state’s budget situation. 
“I’m nervous about it this year, but I’m even more nervous about it next year,” she said, when the budget deficit is projected to grow to more than a half billion dollars.

Specialty crop growers with the advocacy campaign Grow it Here said in a webinar Wednesday that wage increases with temporary visa programs and an overall decline in the availability of immigrant labor has impacted their ability to produce food and compete with foreign producers.
Idaho’s cattle industry driving record-high cash in 2025, other farmers struggling under inflation

Lisa Tate, a citrus and avocado producer in southern California, said labor shortage problems aren’t always immediately felt in the food system but have long-term effects on a farmers’ ability to stay in the industry.
“Labor shortages may not cause immediate food shortages or higher prices, but they quietly weaken our resilience of our food system by increasing our reliance on foreign imports,” Tate said. “Addressing agricultural labor challenges isn’t just about getting through one harvest, it’s about protecting the long-term foundations of America’s food supply.”
Majority of farmers surveyed say experience worker shortages
According to the study, more than half of surveyed farmers said in 2021 that they were experiencing some sort of labor shortage. On average, farmers reported an inability to hire 21% of the labor they needed for normal operating conditions.
The Michigan State University study developed an equilibrium displacement model, a formula that is often used for policy analysis, to relate domestic farm labor markets to labor-intensive agricultural output markets. From here, researcher Zach Rutledge said he was able to derive an expression that related changes in food prices to changes in employment.
Rutledge, speaking at the webinar Wednesday, said the findings “indicate that moderate reductions in farm employment could raise consumer food costs by billions of dollars.”
According to the study, labor-intensive specialty crops generate roughly $115 billion in product value annually, meaning a 2.94% increase due to labor shortages would equate an increase in food prices of nearly $3.4 billion.
The study showed a decline in the Mexican immigrant populations in the U.S., which Rutledge said represents the origin of the majority of foreign-born agricultural workers. He also said agricultural workers are now more likely to settle in one area, rather than migrate to areas where the work is needed, which can add to labor shortages.
Growers on the call said the result is that they cannot find enough workers to get through harvest season without significant loss, or additional costs to pay for overtime work.
 Farmers: With labor shortages, crops can’t be harvested

Brandon Raso, a blueberry farmer in New Jersey, said he needs about 600-700 laborers to harvest his 650 acres of blueberries. This past season, he was only able to hire around 200 workers, which led an estimated 2.5 million pounds of blueberries falling to the ground before they could be harvested.
The result of these shortages, according to Raso, is a “huge exodus in multi-generational farms” and farms that have to downsize as a result of mounting costs and labor shortages.
Brandon Batten, a tobacco and row crop farmer in North Carolina, said when labor isn’t there, the “quality goes down, yields go down, and costs continue to go up” because the work still has to be done.
Trump to send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers to offset ag losses

Growers on the call noted the climbing costs of the H-2A visa program, which grants temporary visas for agricultural workers. According to data compiled by the National Council of Agricultural Employees, the average national hourly wage for H-2A employees increased from slightly more than $11 in 2011, to more than $18 in 2025, though the rate is different in each state.
In October, the U.S. Department of Labor issued an interim final rule to modify the methodology that determines the hourly wages under the program. Growers on the call said the new rule has helped lower labor costs, but Batten said he and other producers are “cautiously optimistic” on the long-term effects.
Tate said improvements to the temporary visa program help, but won’t be enough to make the U.S. competitive with foreign food producers who have consistently cheaper labor.

The specialty crop farmers also said they have noticed behavioral changes in immigrant labor populations due to immigration policies and enforcement from the Trump administration.
Tate said enforcement, protests and concerns about safety has led to some “culture change” in her region.
“That’s really sad, because we should really be valuing the people who are harvesting our crops and taking care of our food and getting it to us,” Tate said. “They shouldn’t be scared to be in their own communities.”

(Photo: Getty Images)Tennessee lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are calling for new marijuana laws following President Donald Trump’s executive order to loosen cannabis restrictions.
Democratic Sen. London Lamar of Memphis and Republican Rep. Jeremy Faison of Cosby in East Tennessee both said they believe the state needs reform after the president ordered the reclassification of marijuana to Schedule III from Schedule I on the Federal Drug Administration’s list of controlled substances, an indication it has medicinal value but still could be abused. 
Tennessee is one of 10 states that restricts medicinal and recreational marijuana while 22 other states have legalized some form of recreational use.
Democratic Sen. London Lamar of Memphis said Tennessee lawmakers should take note of the federal move and pass new laws for medical use, decriminalization or legalization.
“Our marijuana laws are stuck in the dark ages – overly punitive, out of step with our neighbors and holding our state back,” Lamar, chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus, said in a statement.

The state should support medical research of cannabis for treatment of patients who would choose it for pain medication over dangerous opioids, she said.
Lamar added that the state also should stop wasting money incarcerating people for marijuana violations and divert those funds to roads, schools and healthcare. 
Republican Rep. Jeremy Faison, who previously pushed passage of medical marijuana laws, said the federal government never had a “sound justification for a naturally occurring plant” to be classified as a Schedule I drug. That made it comparable to heroin, LSD and Ecstasy. 
Nor did the federal government have a “solid basis to dictate” cannabis regulations to states, Faison said, adding the change brings a “safer, more practical” approach.
“I truly hope that this fosters medical research that either debunks what many sick Americans have testified to or provides the evidence and foundation showing that cannabis is safer than opioids and other man-altered substances,” said Faison, chairman of the House Republican Caucus.
But while the federal change is drawing bipartisan backing for new laws in Tennessee, Lt. Gov. Randy McNally said he has “no interest” in changing how the state schedules marijuana. 










I truly hope that this fosters medical research that either debunks what many sick Americans have testified to or provides the evidence and foundation showing that cannabis is safer than opioids and other man-altered substances.


– Rep. Jeremy Faison, House Republican Caucus Chair


McNally, an Oak Ridge Republican, pointed out that Schedule III drugs remain tightly regulated and can be dispensed only by a pharmacist at a doctor’s direction, usually for short-term use. He added that recommended dosages would have to be established and new rules set up for dispensing medical cannabis. 
“While the federal change does allow easier study and testing of the drug, I have no interest in changing how we schedule marijuana in Tennessee. In my mind it remains a dangerous drug with little demonstrated medicinal efficacy,” said McNally, who is also speaker of the Senate. 
Tennessee lawmakers who sought to pass medical marijuana laws previously ran into opposition from McNally, who said he couldn’t support a change because of the federal government’s Schedule I classification of cannabis.

(Photo by Ryan Murphy/Getty Images)On Dec. 3, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security officially launched an immigration operation in New Orleans. It follows President Donald Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric broadly painting immigrants as “criminals” and in other dehumanizing ways.
Gov.Jeff Landry also requested the Pentagon support his deployment of the state National Guard in Louisiana to target people he claims are “criminal.” Yet New Orleans Police Department data show major reported incidents of violence are down in 2025 compared with 2024.
Similar federal deployments in Memphis, Tennessee; Los Angeles; Chicago; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Washington, D.C., have resulted in major abuses of Black and brown people. Residents report harassment by federal law enforcement. Border Patrol agents are openly stating they stop people based on how they look. Federal officers have turned their weapons on activists and journalists documenting government abuse. Immigration authorities have arrested U.S. citizens, often through the use of violence.
In Jefferson Parish, families are keeping their kids home for fear of immigration raids at schools.
New Orleans officials must step up to protect their residents from similar abuse.
Black and brown communities make up more than 50% of the city’s population. And while New Orleans’ immigrant communities are smaller than some, they are vibrant and critical to the city’s fabric, having contributed significantly to the city and country’s economy, history and culture.
After Hurricane Katrina, immigrants were crucial to the rebuilding effort. Deploying the National Guard to New Orleans recalls for many residents its time in the city after the hurricane, when the guard’s ability to assist was hampered by bureaucratic failure and resulted in more harm than good.
And now, today’s abusive federal and state actions stand to irreparably damage not only our immigrant communities but the whole city, creating more fear and undermining safety for all New Orleanians and its visitors.
New Orleans has become safer because of community involvement and investment in programs such as youth services, approaches that actually work. In contrast, local coordination with federal immigration enforcement can undermine safety, discourage domestic violence survivors from seeking assistance and even incentivize employers to exploit immigrant workers.
Given all this, it is troubling that New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick has not been clear about her department’s commitment to protect residents and visitors from potential federal abuses. Although she has claimed her officers will not participate in civil deportation operations that are beyond the scope of their duties, she has said they will cooperate with federal agents, which in other cities has resulted in abuses.
All this will divert money from helping New Orleans residents, despite the city’s $160 million budget crisis and city officials halting overtime pay for NOPD, firefighters and emergency medical service employees.
In Memphis, recent local cooperation with federal law enforcement has led to continuing use of pretextual stops that can be discriminatory, as well as intimidation and harassment of residents.
In Illinois, state officers and federal agents used violence against peaceful protestors and arrested journalists. Local police appeared to single out and violently arrest religious leaders.
Kirkpatrick has implied NOPD may similarly assist federal agents in response to dissent when they claim it poses a safety threat. Research from 2020 has shown that protesters participating in racial justice demonstrations were met with an escalated police presence and more likely to face arrests and police violence than other protesters.
Concerns are especially heightened in New Orleans, where a federal court recently ended a 12-year consent decree that provided court oversight of NOPD activity after the U.S. Department of Justice found in 2011 that the department engaged in excessive use of force, unconstitutional stops and arrests, and discriminatory policing.
Kirkpatrick and New Orleans officials must do more to protect all residents from federal abuse. NOPD should fully enforce city laws and protect people’s rights. The mayor and city council should more vigorously defend and speak out against the federal attack on the city. Elsewhere, in Minneapolis the police chief recently required officers to intervene in federal agents’ excessive use of force. In Chicago the mayor issued executive orders that protect residents by prohibiting the use of city property for immigration enforcement purposes. These actions should serve as a model for New Orleans.
State government will not make this easy. In June, Louisiana passed a dangerous law, Act 399, to criminalize “obstruction” of federal immigration enforcement, punishable by “hard labor.” Act 399’s author stated that one purpose of the bill was to force assistance with federal immigration officers. It has already been challenged in court.
Regardless, city leaders have a duty to protect their residents from federal abuses that have occurred in other cities. Like the local groups stepping up and providing resources for impacted residents, New Orleans officials must use every tool at their disposal to protect our community.

At the request of Justice, state lawmakers set aside around $23 million in 2021 for the facility. Federal Veterans’ Affairs funds were supposed to pay for the rest of the project. 
Construction was expected to be completed by 2025.
Now, the site remains empty. Nothing has been built due to missing federal funds from the VA.
Justice, a Republican now serving in the U.S. Senate, is frustrated by the situation, his spokesperson told West Virginia Watch. 
“The issue has been raised with the VA,” Will O’Grady, communications director for Justice, said Dec. 17. “It’s not going away until we get a firm answer.”
The facility was supposed to house 90 to 120 veterans in four separate communities on-site. It would include a library, chapel, physical therapy room and a unit dedicated specifically to veterans battling dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

Then-Gov. Jim Justice attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the Charles Calvin Rogers Veterans Nursing Facility in Beckley, West Virginia, on Oct. 23, 2023. 

The project was initially expected to cost $44 million. 

“ … Although earmarked as a Priority 1 project within the VA’s State Home Construction Grant Program, the federal money hasn’t been released,” Randy Coleman, Deputy Cabinet Secretary for the West Virginia Department of Veterans Assistance, said in an email. 
Coleman said there were “a high number”  of Tier 1 projects also awaiting federal funding.  
“The VA hasn’t given us — or any other state, I am told — an indication of when funding might be disbursed,” he said.

So far, $3.2 million has been spent designing the nursing home, state Department of Veterans Assistance Secretary Ryan Kennedy told lawmakers in February. 
In 2023, Justice ceremoniously signed architectural and engineering contracts with SFCS Architects and Thrasher Engineering to oversee the architectural and engineering work for the Beckley facility. The companies didn’t return inquires about the project.
Daniel Hall, a Raleigh County commissioner, served in the state Legislature while Beckley-area lawmakers worked to bring a VA nursing home to Southern West Virginia.
“I’m surprised that the feds haven’t stepped up to do their part. We’re supplying our match, and why are they not doing theirs?” he asked.

Beckley lawmakers asked for VA nursing home more than a decade ago 
More than a decade ago, veterans told lawmakers that a Beckley nursing home was needed. In the aging state, West Virginia’s only VA nursing home is in Clarksburg. 
“I know there’s a lot of [veterans] who worked on this have since passed on,” Hall said. “Maybe their work won’t be in vain.”
In 2014, state senators passed a bill mandating the construction of the facility. The veterans’ nursing home would sit adjacent to Jackie Withrow Hospital. 
“The Legislature finds that nearly 200,000 veterans in this state have distinguished themselves with the highest level of participation per capita of any state in the wars fought by this nation,” the legislation said. “ … An aging veterans’ population which suffers from wartime disabilities and illnesses are, or will be, in need of skilled nursing care.” 
Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin signed the bill into law, but it didn’t come with any funding. Years passed without any movement on the project. 
Then, Justice made it a passion project and, with the Legislature’s support in 2021, he earmarked millions in the budget bill that would serve as a match for federal grant dollars to build the facility. 
“We just thought for sure it was going to happen. Obviously, it wasn’t.” Hall said.
And money from a 2016 bill that generated taxes on certain high-powered fireworks was also supposed to help pay for the Beckley VA nursing home.
O’Grady said Justice would continue looking to the holdup on needed federal funding. 
Justice, while governor, said in 2023 the new nursing facility would “mean the world to our veterans and their families who have needed this facility in Southern West Virginia for a long time.”
The hospital will be named in honor of a Vietnam Veteran and Congressional Medal of Honor recipient Charles Calvin Rogers, who died in 1990. 
President Richard Nixon awarded Rogers, a Fayette County native, the Medal of Honor in 1970, making him the highest ranking African American servicemember to receive the honor.

While no one could have predicted the COVID crisis in her first term that absorbed a great deal of her and her team’s energy and bandwidth, a silent but looming issue back in 2019 that had the potential to disrupt our state, nation and the world that did not seem to be a front burner issue was Artificial Intelligence or AI. 
As I wrote then, “AI promises to rock our world like the sonic boom it is: artificial intelligence or AI. Scientists predict that human-designed AI algorithms can learn human behavior, perhaps getting to know a person better than they might know themselves.”
It did not appear then that anyone in state government was addressing how AI might impact our state and government going forward. I questioned exactly what the state was doing to prepare for its ramifications, or who was thinking about how these changes would impact Michigan and how we can harness AI’s benefits while protecting citizens from its risks?

I strongly encouraged Gov. Whitmer to take the lead on the imminent technological reality that will arrive with AI — equal parts “opportunity” and “threat” to us all.  Now, Michigan and every other state will be challenged by the Trump administration as the President has recently signed an executive order that aims to override state artificial intelligence laws.
The governor went on to establish an “AI Core Team” focused on creating strategies for responsible AI use within state government and a guideline, Michigan’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy, AI with Purpose: Empowering People Through Intelligent Technology.  This has provided a solid foundation for moving Michigan forward. 
So, as we are about to enter the governor’s last year in office and as she prepares to look at a potential presidential run, how did Gov. Whitmer stack up in preparing our state and people for this technological wonder/wrecking ball?
Michigan as a leader in AI and tech
The governor can take a bow for positioning Michigan for the AI revolution by attracting major tech investments (like the controversial OpenAI’s Stargate near Saline or Project Flex in Lyon Township that sucks lots of energy and water), focusing on attracting high-skill, high-paying tech jobs, providing new career paths for Michiganders and positioning 
She can also take a curtsy for boosting the state’s overall economy, creating pathways for young people and skilled workers to stay in Michigan to fill these tech jobs of the future and working to secure our democracy by securing fair and secure elections and protecting them against deepfakes and misinformation.
Earlier this year, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a law that eliminates the state’s 6% sales and use taxes on the equipment for businesses that spend at least $250 million to build or expand data centers. The law also extended data center tax exemptions for enterprise data centers on brownfield or former power plants through 2065. Since then, at least 10 data centers have been proposed across the state.
However, citizen protests continue even as the governor touts her success and the fears that these facilities demand large amounts of energy to operate and large amounts of water to cool the machinery, with environmental and consumer advocacy watchdogs warning these facilities can herald skyrocketing energy rates while harming drinking water access in nearby communities. 
Democratic state Sens. Rosemary Bayer (D-West Bloomfield), Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township) and Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) have put forth legislation to address concerns of the facilities’ water and energy usage. 
Republicans too are tiptoeing around these projects as well, leaving many to wonder if the foundation of these AI data centers are being built on a shaky political foundation.
The politics of Gov. Whitmer wrapping her arms around the mega data centers is puzzling as it is rubbing two longtime allies, grassroots activists groups working class and environmental activists, the wrong way. These constituents and activists have historically been in her corner. The whispers of big dollar PAC money is in the air where once again the wealthy and politically connected will get the gold mine and the citizens of Michigan will get the shaft.
As a former Michigan state superintendent of schools that offered letter grades for our then-school accreditation system, I offer an incomplete or a generous C+ grade in fully preparing Michiganders for this disruptive future.

Preparing for the future that’s here now
There is much work that remains to be done to integrate AI into our existing K-12 standards so that it covers foundational principles, ethical implications, and societal impacts (not to mention assuring more of our children receive the quality education they need and deserve to be prepared for their future and not our past). 
This mirrors the failure of the state to be prepared to implement online learning as described in my 2020 opinion piece, COVID-19 has closed schools. We’re not ready for online learning, when we should have been during COVID. 
We have not invested enough in local communities, libraries, and nonprofit and community organizations to help them adjust to this coming change.  Further, proper oversight is needed as AI systems have been shown to perpetuate bias in hiring decisions, expose sensitive citizen data through security breaches, infringe on intellectual property rights, and undermine the fundamental principle of fair treatment that Michigan citizens should expect from our government.
We still need greater focus on issues that will be impacted by AI in Michigan, including but not limited to: regulatory affairs, privacy, workforce retraining and the social supports for retraining employees, education, strengthen consumer protections, coordination with philanthropic organizations to provide grants to community based non-profits to allow them to keep pace with the AI revolution
While there is great fear of looming mass job losses due to AI, the reality and challenge is more complex. Jobs are not simply disappearing, but rather transforming and new kinds of jobs particularly in higher-skilled occupations are appearing. 
The larger question is are our educational institutions prepared to adapt to this new reality. The article, Teenagers are prepared for the jobs of 25 years ago– and schools are missing the AI revolution, points out that the future paradox is clear, young people are expected to adapt to AI systems while also offering the human qualities that machines cannot. 
Teens must be data-savvy and emotionally intelligent, be digitally fluent and genuinely collaborative all within the four walls of a school and classroom and a 6-hour school day. 
The governor can use her final State of the State address (usually held in late January) and her final state budget proposal (usually introduced in early February) to lay out her vision to tap AI to fuel Michigan’s future. 
She could ask AI to develop a work plan to help Michiganders get ready to prosper in a hyper-competitive, disruptive, technologically driven global economy where ideas and jobs can and do move around the world effortlessly.   
Greater effort is clearly needed to maximize AI’s benefit for all Michiganders. The governor can use her final year to truly prepare our government and people for this disruptive and challenging future.

Rents have risen faster than incomes, pushing rental units out of reach of many modest income tenants. And while interest rates have begun to come down, higher rates in recent years and climbing home prices have pushed  homeownership out of reach for many Americans.    
The NC Housing Coalition’s 2025 housing needs assessment showed that 28% of the state’s households — 1.1 million — are cost-burdened by rent or mortgages. Families that spend more than 30% of income on housing costs are considered cost-burdened.
The housing affordability crisis in this state is most acute among renters, with 48% considered cost-burdened, the coalition found. Meanwhile, 19% of homeowners have trouble affording their homes.
The coalition determined that a $22.28 hourly wage or an annual income of $46,340 is needed to afford a fair market rent of $1,158 a month in North Carolina. 
High housing costs can have dire consequences for families unable to pay them. In North Carolina, 11,394 families faced foreclosures and 194,526 faced an eviction in 2025, the coalition reported. The Eviction Lab has linked rising rents and evictions to premature death because cost-burdened families prioritize paying rent over spending on health and well-being. 
A housing gap
A month into 2025, the NC Chamber Foundation, NC REALTORS and the N.C. Homebuilders Association released a comprehensive statewide report showing that North Carolina faces a five-year housing inventory gap of more than 765,000 units.
According to the report, titled the 2024 Housing Supply GAP Analysis: State of North Carolina, there’s a projected gap of 442,118 for-sale units and 322,360 rental units across the state over the next five years.

“Addressing North Carolina’s significant housing supply gap is more than just meeting immediate demand; it’s a critical investment in our state’s future,” NC Chamber Foundation President Meredith Archie said in a statement accompanying the report.
The report advised addressing the gaps through some combinations of new construction, housing repairs and weatherization and financial assistance to address “severe housing affordability issues.” Those strategies could generate $489 billion in economic activity and create nearly 2.2 million jobs, the report said.
In October, Jenny Schuetz, an affordable housing expert at Houston-based Arnold Ventures, told state housing advocates, developers and policymakers at a conference in Raleigh that the nation must build its way out of the current housing crisis.  
Jenny Schuetz (Photo: NC Housing Coalition)
“We haven’t been building enough homes to keep up with demand created by population growth and job growth for more than 15 years now,” Schuetz said. “Going back to the great financial crisis, we just stopped building housing altogether for about four or five years. It took a long time for industry to start digging itself out of a hole.”
Estimates of the national housing shortage range widely. A Zillow analysis of Census data found the nation has a housing shortage of 4.7 million. The National Low Income Housing Coalition reports a shortage of 7 million affordable rental homes for extremely low-income individuals.
The state housing crisis grabbed the attention of North Carolina lawmakers during the legislative session. 
A controversial bill that Rep. Jeff Zenger, a Forsyth County Republican and developer, said would make it easier for developers to build affordable housing stalled in the House. 
House Bill 765 would have restricted local enforcement of land-use rules not authorized by state law. Critics argued the bill would weaken local government control and undermine community planning. 
Zenger and other supporters said the bill would remove red tape, which would make it easier for developers to build more housing.   
More people experience homelessness

Homelessness in North Carolina increased 19% from 2023 to 2024, according to the 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report. The report features data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Annual Point in Time Count.
The report found that homelessness in the nation reached an all-time high, with roughly 771,480 Americans experiencing homelessness on a given night in January 2024.  
According to HUD data, there were 11,626 people in North Carolina experiencing homelessness during the annual count. Homelessness among families with children, chronically homeless individuals and unaccompanied youth all saw significant increases.
An 11% decrease in homelessness among veterans in the state stood out among otherwise grim data. The HUD count found 688 veterans experiencing homelessness in 2024 compared to 777 in 2023. North Carolina’s reduction in veterans’s homelessness outpaced the nation, which saw an 8% reduction.
As NC Newsline reported in February, the number of veterans experiencing homelessness has declined 55% percent since HUD began collecting data in 2009.
The reduction in veteran homelessness is  “probably one of the most significant public policy wins that we’ve had in the homelessness world,” said Ann Oliva, the CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works to prevent and end homelessness.

Shawn Liu, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Homeless Programs, told NC Newsline that the strategy to reduce homelessness for veterans is a simple one: provide housing and do it as quickly as possible. It’s a “housing first” approach to provide permanent housing and support services to people experiencing homelessness that’s supported by many advocacy groups for people experiencing homelessness.
“No veteran should experience homelessness in the country that they swore to defend, period, end of story,” Liu said. 
Just months into his second presidency, President Donald Trump signaled that his administration is moving away from the housing first strategy that Liu and other advocates believe has helped reduce homelessness among veterans. The administration plans to cut funding for long-term permanent housing and redirect those funds toward transitional housing that requires recipients to work and  to accept mandatory addiction or mental illness treatment.

At a recent fundraising event, Latonya Agard, executive director for the North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness, cited the coalition’s success at turning back Republican-sponsored bills in the General Assembly that she and other advocates believe would be harmful to people experiencing homelessness.
One example, Agard said, was a controversial House Bill 781 to ban public camping. Agard said the bill would have unfairly criminalized people experiencing homelessness “for simply not having a home.” 
A bill co-sponsor, Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph), said leaders of local municipalities came to him looking for guidance in handling homelessness. Biggs insisted the bill doesn’t criminalize homelessness.
“It addresses the use of public property for camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness,” Biggs said in April. “It does create clear guidance. We need guidance.”
Another bill, House Bill 437, Agard noted, would have made homeless shelters operators responsible if drugs were sold or delivered outside of their facilities. It passed the state House, but stalled in the state Senate.
Rep. Heather Rhyne  (R-Lincoln) (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Rep. Heather Rhyne (R-Lincoln) said the law is needed because the state’s homeless population is under regular threat from dealers seeking to sell them controlled substances.
“By making homeless shelters drug-free zones, we reduce the opportunity for these criminal elements to further victimize the homeless while holding operators of these facilities accountable,” said Rhyne, a bill cosponsor. 
But Agard said it could have forced shelters to close. Both bills stalled in the Senate.
Tenants’ rights
Across the state, tenants rose up to fight against high rents and unsafe and unsanitary living conditions.

In Durham, the city council unanimously approved an amendment to the city’s housing code that prohibits landlords from collecting rent if a housing unit is found to be “imminently dangerous” to tenants’ health and safety.
Under the ordinance, which is modeled after one in Charlotte, landlords can be charged with a misdemeanor if they collect rent on housing that has immediately dangerous conditions such as rotted or damaged structural supports, unsafe wiring, unsafe roofs, no potable water supply or no operating heating equipment in cold months, among other violations.
“The police aren’t gonna go and arrest them [landlords], but if that ends up going to court, the tenant has a very good chance of winning and being able to get not only a portion of their rent back, but all their rent back if the tenant takes the landlord to court,” C.R. Clark, an organizer with the Triangle Tenant Union, said in an interview.
The Triangle Apartment Association pushed back against the ordinance.
“While we understand there may exist some circumstances in which residents experience less than habitable conditions, it is our belief that those circumstances do not involve the greater majority of housing providers,” the association said in a letter to the council.
Brianda Barrera, a Durham renter and Triangle Tenant Union leader, called the ordinance a step toward “justice, health and dignity.” 
“It’s for our elderly neighbors living with black mold who are afraid to complain for fear of retaliation from landlords who only view them as an obstacle to profits,” Barrera said. It’s for our undocumented neighbors enduring severe pest infestations because their landlord counts on their silence.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_3346-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)On Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025, Idaho’s senior senator doubled down on the brutal cuts to health care contained in the 2025 tax plan, introducing another plan that goes farther in fracturing health care in Idaho. Instead of finding his better angel, he has assumed the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge. And just in time for Christmas!
In the classic Dickens holiday story, Ebeneezer Scrooge was a miser who came to his senses and found joy in giving. Scrooge provided his exceedingly poor worker and family with a holiday meal and health care for an ailing child – Tiny Tim. Sen. Crapo decided to retreat to his cold room, run the numbers, and make the decision to cut off thousands of Idahoans from access to health care.
He proposes moving Idahoans into Affordable Care Act plans that cover few health care costs and that have huge deductibles – often $7,500 per person – before they cover anything. He proposes $1,000 contribution to a health savings account which cannot be used to pay for escalating insurance premiums. It is barely a Band-Aid over the gaping family health care cost gap that Idaho families will face.
Here is the reality of health care costs Americans are facing :[i]



The average cost of a 3-day hospital stay is about $30,000.






A lifesaving, commonly prescribed cancer treatment costs $12,000 a month.






Fixing a broken leg costs up to $7,500.






Medical costs for the average diabetic are over $1,000 monthly.






An MRI costs $1,325 on average. A chest CT runs over $700.



He advocates ending the Affordable Care Act provision that stops insurance companies from using “pre-existing conditions” as a reason to deny health coverage. To distract us from the real damage the bill proposed to do to thousands of Idaho families, this bill added a little culture war spice. It targeted certain groups for special punishment and denial of care, by cutting the Medicaid of states that use their own funds to offer care to these target populations.
I assume this provision was designed to anger and assure the support of those motivated by the current anti-immigrant, anti-LBGTQ+ fever. But it would deprive states of the right to use their own funds as they allocate them, and it would punish a wider set of Medicaid recipients in those states. This is an ironic provision in a bill with ‘freedom” in its title.
The topping on this bitter holiday treat was the language about the “freedom to choose,” as though gaining access to health care through Your Health Idaho represented a loss of freedom. What freedom is there in being unable to afford the essential health care that your family needs? How is $1,000 in an Health Savings Account an example of freedom when the costs of care are like those reflected above? The freedom to sink into medical debt? These narratives about freedom are as insulting as the idea of $1,000 in a Health Savings Account.
Faced with an opportunity to address the financial and health care access needs of thousands of his own Idaho constituents, Sen. Crapo instead decided to put his finger on the scale and try to make it worse.
The senator’s bill did not make it to the 60-vote threshold to pass the Senate floor. Meanwhile, he also played a role in killing the bill that would have extended the Affordable Care Act tax credits.
But the U.S. House is attempting to do better. As things currently stand, the House will take up a three-year extension to the expanded ACA tax credits in January. It has the votes now to pass, a slim beam of light that might prevent Idahoans from falling off this health care cost and access cliff.
Moderate US House Republicans join Dems to force vote on extension of health care subsidies

Sen. Crapo will have one more chance to take action to serve Idahoans in need of relief from escalating health costs when the three-year extension arrives again in the Senate. His words and actions so far are not encouraging. The Crapo plan that failed in the Senate seems to indicate that if you need health care and cannot keep pace with the escalating costs, Sen. Crapo wants to give you a financial Band-Aid and send you on your way to face crippling costs and less access to health care.
In my last editorial, I passed on making moral judgements about Sen. Crapo’s motivations. But years and years of Sunday School have filled my memory with King James Version scripture,  and this phrase comes to mind during this Christmas season:  “By their fruits ye shall know them.”
In the end, several ghosts moved Scrooge to make the decision to fund the healthcare that saved Tiny Tim’s life. Let’s hope that the opportunity the U.S. House is presenting Sen. Crapo will move him to take a better path.

A new audit by the Tennessee Comptroller cites a series of lapses in financial oversight and patient care in state-operated nursing homes for veterans.
A 13-member Tennessee State Veterans’ Homes Board oversees five long-term care facilities to “provide support and care for honorably discharged veterans who served in the United States armed forces.” About 500 Tennessee veterans live in the homes. A sixth facility with space for 126 is under construction.
The facilities are funded by Veterans Affairs  benefits, Medicare, TennCare and private insurance. They have been operating in the red since at least 2020, the audit said. The homes get no state funding.
Between 2020 and 2024, the board reported $57 million in revenues, but operating losses each year ranged from nearly $2 million to $8 million. A 2024 accounting error overstated the home’s cash balance by $7 million, the audit found.
Collectively these financial losses and lapses “raise concerns about whether the board can sustain long-term operations without additional external support, a major shift in financial strategies, or a combination of both,” auditors concluded.
While the veterans’ homes board reported its finances had improved during the four-year time period covered by the audit, the Comptroller’s report noted that improvement was almost entirely attributable to one-time federal grants and donations tied to construction of new homes, not better financial management. 
Ed Harris, executive director of the veterans homes, told lawmakers Tuesday that the program’s finances had suffered setbacks for several reasons, including that federal payments were delayed for patients admitted to a newly constructed facility in Cleveland, Tenn., he said. And, like other nursing facilities, the veterans homes are still feeling the lingering impact of the COVID pandemic. 
Since the pandemic, Harris said, “our census dropped dramatically, as it did in all nursing homes. The public lost faith in the nursing home industry, and we were included into that mix, although we performed better than the average nursing homes with that so the biggest takeaway here is that this finding will not be repeated in the next audit.”
The 93-page audit released this month also cited problems with quality of care for veterans in one home.
Federal regulators issued a four-star rating for the Murfreesboro State Veterans Home in 2022 for its quality of care. By January 2025, the facility was downgraded to a one-star rating.  
The Tennessee Health Facilities Commission cited allegations of abuse and quality of care “at an immediate jeopardy level” at the facility. Medicare Care Compare, a federally-operated comparison site, issued an advisory that the home had been cited for abuse. The Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services suspended payments for 11 months, costing the veterans homes $193,000. The payments resumed in June 2024.
The board, in a written response to the audit, noted it is disputing the findings; its formal appeal remains ongoing.
The audit also cited instances in which the veterans homes staff did not receive permission from some of its residents to manage their money and they did not sufficiently oversee veteran’s finances.

Extra revenue and lower expenses for Medicaid services and government agencies have shrunk Rhode Island’s projected fiscal 2027 deficit by more than half, according to new estimates published by the Rhode Island Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday.
Budget crunchers now expect a $101 million deficit now forecast for the fiscal year that starts July 1, versus the $237 million gap projected six months ago.
What changed?
The improved outlook reflects a variety of increases in revenue and decreased expenses. Among them: nearly $54 million in increased tax revenue for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027 combined, based on new estimates adopted at the biannual November Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference. The same weeklong review of the government ledger also cut state expenses for medical and cash assistance programs for low-income residents, along with support for people with disabilities, by more than $56 million. 
This is primarily because of federal budget cuts under H.R. 1 which will kick 33,500 Rhode Islanders off of Medicaid by the end of next year due to stricter eligibility rules, according to estimates from the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS).
Add in an extra $20 million more from fiscal 2025, identified as surplus in audited closing statements completed in October, and a $10 million drop in expected government spending for fiscal 2026, and the state’s financial future is looking up, even after transferring an extra $4.2 million to the reserve fund.
But, the rosy picture might be fleeting. 
“While the November updates improve the fiscal picture for FY 2027, Rhode Island’s structural budget challenges persist,” the report states. “Economic conditions and federal budget uncertainty present additional risks. Delays in Congressional appropriations, recent federal shutdown activity, and continued review of federal grant programs heighten the possibility of further impacts on State revenues and expenditures.”
Indeed, overhauls to federal programs like Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Affordable Care Act, alongside bigger business tax breaks, are expected to have major financial impacts for Rhode Island through the end of the decade, according to a series of state reports published in October. 
Many of the changes don’t take effect for several years. However, the wallet strain starts now.
But state budget analysts predict spending “tens of millions” in new administrative, personnel, and IT costs starting in fiscal 2027 as they work to comply with new federal mandates to reduce SNAP error rate. 
Meanwhile, year-end expiration of federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are expected to reduce participation in the state health exchange by 13,000 people, in turn shrinking the revenue used to support HealthSource RI’s operations.
At the same time, the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner called for multiyear hikes to Medicaid reimbursement rates for medical and social service providers to account for inflation, which could add “significant increases” for the state through fiscal 2028, according to the budget report.
Together, federal changes and state Medicaid rates could grow the projected fiscal 2027 deficit by $55 million to $70 million, according to budget analysts.
“These items will be incorporated into the deficit forecast through the upcoming budget process as more information becomes available,” the report states.
The financial forecast will form the basis for Gov. Dan McKee’s proposed fiscal 2027 budget, expected to be unveiled publicly in mid-January. Lawmakers will then spend the next six months reshaping the tax and spending plan before a final version is approved in time for July 1.
“While the reduced deficit projection is a positive development, the challenge remains the same: Providing relief to Rhode Islanders amid persistent inflation and protecting access to critical healthcare supports despite changes at the federal level,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an emailed response Friday. “The Governor continues to work closely with the Office of Management and Budget to develop a balanced budget that meets these goals.”
Larry Berman and Greg Pare, spokespeople for House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson, respectively, said the revisions don’t affect how legislative leaders will approach the 2026 legislative session.
“The report identifies tens of millions of dollars not yet reflected in the total,” they said in a joint emailed statement Friday. “Rhode Islanders are facing many challenges, some stemming directly from actions at the federal level. State government will be under pressure to address these challenges while also addressing its own ongoing budget shortfalls, some of which are also related to federal legislation.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Kevin Nance)Chris Sudduth sold drugs to support a long addiction to heroin and methamphetamine, netting himself a criminal record.
While that resume would put off many employers, it eminently qualifies Sudduth for the job he’s done the last three years — work that he loves and worries he will soon lose because of a change in Kentucky law.
Sudduth is a peer support specialist, earning $15-$18 an hour to help other people who are trying to overcome substance abuse. The support role is recognized as vital in recovery. 
On Jan. 1, Kentucky’s licensing standards will change, making thousands of peer support specialists, including Sudduth, no longer eligible to work in many treatment and recovery settings or be paid through Medicaid, the federal-state program that is the financial backbone of many recovery providers.
As of Dec. 20, only 50 peer support specialists had met the new licensing requirements compared with 16,883 who are certified under the previous standards.
“I’m terrified. I’ve invested all this time getting certifications that because of the new law I’m not going to be able to use,” said Sudduth, 43, of Georgetown. “All of this is just surreal. I’m afraid I’m going to lose my apartment, everything I’ve worked for these three years. Even more I’m afraid I’m going to lose my sobriety over it.”
Displacing and defunding much of Kentucky’s peer support workforce appears to be an unintended consequence of House Bill 505, which the legislature approved almost unanimously and Gov. Andy Beshear signed on April 5, 2024. The new law takes effect Jan. 1. On Friday, state officials received a formal request to suspend its enforcement from a lawyer representing a Lexington nonprofit, Grin Grant Inc. (GGI), that trains peer support specialists. 
In a letter addressed to state Health and Family Services Secretary Steven Stack and Karyn Hascal, chair of the Kentucky Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors, attorney Frank Miller Jr. says the board has yet to enact regulations as required by the new law.  “The absence of rules for compliance with a new law (effective in 13 days) works an undue burden on GGI and thousands of others,” Miller wrote.
 “We would like to see the problems get fixed,” Miller told the Lantern, asserting that the relevant state agencies have the leeway to pause enforcement.

‘A very vulnerable population’
Stack’s cabinet has previously pointed to a conflict between the new law and Kentucky Medicaid reimbursement rules.  
The law has a provision permitting peer support specialists to keep working and be reimbursed under a temporary credential as they earn the new designation of registered alcohol and drug peer support specialist.
However, Kentucky Medicaid does not pay for services provided by someone with a temporary credential, Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS), told the Lantern last week. 
It’s unclear how or why almost 20 months elapsed without the state’s Medicaid payment schedule being reconciled with the new state law.
More than 650 peer support workers have qualified for the new temporary status and more than 300 have applied for it. 
But Medicaid will not be paying them. 
“Kentucky Medicaid is bound by law, and starting January 1st, cannot pay for services provided by someone with only the temporary credential established under HB 505,” Steele said in an email. “The requirements for temporary providers established under HB 505 conflict with Medicaid’s established provider requirements for reimbursement. Kentucky Medicaid will continue to pay for peer support services provided by individuals who have completed the full registration process with the Kentucky Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors.”
Steele also said, “Team Kentucky values the vital role that peer support specialists play in helping those dealing with addiction across the commonwealth.”   
Peer support employers are looking for workarounds and cutting back. Residential treatment centers and outpatient behavioral health service providers are not allowed to employ peer support workers who lack a new credential after Jan. 1, according to a FAQ document issued by the state in October.
Sudduth said he’s already feeling it. “My hours have been cut almost every place I work — 40 hours to 20 hours — because they don’t know how to navigate the new laws.”
Mary Helen Shashy
Peer support duties range from providing transportation to medical appointments and court dates to teaching problem-solving skills to individuals and groups. Peer support specialists share their first-hand experiences of addiction and hope with clients who are new to treatment and recovery. 
Mary Helen Shashy, founder of the Lexington nonprofit that is seeking a suspension of the new law, says there is a “clear and repeatedly studied  connection between sobriety and employment.” 
“Thousands of people are losing their jobs Jan. 1 — a very vulnerable population,” Shashy said.
Sarah Vaughn
Sarah Vaughn, a consultant who works with Shashy and recovery providers, said, “You’re going to have a very vulnerable population becoming unemployed, and these are people who might relapse back into using. And, at the same time, people who are earlier in recovery are going to lose the benefits they get from a peer who is supporting them.” 
Response to suspected Medicaid abuse
Rep. Kim Moser, chair of the House Health Services Committee and sponsor of the new law, said she has talked with the Department of Medicaid Services about allowing a grace period for recovery peer support specialists to continue to work and be paid through Medicaid while earning the newly required credential.
Moser, R-Independence, also is working on a bill for the 2026 legislature that she hopes will relieve some of the problems. 
The impetus for revamping peer support was rising suspicions that some providers were misusing peer support to overbill Medicaid and that this perceived abuse could result in a decision to cut off Medicaid funding for peer support altogether, said Alaina Sweasy, a lobbyist and consultant on substance use treatment. Her company, Lane13 Consulting, provides peer support training.

In 2024, she was representing some members of the Kentucky Association of Independent Recovery Organizations (KAIROS), a coalition of for-profit providers, and working with Moser on HB 505. She said she’s no longer working with KAIROS.
Sweasy recently told the Lantern the legislation has not worked out as expected. “No, no, absolutely, not at all.” 
‘A lot more overhaul’ needed
Even amid the awareness that peer support was under scrutiny, providers billed Medicaid for peer support at a skyrocketing pace. Kentucky Medicaid payments for psychoeducation rose from $35 million in 2023 to $166 million in 2024. Psychoeducation supports clinical care by informing clients and their families about their conditions and treatment options and by teaching coping and communications skills.
Sudduth, the peer support specialist, said the swelling volume “diluted” peer support. “For a while they were giving certificates to whoever,” said Sudduth, who is studying for a degree in social work from the University of the Cumberlands. “In theory sharpening the standards is a good idea but the way the state is doing it needs a lot more overhaul.” 
By late 2024, Kentucky Medicaid announced that peer support would no longer be reimbursed for providing psychoeducation, beginning Jan. 1,  2025.
Since then, Medicaid spending on psychoeducation dipped by 68% this year to $53 million, according to information presented to lawmakers last week by the attorney general’s Office of Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Control.
Meanwhile, the private insurers who process and pay Medicaid claims in Kentucky have tightened reimbursements to recovery and other behavioral health providers, putting an additional pinch on peer support.
Federal prosecutors recently obtained a guilty plea from a peer support specialist in Lexington who worked for a sober living home that investigators say schemed to bill Medicare and Medicaid $26.7 million for unnecessary urine tests. The owner of the sober living home has pleaded guilty to soliciting kickbacks from companies that performed the tests. The indictment says the company also billed Medicaid for peer support services that did not meet state requirements or were not performed at all.
Kentucky’s largest treatment provider, the for-profit Addiction Recovery Care, came under FBI investigation more than a year ago for possible health care fraud. 
A board for peer support?
Shashy and Sudduth say it’s unfair to punish the lowest-paid recovery workers for actions taken by those at the top. “Go after the bad actors,” Sudduth  said. “Don’t go after the industry as a whole. Most (peer) supports don’t know the first thing about billing, we just put in for the hours we work.”

Aside from  the looming prospect of unemployment for many peer support specialists, people interviewed for this article pointed to what they say are other problems with the new law, including the cost to low-paid peer support workers of new training and supervision and other fees associated with obtaining the credentials, as well as a shortage of board-approved supervisors. Shashy says some peer support specialists are taking employer-issued loans of about $1,800 to try to stay compliant. 
She and others also caution that the new standards are geared to qualifying for a clinical role rather than one of peer support. 
Among those looking for a solution are Rep. Adam Moore, D-Lexington. “I don’t think anyone intended to shut down peer support. HB 505 tried to professionalize the field, but applying clinical licensing rules to a non-clinical role has had clear unintended consequences. Even providers who supported the bill now see the harm,” he said.
The Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors had 478 peer support applications pending last week, some of which require additional documentation from the applicant and some that have not yet come before the board, said a spokesperson for the Public Protection Cabinet.
One of the options being considered by Moser, the lawmaker trying to craft a legislative fix, is creating a separate licensing board for peer support encompassing its full scope, not just recovery, but other aspects of mental health, including gambling disorder, as well.
Jennifer McMinn, vice president of recovery at Volunteers of America (VOA) Mid-States, says a separate board for peer support is a good idea.
VOA employs 14 to 16 peer support specialists in Louisville and Manchester. Two or three of them had completed the requirements to become registered under the new law when McMinn spoke to the Lantern earlier this month. The others had temporary status, meaning they can work but their wages can’t be reimbursed by Medicaid. That puts a financial strain on the nonprofit, but ending peer support is not an option, she said. “It’s a crucial part of treatment.”
‘Their product is hope’
The law will not disrupt peer support for providers that don’t bill Medicaid. That includes Voices of Hope, a recovery community organization that is built on peer support and reaches into about 30 counties from its Lexington base. 
Jimmy Chadwell (Voices of Hope photo)
Of its 70 staff members, 96% are in recovery, said Jimmy Chadwell, the organization’s president, who also stressed that having a job helps people stay in recovery.
Grants fund Voices of Hope, including federal money from the Kentucky Overdose Response Effort (KORE), and settlements with drug companies through the Kentucky Opioid Abatement Commission.
Voices of Hope calls its peer support team “recovery coaches” and pays them a little over $17 an hour. Chadwell says they are “integral to recovery.” 
“I’ve heard it described as reaching back into the fire to pull someone out. … Their product is hope.”
While the disruption in peer support funding won’t directly affect his organization, Chadwell worries about its broader effects as Kentucky tries to overcome one of the nation’s deadliest and most pervasive opioid crises.
“I think as a community and a state we have momentum in addressing substance use disorder. Now is not the time to take our foot off the gas. If the statistics show even a slight improvement, now is not the time to let up.”

(Getty Images)Kentucky’s health care system faces serious workforce challenges, yet recent federal and institutional actions threaten to deepen those problems rather than solve them.
The U.S. Department of Education recently proposed removing nursing from its list of “professional degree” programs for purposes of federal student loan limits. As a result, many graduate nursing students — including those pursuing advanced practice and higher education faculty roles — now face lower federal loan caps than students in other health professions.
Lawmakers and nursing organizations have warned that this change could worsen shortages by making advanced nursing education less affordable at a time when demand is already outpacing supply. (See Associated Press reporting on the decision and congressional response.)
Against that backdrop, the University of Kentucky has announced completion of a mandatory review of affiliations with professional and other organizations to identify those that may discriminate on the basis of race. UK is among 45 universities under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. That federal review centered on concerns related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and participation in a nonprofit diversity initiative known as the PhD Project. 
As part of this process, UK has flagged hundreds of organizations for termination or further review. Among them is the Kentucky Nurses Association (KNA), the only full-service nursing professional organization in the commonwealth that is the voice of the nursing workforce.
This is not merely an internal university matter. It is a statewide health issue. 
Partnerships like these are not optional extras — they are essential to training nurses, advancing practice and improving community health.
At a time when Kentucky confronts serious nursing workforce shortages, fragmenting academic and clinical collaborations undermines the stability of our health system. We urge academic leaders to safeguard essential partnerships with professional nursing organizations as part of a shared commitment to the future health of our commonwealth.

Kentucky has more than 93,000 nurses practicing across the state. According to the Kentucky Hospital Association, workforce shortages remain one of the most pressing challenges facing hospitals and health systems, even as patient demand continues to rise. 
Shortages are particularly acute in rural areas and in nursing education, where a lack of faculty limits how many students can be admitted to programs. Reporting has consistently shown that these shortages affect wait times, access to care and worker burnout across the state.
Professional organizations like the Kentucky Nurses Association are not peripheral to addressing these challenges. For nearly 120 years, KNA has partnered with academic institutions, health care systems and policymakers to support nursing education, research and practice. Through the Kentucky Nurses Foundation, significant money has been raised for nursing scholarships and research grants — investments that directly support the workforce pipeline.
The KNA and its members have also played central roles in improving public health outcomes. Nurse leaders associated with KNA helped advance tobacco control policy in a state long burdened by tobacco-related disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, KNA-supported efforts helped expand Louisville’s LouVax initiative into a mobile vaccination program that delivered more than 130,000 vaccines to vulnerable populations.
Academic and clinical leaders today are navigating an extraordinarily complex regulatory environment, and that pressure is real. Compliance with federal law is critical, but so is preserving the partnerships that allow Kentucky to educate nurses, care for patients and respond to public health crises.
As Kentucky’s health care needs grow, the path forward depends on collaboration, not fragmentation. Strong universities do not operate in isolation. They rely on partnerships with professional organizations that help educate students, advance research and connect academic work to real-world impact. 
For nursing in Kentucky, few partnerships are more important than the longstanding relationship between the University of Kentucky and the Kentucky Nurses Association.
To address workforce shortages, improve health outcomes and prepare the next generation of nurses, partnerships like the one between UK and KNA must be protected. Collaboration is not a liability. It is a strength.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hopsital-image-700x467-1.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Photo courtesy of Virginia DBE Transportation)After a U.S. District Court in Kentucky suspended the federal government’s enforcement of race- and gender-based preferences in transportation contracts pending trial, the U.S. Department of Transportation responded by removing women- and minority-owned business set-asides through an interim final rule. This has significantly impacted businesses in Virginia and across the nation.
Amid these regulatory changes, some business owners continue to navigate economic complications and face stigma associated with being women- or minority-owned. 
“Most DBEs (Disadvantaged Business Enterprises) will tell you in a heartbeat: all we need is the opportunity… we’re good at what we do,” said Joanne Payne, a federal lobbyist and president of Women First, an advocacy group representing women-owned small businesses in the highway, transit and airport construction industries. 
“The DBE program isn’t a handout, it’s a hand up — ensuring small business owners, especially women and minorities, get a fair chance to compete and thrive.”
 How the DBE Program came under threat

In 1983, Congress created the Department of Transportation’s DEB Program to help small business formation and growth in the U.S. About 87,000 businesses are registered as DBEs and the program has been reauthorized multiple times, most recently in 2021. It was designed to help small businesses owned by people who have historically faced discrimination — such as minorities and women — by leveling the playing field in contract bidding.
However, the program was challenged in 2023, when two Indiana-based construction contractors —Mid-America Milling Co., LLC and Bagshaw Trucking, Inc.— argued that the DBE program’s race- and gender-based preferences favor certain firms over others, thereby violating equal protection principles under the U.S. Constitution.
The plaintiffs said in their complaint, “the largest, and perhaps oldest affirmative action program in U.S. history … financed the American transportation system … with a series of race and gender preferences they call ‘goals.’ But in effect … these ‘goals’ amount to discriminatory barriers, preventing many construction companies from competing … on an equal footing.” 
To determine whether this was true, the court temporarily blocked the agency from enforcing the race- and gender-based rules governing contracts. 
But the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) took the matter a step further, using the injunction to issue a ruling on Oct. 3 to remove the presumptions from the program requiring business owners to prove in a personal statement or narrative that they are socially and economically disadvantaged on an individual basis, rather than relying on automatic presumptions for women and minority ownership.
This policy shift has also abruptly terminated some existing contracts and paused new opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses.
Babur Mian, a board member of Virginia’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Transportation Association, said the group is deeply concerned about the situation — and about the Virginia Department of Transportation’s limited response to it. 
In an October 3 memo obtained by the Mercury, the state transportation agency only provided procedural guidance and notice of changes for DBEs in the commonwealth and made it clear that the memo was not legal advice. 

“As a result, DBE goals on all federally eligible VDOT contracts are set to zero, DBE participation will not be counted, and certain DBE reporting forms are no longer required until the re-evaluation process is complete,” wrote Stephen Brich, commissioner of Highways at VDOT. “The notice is informational only and advises businesses to seek legal counsel for guidance specific to their circumstances.

Mian said the association was hoping for a more sympathetic response.
“We are at a loss to explain VDOT’s reaction to our members,” Mian said. “Our members have had a strong relationship with VDOT over the years, delivering quality work on projects all over Virginia, and yet, now, they seem to be forced to fend for themselves.”
Compared to other agencies in North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington, D.C., Mian said transportation agencies have “actively engaged” with their respective DBE communities, provided direction that existing DBE-related contracts should not be terminated, and recommended using state-administered small and minority business programs to support their DBE businesses.  
As questions linger, Mian described Virginia’s response as “silent.”
VDOT did not immediately respond to questions about whether it has done anything else to help businesses affected by changes to the DBE program, specifically regarding the program’s recertification process, which will require business owners to prove their own disadvantage rather than relying on race or gender. 
“Unless the recertification process is handled expeditiously and unless VDOT actively engages with the Virginia DBE community, our members and their employees will suffer,” Mian said. “We know that some of our members may not be able to hang on for long. Many will soon have no choice but to consider reducing staff or to take other drastic measures just to survive what should be a temporary lull in activity while recertification occurs and new goals are confirmed.” 
 Defining the stigma against women, minority-owned businesses

Whether it’s prejudiced assumptions or questions about their qualifications, business owners have told the Mercury that they have faced, in some form or fashion, the stigma that comes with owning a minority- or women-owned business.
Some said clients have questioned their qualifications and ownership, while others said they have been pigeonholed and experienced limits imposed on business opportunities. Still others said they’ve faced extra scrutiny and mistrust about their financial reliability or competence.
Catherine Tojaga, owner and president of an HVAC construction company in Illinois, said this stigma diminishes owners’ achievements. She said she has been repeatedly dismissed as a legitimate business owner because of her gender. 
“And I think to myself, well, who wants to work with a fraud? If you think I’m misrepresenting myself, then you must think I’m a fraud, because I just told you I own the company… and that’s the problem I’m really having right now,” Tojaga said. “This has to do with gender, and yet I’m supposed to pretend it doesn’t.”
With women and minority business owners missing out on contract awards, Tojaga said it seems similar to when larger contractors were prioritized over smaller ones during the COVID pandemic. She said some larger companies were awarded contracts in which they were paid based on time spent and materials used, rather than a fixed price, without bidding, while smaller contractors were neglected.
There have been few widely documented construction cases when larger companies were awarded contracts for transportation projects. However, outside of transportation, there have been cases of rapid bid processes on the federal level, including a private donor to President Donald Trump and design work on detention centers in Kansas that raised concerns over fairness and competitive access.
Amid changes to the DBE program, Tojaga said the federal government also made funding cuts that affected organizations, including Chicago Women In Trades, which trains women in the trades industry, exacerbating the labor shortage in the construction field. This came after the Trump administration made significant changes to the Women’s Bureau this year, which was framed as a way to ensure women can earn a living wage and work safely.
All grants were terminated, except for the Chicago Women in Trades grant, which was protected by a court order. The Fostering Access, Rights, and Equity (FARE) grant program supporting women’s workplace rights was also canceled.
“These cuts will likely force organizations nationwide to lay off staff and cancel imminent training programs, and destabilize the Women’s Bureau,” the Chicago Women In Trades said in a May 15 statement. 
While conditions remain challenging, women and minority business owners must now recertify to remain in the DBE program by submitting personal narratives — a process owners say heightens the stigma because it requires them to demonstrate their disadvantage.
Tojaga said she completed the narrative for her recertification, but “what really sucked about writing it, which I did, is that all I do is sound like a whiny person that nobody wants to do business with.”
 DBE program has been ‘a lifeline’ for some while others don’t see its advantages

Business owners said the DBE program has served as a critical infrastructure for economic and social mobility. The program has offset historic disadvantages and helped develop the next generation of laborers.
“The DBE program has been a lifeline for small, minority owned businesses in the commonwealth by providing these companies with the opportunity to compete for contracts, hire people, and grow their businesses,” Mian said.
But some entrepreneurs said the program and recent changes have not been as helpful.  Michael Brown, an operator of a trucking business in Arkansas,  said he would like to expand his business to create more jobs, but has had trouble attracting clients since joining the DBE program two years ago. He thinks it may be due to the stigma associated with being a minority-owned business.

Matters have only worsened for Brown’s business since the program’s rule changes. He said he has had to reach out to  large contractors, who receive the awards, to see if he can work with them — the opposite of his goals to achieve economic independence through his trucking business, support his family and serve as a positive role model. 
He also wants to help disadvantaged individuals by sharing opportunities, advocating for better DBE programs and eventually by starting a nonprofit. 
“Ever since I’ve been a DBE, it seems like my income has dropped tremendously, but I still keep hope, you know, that this program will eventually help me in some kind of aspect,” Brown said.
Hoping for some changes to the DBE program, Brown said he’s held off on closing his truck company because of the lack of business.
“(It’s) really depressing,” Brown said. “That’s why I don’t have real confidence in the DBE program, because I feel like they put more pressure on us … than on the big (companies) to help the smaller (companies) like mine.”
 Complications, legal battle

The lack of a final court ruling on the DBE program leaves women- and minority-owned businesses in limbo, blocking their ability to recover or plan effectively nationwide.
In the meantime, business leaders are supporting DBEs by providing resources and urging federal lawmakers to reauthorize the program while preparing for the trial hearing.
“I tell people, ‘Congress can help us,’” Payne, the Women first president, said. “Congress has the authority to authorize this program, and they also have the authority to tell DOT how to administer this program, and that’s what we’re focusing on.”
Advocates, including DBEs of America, which represents almost 50,000 certified DBEs nationwide, are also hosting informational meetings, helping their members with recertification and urging Congress to get involved, including reauthorizing the program by Sept. 30, 2026, when it is set to expire and set off a gap in funding and legal authority.
The groups all stress that reauthorizing the DBE program ensures continued support and fair access for small, minority- and women-owned businesses in federal transportation projects. Its continuation would also prevent monopolies, foster economic opportunity and ensure that public dollars benefit diverse communities nationwide, advocates say.
Stephanie Duncan, director and president of DBEs for America, said failure to reauthorize the program could put business owners in jeopardy.
“It’s just going to shut out small businesses … become a monopoly and the prices are going to go up because there won’t be any competition,” Duncan said. “Small businesses are the backbone of this country, and the dollars that we put into a big construction project stay in our community.”
DOT issued an update to its interim final rule in December, after members of the House of Representatives —including leaders from the House Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Small Business, and Democratic Reps. Bobby Scott and Jennifer McClellan, both from Virginia — signed a letter cautioning the agency to “tread carefully” with the department’s plans for the program. 
“Changes to the implementation of the DBE program threaten the survival of more than 50,000 existing small businesses across every state and affect the future path for small business participation in federally assisted transportation contracts,” the lawmakers’ letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated. “An approach to implementation of the Department’s Interim Final Rule (IFR) that seeks to punish minority- and women-owned small businesses will add chaos, cost, and delay to transportation projects and will have ripple effects throughout the construction industry.”
The agency then announced several changes to its ruling, noting that state agencies can still support small businesses, but only without regard to race or sex.
While the rules are being reviewed, DBE goals are put on hold — which means there are currently no DBE targets, no tracking of DBE participation, and no penalties for missing past goals. 
Businesses executing existing contracts and special cases, such as ferries, must use zero DBE goals for now, and any old race- or sex-based requirements no longer apply. DOT will update its paperwork to match the new rules.
A jury trial to determine the final rule is scheduled to begin on Jan. 26 at 10 a.m.

(Photo courtesy Jeremy Horne/The Historical Marker Database)The Battle of Great Bridge on December 9, 1775 was an important step on the road to American independence, as rebellious Virginia soldiers defeated a detachment loyal to royal governor Lord Dunmore. The role of William “Billy” Flora, a free Black man, in this battle is now widely acknowledged, yet this recognition of his contribution to the revolutionary cause is a relatively recent achievement.
Fifty years ago, as Americans celebrated the bicentennial of this battle, Flora received little attention, thus ignoring the extensive documentation available from Black historians. This transformation in public knowledge confirms the importance of bringing diverse, inclusive and equitable perspectives to commemorations of America’s semiquincentennial in 2026.
William “Billy” Flora was born in 1755 to free Black parents in Portsmouth, Virginia. At age 20, Flora joined a militia mobilized to challenge the royal forces of Lord Dunmore. 
On December 9, 1775, Flora and other Virginians stood on the Great Bridge over the Elizabeth River facing a larger force of oncoming British soldiers. Flora fired eight times at the approaching soldiers, marching six abreast, before withdrawing back to the waiting Patriot forces. The Virginian marksmen fired at the soldiers, causing extensive casualties, forcing the British troops to retreat, and securing the first battlefield victory for revolutionary forces in Virginia.
This version of the Battle of Great Bridge is easily accessible now through many resources, including VA 250, the American Battlefield trust, Dictionary of Virginia Biography, and two historical markers in Portsmouth and Chesapeake. Yet this recognition of Flora is relatively new in historical and popular understanding.
Fifty years ago, as newspapers celebrated the bicentennial of the Battle of Great Bridge, Flora received little recognition in the mainstream press. A lengthy article in the Richmond Times- Dispatch on December 7, 1975 included a detailed account of the battle, yet does not identify Flora’s role or acknowledge that a free Black man fought for Virginia. 
Further reinforcing this erasure of Flora’s role, a widely circulated illustration shows a white man in the act of firing a musket, again ignoring the fact that a free Black man performed heroically at a critical point in this battle. 
By contrast, Flora’s contributions have long been known in Black newspapers and in the publications of prominent Black historians. 
The Portsmouth Star published an article in 1934 praising “Old Billy Flora” for his “heroic service,” with an account of his firing eight shots at British forces. Luther Porter Jackson’s 1944 book, “Virginia Negro Soldiers and Seaman in the Revolutionary War,” describes the “unusual bravery” demonstrated by Flora at the Battle of Great Bridge, which is confirmed by statements from fellow soldiers and officers. 
Jackson’s biographical sketch was based on an 1853 article which drew upon first-hand accounts from the revolutionary era that credited “Billy Flora, a colored man” as the “last sentinel” to keep firing at the British, thus confirming Flora’s “good conduct during the Revolutionary War.”
Whereas Flora’s role in the revolution was visible in Black newspapers, the only mention of Black soldiers in most mainstream Bicentennial era accounts is the statement that Dunmore’s forces included runaway slaves. An article in the Fredericksburg Free Lance -Star on December 9, 1975 linked “loyalist and escaped slaves” without any recognition that enslaved people shared the same desire for freedom motivating the Patriot forces.
Flora’s subsequent life further enriches our understanding of this early stage of American history. 
Flora fought as a free Black man for three years with revolutionary forces, earning distinction for his service. After the war, he became a prominent Portsmouth businessman. In 1807, when rumors spread of an attack by a British naval ship, Flora volunteered to fight, using the same musket deployed in 1775 at the Battle of Great Bridge. Flora died in 1820, and his remains were buried in an unmarked grave. 
Appreciating Flora’s role in the revolutionary era leads to a more nuanced understanding of American history as we look ahead to the semiquincentennial observations in 2026. The final paragraph of Jackson’s history addressed to Black men “going to war now just as Flora went 167 years ago” provides us with a way to think about the meaning of freedom, equality, and democracy as we recognize the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Great Bridge:
“They must remember also that the democracy for which they fight, though frequently violated in our country is a principle of life and a system of government worth fighting for. Without the basic democratic character of our American society and American government, Flora would never have become free nor would he have become the man of influence and power that he was.”

Federal prosecutors have alleged Chesapeake Sheriff David Rosado of abusing his authority to coerce employees into supporting his 2025 campaign.
The U.S. Office of Special Counsel filed a complaint last week with the Merit Systems Protection Board, alleging Rosado violated the federal Hatch Act by using his official position to influence an election and by pressuring sheriff’s office employees to contribute money, time and labor to his campaign.
This is the first time in at least a decade the federal ethics watchdog has brought this kind of disciplinary case against a state or local official, according to the Washington Post. The Hatch Act applies to federal employees, as well as state and local employees who are federally funded.
Federal prosecutors alleged Rosado repeatedly relied on sheriff’s office employees to advance his campaign, including assigning supervisors fundraising ticket quotas based on rank and expecting employees to personally cover the cost of unsold tickets.
The complaint also alleges employees were directed to staff campaign fundraisers, install campaign signs across the city, canvass neighborhoods and work polling locations — sometimes using personal leave during the workday.
The allegations stem from Rosado’s unsuccessful bid to retain his seat. He lost the Republican primary in June 2025 and later ran as a write-in candidate in the general election after leaving the Republican Party. He lost to the party’s nominee, Wallace Chadwick.
The Post also says the complaint could result in Rosado’s removal, but that’s unlikely as he has less than two weeks left in office. Chadwick will take over on Jan. 1.
WHRO contacted the Chesapeake Sheriff’s Office for comment but did not receive a response.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)In a bipartisan move, U.S. Reps. Bobby Scott, D-Newport News, Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, Jennifer Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia,  together introduced a bill to reauthorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Chesapeake Bay Office. Maryland’s Rep. Sarah Elfreth, D-Annapolis, also joined the effort to maintain support for the agency.
The Bay office conducts critical research on climate resilience, sustainable fisheries, habitat restoration and other information key to helping the Bay and related industries flourish. 
The bill also authorizes an education and training program for the first time, which will help Virginia meet the goals of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. Research shows Virginia previously fell behind on the educational aspect of the last agreement.
“By allowing NOAA to coordinate with community stakeholders, monitor restoration activities, and authorizing the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Education and Training program, the WATERS Act will help protect the Chesapeake Bay’s health for generations to come,” Wittman said in a statement.
The Chesapeake Bay Office, which is based in Annapolis, manages the interpretive buoy system that collects real-time data on water quality, weather, and fish migrations. This data is then used when planning restoration efforts and can help assist in maritime safety.
When Congress authorizes an agency, it essentially reaffirms federal lawmakers’ interest in its work and shows support for continuing its operations. The reauthorization effort comes as the administration of President Donald Trump has pledged to roll back funding for NOAA, including a proposal to cut 28% of NOAA’s operating budget, or $1.33 billion, and slash 75% to the agency’s climate science work.
The last time the Chesapeake Bay Office was reauthorized was in the early 2000’s. The move to sustain the office highlights the Virginia congressional delegation’s desire to see research into oyster habitats, weather patterns, and ways to assist the fishing industry continue.
“By reauthorizing NOAA’s Chesapeake Bay Office, supporting science-based restoration, and expanding education and workforce training throughout the watershed, this bill strengthens long term stewardship of the Bay,” Kiggans said.
The states that have waterways that feed into the Chesapeake Bay recently signed an updated agreement that puts each on the path towards reducing pollution, rebuilding habitats and increasing education around the Bay’s environment. NOAA’s data helps states shape related policy and resiliency efforts.
The bill will be considered when Congress returns to work after the holidays.

But Republican state officials say they will use the map in the meantime.
Missouri courts now appear likely to weigh in.
“If we need to continue to litigate to enforce our constitutional rights, we will,” said Richard von Glahn, a progressive activist who leads People Not Politicians, which is leading the campaign opposing the gerrymandered map.
As some states engage in an extraordinary redraw of congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, state courts may decide the fate of the new maps. President Donald Trump has pushed Republican state lawmakers to gerrymander their states’ congressional maps, prompting Democratic state lawmakers to respond in kind.
Nationwide, state judges are poised to play a pivotal role in adjudicating legal challenges to the maps, which have been drafted to maximize partisan advantage for either Republicans or Democrats, depending on the state. Maps are typically only redrawn once a decade following the census.
While some state courts have long heard map-related lawsuits, the U.S. Supreme Court has all but taken federal courts out of the business of reviewing redrawn maps this year. On Dec. 4, a majority of the court allowed Texas’ new map, which seeks to secure five more U.S. House seats for Republicans, to proceed. A federal lawsuit against California’s new gerrymandered map, drawn to favor Democrats, hasn’t reached the high court.
The midterm ballot measure battles have already begun

The U.S. Supreme Court’s brief, unsigned majority decision voiced concern about inserting federal courts into an “active primary campaign,” though Texas’s primary election will occur in March. Critics of the court’s decision have said it effectively forecloses federal challenges to this year’s gerrymanders. The justices could also issue a decision next year that makes it more difficult to challenge maps as racially discriminatory.
State courts are taking center stage after gerrymandering opponents have spent decades encouraging them to play a more active role in policing maps that had been drawn for partisan advantage. Those efforts accelerated after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2019 limited the power of federal courts to block such maps.
“Basically, every one of the 50 states has something in its constitution that could be used to constrain partisan gerrymandering,” said Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project.
State constitutions, which are interpreted by state supreme courts, typically have language that echoes the right to freedom of speech and association found in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Wang said. They also include a right to equal protection under the law, similar to the 14th Amendment.
Some state constitutions guarantee free and fair elections, language that doesn’t appear in the U.S. Constitution. Thirty states have some form of a constitutional requirement for free elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
At least 10 state supreme courts have found that state courts can decide cases involving allegations of partisan gerrymandering, according to a 2024 review by the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
So far this year, California, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Utah have adopted new congressional maps. New maps also appear possible in Florida, Maryland and Virginia. A handful of other states — Alabama, Louisiana, New York and North Dakota — may have to change their maps depending on the outcome of court cases.
Some of those new or potential maps could face legal obstacles. Florida, New York and Ohio all have state supreme courts that have previously found problems with partisan gerrymanders. Maryland Democrats have so far not moved forward with a gerrymander, in part because of fears of an adverse decision from the state Supreme Court.
Four state supreme courts — including in Missouri — have determined that they cannot review partisan gerrymandering claims, though state courts may still consider challenges on other grounds, such as whether the districts are compact or contiguous.










Basically, every one of the 50 states has something in its constitution that could be used to constrain partisan gerrymandering.


– Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project


In Missouri’s case, courts could also clear the way for a referendum vote over the new map, which is intended to force out U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who has represented Kansas City in Congress for the past two decades. Republicans currently hold six of the state’s eight congressional districts.
The map already faces a bevy of lawsuits, most notably over whether state officials must count some 103,000 referendum signatures gathered before the governor signed the map into law; at least 106,000 signatures are needed to send the map to voters.
Opponents of the new map have also filed lawsuits asserting the Missouri Constitution prevents redistricting without new census data and that an area of Kansas City was simultaneously placed into two separate congressional districts.
Missouri Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ decision this month (relying on an opinion from Missouri Republican Attorney General Catherine Hanaway) to implement the new congressional map, despite a submitted referendum petition, is expected to become the latest legal flashpoint. Opponents of the map argue it is now paused under state law.
Hoskins spokesperson Rachael Dunn said in a statement to Stateline that local election officials have until late July to verify referendum signatures — months after candidate filing ends March 31 and days before the Aug. 4 primary election. At that point, blocking the new map would be all but impossible, even if map opponents have gathered enough signatures to force a vote.
“Once signatures are all verified, the Secretary will certify the referendum based on constitutionality and verification,” Dunn wrote.
Hanaway’s office didn’t respond to questions.
Breaking out of lockstep
As federal courts limit their review of gerrymandering because of U.S. Supreme Court decisions, some state supreme courts are reluctant to wade into the issue because of a practice called “lockstepping.”
State supreme courts often interpret their state constitutions in line with — or in lockstep with — how the U.S. Supreme Court views similar language in the U.S. Constitution. Because the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to limit partisan gerrymandering, some state supreme courts have also declined to impose limits.
As Democrats fight ‘fire with fire,’ gerrymandering opponents seek a path forward

Gerrymandering opponents have used a variety of arguments over the years to try to prod state supreme courts out of lockstep. They have emphasized differences in wording between state constitutions and the federal one, and provisions in state constitutions — such as the free elections requirement — not found in the U.S. Constitution.
Sometimes these arguments work — and sometimes they don’t. The North Carolina Supreme Court in 2022 ruled against partisan gerrymandering. But after two Republicans were elected as justices that fall, the court reversed itself months later.
“Across the country, we have seen advocates turn to state supreme courts, and state courts in general, for state constitutional arguments against gerrymandering or voter suppression more broadly. And it’s been met with mixed success,” said Sharon Brett, a University of Kansas associate professor of law. In 2022 as litigation director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, she unsuccessfully argued a case before the state’s high court challenging Kansas’ congressional map.
In states where legislatures draw congressional maps, some lawmakers argue that state constitutions shouldn’t be interpreted to curb legislative authority over mapmaking. Court-imposed limits amount to violations of the traditional separation of powers, they say, with the judiciary overstepping its authority to interfere in politics.
“We expect them to be nonpartisan. We expect them to be unbiased. We expect them to be fair. We expect them to read the constitution and to protect or at least respect the separation of powers,” said Utah Republican state Rep. Casey Snider, speaking of Utah courts during a floor speech earlier this month.
In Utah, state courts waded through a yearslong legal battle over whether state lawmakers must adopt a non-gerrymandered map. After the Republican-controlled legislature repealed and replaced an independent redistricting process, the Utah Supreme Court last year ruled lawmakers had violated the state constitution.
A Utah district court judge in November then adopted a congressional map that will likely lead next year to the election of a Democrat. The state’s four congressional seats are currently all held by Republicans.
“What we would like is them to redistrict based on population — fairly,” Katharine Biele, president of the League of Women Voters of Utah, said of state lawmakers.
One urban crossroad, 3 new districts: Kansas City braces for Missouri gerrymander

Republican Gov. Spencer Cox called the Utah legislature into special session earlier in December to respond to the judge’s decision. Lawmakers pushed back candidate filing deadlines in hopes that an appeal to the Utah Supreme Court will result in a decision overturning the judge’s adopted map.
They also passed a resolution condemning the judiciary.
Constitutional concerns
As the Indiana legislature weighed a gerrymandered map to boost Republicans this month, some lawmakers were reluctant to constrain state courts. Democrats currently hold two of the state’s nine congressional districts.
The GOP-controlled Indiana Senate voted down the map in a major setback to Trump’s national redistricting push. The vote came after a floor debate where opponents raised concerns about limiting court involvement; the legislation included a provision sending any legal challenge directly to the Indiana Supreme Court, bypassing a jury trial.
Indiana Republican state Sen. Greg Walker said the measure violated the state constitution, which guarantees an “inviolate” right to a jury trial in all civil cases. “In legal terms, ‘inviolate’ has the implication of being sacred, as opposed to being just a piece of the law,” Walker said on the floor.
State Sen. Mike Gaskill, a Republican who sponsored the map, said during a speech that Indiana residents would benefit from a quick process to resolve legal challenges. “Both sides, in any case, want them to be settled quickly so that they don’t cause chaos and interruptions in the elections process,” he said.
If the map had passed, opponents would have likely attacked the measure using a provision of the Indiana Constitution that requires “free and equal” elections.

(Photo by halbergman/Getty Images)For years, the housing shortage has dominated New Hampshire residents’ concerns, rising to the top in poll after poll. On Wednesday, the Manchester Board of Mayor and Aldermen decided to respond.
The body approved a sweeping overhaul of the city’s zoning code, completing a yearslong effort to encourage more housing. 
The new ordinances, which take effect in March, are intended to assist in the creation of “missing middle” housing — development that uses existing buildings to increase density. And they come after a 2024 University of New Hampshire survey sent to every Manchester household found general support: A majority of respondents said housing is too expensive and scarce in the city, and a majority said they would favor duplexes and townhouses over large developments. 
Mayor Jay Ruais lauded the changes, calling them the “most important steps we can take to secure Manchester’s future.” 
But while interest in housing remains high, Manchester’s action appears relatively rare. Only a handful of New Hampshire cities and towns made meaningful, pro-housing changes to their zoning codes in the past year, researchers at St. Anselm College have found.
Municipalities collectively made 59 “liberalizing” changes to their zoning codes from June 1, 2024, to May 31, 2025, according to a tally presented by St. Anselm’s Initiative for Housing Policy and Practice this month. Fifteen of those changes were “significant,” the researchers found. The numbers came from an analysis of the New Hampshire Zoning Atlas, an effort by St. Anselm to catalog zoning codes across the state and display which areas have the most and least restrictive regulations around housing development. 
The changes that did happen in the last year were mostly pro-housing. The 59 liberalizing changes outnumbered the 13 “restrictive” changes to zoning made in the past year, the researchers noted. 
But the tally exposed a bigger reality: Even as housing prices remain high and shortages persist, most New Hampshire cities and towns have avoided taking actions that could address that shortage by allowing more building in their own borders, housing advocates say.
“The number of liberalizing changes was similar to what we’ve seen in prior years. The number of restrictive changes was significantly lower,” said Jason Sorens, a researcher at the American Institute for Economic Research, addressing attendees of St. Anselm’s Housing We Need conference on Dec. 12. 
“However, of those restrictive changes, a high proportion of them were significant restrictive changes,” he said. 
Zoning hurdles remain
For those municipalities interested in change, many have looked to accessory dwelling units — the small apartments often built by dividing or renovating existing housing into multiple units. After New Hampshire passed a law in 2016 to require municipalities to allow ADUs, many of them passed restrictive zoning to slow down ADU construction, such as minimum parking requirements that were hard to meet. 
Now, some are reconsidering. Fourteen of the 59 pro-housing zoning changes in the last year related to ADU construction, according to Sorens. 
Still, Sorens says New Hampshire housing development continues to be constrained by zoning barriers — including for ADUs.
ADUs are technically allowed by right across the state, but about 50% of the land requires at least two parking spaces, the St. Anselm research reveals. 
Other types of housing are also constrained. Multi-family developments of five units or more are allowed on only 46.5% of the state’s buildable land, and the vast majority require public hearings for approval, the data shows.

And housing advocates say many zoning ordinances discourage starter homes because they bar housing on small lots. Just 13% of the state’s buildable land is zoned to allow houses built on less than 1 acre of land and with less than 200 feet of frontage on the street, according to the Initiative for Housing Policy and Practice. It also found that of the total land where manufactured homes may be built, just 40% is likely to be affordable. The rest requires such large minimum lot sizes per manufactured home that it is likely cost prohibitive.
“It’s really still a minority of the land area where there are good opportunities for using manufactured housing as an affordable housing typology,” Sorens said. 
Speaking to the Housing We Need conference, Mike Kingsella, the CEO of Up for Growth, a national housing advocacy organization, said New Hampshire is far behind other states when it comes to positive zoning.  
The state is 25,000 housing units short of what is needed for a healthy market, a gap equivalent to 4% of the state’s overall housing units, Kingsella said, which he said is one the highest under-production rates in the country. 
Speakers at the conference highlighted some communities that have made meaningful strides. Antrim passed a zoning code that creates “connected villages” — compact, walkable neighborhoods that allow up to 12 homes in close proximity, each around 900 square feet, noted Noah Hodgetts, the principal planner of municipal and regional assistance at the Department of Business and Economic Affairs. 
Lebanon is in the process of developing “pattern zoning,” an approach that ties zoning districts to pre-approved housing design to allow easy construction that follows a similar aesthetic. And Newmarket has rolled out “form-based” zoning, in which new buildings are approved based on their physical characteristics rather than their use. In theory, that allows housing to be built alongside businesses and other entities. 
“It really focuses on regulating the character and physical form of different building types, rather than just the use,” Hodgetts said. 
Legislation still rolling out
As cities and towns inch toward change, state lawmakers have taken more forceful measures. Legislators passed a slate of laws this year that would prohibit municipalities from implementing certain zoning ordinances that restrict housing, an effort championed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
The state now has laws limiting the number of parking spaces municipalities can require for new housing developments; expanding the number of accessory dwelling units that may be built by right; and requiring municipalities to allow housing in most commercial zones.  
But some of those changes won’t take effect for months, and even when they do, housing advocates say it will take time for development to increase in response.
Meanwhile, some lawmakers have argued the zoning overhaul laws passed this year have gone too far and have trampled on local control. Pro-housing advocates say they are preparing for that backlash, and a slew of bills to roll back the new zoning laws. 
One form of legislative action supporters of housing are less confident in is state investment toward affordable housing and programs to incentivize local zoning changes. Some of those programs were capped or cut in the 2025 budget process, and will likely not get support in 2026, noted Jack Ruderman, the energy and legislative affairs adviser at New Hampshire Housing. 
“Hope is not a strategy, but I do hope that we will be surprised and there will be some funding for some housing programs,” Ruderman said. 
To Kingsella the lack of sufficient development in New Hampshire is due not to bad intentions, but to a system in which decisions are scattered among local communities and the incentives for more housing are not aligned. 
Up for Growth has championed a federal bill this year, the ROAD to Housing Act, that would offer federal funds such as Community Development Block Grants to incentivize local housing production and zoning reform. That bipartisan bill passed the Senate Banking Committee but has since faced resistance; earlier this month, the House removed it from the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, rebuffing the Senate. 
“New Hampshire scarcity is not an abstraction,” Kingsella said. “It is a predictable output of a system built without alignment or a mandate to deliver.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/manchester-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

He takes in the Slater Memorial Park holiday display. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Growing up, the holidays weren’t about the latest gadgets or the biggest gift under the tree. For my family, it was about us; being together, sharing stories, and creating a sense of belonging. My parents worked hard and did what they could. Even if the season wasn’t driven with tons of gifts, they gave boundless love. That love was enough to fill the room, enough to make the season feel divinely abundant.
As I’ve gotten older, I’ve started to notice how that meaning has shifted. Now, the holidays often feel like a race: shopping, planning, trying to meet the expectations we set for ourselves. Instead of being about connection, it sometimes becomes a checklist of stress and worry. We chase after the perfect gift, the perfect moment, the perfect family gathering — and in the process, we forget what it was all about.
I see it in myself, in friends, and in loved ones. The gift of love gets replaced by the gift of exhaustion. We give so much outward, so much to others, that we forget to give something vital to ourselves. Grace. Patience. Compassion.
Grace, for me, is kindness in the moment, especially when it’s hard to offer. It’s choosing to be gentle with myself even when I feel like I’ve dropped the ball. It’s letting go of the pressure to be perfect and remembering that I’m still worthy of love, even when I’m tired, messy, or grieving. Grace doesn’t ask me to earn it. It just invites me to receive it.
Practicing grace during this season isn’t about ignoring what’s hard or pretending everything’s fine. It’s about acknowledging the pain, the loss, and the overwhelm; and still choosing to be gentle with ourselves. Research studies remind us that gratitude can boost happiness, but it’s not just about counting blessings. It’s about accepting what’s real. Sometimes, that means giving ourselves permission to grieve what’s gone or what we wish was different.










I see it in myself, in friends, and in loved ones. The gift of love gets replaced by the gift of exhaustion. 


And that’s OK. It’s OK to feel tired. It’s OK to feel sad or disconnected. Giving ourselves grace means recognizing those feelings, honoring them, and not judging ourselves for having them. As grief expert and bestselling author David Kessler writes, the holidays can bring up grief, and giving ourselves permission to feel that grief is part of healing.
When I need to reconnect with grace, I go somewhere quiet. Sometimes it’s a walk through the woods, where the cold air reminds me to breathe. Sometimes it’s sitting in my car with music that speaks to my soul, or dancing slowly in an empty studio with no one watching. I find grace in silence, in movement, in prayer, and in letting myself feel without rushing to fix it. These moments don’t solve everything, but they soften the edges. They remind me I’m allowed to be human.
This year, I want to remember that the greatest gift I can give myself is kindness; patience with my imperfect self, space for my feelings, and the understanding that I am enough just as I am. I don’t need to make everything perfect. I don’t need to do everything. Sometimes, the most powerful act is simply to slow down and be present.
So, I’m choosing to give myself the gift of grace. To focus less on the stress and more on the love already present around me. To remember that the true spirit of the holidays isn’t in what I buy or do, but in how I treat myself; and others, with patience and kindness.
Because, in the end, the greatest gift I can offer is to be gentle with myself. To accept where I am. To give myself the same love I so freely give to others. That’s how I’ll survive and thrive this season.
And that, I believe, is the real magic.

Thomas Barwick/Getty ImagesIn politics, as in war, victory often depends on your choice of battlefield.
Here in Georgia, U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff has chosen health care and the economy as the grounds on which he will defend his Senate seat in next year’s election. His Republican opponents have chosen loyalty to Donald Trump and, I guess, “wokeness.”
Good luck with that. 
So far, an estimated 190,000 Georgians have been forced to drop their health insurance for next year because Republicans in Washington refused to extend subsidies to make the insurance affordable. That’s just the first wave. Overall, experts predict more than 400,000 Georgians will be forced to go uninsured under the ACA next year because they just can’t afford a doubling or tripling of their premiums.
(That’s not counting the hundreds of thousands of additional Georgians who will lose coverage due to cutbacks in Medicaid approved by Republicans in Congress, including two GOP congressmen who are running to oppose Ossoff.)
The political impact of all that will likely be significant, but as Ossoff points out, so will the impact on human beings.
“I heard just a few days ago from one of my constituents, a single mother with four children who gets her insurance through the Affordable Care Act exchange, and her medication costs $20,000 per dose,” he said on the Senate floor earlier this month. “She needs four doses per year. Her premiums are about to go up by 500%.
“I heard from another constituent a few days ago, a woman in her early 60s who waits tables for a living, who’s fighting breast cancer. She needs chemo monthly. Her premiums are now going to be $500 per month. She can’t afford it. She’s going to have to give up her insurance in the middle of chemotherapy while she’s fighting breast cancer.
“What are people supposed to do when they lose health insurance in the middle of a cancer battle?”
Theoretically, you could make an argument that a country with an exploding deficit can’t afford to keep funding Medicaid and ObamaCare subsidies. In the coming campaign, Republicans will no doubt try to do so. But if we, the richest nation in the world with an economy that Trump describes as the best ever, can’t afford to help a working mom and her four kids buy health insurance, if we can’t cover a cancer patient who would die without treatment, then surely we also can’t afford trillion-dollar tax cuts for the very wealthy, right?
Wrong, according to Republicans, because that’s exactly what they’ve done in their “big, beautiful bill,” the legislation that they tout as their crowning achievement of the past year. Budgets reflect priorities, and based on their actions the priority for national Republicans is to further enrich the already rich, while pushing sick Americans onto ice floes and wishing them well.
The political problem for Republicans runs even deeper than that: Because they have never accepted the argument that Americans have a right to health care, they have never shown interest in how that right might best be protected. Trump, for example, has been promising to offer a better, cheaper version of Obamacare since 2015, but in the decade since has failed to produce anything akin to an actual proposal.
And if the GOP can’t accept that health care is now viewed as a right, they have isolated themselves from the American mainstream on a critically important issue. According to a Pew poll released last month, 66% of Americans now agree that health care should be treated as a human right. 
Those Americans don’t agree on how best to do it – roughly half believe that health insurance should be purely a governmental responsibility, while others believe that government and private industry together can best provide coverage – but the political question of whether such coverage should be provided has been settled emphatically.
I don’t want to pretend that Obamacare is perfect, because it’s far from it. Like the rest of our health care delivery system, it’s cobbled together from whatever seemed politically plausible at the time, and in the 15 years since its passage some of its frailties have become obvious. Reform is badly needed.
And if the Republican Party could finally accept that health care is a human right, if it could accept that the debate is no longer whether to provide universal health care but how to provide it most effectively and efficiently, maybe, together, we could get somewhere.  
And the best way to convince them is through the voting booth.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hospitalbed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Groceries cost more. Housing costs and property taxes are up. Health care is harder to afford and access. Too many of our neighbors feel it is a challenge to survive, let alone thrive. It’s easy to blame inflation or say, “That’s just how things are now.” Part of the reason life feels harder is public policy. Decisions made this year in the New Hampshire State House and Washington, D.C., have impacted family budgets, health care, and economic security, and will continue to in 2026 and beyond.
Looking back at 2025, three decisions stand out.
 A tighter state budget means fewer services when families need them.
First, with less money coming in for this current budget, policymakers cut funding across multiple programs.
Imagine a family that asks for their paycheck to be cut, but still has to cover the same bills. Something has to give. That is how policymakers started 2025, entering this year with less state tax revenue due to their own past policy decisions.
Over the last several years, the state cut its two business taxes and repealed the 102-year-old Interest and Dividends Tax, which mainly affected households with significant non-retirement account investment income. Together, these choices reduced state revenue by an estimated $500 million to $800 million during the current budget cycle. While some said cutting business taxes would actually improve revenues, New Hampshire fell behind neighboring Vermont and Maine in business tax revenue growth (our largest state tax source). While Vermont and Maine grew by about 166%, New Hampshire grew only 124%.
Policymakers can use the state budget to invest in public health, education, mental health care, housing, child care, and job training to improve the lives of our residents. But in the 2025, this lagging revenue meant fewer resources were allocated for mental health care, housing supports, and other services families depend on. At the same time, while state taxes have been cut for profitable corporations and wealthy investors, local property taxes continue to increase, driving up costs for our hardworking Granite State neighbors.
For many Granite Staters, the result is simple: higher bills at home and fewer supports from the state when times get tough.
 Federal changes shift costs and add risks to states and families.
Second, just days after New Hampshire passed its state budget, Congress approved a major federal law, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” This law made permanent many of the tax cuts passed in 2017. About two-thirds of those benefits go to the top 20% of earners. But the same law also made changes to assistance programs that could hurt New Hampshire families and strain the state budget.
Limits on a key Medicaid funding tool could soon cost New Hampshire hundreds of millions of dollars each year. That money helps support hospitals and health care access statewide. New paperwork requirements could cause about 20,000 Granite Staters to lose Medicaid, risking coverage for hard-working Granite Staters. Food assistance is also at risk. The food stamp program helps about 76,000 people in New Hampshire afford groceries. Under new rules, the program will cost the state more to run and could penalize people who have trouble meeting new requirements. When people lose health care or food assistance, the impact doesn’t stop with them. Hospitals, local businesses, and communities feel it.
 Rising health insurance costs could push coverage out of reach.
Third, decisions made in Washington this year could make health care coverage much more expensive for many Granite Staters.
Picture a working adult who finally found health insurance they can afford. That coverage may soon cost much more. At the end of 2025, expanded tax credits that help people pay for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are set to expire unless Congress acts. Without those credits, average premiums in New Hampshire could rise by about 60%. A 60-year-old couple earning $85,000 a year could pay 170% more, seeing their premium jump from $602 to $1,624 each month to keep the same coverage. When insurance becomes too expensive, people delay doctor visits, skip prescriptions, or lose coverage altogether. That harms families and puts pressure on hospitals and the broader economy.
 2025’s policy choices could have major impacts on New Hampshire’s affordability in years to come.
These three decisions share a common theme: Life is becoming less affordable and more uncertain for many Granite State families. A lack of state budget investments, major federal changes, and rising health care costs will impact daily life in New Hampshire in 2026 and beyond.
Public policy choices in our national and state capitals shape health care access, core public services, and economic growth that could be made to work for everyone, not just those at the top. Thoughtful, data-driven decisions can help prevent today’s policy choices from becoming tomorrow’s avoidable crises.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/costofliving-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed half a dozen pieces of legislation Friday during a ceremony at the Ohio Statehouse. The slate included five property tax measures as well as a bill known as Avery’s Law meant to prevent dog attacks.
After those signings, DeWine explained he had “reluctantly” signed Ohio Senate Bill 293, which will eliminate the grace period for absentee ballots. He pointed to the U.S. Supreme Court agreeing to hear a case out of Louisiana where the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a similar grace period.
“If it wasn’t for the Supreme Court issue, if it wasn’t for this case,” he said, “not only my inclination, but what I would have done, is I would’ve vetoed this.”
The governor expressed concerns about an adverse ruling landing late next summer, and the potential for different rules governing state and federal races. Ballots must be finalized well ahead of election day, House Speaker Matt Huffman said. Unless lawmakers approved legislation with an emergency clause, they might not have enough time to harmonize state law with the ruling. The problem Huffman said, is an emergency clause requires supermajority support in both chambers.
“Are we going to get immediate agreement or enough agreement among all the members of the House, Republican and Democrat, to pass an emergency legislation?” he asked. “I don’t think so.”
Gov. DeWine weighing whether to eliminate Ohio’s absentee ballot grace period

DeWine said at least voters are now “on notice” about the changes, and despite his misgivings he came down on the side of certainty, “and to avoid what could have been a real mess in leading up to our election.”
The Ohio Voter Rights Coalition wasn’t having it. The group noted, shortly before passage, lawmakers amended the bill to include “several unfunded, unnecessary provisions” related to state voter rolls.
Those changes “will drastically increase the number of provisional ballots, purge eligible voters from the rolls, and place an additional heavy burden on elections officials,” the coalition said.
“Instead of making Ohio’s elections more reliable for eligible voters to freely and fairly participate in our democratic processes,” the group stated, “Ohio’s leaders have decided they would rather continue to punish voters and leave valid ballots uncounted due to delays by the U.S. Postal Service.”

How we got here on property taxes
State lawmakers are increasingly anxious about growing support for a citizen initiative abolishing property taxes. The grassroots organizers collecting signatures argue people are being taxed out of their homes and they’re done waiting for lawmakers to address the problem.
The simplest fixes would be to expand the homestead exemption, which offers a break to low-income senior citizens, or create a ‘circuit breaker,’ which targets relief based on a homeowner’s income. Republican lawmakers have largely rejected that approach, comparing it to writing a check to bail out homeowners.

Property taxes fund several local services, but schools account up the lion’s share of revenue. And so, during the most recent budget cycle, lawmakers wrote in a handful of provisions making it harder for schools to raise funds through voter-approved levies or to carry over money year-to-year.
DeWine vetoed those proposals and promised to set up a working group to develop recommendations. Lawmakers quickly overrode one DeWine’s vetoes but otherwise kept their powder dry. The working group wound up highlighting several proposals already working through the statehouse and DeWine said he’d use its recommendations to guide his decision making.
“I knew that when I put that group together, I wouldn’t love everything if they came out with,” DeWine said at an annual breakfast this month. “But they came out with good recommendations, and so what I’m going to do is look at those recommendations again and compare those with what the legislature has done.”
What the legislature did
Property tax is calculated in mills — like a percentage but calculated out of 1,000 rather than 100. The state constitution guarantees local authorities the right to levy up to 10 mills (or 1%) of property tax. This is known as “inside” millage. Any other property tax levies must be approved by the voters. That’s known as “outside” millage.
Inside millage has always grown with inflation; as a property becomes more valuable it generated more tax. But a 1970s-era piece of legislation limited outside millage by reducing tax rates to keep tax bills steady. So even as a property becomes more valuable it generates the same tax.
But at a certain point, rates can’t drop any further, and outside millage grows with inflation just like inside millage. That point is the 20-mill floor — the state mandated minimum amount of spending on public schools.
How big a difference will Ohio’s property tax proposals make?

Two of the bills Gov. DeWine signed limit the growth of property taxes by capping increases at the rate of inflation in the overall economy. Ohio House Bill 335 does so for inside millage and Ohio House Bill 186 applies those restrictions to outside millage.
Another proposal relates to the 20-mill floor. Under existing law, emergency or substitute levies don’t get counted toward that minimum funding requirement. But Ohio House Bill 129 would include them — creating more room for the 1970s-era reduction factor to bring rates down.
DeWine also signed off on Ohio House Bill 309, which gives county budget commissions the authority to reduce voted levies if they determine the taxes are “unnecessary” or “excessive,” and Ohio House Bill 124, which gives county auditors greater control over property valuations.
“I think what took place today, with the signing of these bills,” DeWine said, “brings about meaningful tax relief and brings about clarity. No longer will people see the spikes that they have seen.”
He described a relative who’s a realtor telling him about people selling their home because of 30-35% spikes in their property taxes. But as for the citizen initiative, he warned it would be “great mistake.”
“We do have a problem,” he acknowledged. “And I think the people who are putting this on the ballot, their solution, I think, is untenable and makes no sense.”

Avery’s Law
The impetus for Avery’s Law was an attack on 11-year-old Avery Russell of Reynoldsburg last June. In an Ohio House committee hearing, she described how two dogs mauled her during a playdate, and how she’d already had five surgeries with another one coming up.
“We are grateful that she’s taken her story to the public, she’s taking her story to the state legislature,” DeWine said. “Because she did that, you’re able to sign this bill today.”
The measure imposes criminal penalties for negligent owners of dangerous or vicious dogs and requires courts to put down an animal that kills or seriously injures a person. It also requires owners of dogs previously determined to be dangerous under state law to obtain at least $100,000 in liability insurance.

The Republican sweep in Ohio’s 2024 election saw Cleveland-area businessman Bernie Moreno unseat Brown and created a vacancy as J.D. Vance left the chamber to serve as Vice President. Gov. Mike DeWine tapped Lt. Gov. Jon Husted to serve in place of Vance, but he’ll need to win next November to serve out the remainder of the term.
The roundtable
Most of the Columbus business owners Brown met with run restaurants. Letha Pugh owns the bakery Bake Me Happy and burger joint, Prestons. She explained they’re feeling the pinch from the Trump administration’s tariffs. The cost of beef is “astronomical,” she said, basically tripling in price.
“What happens, is there’s a threat of a tariff, the price increases, and then the price just never goes back down,” she said.
“It’s like the supplier is filing an insurance policy for themselves,” Harvest Pizza owner Chris Crader chimed in.

Pugh said their cost of goods went from 30% of revenue to 42%, “that is beyond our margin, so none of us are paying ourselves.”
She’s seen equipment costs rise, too, in part because of tariffs on steel and aluminum.
Brad Rocco from Bexley Pizza Plus echoed that point. “You think you might not be affected by it,” he said, “but if you really think about it, you are.”
“It might be a piece of equipment that was made in the United States, but a good portion of the parts are not,” he went on. “When you start taxing the pieces that go into this equipment, the price of that equipment becomes incredibly expensive.”
And that’s a dicey proposition, he said, when restaurant equipment gets so much use “it’s worth the metal that it’s built with” in about a year.
Rocco and Crader, both pizzamakers, lamented the complexity of buying something as simple as cheese. They explained prices fluctuate like pork bellies in a commodities market.
“You can buy like futures, or you can buy protections for it,” Crader said. “Dude, I’m just trying to make pizza. I don’t have a minor in Economics to figure out your contract.”
They all described a shrinking share of dine-in customers and a rise in food delivery app purchases. Rocco had to close his dining room for a year and a half during COVID. “That changes people’s habits,” he said.
Pugh added there’s little they can do to avoid those apps taking a cut. “If you put a cap on what they can charge, percentage wise, they add a new service charge to make up the difference.”

In addition to Harvest, Crader runs a bakery in Granville. He described setting up a coffee program for workers at the Intel factory going up nearby, but midway through a two-year contract, Intel shortened the agreement and pushed costs down. “They’ve got better lawyers than I do,” Crader said. More recently, he’s seen workers drilling test wells in a neighboring parcel to supply water for data centers and Intel.
“We lost money there, now they’re taking the water,” he said. “My energy costs have gone and I’m like, the whole thing feels like somebody’s really getting really rich off of this. And everybody that we represent, the average person in America, it’s like a struggle.”
Like the others, Tony Scartz, who owns Tony’s Italian Ristorante, said the cost of almost everything has gone up, but he added the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has been particularly hard on labor. Scartz said he recently lost two Venezuelan employees that had been with him for years.
“They didn’t really want to leave, but they were nervous about being in this country,” he said. “They had children, and they didn’t want to raise their kids in that environment, they felt like the door was going to be opened and they were going to get arrested, and then what’s going to happen to their kids?”
Ohio U.S. Sen. Jon Husted wants to “freeze” ACA insurance subsidies

Brown’s input
Speaking to reporters afterward, Brown did his best to hang those challenges on Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted. In particular, he emphasized the likely increase in healthcare costs for people getting insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
“Jon Husted, nine times, has voted to allow insurance rates to double and triple,” Brown said “He’s there to fix it. He hasn’t fixed it.”
“You heard the problems around here with tariffs,” Brown added, “Jon Husted has not spoken out against those tariffs or done anything about them.”
Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Husted’s campaign for comment without response.
Earlier this month, Husted introduced a measure granting a two-year extension for the enhanced healthcare subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.  On social media, he wrote, “Democrats created the broken ACA system, but I’m working to be part of the solution to make health care more affordable for Ohioans.”
But Husted’s proposal went nowhere.
Asked about Husted’s proposal, Brown criticized his opponent for backing the tax cut package known as the One Big Beautiful Bill. That measure made tax breaks from the first Trump administration permanent and paid for it with deep cuts to health care programs.
“He’s done nothing,” Brown said of Husted. “He’s made some speeches, he’s introduced some bills, but he had a chance nine times and turned his back on people in this state.”

They didn't notify families before, or after. (Getty Images)Tamika Zollicoffee said her 16-year-old son had never had a run-in with police, but now he may have a record floating in the system because he attended a party near a homicide scene.
Students should not lose their rights when arriving at school, but when police appeared Dec. 8 at Topeka High School with a warrant, they pulled him from class, seized his phone and demanded the passcode.
Zollicoffee said administrators fell short of their duty and that a law enforcement officer abused her son’s trust. Her son wasn’t alone. The warrant listed the names, race and other personal information of 20 students.
“I felt in my soul that this couldn’t be right,” she said during a phone interview. “This is so upsetting to me.”
The presence of the warrant likely protects police, but repercussions may yet exist for the students. For parents, it appears that police with warrants can question your child at school without notifying you.
Neither the school nor the police department informed her about this incident.
During the public statement portion of a Dec. 16 city council meeting, Zollicoffee expressed frustration with the police department and the school district.
“What happened on Dec. 8th … was totally in my opinion, sloppy, unprofessional and disrespectful to the parents involved,” she said, adding later, “The ball was totally dropped, and I feel totally disrespected. (The police) did it behind our backs.”
Kansas Reflector contacted the city and the school district for comment. Kimberly Qualls, spokeswoman for the city, said, “Due to the pending judicial process related to the case, the Topeka Police Department is unable to provide additional comment at this time.”
The school district did not respond.
Kansas Reflector has not yet seen the warrant.
Lauren Bonds (Submitted)
Lauren Bonds, a civil rights lawyer and executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, said that unfortunately, “there really aren’t strong Fourth Amendment protections in cases like this.”
While some states have passed protections above those set by courts because of how easily police can coerce students into false confessions and wrongful convictions, Kansas is not among those states, Bonds said.
The warrant gave police cover in this instance, and courts likely would find that school officials had no choice but to comply with police entering the school and waving a warrant.
But that doesn’t mean everything that happened was OK.
Bonds said it was reasonable to wonder if being named on a first-degree murder warrant might follow the students around for years. Also, including all the names on one warrant placed students in danger. Again, this was a homicide investigation.
“It’s very much a possibility,” Bonds said.
She added: “The uncertainty here alone is a problem. It is also imposing a burden. That’s incredibly disconcerting.”
Zollicoffee feared this.
“The safety of those students was jeopardized,” she said. “This could be considered a ‘snitch list.’ ”
Zollicoffee asked the officer she’d tracked down why he would put all the students’ names, race and other personal information in one document.
“He said, ‘It was easier this way,’ ” she said.
Tyshika Jones, mother of two students who were questioned, doesn’t think so.
“If you would have come and talked to me,” Jones said of the police, “I could have told you that my kids didn’t even have working phones at the time (of the homicide being investigated). I have receipts and everything.”
Jones said the intimidation her daughter faced made matters worse.
“My daughter said she asked three times to speak to me,” Jones said. “She kept asking to talk to me, but the officer snatched the phone out of her hand, because she wasn’t giving it to him, and told her to ‘call her on your own time.’ ”
Zollicoffee said by not contacting parents, the school district violated its own policy. She quoted 2350-01, the policy that prefers students be questioned outside of business hours and parents to be notified before interrogation.
Parents should have been informed after the questioning as well, Zollicoffee said. That policy has been in place since 1980, and the last revision, she said, was in 2018.
Police attempted to question Jones’ son at Eisenhower Middle School, but administrators didn’t let the officer question him until they’d notified Jones.
Zollicoffee worries about police digging for new cases against the students as they wander through the confiscated phones.
“Couldn’t they just say that they found something and set it aside for a later investigation?” she said.
She believed race and social class played a role in how police behaved. She said the students seemed to be rounded up like cattle and left alone with police. Almost every student on the list was Black, she said.
“If that was a white school, I don’t think they would’ve walked in, grabbed phones and questioned kids without calling their parents,” she said. “We are Black and working class. They just dismissed us.”
Had these been white students from wealthy families, she said, “it wouldn’t have happened this way. Police would have called and spoken to them and given them the respect they deserved.”
She still has not heard from the school system.

Among the tasks waiting for the Nebraska Legislature when it reassembles after the first of the year will be a budget shortfall, the perennial pitch for lower property taxes and a roster of issues from education to fulfilling the wishes of the electorate … finally.
State senators also will be dealing with a couple personnel issues during the 60-day session, a pair of stinkers that have already occupied a considerable amount of time not simply for lawmakers but for the state’s body politic.
The lowlights: First, the Unicameral’s Executive Committee has unanimously recommended the expulsion of one of the Legislature’s sitting members for what it deemed a “pattern of behavior,” but nevertheless propelled by an incident at a sine die celebration last spring. Jettisoning a sitting senator requires a vote of the entire Legislature, and 33 members would have to agree to the dismissal.
Senators also may weigh in on whether or not to impeach a member of the University of Nebraska Board of Regents after her arrest for felony drunken driving. She stands accused of causing a crash that seriously injured a passenger in the other vehicle. A state senator has vowed to introduce a legislative resolution to impeach the regent. 
If a simple majority (25 votes) of the full Legislature agrees, the regent is suspended while the Nebraska Supreme Court hears the case. State law requires five of the seven justices to agree to convict and remove the regent permanently.
I’ll let others consider the merits of both situations. Opinions on each are easy to find. While the cases must go forward, we should remember that Nebraskans send their elected representatives to Lincoln to solve problems and create good laws and policy. These two sadly necessary tasks do neither.
Eyes on the prize
Some of the Legislature’s collective eyes appeared to be on the right prizes at a public forum last week at which a panel of seven Lancaster County area state senators talked about the upcoming session and some of their priorities. 
The legislators were forthcoming in fielding audience questions and — for the most part — free of non-answer answers, a linguistic subterfuge far too common among politicians hoping to avoid the truth. The panel’s candor cheered me.
Based on their feedback, the short session, which begins Jan. 7, will challenge senators to right the budgetary ship, create solid tax policy, consider the body’s response to the will of the people via ballot initiatives and address a host of other pressing issues from broadband access to an infusion of fairness into the Homestead Act.
What we didn’t hear from any of the seven — gratefully — was that the session should take time debating what books children should be reading in Nebraska classrooms, who should be using what bathrooms or if the Unicameral will look further to erase gains made from efforts boosting diversity, equity and inclusion, the federal government’s latest bogeyman.
In a 60-day session, senators have precious little time to waste on such “issues.” Come to think of it, neither do they in a 90-day session.
Fixing things that need fixing
Nebraska has become the first state to add work requirements for recipients of Medicaid, the initial nod to the “Big Ugly” bill Congress passed and the president signed last summer. One idea being trafficked here is that a work requirement will curb “waste, fraud and abuse” in the Medicaid system, the now-ubiquitous reasoning for gutting government programs. 
Such thrift is a worthy goal even if most Nebraskans, Medicaid recipients and non-Medicaid recipients, have yet to see a hard number of just how much waste, fraud and abuse we have going on in these environs. 
Public health policy researchers at KFF report that the majority (75%) of the 346,000 Nebraskans who get Medicaid benefits already work. Many of the remaining recipients are exempt because of poor health, age or school. Others are caregivers.
State public health advocates warn that the cart is before the horse here, that systems to administer the work requirement processes are not ready to handle the “access and capacity” issues that will rise as the new rules take effect. The consequences may move many off Medicaid — even some that may be working. 
Optimal efficiency in social safety net programs is necessary. Recipients able to work should, to remain eligible. Nor is anyone suggesting we entertain Scrooge’s famous seasonal insensitivity of “prisons and workhouses.” 
Still, as this space has argued before, government largesse is an expansive universe, and those who benefit should be treated with equity and fairness, regardless of their income level or ability.

What have they ever done for us?
I grant you there was that 18th century guy, that Marquis de Lafayette, who convinced the French government to back us against the British and used his own money to help fund the War of Independence.
You could argue the Chinese who came over in the 19th century to build the railroad also had their uses.
They worked for practically nothing, rarely whined about getting dynamited on the regular or not being eligible for citizenship.
But the foreigners clogging up our colleges don’t help make America great again.
While some would say Albert Einstein was the kind of foreigner you want hanging around, what with him being smart at science and all, he took a job at Princeton that could have gone to a real American.
Why couldn’t one of us have come up with theories about the universe that were just as good or better than his?
We’re the ones who invented the quarter-pound hamburger, the microwave oven, the credit card, and Spanx.
To be fair, immigrants obtain patents at about twice the rate of regular Americans, and OK, gave us video games and doughnut machines.
Plus, I guess we have to mention that foreign-born researchers represent 25% of America’s Nobel Prize winners.
But so what? Is any of this really great?
‘Pull the plug’
Not according to our fearless governor, who vows to rid us of annoying people with their strange accents and peculiar habits, especially in Florida’s institutions of higher education.
Ron DeSantis demands the state Board of Governors “pull the plug” on those H-1B visas that allow practically any Tomás, Didier, or Haoran with a fancy degree and a slew of top-drawer publications to get a gig in our colleges.
“Universities across the country are importing foreign workers on H-1B visas instead of hiring Americans who are qualified and available to do the job,” said DeSantis. “We will not tolerate H-1B abuse in Florida institutions.”
Colleges are, as the governor says, “doing social justice.”
We don’t do social justice in Florida.
DeSantis’ Exhibit A: “A clinical assistant professor from Supposed Palestine,” the West Bank, now teaching at the University of Florida.
Of course you realize “Supposed Palestine” is one of the most feared places on earth, full of teenagers armed with slingshots, so vicious that Israeli settlers are forced to burn mosques, villages, and olive trees just to keep them in line.
The university would probably argue that professor is a super-brain and the most qualified for the job, but do we really want young Floridians exposed to ideas that could confuse them about who they’re supposed to hate in the Middle East?
Diversity gone wild, clearly.
UF’s got too many foreigners; FSU has a long history of coddling them, too.
In 1949, Florida State’s School of Music hired a Hungarian named Ernst von Dohnanyi.
He was renowned as a brilliant composer and pianist, called a “Romantic master,” and had been a courageous anti-Nazi fighter who also hated the Soviet regime.
But come on: Wasn’t there an American who had more or less the same resumé?
‘Ignorant, naive, blindsided’
In the 1980s, FSU brought in one Paul Dirac, a former Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University.
Paul Dirac via FSU YouTube
That’s a supposedly big-deal position once held by Isaac Newton, the one who got the idea about gravity by watching apples fall out of trees.
Science nerds call Dirac, a Nobel Prize-winner, the Father of Quantum Mechanics, which is all very well, but I’ll bet FSU could have got a Ph.D. from, say, the University of Alabama to do the same thing, and cheaper, too.
Take a look at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory there in Tallahassee.
It’s like the UN.
Take Dr. Likai Song: an M.D. and Ph.D. who works on cancer and HIV vaccines.
He went to Harvard and got his doctorate in Biophysics at FSU.
He’s won a bunch of NIH and NSF grants and fancy research awards, but he was born in China.
China, people.
Or what about Peter Gor’kov, a native of Russia, who makes magnetic resonance probes, instruments that tell you what’s going on inside magnets (or something like that)?
Who understands that stuff? Not red-blooded Americans!
Now I don’t know if any of these folks became citizens, but the point is there must be gazillions of native-born people with normal-sounding names like “Smith” and “Henderson” who could do those jobs.
If you listen to the professors and the students, you’d think the governor is a nasty, angry fellow who wants to destroy academic freedom and deny students perspectives from across the world while telling Floridians this will make us great again.
One uppity prof said, “I think people are ignorant, naive, blindsided or just generally racist to accept that perspective.”
He claimed international educators “add so much value, provide so much to citizens, whether it be health care, education, engineering,”
Oh contrarywise!
Picky, picky, picky
More than 60,000 egghead types work for Florida’s colleges and universities, and of those a full 1.7% are foreign.
That’s about 1,020 jobs stolen from Americans!
Hossam Ashour via USF
How hard can it be to become qualified in, say, immunology and microbiology like USF’s Hossam Ashour, born in Egypt and ranked among the top 2% of researchers worldwide?
There’s probably a TikTok video you can watch.
But the lefty-wokey academics claim there aren’t enough qualified American scientists around.
At the University of Miami, a big chunk of the biochemists, biophysicists, medical researchers, and molecular and cellular biologists are on H1-B visas.
According to the Miami Hurricane newspaper, some of UM’s obviously spoiled students aren’t happy about removing the foreigners. One said, “The STEM departments at UM could definitely struggle from a loss of international professors.”
A sophomore studying microbiology and immunology (aren’t we getting rid of those stupid vaccines?) seems to think the H1-Bs are a good thing: “It was interesting to experience [international professors’] teaching styles because they’re different from professors I’ve had before.”
American STEM not good enough for these kids?
Anti-American Americans like to bring up “the law” and “the Constitution,” pointing out that H1-B visas actually fall under the control of the federal government and Ron DeSantis can’t just wave them away.
Picky, picky.
Doesn’t matter: President Trump will help by charging $100 grand per new H-1B visa.
That ought to slow them down.
Of course the “that’s illegal” crowd, fringe types such as unions, 20 state attorneys general, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are pitching a fit over our great America First Forever A+++++ policies and suing the government.
‘Filthy countries’
Nevertheless, Trump will not waver from his determination to rid America of foreigners — unless they’re incredibly sexy or incredibly rich.
Take our well-dressed First Lady. She was a model who arrived in New York on an EB-1, often called the “Genius Visa.”
How about Elon Musk, one-time student visa holder? Sure, he dropped out of Stanford and probably worked illegally, but so what?
Without him, Mars will always be a cold, obscure planet with an unbreathable atmosphere instead of a potential vacation spot.
We need him, just like we need those oppressed white South Africans whose only crime was appropriating land belonging to the people who may have lived there for millennia but were failing to monetize it properly.
What we don’t need is so-called “experts” from countries with names we can’t spell.
No worries: Like DeSantis, the president is on the case.
He’s going big, too, planning to strip an untold number of so-called “naturalized” Americans of their citizenship.
The Justice Department says it’ll go after people who may be criminals, misrepresented themselves on their applications, or sneakily obtained citizenship during the Biden administration.
Just last year, 800,000 people, mostly from India, Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, and the Dominican Republic, took the oath.
Come on: Where are the Norwegians?
As for all these students pouring into our country and our state, many from “filthy” countries, Trump wants their social media inspected for any sign of terrorist tendencies such as making fun of him and deny their visas.
DeSantis says Florida’s public schools shouldn’t educate kids here without legal status, nor admit any undocumented student to one of our universities.
He will make sure the Sunshine State, home of the Cuban sandwich, is free of foreign influence.

A new poll found just 11% of residents thought the holidays would be less stressful this year, compared to 41% who expect more stress. And politics plays a role.","More than one-third of Marylanders surveyed in a new UMBC poll said they planned to take in holiday-related activities such as visiting a light display like this one in Hampden. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Santa may find Marylanders less than jolly when he arrives in the Old Line State later this week.
A poll released Monday by the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County surveyed residents on the upcoming holidays. Mileah Kromer, a political science professor and director of the poll, said many of the answers spoke to how people feel about the current state of political affairs in the country.
“Right now, everything is just so driven by the way people view the other party. And right now, Republicans are in charge, and Democrats really don’t like it,” Kromer said. “And a lot of Democrats believe very strongly that Donald Trump, the Republican Party, is a threat to American democracy, and it turns up in our numbers here.”
To start, 41% of those responding said the holiday season would be more financially stressful this year. That is on top of 46% who said they expected their stress level to be about the same as last year.
But 67% of Republicans in the survey said financial stress would be less or about the same as last year, compared to 53% of Democrats.
The poll surveyed 801 Maryland adults, including 769 registered voters, from Dec. 2-6. The margin of error for both pools of respondents is plus or minus 3.5%.
The look to the new year seems bleak, too.
Two-thirds of those in the poll said they expected divisions between people based on political affiliation would be worse. The number was driven by 77% of Democrats who said they expected things to be worse.
Marylanders split on resolving budget shortfall, pessimistic about Key Bridge rebuild

More than 50% of Marylanders said the overall quality of life for most Americans and American democracy would be worse in 2027.
A plurality — 44% — said they expected a sense of stability in life to be worse in the coming year.
The poll is not just a stocking full of coal.
“Here’s the good news: 63% of us say we’re going to prepare holiday meals and baked goods,” Kromer said.
More than eight in 10 Republicans said they were certain, or there was at least some chance, they would prepare a holiday meal or make baked goods in the weeks from Thanksgiving to mid-January. That compared to 77% of Democrats who said the same.
Also during that holiday period:

58% said they planned to shop for gifts.
53% planned to attend a gathering or party.
46% plan to attend a religious service.
45% planned to visit family or friends.
38% planned to host a gathering or party.
36% said they would attend events such as holiday markets, light displays or shows.
21% said they planned a vacation.

Finally, the vast majority of Maryland residents are not making resolutions for the coming year.
Kromer had not previously asked this question and had no baseline to compare responses this year. Still, the results were unsatisfying, she said.
“I actually don’t know how many people typically make these new year’s resolutions, to be honest,” she said. “Anecdotally, I thought it would be higher. I was a little bit disappointed that there weren’t more resolution makers among my fellow Marylanders.”
Nearly three out of four who responded said they would not make a resolution for the coming year. About one-fifth of those who answered said they would make a resolution. Of the resolution-makers, the list included:

8% who said they would work to improve their health or well-being.
55% who said they would work on some general self-improvement.
4% who said they would work on their finances, work or stability.
3% who said they would work to fix politics, government, or society.
2% said they wanted to improve their personal life, relationships with family, faith, and community.

Kromer did not ask Marylanders if they thought they could be consistent with their resolutions.
But let’s be honest: We know the gyms will get less crowded around Valentine’s Day.

Out of nearly 926,700 CT residents who receive Medicaid, these cuts could remove coverage for up to 170,000 people, many of whom are children, seniors, people with disabilities, and working families already living paycheck-to-paycheck. 
This is not a small policy change, but rather a shift with life-altering consequences.



 When people lose their only form of health insurance, they don’t stop needing medical care. They simply delay it. They wait until the infection spreads, the chest pain worsens, or the depression deepens. This is not out of choice, but because their immediate needs come first. Preventable conditions worsen, and what could have been treated quickly and affordably in a primary care office becomes an emergency medical crisis. 
That crisis typically lands in the emergency department: the single part of the healthcare system that is legally required to treat everyone, insured or not. However, ER care is the most expensive, least efficient form of healthcare. More ER use means longer wait times, more hospital crowding, and more delayed care for everyone. No one, not even those who can afford private insurance, is insulated from the consequence.
Not only are individual people impacted, but hospitals too. Medicaid provides significant reimbursements to hospitals and health systems like Yale New Haven and Hartford Healthcare, as well as smaller hospitals that serve rural and low-income regions. Connecticut’s hospitals are already strained and cuts will further threaten their operating budget, potentially leading to cuts in staffing, services, or both.

When there’s fewer staff in already short-staffed departments and fewer services, care becomes less available to those who need it the most.
This trend is not hypothetical. It is already happening. This past summer, when I had to schedule an appointment with my primary care practitioner, I was told that the earliest availability was in three months. When I called on September 5 for a specialty appointment at Yale New Haven, the first available date was September 9, 2026. If this is the system before thc cuts, what will it look like after?
The burden will fall heaviest on communities that already face obstacles to care: low-income residents, rural towns with limited providers, and Black and Latino families who are disproportionately insured through Medicaid. These cuts will deepen, not close, Connecticut’s health disparities. 
This is not just a public health issue, but also an economic one. Preventative care is significantly cheaper than emergency care. When residents cannot access affordable healthcare, the long-term costs shift to hospitals, taxpayers, and private insurance premiums. The country and state may “save” money in the short term, but we will all pay more later. 
It is imperative that Connecticut takes proactive steps to protect its residents. The clearest path forward is for the state to expand and strengthen community health centers (CHCs), which provide affordable primary care and prevent emergency room overcrowding. 
Currently, the state supports 17 federally qualified CHCs, serving more than 440,000 Connecticut residents, which is about 1 in 8 people statewide. These centers operate hundreds of sites in urban, suburban, and rural areas, including school-based clinics, mobile units, and service-delivery points in medically underserved towns. About 60% of CHC patients in Connecticut are on Medicaid, while a significant portion are uninsured or underinsured, which are populations often shut out of private practices. 
Strengthening CHCs would have far-reaching impacts on both access and system stability. These clinics provide consistent, high-quality outpatient and preventive care, including primary care, prenatal services, chronic disease management, mental health treatment, dental care, and substance-use services. This reduces the likelihood that patients delay treatment until their condition becomes an emergency. CHCs also serve large numbers of uninsured and underinsured residents through sliding-fee scales, ensuring that people can still receive care even if they lose Medicaid coverage.
By investing in community health centers, Connecticut can keep its citizens  healthy, reduce long waits, and ensure timely care even as federal cuts take effect. 
Access to healthcare should not depend on ZIP code, income level, or politics. It is the foundation of community well-being and a prerequisite for a functioning healthcare system.
The clock is ticking. The waiting room is filling. Connecticut must choose to care for its residents before the wait becomes even longer.

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)President Donald Trump announced Sunday night that Gov. Jeff Landry would serve as his special envoy to Greenland. 

“I am pleased to announce that I am appointing the GREAT Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, as the United States Special Envoy to Greenland,” Trump said through a post to his social media network Truth Social. 

“Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,” the president wrote. 
Landry will remain Louisiana governor while serving in his new role for Trump. 
“This in no way affects my role as governor of Louisiana!” he posted on the social media platform X. 
Greenland has significant oil and gas reserves and has been a focal point for Trump on-and-off since he entered politics a decade ago. 
On several occasions earlier this year, the president publicly mused about an American takeover of the island, which is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. The threats have upset not only the Danes but also the European Union and Russia. 

Vice President J.D. Vance traveled to the American military base located in Greenland to reiterate the president’s interest in acquiring the island in March. Then in August, a Danish media outlet reported that people connected to Trump were carrying out “covert operations” in Greenland, which prompted a high-level diplomatic meeting between the Trump administration and Denmark, according to the Associated Press. 
Another joint meeting between U.S., Greenland and Danish officials also took place earlier this month, during which a Danish minister stated that Greenlanders should be in charge of their own future.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BR.specialsession.110724_HS_1222-1024x906.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

But that's just one of changes coming down the pike.","New House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel), on the day of her election last week. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The pace of change in Annapolis continues to accelerate.
For starters, Maryland has never had anyone in high office who was anything like the new House speaker, Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel).
Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County) paved the way for Peña-Melnyk: Jones was the first woman and the first person of color to become a presiding officer in the Maryland General Assembly – and just the third Black woman in the U.S. to lead a state House. She handled the role of trailblazer proudly, with dignity and equanimity.
But Jones was grounded in local government and in the Baltimore County Democratic machine. She is temperamentally understated. She had been a top lieutenant to the late Michael Busch (D) during the full 17 years that Busch was speaker, and her 6 ½-year speakership in a way was a continuum of his – despite the obvious differences and even after she started to put her own team and agenda in place.
Peña-Melnyk is a different type of political athlete.
She is a vocal progressive. A passionate and compassionate protector of the underclass and the unparalleled defender of immigrants’ rights in Annapolis.
She’s also a true believer in government’s ability to improve people’s lives. She’s a policy wonk who works incredibly hard and doesn’t suffer fools gladly.
Peña-Melnyk went against the grain last year, supporting David Trone in his unsuccessful big against Angela Alsobrooks in the U.S. Senate primary, because she didn’t think Alsobrooks had done enough to boost Latinos as Prince George’s County executive. And she did that without any evident blowback. That says something about her.
The new House speaker: Forged by poverty, fueled by empathy

Peña-Melnyk is a historic choice in obvious ways. She’s the first Afro-Latina to serve as a presiding officer in the Maryland General Assembly (the current state Senate president in California, Monique Limon, is also Latina). She is the first immigrant to ascend to speaker.
It was always going to be a matter of time before a woman or a Black legislator became a presiding officer in Maryland. In fact, before Jones emerged as the compromise choice for speaker in 2019, the leading candidates were a Black man and a white woman who was openly lesbian.
The Latino community has yet to fully mature as a political force in Maryland, so when you think about that, Peña-Melnyk’s achievement becomes even more extraordinary.
And she is unique in other ways. We’ve had plenty of rags-to-riches stories in Maryland politics, people who rose to great power from humble beginnings. But the level of privation Peña-Melnyk and her family faced – first when she was a very young girl in the Dominican Republic, later growing up in New York City – is possibly unprecedented.
We’ve had House speakers from Baltimore City and House speakers from rural communities, but there is nothing in Maryland like the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan where Peña-Melnyk grew up.
You take the most urban neighborhood in Baltimore that you can think of, and I’d argue that culturally it has more in common with Western Maryland or the Eastern Shore than it does with Washington Heights.
Washington Heights has more energy, more diversity, more congestion and more chaos than anyplace in Maryland – and I know this because I lived in Washington Heights for seven years as a young adult. And I say it with all due respect and affection for Maryland, where I’ve been for the last 30 years.
Peña-Melnyk will join the pantheon of consequential people who grew up in Washington Heights, a list that includes Henry Kissinger, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, TV news reporters Bernard and Marvin Kalb, baseball slugger Manny Ramirez and Broadway impresario Lin-Manuel Miranda, who still lives there.
Even though she’s taking over in the last year of a four-year legislative term, Peña-Melnyk is going to put her own stamp on the House right away, including creating a new committee and making some significant changes to House leadership. No doubt there will be more moves in House leadership in the next year – and more after the 2026 election. But that’s still a lot of change in a short amount of time, and it will be interesting to watch Peña-Melnyk grow into the job.
Redistricting commission votes behind closed doors to move toward redrawing maps

She has been an advocate and a policy leader during her time in the legislature. Now she’ll have to become a conciliator, a consensus-builder, someone who cools temperatures and allows egos to mesh.
Peña-Melnyk’s election should make leadership in the House more progressive than it’s ever been – and the House is already considered way more progressive than the Senate. That dynamic will be a factor in the upcoming legislative session and during the election year.
The legislature did not take up redistricting during its daylong special session Tuesday. But that doesn’t mean the idea is dead. It could still come up in the regular session, which convenes on Jan. 14.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and House leaders favor the idea of drawing a new congressional map for the state, thinking they can squeeze the state’s lone Republican member of Congress, Rep. Andy Harris, out of his seat. But Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) has resisted the idea, and most of his caucus supports him.
Ferguson has argued that mid-decade redistricting is a bad and undemocratic idea and has also warned that a court might not just overturn a newly drawn map but could also change the current map, with its 7-1 advantage for Democrats.
On the one hand, we can laud a political leader taking an adult view in these partisan times. And maybe his fears about judges redrawing the boundaries to the Democrats’ detriment are founded.
But on the other hand, in the age of Trump, it sure doesn’t feel as if this is a political leader who is reading the room or meeting the moment – at least not in the eyes of many Democratic activists. Fairly or not, Ferguson has been lit up for his wariness – on social media, and by national progressive pundits and political leaders.
Will he face more blowback?
Just last week, a poll came out showing Marylanders have at best mixed opinions about redistricting – and that it’s only a top priority for 27% of registered voters.
Of course, in California there were mixed opinions about re-redistricting initially, but with the full weight of the Democratic establishment behind it, and after weeks of expensive messaging, the ballot measure passed overwhelmingly last month, and could yield Democrats up to five House seats. I suspect the same dynamic could develop here, with a stronger push from Moore and other party leaders.
Ferguson’s redistricting stance is all of a piece. The state Senate during this legislative term has been demonstrably more moderate and cautious than the House in Annapolis.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Under Ferguson this term, the Senate has moved more slowly or more incrementally than the House on a range of things, including taxes, the living wage, abortion rights, immigration, health care and healthy school meals for low-income students.
That’s just a quick survey. Talk to advocates and they’d show you other examples.
And this is all under Bill Ferguson’s leadership. Ferguson – who is just 42, who was considered a liberal breath of fresh air when he became Senate president in 2019, after 33 years of the conservative Democrat Mike Miller in that job.
I am, frankly, given the mood of most Democratic activists, surprised that several Democratic Senate incumbents aren’t facing serious primary challenges from their left in 2026. Though that could still happen in some places before the late February filing deadline.
Ferguson has a challenger now, Bobby LaPin, though he seems like more of a community character than a political force, and it’ll be interesting to see if he gets any traction.
In Montgomery County, Sen. Nancy King, who is Ferguson’s majority leader, got a challenger who is worth watching, a young military veteran and gun safety advocate named Amar Mukunda who is taking her on from the left, and suggesting that Senate leaders are too scared of Donald Trump to go through with redistricting. King is a distinguished and honorable public servant who has beat back tough opponents before, but that doesn’t mean the primary isn’t going to get uncomfortable for her.
A few weeks ago, Moore announced that he was setting up a political slate, to back candidates who support his agenda. But he was a little vague about its scope and purpose.
My understanding is there are a couple of Democratic legislators he’s really mad at, and is going to try to find and back primary challengers against them. Otherwise, he’s created a list of questions for candidates to answer who want to be considered for his slate endorsement. Who he ultimately backs and what his criteria will be are a little unclear.
Earlier this month, quite by accident, I heard Moore on a podcast with a progressive California Democratic activist named Jess Craven, saying that if Annapolis lawmakers aren’t going to go along with his re-redistricting plan, “it’s time to move them out.” Does that mean his slate could target incumbent senators who don’t get behind the redistricting push?
That’s one of the many intriguing political questions to think about as we turn the page on the calendar and contemplate the possibility of even more jolting political developments ahead.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3239-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

Muse vows to fight to keep county job and Senate seat despite ethics committee’s concerns

Hawkins, a Democrat, was first elected in 2018 and reelected in 2022. His current term ends Dec. 5, 2026. He would have been unable to run for reelection to his current seat next year because of the county’s two-term limit on council members.
His departure is just the latest change in the county, which began last summer when At-large Councilmember Mel Franklin resigned shortly before pleading guilty to stealing from his campaign account. He was succeeded by former District 5 Councilmember Jolene Ivey, whose seat was filled in a June special election by Shayla Adams-Stafford. In that same special election, voters chose Braveboy, then the county state’s attorney, to replace former County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, who was elected last fall to the U.S. Senate. Braveboy’s seat as county prosecutor was filled by Tara Jackson,  the county’s former chief administrative officer, who was filling in as acting county executive before Braveboy’s election.
Hawkins also ran unsuccessfully for county executive in a crowded field of Democrats in the special election to replace Alsobrooks.
Because his resignation comes with less than a year left in his term, Hawkins seat will be filled by the county council. The council is now seeking letters of interest and resumes from interested individuals who are registered voters in Prince George’s County.
Those who wish to be considered for the At-Large County Council position have until 5 p.m. this Friday, Dec. 26, to submit a statement of interest and a resume to this link. In the meantime, Hawkins’ office will continue fielding constituent requests at 301-952-2195 or by email at ATLargeHawkins@pgccouncil.us.

Many are holdovers from former Speaker Adrienne Jones’ (D-Baltimore County) staff while some come from the House Health and Government Operations Committee, where Peña-Melnyk had been the chair.
“As Speaker, I am honored to lead alongside a team that shares a deep commitment to our state and to the work ahead,” Peña-Melnyk said in a statement Friday afternoon. “I am not alone in this effort. Together, we will support the operations of the House of Delegates and remain responsive to the needs of Marylanders across the state.”
The list of aides announced by Peña-Melnyk includes:

Michelle Firmin, chief of staff
Erin Hopwood, legislative director
Tom Lewis, special adviser to the speaker
Patrick O’Leary, senior legislative counsel
Duane Bond, senior policy advisor
Vanessa Bustos, deputy director of communications
Jeanie Ferretti, legislative assistant
Melanie Gordon-Newell, assistant to the speaker
Rhonda Caldwell-Dove, office manager
Morgan Streeter, House administrator
Alina Freimuth, assistant to the House administrator
Tawana Offer, page coordinator
Robert A. Parham, sergeant-at-arms

Lewis, who worked for previous speakers Cas Taylor and Mike Busch, had been working as Montgomery County’s development ombudsman. County Executive Marc Elrich said in a statement that Lewis would be missed, but that “Speaker Peña-Melnyk made a great decision in bringing Tom onto her team. He will be an asset to her office, to the General Assembly, and to the work they will do on behalf of all Marylanders.”
The speaker’s statement said sdditional staff announcements may be made in the coming weeks. Peña-Melnyk also has to line up her leadership team, including the chairs of the newly separate Health and Government Operations committees, that are being split out from the speaker’s old committee. The 2026 General Assembly begins in a little over three weeks, on Jan. 14.
Jim Henson High will have to wait
After an outcry by opponents, Del. Anne Healey (D-Prince George’s) has decided to withdraw her bill to rename Northwestern High School in Hyattsville for its most-famous alumnus, Muppets creator Jim Henson.
Healey said in a news release Friday that “after careful consideration” she has decided to withdraw PG 502-26: Prince George’s County – Northwestern High School – Renaming., for now.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Healey said the goal of the bill was to “celebrate the creativity, kindness, creative genius and cultural impact of Jim Henson’s work, and how he continues to inspire millions around the world.” But critics called it a change that no one had asked for, and that the county can’t afford, estimating the rebranding the school could cost up to $1.5 million, money that school boosters said could be better used elsewhere.
The Prince George’s County Board of Education went on record against the change, after it was introduced at a county delegation meeting Dec. 1, and the head of the Northwestern High School PTSA told WTOP that the school needs HVAC upgrades, a traffic light in front of the school, more security guards and other staff, and those are “the day-to-day things that are the priority for the school, not renaming the school.” She noted that the school auditorium and performing arts program are already named for Henson..
Healey, a longtime Hyattsville resident whose children graduated from Northwestern, said she has been talking about the idea for years and was taken aback by the opposition. She said she had hoped recognizing Henson, a 1954 graduate, would be a “source of pride to the entire community,” but realized the time is not right.
“We can all use more joy in our lives, and I have always thought of Jim Henson as a bringer of joy,” Healey said in her statement. “I never expected or wanted this proposal to be controversial, and I remain committed to supporting the legacy of Jim Henson and his contributions to education, creativity, the arts, and Northwestern High School.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Calvin-Hawkins-12-11-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-22 17:24:12.903293

The order Sunday from Immigration Judge Brea Burgie came after a Friday bond hearing at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora, where ICE has detained Vizguerra for nine months. Bond was set at $5,000.
“We are in the process of submitting the bond paperwork, but it can take 24 to 48 hours for that to be processed,” her lawyer, Laura Lichter, said by text Sunday evening. 
The order “explicitly declined to impose electronic monitoring,” Lichter said.

A citizen of Mexico, Vizguerra, 53, fled with her family to the United States in 1997 after criminal organizations persecuted her husband, as she has described in court documents. She rose to national attention as an immigrant rights activist during the first Trump administration when she took sanctuary in a Denver church to avoid deportation. She has four children, three of whom are U.S. citizens.
She was arrested this year as the Trump administration undertook aggressive mass deportation efforts. The bond hearing arose as part of a habeas corpus petition in U.S. District Court of Colorado, where Vizguerra argues that the government targeted her for exercising protected First Amendment activities. The district court, which on Wednesday ordered that the bond hearing must occur, appeared to agree that the government retaliated against Vizguerra, who sometimes goes by Vizguerra-Ramirez.
“Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez’s substantial First Amendment allegations, taken to their logical conclusion, suggest that ICE did not act as an impartial decisionmaker in determining that she was subject to continued detention under (statute)  and may have been motivated by a punitive purpose,” Judge Nina Wang had written.
Vizguerra is also in separate legal proceedings over the government’s attempt to remove her from the country.
Her family “has confirmed that they intend to post the bond immediately — with help from the Immigrant Freedom Fund — so that she can be released as soon as processing allows,” says a statement from Lichter.
