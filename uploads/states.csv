The Kentucky Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners during a public hearing Monday heard concerns about a proposal that would change regulatory requirements for Kentucky veterinary facilities. 
Those concerned about the regulation — which included representatives from humane societies and licensed veterinarians with the company VIP Petcare — argued the amendment would mean less access to pet vaccines for rabies, canine parvovirus and other diseases. 
VIP Petcare, a mobile veterinary services company,  operates clinics within retail stores such as Tractor Supply Co. and Feeders Pet Supply. Franklin County Humane Society executive director Kerry Lowary said she feared the proposed regulation could also make it “financially untenable” for nonprofits to conduct animal vaccine clinics.

“I implore the board to reconsider advancing these regulations until it receives input from the organizations offering affordable, low cost spay and neuter services and conducting community-wide vaccination clinics,” Lowary said to the board, meeting at its offices at the Kentucky Horse Park.
What would the regulation do?
The board, made up of licensed veterinarians for large and small animals, oversees the licensing and certificating of the more than 2,600 active veterans throughout Kentucky. The board in July advanced the proposed regulation requiring the “dedicated” space that veterinarians use to treat animals be a “clearly distinct, purpose-built area that is physically and operationally separate from non-veterinary spaces and retail shopping areas.” 
Such a space would be required to be confined and enclosed with floor-to-ceiling walls so that “patients are fully contained and separated from persons who are not veterinary personnel or an owner.” 
The regulation appears to not affect traditional veterinary offices and mobile veterinary units housed in large vehicles that already meet the space requirements. Government-sponsored vaccine clinics, including mass rabies vaccine clinics sponsored by local public health departments, would be exempt from the regulation. 
According to minutes from a July special meeting, the board argued the regulation was needed because of “real issues with public safety,” such as the possibilities that improperly disposed needles could cause an “inadvertent” puncture and that aggressive animals could “lash out” at passersby. The board also argued that temporary veterinary spaces could be a danger to animals that have an adverse reaction to treatments and need follow-up care.
Licensed veterinarians and other representatives with VIP Petcare told the board that their in-store operations are safe, saying that during tens of thousands of “patient encounters” there have been no examples of animals escaping or syringes being mishandled. 
A lack of access vs. ‘limited’ risks
Thomas Kerr, the director of veterinary compliance with VIP Petcare, told the board the in-store clinics offered by the company vaccinated more than 4,200 dogs and cats against rabies, conducted 1,700 tests for heartworm and tick-borne disease and microchipped almost 400 pets.

Kerr said the company, which was bought by the company Pet IQ in 2018, has operated in Kentucky for 11 years. Pet IQ was subsequently bought by a private equity firm last year. 
“These proposed rules, while well-intentioned, do not align with the real-world evidence of how care is already being delivered,” Kerr told the board. “Instead, they create barriers that reduce access for the very communities most in need. In a state where rural areas already face healthcare challenges for both people and animals, we should be working together to expand, not restrict options for families and their pets.” 
Michelle Shane, the executive director of the board, told the Lantern the proposed changes to the regulation came about after questions from veterinarians about “what was allowable, what facilities they needed to register.” She said the board had not intended to single out a particular type of veterinary facility when it proposed the state regulation. 
Kentucky, like other states, is grappling with a shortage of veterinarians to care for both pets and large farm animals, though a 2024 report commissioned by the American Veterinary Medical Association found the number of graduates from veterinary colleges nationwide would likely meet future demand. 
Katryna Fleer, a licensed veterinarian and medical director with VIP Petcare, told the Lantern a licensed veterinarian is on-site at every in-store vaccine clinic along with other support staff. Fleer and another VIP Petcare employee said the clinics are usually set up either in the “warehouse” section of the store in the back or in a low-traffic section of the store. 
“We can’t ask them to build us a ‘purpose-built’ space for what we do,” Fleer said, speaking about the stores the company partners with. “Safety of our teams, of the pets, of the owners, of anybody else in the store, it’s just top of mind.”

Nicole Logan, a senior vice president of Tractor Supply Co., also sent a letter to the board urging it to reconsider changing the regulation because their stores can not accommodate floor-to-ceiling walls for pop-up clinics. Logan wrote the company had not received complaints of danger to customers, their employees or pets because of the pop-up clinics. 
Another licensed veterinarian with VIP Petcare Brenda Specht said she travels over multiple states to run the pop-up clinics, each one usually running up to two hours in length. She said she refers pet owners to “full-service” veterinary offices if she finds more serious issues such as “rotting teeth.” 
“Very often it’s 30, 40, 50 miles away to go to find somebody who can do good dentistry,” Specht told the board. She acknowledged there is a “limited risk” of public safety issues connected to the clinics, but that it hasn’t occurred yet. 
The board can choose to make further amendments to its proposed regulation following the public hearing or keep its proposal the same. From there, the regulation goes before the state legislature’s Administrative Regulation Review Subcommittee where state lawmakers can determine whether a regulation is “deficient.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The Kentucky Lantern filed an appeal Monday with the state Office of the Attorney General seeking records from the University of Kentucky related to the departure of the president of the now disbanded University Senate.
The appeal is in response to UK’s denial of the Lantern’s request for records of email exchanges that preceded the university signing a $375,000 separation agreement with DeShana Collett, who had been a tenured professor in physician assistant studies. 
A provision of the legal settlement between UK and Collett required her to withdraw her request for the records. She had sought emails among UK administrators that mentioned her. 
Collett played a prominent role last year in opposing a change to UK’s internal governance and presided over a vote of no confidence in UK President Eli Capilouto.

She and others had warned that faculty would be stripped of decision-making power over academic decisions. But the UK Board of Trustees approved the new governance plan proposed by Capilouto. It recommended creating a faculty senate, which is now in effect, to replace the University Senate.
In the final meeting of the University Senate, Collett presided over a vote of no confidence in Capilouto. Collett later wrote to faculty members warning of acts of retaliation by the UK administration after the vote. Collett warned that the provost’s office had taken control of the University Senate’s online voting system and would have access to how individual Senate members had voted on Capilouto. 
Joe Childers, Collett’s attorney, told the Lantern last month that after the controversy Collett was “subjected” to an environment at UK that made her uncomfortable. 
Childers filed requests on her behalf for records pertaining to her, including emails among administrators. UK denied Collett’s request for the records but the attorney general’s office issued an opinion partially in her favor in February. In that opinion, the office ruled that UK violated the state’s Open Records Act because procuring the documents “did not place an unreasonable burden” on UK and it had denied records related to the requester, Collett. The attorney general’s office said that UK did not violate the act “when it withheld privileged attorney-client communications” in accordance with state law. 
Childers previously told the Lantern that after the attorney general’s opinion UK agreed to provide the documents by July 31. However, the settlement agreement was reached before the documents were provided to Collett. 
The Lantern is seeking the same records that Collett sought in its appeal. UK denied the Lantern’s request, saying in a letter that “the Attorney General has already ruled that the records are exempt as preliminary and/or attorney-client privileged” both within the scope of the Febuary opinion and outside of it. 
However, contrary to what UK wrote in the denial, the attorney general’s office did not cite the provision protecting preliminary records in its ruling on Collett’s appeal.
UK spokesperson Jay Blanton said in a statement to the Lantern that state law “distinguishes between the rights and privacy of an employee and the rights of the public, in this case a media outlet.” 
“An employee is entitled to otherwise exempt records that relate to the employee to preserve their privacy interests,” Blanton said. “In contrast, the public — a media outlet such as the Lantern — is not entitled to materials that were exempt for a public request. Thus, the University appropriately refused to disclose preliminary materials or materials that were exempt for a public request.”
However, Michael Abate, who frequently represents news outlets seeking public records, called UK’s stance in this situation “shocking” in a statement to the Lantern. 
“They’ve paid nearly $400,000 to a former professor in part to keep these very records secret. I can’t recall another time where a settlement was conditioned on the withdrawal of an Open Records Request after the Attorney General said the records must be released,” Abate said. “To make matters worse, the University misrepresented to the Lantern what the Attorney General previously held — suggesting it won on an issue the AG declined to address. That only heightens the need for the public to see what’s in these records. What is the University trying so hard to hide?”
In recent years, UK has gone to court with Kentucky news outlets over denied open records requests, including the student-run newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0809-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)This year, a political drama unfolded in a small town north of Colorado Springs, resulting in an upheaval of town leadership and a triumph over a corporation with an estimated annual revenue in the billions.
The controversy engulfed the town of Palmer Lake (population 2,575), which sits just east of the foothills and atop the Denver Basin aquifers, an important source of water for the town. Buc-ee’s, an expanding chain, selected a location a few miles from Palmer Lake to construct a new travel plaza. Their travel plazas are known for their branded snacks, brisket, relatively high wages, clean bathrooms, and rows upon rows of gas pumps. Many Palmer Lake residents, however, opposed the development, vehemently.
There are many compelling reasons why a community would resist the construction of a glorified gas station, but in Palmer Lake, the crux of the issue was groundwater scarcity. And as Colorado becomes increasingly arid, contentious disputes about how to accommodate population growth and commercial development without exhausting groundwater resources are bound to arise more frequently. The Palmer Lake controversy is a harbinger, unless small towns proactively establish rules for growth in a water-limited future.

Water is of perpetual concern in Colorado, especially in the midst of a climate change-induced megadrought. Colorado’s municipalities, industries, and agriculture rely heavily on surface water (water from rivers, lakes, etc.), especially the Colorado River. And although the Colorado River is diminishing, over-allocated and contentious, it is renewable. Groundwater, stored in underground aquifers that accumulate over millions of years, is not.
Aquifers tapped by wells supply 17% of Colorado’s water, but at current withdrawal rates, much of Colorado’s groundwater may become inaccessible in just decades. Groundwater depletion is of particular concern for agriculture, which uses 89% of the state’s water. A hodgepodge of laws, regulations and court cases dictate by who and how much water may be extracted, making it difficult for new developments to establish sufficient access to water. To build a travel plaza, Buc-ee’s had to be annexed by Palmer Lake (or another town) to tap into Palmer Lake’s existing water rights.
Buc-ee’s had little reason to suspect that its proposed annexation would be the cause of so much vitriol. In the town of Johnstown, south of Loveland, Colorado’s first Buc-ee’s location has so far generated $1 million of tax revenue and increased foot traffic for local businesses. That was not a sufficient draw for residents of Palmer Lake. Vocal opponents to Buc-ee’s overwhelmed town council meetings and ultimately resulted in the resignation of the mayor and multiple trustees.
Residents also called a special election to pass an ordinance requiring a town vote before new land annexations. Residents opposed to the Buc-ee’s cited concerns about community character, traffic, and preserving dark skies and conservation corridors. Gas stations also increase air pollution and further entrench cars reliant on fossil fuels in an era where electric cars could and should become dominant. However, even though Buc-ee’s committed to fronting the cost of two new wells for itself and the town, the estimated 19% increase in Palmer Lake’s water usage for the Buc-ee’s location was the straw that broke the camel’s back.
So what does this mean for the rest of Colorado?
For one, Buc-ee’s fans will have to keep commuting to Johnstown. But more importantly, communities in Colorado can learn from the controversy and create plans to dictate how water should be managed, conserved and allocated in alignment with the Colorado Water Plan. Specifically, communities should develop guidelines for prioritizing water uses. Large population centers have experts and agencies dedicated to ensuring stable access to water as the climate heats up.
The City of Castle Rock, for example, was 100% reliant on groundwater from Denver Basin aquifers in 2005. With planning and hefty infrastructure investments, such as water storage capacity and better wastewater treatment, Castle Rock has decreased reliance on groundwater to 69% and is aiming for 25% by 2050. Expensive water projects may be challenging for small towns to pull off in the same way, but setting stipulations for usage and growth is possible.
The residents of Palmer Lake did an admirable thing in preventing the Buc-ee’s annexation and preserving their groundwater for future use. To prevent another upheaval, the town should perhaps codify water usage guidelines for development. Palmer Lake maybe could have kept its town leaders and avoided a divisive dispute had leaders previously decided not to approve developments with exorbitant water requirements.
Pretty soon, water will determine the success of every proposed development in Colorado. Buc-ee’s may have been the first casualty, but it won’t be the last.

(Photo courtesy of Amazon)Last week, the Goochland County Planning Commission voted to create a proposed technology overlay district (TOD) and technology zone, with some recommendations. These areas of zoning would incentivise companies, like data centers, to build within them and clear the way for peaker gas plants and small modular reactors to be built in the district.
Many counties in the state have these specialized zones that are often already commercial or industrial use. They offer incentives to companies to build in those specific zones and often have additional rules for being set back from residential areas and other ordinances. 
Goochland’s proposed district was advanced by the county planning commission in a 3-2 vote. The area would stretch for about five miles along Route 288. 
The TOD is a controversial subject in the county. Hundreds of residents came to the two public hearings the planning commission hosted on the proposed ordinance and urged the board to reach out to counties where there is an abundance of data centers or where similar energy projects have been proposed. 
Their main concerns are impacts on utilities, water use, fire hazards, sound and air and pollution.
“Small nuclear reactors and gas peaking plants do not belong anywhere near neighborhoods, schools and senior living facilities,” said Lawrence Frank, a resident of Goochland County.
The objective of creating the overlay district is to keep these types of developments away from residential areas by providing those incentives. Companies can still build outside of those areas if they so choose.
“Do I think Google and Amazon will choose to build a data center next to a neighborhood when they could choose a different property in the TOD where a retired couple won’t be sitting on their back deck all day with a dB app monitoring noise, then calling the sheriff and the local news station every time the noise limit is exceeded? I don’t,”  commissioner Guy Kimmerly said
Kimmerly ultimately voted against the proposed TOD because he felt it would allow agricultural land owners within the district to build data centers on their land. He suggested making the energy projects subject to conditional use permits that allows for more public input into the permitting process.
“I do agree with the fact that we do need to put the energy generating facilities in the CUP,” commissioner Dwain Cosby said. “That does give you the public the opportunity whenever there’s a CUP to (have public input).”
Data centers will still be able to be built in the TOD by-right, which means they can be permitted without discretionary review if it meets the requirements for the district. 
Some key changes were approved in the board’s vote following public comment, which the Board of Supervisors will need to consider. Those changes include:

Make energy generating facilities allowable only through a conditional use permit, both for primary and accessory uses.
In the areas of the Technology Overlay District with current base zoning of A2 (agricultural), impose a 500- foot setback from residential property for a data center permitted by right and require conditional use permit approval for locating closer in those areas. 
Limit by-right maximum building height to 80 feet’ for structures located adjacent to residentially zoned property
Reduce the decibel limits lower than currently proposed 65 dB in the day and 60 at night.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star.)On a rainy Thursday afternoon, Anne Pfitzer and Jillian McLeod-Tardiff donned pink Planned Parenthood safety vests over their rain jackets as they walked the streets of Biddeford, knocking on doors to let residents know about the local clinic, where they could access a variety of services from cancer screenings to flu shots. 
After being cut off from federal Medicaid funding by Republicans’ sweeping budget bill in July, the organization has taken the fight to court while staff continues to provide services in Maine and across the country. 
“Hopefully it will come out in favor of Planned Parenthood, but in the meantime, services are still being provided,” Pfitzer told a mom who answered the door while her two kids played in the front yard. “That’s partly why we are here today; to say that even though all this is happening, you can still rely on Planned Parenthood.”
In light of the rapidly changing federal landscape, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England last month launched a regular neighborhood canvass in Biddeford and will soon be knocking doors in Sanford, as well. In addition to spreading awareness of the clinics located in those communities, the outreach is intended to let people know that anyone can access their health services, which are not limited to the reproductive health care typically associated with the organization. 
“I think there’s a lot of misinformation floating around, not only perpetuated by folks out of state, but also by political actors in state. Every year we see bills that seek to undermine our reproductive rights,” said Lisa Margulies, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England’s vice president of public affairs.
“And so this is a way of getting out into the community and letting people know that they have these rights in Maine, and these services are available to them,” Margulies said.
Before the canvass, half a dozen staff and volunteers gathered downtown for a brief training. 
Maine Family Planning appeals ruling that upheld loss of $1.9M in Medicaid funding

“So today, the goals are to spread the word about resources available, clear up any misconceptions people may have about these recent bills, and to sign up new supporters,” Lindsay Ware, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England’s civic engagement project leader, told the group.
Getting the word out
In groups of two, staff and volunteers knocked on more than a 100 doors that day. Some who answered were already supporters of the reproductive health care provider, making regular donations. Others used Google Translate to understand what the volunteers were saying, and exchanged contact information to learn more. And a handful said they were happy with their current health care providers but accepted the volunteers’ printed hand-outs. 
One young woman who had just moved to Biddeford had not heard of Planned Parenthood, but told McLeod-Tardiff that they were planning to start a family soon and could utilize some of their services. 
“While there are politicians who are trying to take away our care, we’re out here in the rain, talking to real people, making sure that people know that they can get care,” said McLeod-Tardiff, a canvassing organizer with Planned Parenthood’s local chapter.
“And it feels good, because a lot of the other canvassing that we do has to do with elections or ballot measures,” she added, “and this is just purely getting information out there directly to potential patients.”
Pfitzer spent years working internationally on reproductive health care as a grantee of the U.S. Agency for International Development. But after President Donald Trump’s administration ordered mass layoffs at the agency, Pfitzer lost her job earlier this year. She now volunteers for Planned Parenthood in Maine and splits her time between that and volunteering in Maryland for other causes. But this one is personal, she said.
“I’ve given my whole career to that work, and I’ve seen it under so much attack here,” Pfitzer said. “So it’s my own form of resistance by saying, ‘You fired me from doing it overseas, well, then I’ll put that energy to countering that here in my country.’”

Services continue amid legal challenges 
Both Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning, Maine’s largest reproductive care provider, were blocked from receiving federal Medicaid funding and have asked the courts to reverse initial rulings that have sustained those cuts.
In August, Maine Family Planning was denied a preliminary injunction by U.S. District Court Judge Lance Walker, a Trump appointee. That case will now be heard in the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. Planned Parenthood was initially granted a preliminary injunction, which was later reversed by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in September. 
Meanwhile, both providers have said they will continue to treat patients on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, free of charge. 
While Planned Parenthood of Northern New England has not announced any changes to services yet, Maine Family Planning — which operates 18 clinics, many in rural, medically underserved areas — will have to shutter its primary care practices in Ellsworth, Houlton and Presque Isle next month if the appeals court does not rule in its favor, said Olivia Pennington, the group’s director of advocacy and community engagement.
The Maine Legislature has provided some temporary relief, in the form of $6 million in family planning funding, but it does not fully meet the deficit both organizations face. 
“There are so many providers who simply don’t take Medicaid because it does not actually cover the cost of care,” Margulies said, noting that Medicaid reimburses health care providers at a lower rate than private health insurance. “And so should we and Maine Family Planning and others not exist in our community, there’s simply no other place folks can go.”

Read the first story here.
GREEN MOUNTAIN — A few ounces of Helene’s floodwaters remain trapped in the headlight of Leo Sharp’s Harley-Davidson.
When the Nolichucky River surged, it swallowed the bike, flooded the tool shed and ripped away the vegetation. Water rushing down the mountain left everything caked in mud, the barn barely standing and half of the home destroyed.
The year since has brought a new roof; a reinforced shed; the skeleton of a new bedroom. Sharp and Tessa Reed, who call the riverside property home, still sleep most nights in a tent pitched on wooden scaffolding across the property.
Estimated repair costs were far beyond their own means. The couple didn’t have flood insurance, and have yet to receive aid from FEMA. Help has come in fits and spurts, from neighbors, friends and church groups. At first, they had hoped to have the home repaired by July 2025. Now, the timeline is indefinite.
“It’s hard to get any one thing done when everyone is pulling you in different directions,” Reed said, standing in the echoey, wrapped shell of a room. A rolled-up carpet and cardboard are stuffed in a clawfoot bathtub.
They don’t plan to leave or sell. Nor do their neighbors. They’ll stay and rebuild, they’ve decided, even if it’s with their own hands.
“In the moment, it was like, what are we going to do?” Sharp said. “Then afterward, you’re just saying, ‘thank God I have you.’ Thank God for everything we do have. Everything else just kind of becomes unimportant. It’s been a hell of an onion to peel.”

The homestead
Sharp and Reed, 38 and 29, moved to Yancey County three years ago. Their new, century-old home was a dream come true, a far cry from their original home in Virginia and Sharp’s decade aboard a Navy submarine.
They had transformed their home into a business — selling herbs and tea, eggs, honey from their beehives. Helene destroyed the garden, topped the beehives, washed away the chicken coops and ruined freezers full of meat and vegetables.
After checking on their neighbor Freddie and Sharp’s mom, who lives five miles away, they began to dig out. The bedroom was unsalvagable, with the foundation eroded and black mold creeping in. An estimate for a bare minimum rebuild totaled $120,000, nearly what they paid for the home in the first place. Somehow, it could have been worse.
“I think if we had another three inches (of rain), we would have lost the house and the barn,” Reed said.

Over the coming months, neighbors, friends and roving groups of volunteers and charity workers began to take on projects on the property.
One group rebuilt an enclosure for the ducks and geese, digging out a small pond and building a wire fence. Two young Amish men helped install insulation, and built a retaining wall to prevent the shed from collapsing. A group of men from Wisconsin helped the couple construct the bedroom’s frame. And Living Grace Ministries, a Virginia-based church, has had members coming by for months to lend a hand.
A friend named Mike, who lived two hours south in Saluda, would make daily trips up to help the couple. He brought them peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
“We’ve called him Mountain Dad,” Reed said, smiling.
The river
The Nolichucky was unrecognizable when the flooding subsided. An island in front of the couple’s home looked more like a landfill: toppled trees, scraps of metal from cars and homes.
After months without a hint of green, Sharp spotted a bundle of yellow daffodils sprouted among the debris. A year after the storm, the island is mostly rebuilt, and plants grow again.

Still, the couple has gotten to know the local wildlife well — and saw both the storm and the cleanup upheave it.
“Truck after truck after truck, excavators driving through the river,” Reed said.
The excavator was such a common sight that it earned a nickname: “Carl.”
“We had seen hellbenders and trout during the spring and the summer,” she said. “While we were out here fishing, almost every day.
“You couldn’t pay me to get in that water now. I don’t care how many water tests come back OK.”
Reed’s a bird person. But she hasn’t seen kingfishers or osprey fly over, as they normally do. Sometimes she spots a heron.
She started seeing copperheads frequently after the storm, after having seen none in years. Sharp’s mother and her neighbors started to see bears venturing further out, near homes.

The mine
In recent months, Sharp and Reed noticed work vehicles and excavators constantly coming down the railroad tracks. A neighbor’s Facebook posts shed light on why: a 50-acre mining operation along the Nolichucky in Mitchell County to supply CSX the materials it needed to stabilize a railroad bed.
For those living nearby, the noise was deafening and constant — sometimes going into the early morning hours.
But for Sharp and Reed, it was the air quality that was the most apparent: clouds of dust descending on their home. Reed has systemic lupus, and had started to notice more persistent flares. And Sharp had recently had a cancer scare.
“It gets in the house, it gets in your car, it gets in everything,” Reed said.
Sharp, a licensed drone pilot, captured overhead footage of the active mine. When the Department of Labor learned that the operation was being done without a permit and a judge shut it down days later, his photographs and video accompanied the story across TV stations.

It was, it seemed, another test for a region already exhausted by hurricane recovery.
“Out here after Helene, there were so many people that dipped their fingers into the area,” Reed said. “It’s just fishy … opportunistic.”
In late August, the company’s application for a permit was denied by the Department of Environmental Quality.
“Taking advantage of our area was not the right move,” Sharp said. “It did a lot of people harm, so we fought it. Even though we’ve only lived here a few years… we fought for it to get shut down. This is where we call home.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3564-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

(Luis Alvarez/Getty)A state agency responsible for administering Medicaid in Georgia has failed to adopt or follow through on most of the recommendations made in an earlier audit that were meant to help more children, including those with disabilities, obtain dental care, according to a recent report. 
Despite a 2021 state audit that highlighted falling dental care utilization among a group of Georgia children enrolled in Medicaid, a recent follow-up review found that the situation has worsened.
The 2021 report identified a downward trend in the percentage of children covered by Fee-for-Service Medicaid who received dental care, with it dropping from 44% to 33% over a three-year period. An August report found that this decline has continued.
Participation had fallen further to a new low of 28% in budget year 2024, with the review attributing this decline to a lack of coordinated, data-driven management by DCH.
“DCH was unaware of this trend because it did not routinely analyze claims to evaluate services provided and identify differences between subpopulations and geographic areas,” the 2025 audit stated. “The lack of a data-driven management approach also limited DCH’s ability to develop informed strategies to address deficiencies.”

According to data from DCH, an average of nearly 100,000 children receiving Medicaid benefits, or about 6%, were enrolled in the Fee-for-Service program between January 2021 and August 2025. However, this relatively small population largely represents children who are disabled or receive specialized care.
Georgia administers Medicaid benefits through two different models: Fee-for-Service and managed care organizations. For those enrolled in Fee-for-Service Medicaid, also known as traditional Medicaid, the state directly pays health care providers, including dentists, a fee for each service they provide. For Medicaid plans provided through managed care organizations, known in Georgia as care management organizations, the state pays a fee to a private insurance company that then manages the patient’s care. 
This year’s follow-up review found that the main issues identified in the 2021 audit remain largely unresolved. 
The report found that DCH has since discontinued its quarterly reviews of dental claims data and abandoned “secret shopper” calls, which were meant to assess whether providers were offering appointments to new patients without long wait times. The state agency has also not established utilization goals for its children’s program, nor has it fully analyzed provider networks to accurately reflect the number of dentists accepting new patients, the audit found. 
David Crews, chair of the Board of Community Health’s audit committee, noted the limited progress at the panel’s September meeting. He said the department has “developed a structured and strategic approach to ensure a sustained effort to address these findings and bring the resources necessary to address the findings.” Crews did not provide details on these efforts.
The state “partially addressed” efforts to increase participation from dental care providers in the Medicaid dental program, according to the audit. Although the General Assembly passed a new law last year offering loan forgiveness to dental students who practice in underserved areas, it’s not clear whether the Department of Community Health has specifically used this program to boost the number of dentists in its Fee-For-Service network, according to the follow-up review.
The state has fully addressed a key recommendation to provide more comprehensive dental coverage for adults, which the General Assembly targeted by funding full dental benefits for adults starting in last year’s budget.
Rena Harris, chief program officer for the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities, said in an interview that the audit identified historical issues in the state’s Fee-for-Service program, such as lower provider reimbursement rates than those in a care management organization. She also said the audit encouraged the state agency to adopt procedures in place for care management organizations to help increase access to Medicaid-covered dental services for children with disabilities. 
The agency initially adopted some procedures to address concerns raised in the 2021 audit but eventually “abandoned” those efforts, according to the audit review. The agency, for example, began analyzing Fee-for-Service dental claims and enrollment data trends, but that was eventually discontinued. The review further states that DCH has not shared those findings with a policy compliance specialist assigned to its dental program.
“That’s what the children need. So if they reimplement these processes that halted, that will result in children who receive Fee-for-Service dental care having better access, which will hopefully bring their services on par with the children who receive services through CMO,” Harris said.
Harris said she was encouraged to see DCH’s response in the audit. She said that while DCH did not follow through on earlier recommendations, the agency has since shown accountability and appears “open to restarting the processes that were halted,” some of which were likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 audit noted that dental services expenditures in both Fee-for-Service and managed care declined in fiscal year 2020, likely due to reduced overall utilization of health care services during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s difficult to fully comprehend all of the challenges that were faced during that time, and I know that our state government and our state agencies were incredibly stressed during that time, especially the state agencies that were responsible for people’s health and safety,” Harris said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1169329573-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

They spent kindergarten through fifth grade at the rural Bridgewater-Hebron Village School. Then, they took buses to bigger schools within School Administrative Unit 4: first Newfound Memorial Middle School and then Newfound Regional High School, both in Bristol.
But parents from those three towns disliked the arrangement. The change in schools from fifth to sixth grade was disruptive to their kids’ learning, they argued, and the busing distance to the Newfound schools was inconvenient.
So in 2024, aided by a targeted state law and advocacy from local leaders, residents in each town voted overwhelmingly to leave SAU 4, create their own smaller SAU, and expand the school to serve kindergarten through eighth grade. The new district began operations this summer. 
The withdrawal is part of a trend. New Hampshire towns are increasingly voting to split apart their school districts and go their separate ways. The result: Even as school enrollment has steadily declined, there are now more school administrative units than there were 20 years ago — 105 in 2025 compared with 85 in 2005. 
In 2020, voters in Nottingham withdrew from SAU 44, choosing instead to provide K-8 education to its residents and send students to Dover High School or Coe-Brown Northwood Academy via tuition agreements. Strafford residents also withdrew from SAU 44, leaving behind just Northwood. 
Voters in Cornish, Croydon, Franklin, Goshen, Middleton, Rollinsford, and Wakefield have also opted to spin off their own school districts in the last decade, according to Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association.
The splintering is driven by many factors. Voters in departing school districts crave an increase in control over curriculum and leadership, says Christina. Leaving a larger SAU allows town school boards to choose their own superintendent, for instance, and voters to more directly influence school policy, he said. 
But the trend is now crashing against an opposing force. Republican lawmakers are raising the alarm about the number of school administrative units in the state, citing what they see as unsustainable administrative bloat in public schools. And some are exploring options for the state to rein it in.
“The number of SAUs is up 25% in the last 20 years,” said Sen. Keith Murphy, a Manchester Republican, in an interview.. “And that speaks to the natural tendency of school boards to want more control over the schools in their town. And so we’ve got to find a balance between that, and … the need to make sure state money is being spent responsibly.”
This fall, a bipartisan study committee is meeting to examine the possibility of consolidation. The committee is charged with looking into the current role of SAUs, the existing research on the effects of school consolidation, the feasibility of a county superintendent model, and the effectiveness of the existing school merger process. Members must produce a report by Nov. 1 that could include proposed legislation for the 2026 session. 
Democrats have generally opposed the push to require consolidation, arguing it tramples on local control and is not needed. And a bill in early 2025 to establish county superintendents to oversee all schools within the county was unanimously killed by the House this year. 
That bill, House Bill 765, would have eliminated SAUs and created 12 superintendents: 10 for each county and one each for Manchester and Nashua. It was rejected by the House Education Policy and Administration Committee because lawmakers in both parties objected to making superintendents elected officials. 
Rep. Hope Damon, a Croydon Democrat and member of the study committee, said consolidation decisions should be made carefully, with local expertise. 
“You have to look at what the trade-offs are,” Damon said in an interview. “So if you’re going to have less administrative costs, what services are you not asking the administrators to provide or oversee, and what impact does it have to reduce those services?”
For now, lawmakers in both parties are helping to gather more information about why schools splinter — and whether they would benefit from combining instead. 
Christina said the School Boards Association exists to help school boards navigate the separation process, but not to advise whether they should. That is a question to be decided by voters in those school districts, not his organization, he said.
Still, Christina said there are a number of reasons that could entice a district to leave. Some want to save money by exploring different administrative arrangements. Others feel outvoted by larger towns in their districts on policy and spending decisions. 
“They feel that they are either paying too much and not getting enough in return, or they feel that we just want our own person that the school board gets to hire, gets to fire, gets to contract with, and not having to share that vote or superintendent evaluation process with 15 other school boards.” 
Murphy and other Republicans say overall cost concerns may trump the desires of specific towns to break away. The breaking apart of an SAU means towns now have a smaller tax base to support superintendents and other administrators, they said.
“A superintendent is $100,000-plus person, and if they’re only superintendent-ing 300 kids or something, it’s not very good,” said Rep. Dan McGuire, an Epsom Republican.
“It isn’t just superintendents,” added Murphy. “That’s the top. Then there’s HR departments, and legal departments, and purchasing departments. All those various members.”
But critics say it is not necessarily true that the alternative — consolidation — would save money. In a thesis study released in 2024, Yale University graduate Grace Miller found that the 49 Vermont school districts that had merged since 2015 did not significantly reduce those schools’ per-pupil expenses when compared to districts that did not merge. The savings in administrative costs were generally canceled out by additional expenses in salaries and transportation, Miller found. 
“I do not think that we have, at this point, any confirmation that reducing the number of SAUs is actually going to save money,” said Damon. “I don’t think we have confirmation that it doesn’t save money either.”
And school districts sometimes break apart even while acknowledging that it could increase taxes. In a joint letter to voters ahead of the 2024 town meetings, school boards for Bridgewater, Hebron, and Groton said the goal was not saving money.
“Change is not easy, but it is sometimes necessary,” the letter read. “This is one of those times. Making changes will not result in tax saving, in fact it may slightly increase our taxes to make sure we are doing the right thing for the academic future of our kids.”
To Drew Cline, the chairman of the State Board of Education and the president of the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, even though consolidation and fragmentation are opposite approaches, they may often be motivated by the same instinct: saving money.
“Some of the forces that are driving them apart overlap with the forces that want consolidation,” he said. “… A lot of districts are splitting up on the idea that they feel like they’re overpaying a larger district, and they feel like the administrative costs are out of control, and they feel like they can do this better and more cheaply on their own. And then you see folks saying, ‘Well, maybe if we got (the SAUs) bigger, we can have economies of scale, and that will save us money.’
“So they’re really just trying to figure it out,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Bus2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

If that’s allowed to happen, Ohio will see $363 million less spent on health next year and it will see the demand for uncompensated care go up by $163 million, a 10.3% increase, a new analysis says.
The federal government is on the brink of an end-of -the-month shutdown as Congress debates a stopgap spending measure. One of the sticking points is a Democratic demand that the health subsidies be extended.
Created in 2021, they were intended to make health coverage on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces more affordable. 
Known as an “enhanced premium tax credit,” it’s available to people making up to 400% of federal poverty guidelines. 
For a family of three, that’s between $26,650 and $106,600 a year. Nearly 20 million Americans and 530,000 Ohioans receive it.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The subsidies save the average recipient about $700 a year, but those savings can be nearly $20,000 for some households. 
Their existence is credited with helping to push the percentage of uninsured Americans to an all-time low.
With President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Congressional Republicans this year extended tax cuts heavily skewed toward the wealthy, and they cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending over 10 years. 
At this point, they seem uninterested in extending subsidies to buy health insurance. 
Asked about the matter last month, the offices of Ohio’s Republican U.S. senators, Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, didn’t respond.
A report released last week by the Urban Institute said that if the subsidies are allowed to expire, it could have bad consequences for all Americans.
Ironically, the worst consequences would be felt in Republican-ruled states such as Florida and Texas that didn’t expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That’s because a higher percentage of their residents had to turn to the insurance marketplace for coverage. 
Ohio emergency doc: Medicaid cuts will hurt everybody, close hospitals

Florida will see demand for uncompensated care go up by 18%, the report said. That’s care provided to those who can’t pay. 
Costs for such care fall on the government or hospitals themselves. 
Ohio’s emergency physicians have warned that big increases in such costs will result in longer wait times, reductions in services, and more stress on rural and safety net hospitals.
Nationally, expiration of the subsidies will result in 7.3 million fewer people insured on the marketplace and 4.8 million more uninsured Americans, said the study, which was done with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 
In Ohio, that will mean 0.4% less health spending on the non-elderly, or $363 million less a year. Increased demand to hospitals for uncompensated care will go up 8.9%, it said.
The report said the loss of the subsidies — and the consequent loss of health spending on low-income workers — would be bad for everybody.
“Because lower spending on health care services means lower revenue for health care providers and fewer services rendered, the resulting decline in revenue could have adverse consequences, particularly for already financially at-risk hospitals and the communities they serve,” it said. 
“This loss of health insurance coverage could have significant negative consequences for individuals, as health care use declines and unmet health care needs increase when people become uninsured.”

Enbridge Gas North Carolina is asking for a 12.37% increase to its residential natural gas rates, which it says would result in a $6.30 increase in the average residential customers’ monthly bill. Last week, the North Carolina Utilities Commission heard expert testimony from Enbridge employees on the need for the increase and from the state’s Public Staff, which represents customers in rate cases.
The proposed adjustment is 13% lower than the inflation rate since 2021, the last time Enbridge, then known as the Public Service Company of North Carolina, had a general rate review. (A utility company can also request to increase or decrease its rates because of changes in fuel prices. These recovery riders, as they are known, do not typically require public hearings.)
Enbridge acquired PSNC in 2023 in a $14 billion deal from Dominion Energy. According to Enbridge, it has more than 655,000 customers in 28 counties in the North Carolina.
Enbridge Gas filed for the rate review and adjustment on April 1, and the Utilities Commission held public hearings on the request over the summer, including in Asheville, Gastonia and Statesville. Enbridge has requested that the new rates go into effect Nov. 1, if approved.
Enbridge has said the rate increase is needed to recover costs associated with infrastructure investments to provide natural gas service to customers safely. The company is seeking a higher rate of return on common equity.
Michelle Boswell with the Public Staff wrote in her testimony that the utility company could reduce payroll and benefits to control expenses, noting that the company was able to operate with fewer employees during COVID-19.
But Enbridge has noted that it has gained more than 53,000 customers in North Carolina since 2021, and James Spaulding, financial and business services for Enbridge, rebutted Boswell’s testimony.
He said it was not accurate to use the average headcount from 2022 and 2023 as a basis for ongoing payroll and business expenses.
“To disallow the recovery for these positions would be detrimental to the Company’s need to staff its business adequately,” Spaulding wrote.
In an earnings call last month, management of the Calgary, Canada-based Enbridge Inc., told analysts they were optimistic about the rate review case in North Carolina.
Michelle Heritance, Enbridge’s head of gas distribution and storage, said the company is “very confident” that the case in North Carolina will be approved. She expects to see the outcome in the fall, as well as for Utah, and for new rates to take effect in those jurisdictions by next year.

The bus model of school transportation is trying to rebuild its workforce after the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw many drivers retire and left some families without consistent bus service. (Photo by Robbie Sequeira/Stateline)As a middle-school student in 1980s Philadelphia, Shelley Hunter remembers getting to and from school pretty easily thanks to the city’s public transit service, SEPTA, which had bus and train routes near her home and her school. Sometimes, she even felt comfortable enough to take a city cab.
Now, Hunter is a single mother of two living in Grapevine, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, juggling her unstable housing situation and early and late shifts at a local hospital where she works as an EEG technician.
In a heavily car-dependent area, getting her own kids to school is a lot harder. Her family has been able to use a school-sponsored ride-hailing service, joining a trend that’s quickly gaining acceptance around the country.
“The DFW area isn’t like New York or Philly — there isn’t a train at your door. In some cities here, you can’t even cross to another city by transit,” Hunter told Stateline. “If we’d changed schools every time our housing situation changed and they had no bus route near them, my kids would have switched four or five times in a year. That would have blown up their education.”
Big, yellow and once ubiquitous on early morning or rush-hour streets, the traditional school bus has been undercut by national bus driver shortages, worsened by the pandemic. And with states stretched thin by federal funding cuts, a pathway has opened for an industry of small-car, ride-hailing and private transport services to ferry children to and from school.
Some school districts sign contracts to gather children every morning in cars or transport vans; in other cases parents pay individually for a driver to arrive, Uber-like, and ferry their child off to class.
Growing interest in charter schools and private vouchers will likely bring more business to these alternatives to traditional school buses. And recently, the shift has been helped by new state laws that encourage school districts to embrace new transportation models.
School systems are remaking the old yellow bus into a high-tech machine

A new Idaho law this year, for example, allows school districts to use smaller capacity vehicles to carry schoolchildren, not just yellow buses. Similar new laws in Louisiana and Virginia allow districts to hire ride-hailing companies, though Virginia’s is a two-year pilot program.
New Jersey enacted a law last fall allowing school employees who undergo training and pass background checks to transport up to eight students to and from school in personal vehicles.
And in South Carolina, where the state, rather than individual districts, runs the bus system, lawmakers introduced a privatization bill that would have phased out the state’s ownership and operation of yellow buses. It would have allowed districts to choose their own transportation fleet and contract with private companies.
The bill, which died in committee, also would have required South Carolina to sell or lease its yellow buses by 2029, ending state ownership of the system.
A recent State of School Transportation survey, conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in partnership with HopSkipDrive, a ride-hailing company that supplements school bus service, found that 80% of school administrators say driver shortages are straining their districts, with two-thirds reporting smaller budgets despite rising demand.
Three-quarters of school administrators link poor transportation access to chronic absenteeism. In another survey by the same group, parents, and especially mothers, reported missing work — and sometimes losing their jobs — because they often got stuck in traffic jams that made them late. Respondents reported that students missed meals, tutoring and extracurricular activities.
“When school transportation isn’t running as it should, we see a direct impact on attendance. Families who don’t have reliable alternatives often end up missing school entirely or showing up late, which disrupts learning and stability,” said Miriam Vasquez, executive director of student welfare and attendance at the Alameda County Office of Education in California.
But critics, including the lobbying association for school bus contractors, said the changes could undermine safety.
“Buses are built to withstand collisions in ways no passenger vehicle can,” Curt Macysyn, executive director of the National School Transportation Association, told Stateline. “One bus takes 36 cars off the road, and drivers have specialized training you don’t get anywhere else. I haven’t seen another model that replicates all of those pieces.”

Around 2023, Hunter was stretched thin. She didn’t have a home of her own, so she had been living with her kids at friends’ homes. She spent a lot of money trying to get her children to and from school safely.
At first, Hunter tried Uber and Lyft, but anxiety overwhelmed her with each trip. She began downloading tracking apps and paying friends to accompany her children just to make sure they made it to class safely. But that started becoming too emotionally and financially overwhelming.

It wasn’t until she contacted the school district that she learned she was eligible for help under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, a 1987 law that allows students experiencing homelessness to stay in their original school and receive transportation assistance.
“I never wanted my kids to switch schools because it’s stressful and they learn less,” said Hunter. “I also wouldn’t have known if I was eligible for assistance without asking.”
The district put her in touch with HopSkipDrive.
Operating in 17 states, HopSkipDrive offers a small-vehicle ride-hailing service covered under the McKinney-Vento law for families with unstable housing situations. The company operates similarly to ride-hailing companies such as Uber, but it contracts directly with schools, camps and districts through agreements that usually include a base trip fee plus mileage.
HopSkipDrive co-founder Joanna McFarland isn’t advocating for replacing the yellow bus model, or for shrinking routes or service, she said. Rather, she is lobbying states to allow more flexibility for districts to use small-vehicle services for the hardest-to-reach students.
Vasquez, of Alameda County, works almost exclusively with district students eligible to attend their home schools under the McKinney-Vento law. She noted that some families may not be aware of the transportation benefits available to them, and sometimes have to be persuaded to participate, given the stigma of their situation.
Under McKinney-Vento, districts are legally responsible for providing transportation, but only what’s considered “reasonable.” Vasquez points out that “reasonable” often ends up being a mass transit card or bus pass, which may not necessarily be safe or age-appropriate.
It’s why, she said, Alameda County contracted with HopSkipDrive to fill some of the gaps for those families in 2024.
“It’s very layered. We don’t just need more buses, we need routes that match bell schedules, laws that make it safe to transport younger kids, and case management that makes sure families actually know their options,” said Vasquez.
According to the State of School Transportation survey, roughly a quarter of school administrators say their school or district has cut or shortened bus routes in response to driver shortages.
Drivers keep passing stopped school buses, despite use of cameras to catch them

In Ohio, multiple districts canceled public high school busing this year while still transporting students to private or charter schools under new state mandates. Several New Jersey districts eliminated “courtesy busing,” prompting more walks to school for students within 2 miles. A similar change affected middle and high school students in Florida’s Duval County last year.
“While cutting transportation has become a default option, it has unacceptable consequences,” said McFarland. “What schools really need is a policy that gives them the flexibility to add more tools, like small-vehicle options, so they can get more kids to school, often in less time and at lower cost.”
McFarland told Stateline when she co-founded the service in 2015, she was one of those parents who needed to sacrifice working time to take her kids to school. A decade later, more than 10,000 schools across the country use HopSkipDrive, she said.
Fewer yellow buses
The safest form of transportation to and from school is still the yellow bus, said Macysyn, of the National School Transportation Association. For Macysyn, the COVID-19 pandemic turned a predictable model of school transportation on its head.
During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, many bus drivers retired, left the workforce or in some cases died, and districts have scrambled to find someone to take the wheel, be it substitute teachers, administrators and, sometimes, even parents.
The number of bus drivers decreased by 15% between September 2019 and September 2023, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Private school bus contractors now account for 38% of the nation’s pupil transportation services, according to the National School Transportation Association.
In the changed post-pandemic school transportation system, Macysyn worries that small-car and ride-hailing alternatives will compromise on safety and reliability as they push efficiency and expediency.
“I’ve yet to see anybody replicate the yellow bus system in its entirety,” he said. “The bus, the driver training, the safety standards, the student management and being able to put all of it together and make it work.”
A major focus for yellow bus advocates has been under-the-hood laws, which allow bus driver applicants to earn a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) without having to identify and explain engine components during the road test.
Since then, these laws have passed in 12 states: Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.










Transportation is the entry point to education. Yet every time there’s a budget crunch, buses are the first thing on the chopping block.


– Curt Macysyn, executive director of the National School Transportation Association


Macysyn believes these laws, as well as boosting pay for bus drivers, can rebuild the workforce. He also cautions against privatization bills like the one in South Carolina, arguing that individual vehicles taking kids to school wouldn’t be more cost-effective than the yellow bus model.
“Until you lose it, people don’t realize what would be gone if the yellow bus system disappeared,” he said. “Transportation is the entry point to education. Yet every time there’s a budget crunch, buses are the first thing on the chopping block. If we don’t get kids to school, what happens in the classroom is irrelevant.”
Back in Grapevine, it’s been two years since Hunter first signed up to use the HopSkipDrive service, and though her oldest has graduated, her 13-year-old son still uses it.
Hunter says her children developed personal, intergenerational relationships with their HopSkipDrive driver. She describes her decision to use the service as a “blessing” and says her children’s school commutes have been cut in half.
“The people that are driving are kind to my kids,” Hunter said. “They’re not just driving; they care.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-30 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Rising costs strain Medicaid in CT – before federal cuts are counted,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/30/ct-medicaid-cost-overruns/,"Less than three months into the fiscal year, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration has identified major cost overruns in CT's Medicaid program.","Deep cuts in federal Medicaid assistance aren’t the only threat to health care for needy families and children here.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration has identified major cost overruns in the entitlement program, known as HUSKY in Connecticut, which has struggled to stay out of the red since 2022.
Less than three months into the new fiscal year, the Department of Social Services, which oversees the majority of state Medicaid spending, expects to exceed its $3.7 billion line item by $100 million, Lamont’s budget staff reported in its last monthly report to the comptroller’s office.
The legislature authorized $284 million extra to cover Medicaid cost overruns in 2024-25. And the health care program topped its budget by $166.3 million in 2023-24, according to records from the comptroller’s office.
But it remains unclear whether state officials, who have secured record-setting budget surpluses over the past eight years, will invest more in Medicaid.
“The costs of pharmaceuticals are just astronomical,” Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said last week, adding that continued increases in inpatient hospital costs also are straining the Medicaid budget. “It just costs more to deliver that kind of care.”
Since 2022, pharmaceutical costs covered by Medicaid — after industry rebates have been applied — are up more than $278 million or 47%, according to the department. Inpatient hospital costs over the same period are up $119.3 million or 10.1%.
Hospitals are increasingly faced with Medicaid patients with chronic and complex conditions, said Shantelle Varrs, the department’s deputy commissioner. Increased demand for behavioral health services, staffing shortages and rising medical inflation also are pushing inpatient service costs upward, she added.
Further complicating matters, a temporary boost in federal funding ordered in 2020 in response to the coronavirus has been exhausted.
Congress had boosted assistance to all states five years ago, even as it temporarily blocked them from terminating Medicaid enrollees during the worst of the pandemic. But that “continuous coverage” mandate expired in April 2023, and Connecticut and other states lost their enhanced reimbursements last year.
But while Connecticut’s Medicaid caseload has dropped since that mandate was lifted, the caseload remains about 10% greater than pre-pandemic levels.
An omnibus federal program run cooperatively with states, Medicaid in Connecticut covers medical and behavioral health services, substance abuse treatment, and nursing home and in-home care. It also supports hospitals and federally qualified health centers that treat uninsured and under-insured patients. The program served nearly 926,700 individuals in Connecticut last fiscal year, according to the Department of Social Services, and remains one of the largest programs in state government.
And the legislature has continued to expand Medicaid to meet growing needs.
For example, in January 2023, the state began covering children 12 and younger from families without qualifying immigration status. Initial expectations were that 4,250 kids would be enrolled, but that number reached 15,000 by July 2024.
Legislators this year also took a first step, albeit much smaller than planned, to boost long-neglected Medicaid payments for providers who treat low-income patients.
Connecticut hadn’t raised these reimbursement rates broadly since 2007, leaving many insured patients unable to find physicians who will treat them. Leaders said a $250 million infusion in this area is needed to make a big difference and pledged to get there in four years, starting with $75 million in extra Medicaid spending this fiscal year.
But because of budget caps and savings rules, that $75 million investment ultimately was scaled back to just $15 million in 2025-26.
The General Assembly this year also ordered an $80 million investment in Medicaid funding for health centers. And while Reeves called that a “smart investment,” she said it largely recognizes demand that already has been straining these providers, meaning it won’t necessarily stem ongoing growth in Medicaid costs.
“So, we might not see this turn around for another year or two,” she said.
Meanwhile, Medicaid continues to gobble up an ever-larger share of the state budget.
The $3.7 billion the legislature authorized the department for Medicaid this fiscal year is up 55% from one decade ago, while the General Fund has grown 34% over the same period.
“We are monitoring these trends closely,” Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Monday, noting it’s early in the fiscal year, which began July 1. “As the year progresses, these estimates will likely be revised to reflect changes in the economy, expenditure patterns, or other factors.”
Lamont took some heat last year from his fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority and from health care advocates when his administration launched a study to return the state’s Medicaid program to a model known as managed care.
Connecticut currently uses what’s known as a managed fee-for-service model for its Medicaid program, where the state pays providers directly for services delivered to Medicaid beneficiaries. In managed care, or a traditional “capitated managed care” model, the state instead pays a set monthly fee per member to insurance companies to manage the Medicaid program, and the insurance companies pay providers.
The eventual report, authored by independent consultants, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid program boasts lower costs and similar levels of access when compared to peer states, leading to the conclusion that employing managed care would not likely save the state money, prompting the administration to pull back.
Despite the surging costs in Medicaid, Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, said Monday she believes state legislators will want to invest more in Medicaid, particularly given expectations that new federal cutbacks will eliminate hundreds of millions of dollars annually for vulnerable patients.
Those cutbacks, most of which won’t take effect until next year or later, also will take a heavy toll on nutrition assistance programs.
It still is unclear whether state legislative leaders and Lamont will begin the debate in special session this fall, or in regular session next February, on whether to use state resources to temper federal cutbacks.
Osten and other Democratic leaders say Connecticut has the resources to help, but it likely must scale back savings programs that have channeled more than $1.8 billion annually since 2017 into reducing pension debt and building reserves.
“People are going to have to choose between health care, their rent, mortgage payments and other necessities” like groceries, Osten said, adding a sicker, less productive population will cost Connecticut in terms of economic productivity and demand for care at hospital and health clinic emergency departments.
“I do believe we end up paying,” she said, “one way or another.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Andrea-Barton-Reeves.jpg,,,2025-09-30 05:56:36.367494

Bill DeMora recently introduced a bill that would ban the sale of intoxicating hemp products to people under 21. Unlike some others that have been introduced, this bill would focus solely on hemp and not on changing voter-passed marijuana law.
Ohio Senate Bill 266 would also ban the sale of intoxicating hemp products that have not been tested under the same rules as marijuana and would prevent selling intoxicating hemp products that are “considered attractive to children,” according to the bill’s language.

This bill would prohibit selling an intoxicating hemp product “that bears the likeness or contains the characteristics of a realistic or fictional human, animal, or fruit, including artistic, caricature, or cartoon renderings,” according to the bill’s language. 
“I put this bill in to get rid of the stuff that everybody agrees is bad,” Columbus Democratic state Sen. DeMora said. “Everybody agrees (intoxicating hemp products are) targeted to children to look like Skittles and Oreo cookies and that it’s unregulated. … We need to act because this stuff is poisoning kids (and) making kids sick.” 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has previously asked lawmakers to regulate or ban delta-8 THC products.
“It’s a huge problem,” DeWine said talking to reporters on Monday. “There’s really no regulation at all. We need regulation. We need the legislature to take action on this. We’re also looking, frankly, at some things that I might be able to do without legislative action.”
DeMora thinks marijuana and hemp products should be dealt with separately. 
“Hopefully this bill will, if nothing else, we can all agree on one thing — to get the bad stuff out of the hands of kids and stop the marketing toward kids,” he said. 
The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC. 
Ohio is one of about 20 states that does not have any regulations around intoxicating hemp products, according to an Ohio State University Drug Enforcement and Policy Center study from November 2024. 
This is one of a handful of bills in the Ohio legislature that are trying to regulate intoxicating hemp products. 
Ohio Senate Bill 86 
Ohio Senate Bill 86 would ban intoxicating hemp products sales to anyone under 21, impose a 10% tax on intoxicating hemp products and regulate drinkable cannabinoid products. 
The bill would require intoxicating hemp products to be sold only at adult-use marijuana dispensaries instead of allowing them to be sold at CBD stores, convenience stores, smoke shops, or gas stations. 
It would require intoxicating hemp products to only be sold if the products have been tested and comply with standards for packing, labeling, and advertising.  
Republicans Ohio state Sens. Steve Huffman and Shane Wilkin introduced S.B. 86, which unanimously passed the Ohio Senate in April.  
Ohio Senate Bill 56 
Ohio Senate Bill 56 would regulate intoxicating hemp and change Ohio’s marijuana laws. 
It would only allow a licensed marijuana dispensary to sell intoxicating hemp products that have been tested and complied with packaging, labeling and advertising requirements. 
Huffman, R-Tipp City, introduced S.B. 56 which would have the Ohio Department of Commerce regulate intoxicating hemp products and drinkable cannabinoid products. 
The bill would also reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, limit the number of active dispensaries to 400 and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
S.B. 56 passed in the Senate earlier this year, but has yet to make it out of the House Judiciary Committee. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. 
Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment.
Ohio House Bill 160 
Ohio House Bill 160 mostly deals with potential changes to the state’s marijuana laws, but it also has an intoxicating hemp provision that would require every THC product to only be sold at Ohio’s regulated marijuana dispensaries. 
H.B. 160 would reduce the THC levels in marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap the number of marijuana dispensaries at 350, and reallocate the bulk of marijuana tax revenue to the state’s General Revenue Fund. 
It would ban using marijuana in public spaces and offer expungement for prior convictions for marijuana related offenses. 
It would also make it illegal to purchase marijuana in another state and bring it back to Ohio. 
State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, introduced H.B. 160, which has had three hearings so far in the Ohio House Judiciary Committee.

Mike DeWine is moving forward with a ban on carbonated, sugary drinks from food assistance programs.
The cost of groceries adds up.
“I remember being the kid in elementary school who had lunches that were a bit hodgepodge, or didn’t have the same types of meals that other people did,” Ohioan Lis Regula said.
This is why Regula said he was grateful to get some help from the government when he was growing up.
“It is still a crucial gap-fill for [people] to be able to meet their family’s nutritional needs,” he said.
He was one of the around 1.5 million Ohioans using food stamps, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), to help buy groceries.
But DeWine’s SNAP working group wants to make some restrictions.
The state-led coalition of health and business leaders just released a report recommending that Ohio ban SNAP benefits from being used for pop or energy drinks — carbonated beverages high in sugar or drinks with sweeteners.
“I don’t think we should have a policy in this state where we are essentially subsidizing diabetes in children by buying pop with food stamps,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said during the budget process in the spring.
Stewart and the GOP put a similar type of provision in the state budget, but DeWine vetoed it, saying the language was too broad.
“Ohio should restrict beverages that list sugar, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, or similar caloric sweeteners as the primary ingredient or as the second ingredient if the first ingredient is carbonated water, as displayed on an individual product’s Nutrition Facts label regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration…” the workgroup report states. “Importantly, this definition does not exclude foods that support nutrition.”
Democrats thought it could impact juices or drinks like Gatorade. These would be carved out under the proposed policy.
“Overly broad restrictions could limit access to products essential for infants, individuals at nutritional risk, and those recovering from illness or surgery,” the report states, indicating that products like Pedialyte would still be covered.
The working group was meant to not just evaluate the idea, but also help with a federal waiver request, which would allow Ohio to restrict SNAP.
The language was modeled after several other states’ waivers.
If approved, Ohio would join 12 other states like Texas and Florida in restricting soda pop.
“I support not using SNAP to purchase these beverages,” DeWine said in July.
Regula said this infringes on personal liberty and could increase stigma for kids whose families make less money.
“It keeps a kid from being able to have soda at their birthday party,” he said. “What really is the point of that?”
Stewart argued that this is meant to promote health and responsibility.
“When you’re using the taxpayers’ money to buy your food, I think taxpayers have an ability to say, ‘We’re not going to buy junk food with it,'” Stewart said.
DeWine’s spokesperson said that the office is in the process of formalizing the waiver soon, as the deadline is in late October.
The governor is also looking into a waiver that would allow for prepared chicken to be available with SNAP benefits.
Right now, consumers can only buy cold chicken; the workgroup recommended asking to allow for hot rotisserie chicken.

(Jill Hummels for the Kansas Reflector)Many of my columns for Kansas Reflector have focused on agricultural topics. In recent weeks, I’ve heard from folks in Kansas and elsewhere, with the most of those comments coming from people having a connection to agriculture.
But their concerns stretch far beyond grain prices and the overall agricultural outlook. They go to the core of who we are as a country, and they caused me to reflect on past events in my own life, and to draw some parallels from those events to the present.
In 1985, I took a two-week business trip around the world. One of the stops was in Mumbai, India. Upon walking into the terminal, I saw dozens of soldiers with machine guns, with their fingers on the triggers. That shook me that day, and I have never forgotten that moment. Little did I think that, one day in America, we would see the same thing. Those displays of “power” provide no calm; instead, they provoke fear and uncertainty. There has not been any let-up in these tawdry displays of raw power since Trump took office.
The common theme in comments about my columns has been a deep concern about the viability of our democracy.
It was apparent that the writers were not members of the radical left. Instead, they were from folks whom I would refer to as ordinary Americans. (I attach no negative connotations to that description.) Many expressed disgust at the absolute failure of our elected representatives in Kansas, and others, to show any sense of loyalty to the Constitution, and to the people whom they are supposed to serve.
My correspondents share a common concern about how far we have fallen as a nation. Cruelty and incompetency are the modus operandi for this administration.   President Donald Trump is learning some hard lessons about throwing his weight around with other countries, many of whom once had at least a semblance of trust in the United States. Take your pick — Brazil, China, India — to name a few. And then there is Russia, with the pathetic display at the so-called Alaska summit.
The damage done to Kansas farmers and their cohorts across the nation will take years, if at all, to be repaired.
The broader picture requires us to ponder whether we are at an inflection point in this country. The vitriol is awful.  While I understand the right of free speech, one of the first things that I learned in law school, per the late Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, is that you can’t shout fire in a crowded theater.  At this point in time in our nation, there are many fires burning, and they have been set by our friends and neighbors.  The monster of unchecked social media is fueling the fire.
When we citizens, and those who represent us in Washington, know the lessons of history but allow them to be repeated, we fail at the moral duty that is at the heart of a democratic and enduring society.
Lies have become truth in the eyes of the Trump faithful. The premise is that if the lie is repeated often enough, it must be the truth. Outrage always comes first, rather than reason or compassion.
Sad to say, but I believe with all of my heart that an inflection point is near for our country. That is the message—loud and clear—that stands out from all the remarks from others about my columns. We have endured new political assassinations and violence, while our leaders seem unable or unwilling to unify Americans.
I remind those of you who read this of the famous words of our late President John F. Kennedy, who said “ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for your country.” As Kennedy reminded us, we have a civic duty — not to tear our country apart, but to build it together.
The crossroads are in sight. What will future generations say about us?

Photo from Getty Images.“We’re in a hell of a mess here,” said Ohio farmer Chris Gibbs as he worked on his combine at the start of harvest season. 
“A severe cash flow mess,” he sighed. “A working capital mess.” 
Gibbs, who farms more than 500 acres of corn, soybeans, wheat, and alfalfa hay in Shelby County, along with a 90-head cow-calf operation, described the five-alarm fire raging in the farming community from Trump’s blanket tariffs.
Some growers have called the fallout from his chaotic trade war, and the reciprocal tariffs it provoked, a “farmageddon” that could ruin what made rural America great. 
It’s that bad.
The Trump tariffs are shrinking incomes and exploding expenses for farmers, who, thanks to a president they still overwhelmingly support, fear losing their farms. 
Many don’t know how much longer they can hang on. 
Trump’s punitive tariffs on foreign buyers made their crops less competitive in markets around the world (and drove down prices more) while other senseless tariffs on fertilizer, steel, aluminum, and lumber just sent the cost of doing business through the roof.
The double whammy of Trump tariffs is especially painful for family farms that make up about 87% of all farms in Ohio. 
Individual farmers struggle to break even, buy supplies, sell their crops, and build a sustainable future with long-term customers. 
But the current tariff dance with Trump keeps them up nights.
Everything a farmer buys “from phosphate and potash to agricultural chemicals, herbicides, machine parts, is up by 50% over the last decade, while our proceeds from the sale of crops is down by 40%,” said fifth-generation Ohio farmer Joe Logan. 
The former president of the Ohio Farmers union — a group focused on family farmers — maintained “the industrial agricultural community is chugging right along, raking in billions of dollars” while family farmers are not making any money. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Instead, they’re battling irrational tariffs, rising costs, high interest rates, farm bankruptcies and abiding dread. 
How will they move crops without buyers or the major trade deals Trump promised to fix what he broke?  
Farmers felt the same creeping despair with the tariff debacle of 2018 when Trump first slapped punitive tariffs on crucial exporters of American crops, including China. 
The move caused a tidal wave of financial disaster for U.S. farms and irreparably damaged trade relations abroad.  
“Farmers, agribusiness and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) had invested millions of dollars and decades of time to cultivate foreign markets like those in China,” explained Logan, “which, up until that point, bought most of our soybeans.” 
But the biggest crop farmed in Ohio was fated to lose its biggest customer then and now. 
In 2018, Trump destroyed enduring trade deals in overseas markets and “the trust that we had built over the previous 30 years,” Gibbs said. 
“That left us with acute losses because of retaliatory tariffs, primarily from China.”
The U.S. soybean crop dropped 20% in value overnight in the summer of 2018, recalled the farmer from west central Ohio.
“I came out swinging pretty hard with that and was very critical of the president and the policy at the time.”
The tariff madness was enough for Gibbs, a lifelong Republican and former chairman of the Shelby County GOP, to leave his party in 2019 and join forces with state Democrats as an advocate for rural Ohio and America. 
Then came 2025 and another blast of Trump tariffs to hammer farmers with shattered export markets and rising input costs.
“This is déjà vu all over again,” Gibbs griped. “We’re back in the same situation but only worse. In the major commodities, corn, wheat, soybeans, sorghum, rice, cotton, prices are below the cost of production, so there’s built-in loss. But we also have exorbitant costs that never recovered since Covid.” 
Plus, the front-end cost of farming has been jacked up by Trump tariffs on seed, fertilizer, and machinery. 
Farmers in already-thin margins are getting crushed.  
Tariffs on imported goods have made it more expensive for them to farm while retaliatory tariffs, imposed by other countries, (in response to Trump’s trade war) mean fewer American crops being sold and, when they are, at lower prices. 
It’s a no-win gambit for farmers and the ag industry that generates over $9 trillion in economic activity and supports millions of jobs.
Last year, China accounted for 54% of U.S. soybean exports. This year it bought zero so far.
Not a single soybean from U.S. farmers.
Chinese buyers turned to Brazil and other suppliers for the crop in 2018. U.S. soybean trade with China never fully recovered. 
“We did hear that China made a big purchase recently,” said Logan, “but unfortunately that purchase was from Argentina rather than the U.S., so we’re in a world of hurt.” 
He believes more farmers are waking up to the hollowness of Trump’s promises for a “golden age” through tariffs but expect the government to bail them out again like it did in 2018.
Trump floated using tariff revenue as farm subsidies. 
Farmers will wait, because what choice do they have? And sweat. 
“I used to tell my son, when he was just getting started, until you wake up in the middle of the night, 2:30 in the morning, and you got sweat rolling down your face, you haven’t really experienced what it is to farm,” Gibbs said with a rueful laugh. “I’m feeling that now, 49 years in. It’s hard.”

Ford/Maryland Matters)State officials have been doing what they can to connect Maryland residents with food, housing, health care and financial resources ahead of a looming government  shutdown.
What they can’t do is make the White House and Congress come to an agreement that would head off the shutdown that is scheduled to hit at 12.01 a.m. Wednesday.
“There’s rumors that the Trump administration is going to use the shutdown as an excuse to lay off … people,” said Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s). “It’s a scary time for them.”
After a meeting between President Donald Trump (R) and congressional leaders at the White House ended without an agreement Monday afternoon, Vice President JD Vance said bluntly, “We’re headed to a shutdown.”
Maryland has already lost the most federal jobs of any state, shedding more than 15,000 federal jobs since Trump took office in January, and the administration has directed agency heads to prepare for large-scale layoffs if a shutdown occurs.
Even without layoffs, a shutdown could threaten a large part of Maryland’s workforce — the state had an estimated 269,000 federal workers in 2023, according to a report from the Maryland Department of Labor.
“Marylanders should not have to bear the consequences of political games that put their paychecks, healthcare and security at risk,” David Turner, the communications director for Gov. Wes Moore (D), said in a statement. “At every step, the governor’s priority is making sure that Marylanders know their state will stand with them.”
‘We’re headed to a shutdown’: White House talks end with no deal as deadline nears

He said the state has been working to connect Maryland residents with resources to help cope with a shutdown, including career transition support and increased administration of both unemployment insurance and interest-free loan programs for furloughed workers.
“The potential mass firing of more federal workers and furloughing tens of thousands of contractors in Maryland as the result of shutdown will only further jeopardize both our citizens’ livelihoods and Maryland’s economy,” the statement said.
Lewis said that besides the large number federal employees in Maryland’s workforce, the state is also home to federal contractors or researchers, meaning a government shutdown could have a “ripple effect” on the economy. Nearly 11% of Maryland’s gross domestic product came from the federal government in 2023, according to a report from the Maryland Department of Labor.
Legislation to provide emergency assistance to furloughed workers was passed during a long government shutdown in the first Trump administration, and that fund is still operational, according to Lewis. The fund was also expanded to provide support to federal workers who have been laid off.
“Maryland’s going to stand ready to try to help our citizens where and how we can,” he said.
The Maryland Labor Department has resources like the Federal Shutdown Loan Program for essential workers — those who have to work without pay during a shutdown, but get back pay after it ends —  and unemployment insurance for furloughed workers, according to a statement from Labor Secretary Portia Wu.
The state provides these resources along with support for laid off federal workers, such as other types of unemployment insurance and support in finding a new job, according to the statement. Many Maryland counties have also offered job fairs to help federal workers transition into a new role.
“A federal government shutdown creates immediate financial hardship for our dedicated public servants,” the statement said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
On Capitol Hill Monday, lawmakers came out to support companion bills by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) aimed at helping workers through any shutdown. The Help Federal Employees During Shutdons — or Help FEDS — Act would require that states allow essential federal workers, who have to work without pay during a shutdown, to apply for unemployment insurance.
Elfreth said she remains hopeful her Republican colleagues will listen to their “better angels” on helping federal workers.
“I think everybody is up here because we happen to be optimistic in nature. You couldn’t really be a politician in this Congress without being an optimist,” she said.
“Many federal employees live in all 435 congressional districts, and so our colleagues are going to have their own constituents working on Wednesday if we shut down without a paycheck,” Elfreth said. “It’s just about calling forth everybody’s better angels in this moment, at least on this issue.”
The lawmakers were joined by Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which she said represents nearly 160,000 federal employees and 38 federal agencies nationwide.
“My hope is that everyone works together to provide the necessary resources to fund the government, deliver services to the American people and avoid a wasteful and costly government shutdown,” she said. “I am grateful for the people standing behind me today that are willing to stand up and support federal employees.”

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland State Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis told the state board of elections in August that he has worked with the U.S. Department of Justice on its request for state elections data, but apparently that’s not good enough for state Republicans.
Maryland House Republicans wrote to DeMarinis Friday to say they don’t believe the Justice Department request violates Maryland law, which limits access to the registered voter database. DeMarinis has so far balked at the request, out of concerns that some of what has been requested contains sensitive, personally identifying information.
“As you are aware, Maryland citizen groups have long voiced concerns about the integrity and accuracy of voter registration data,” House Republicans write. “Discrepancies have been noted, but no meaningful explanations have been offered. We believe that providing clarity on the process will help restore public confidence and ensure the integrity of our electoral process. Refusing to provide information to the DOJ demonstrates a lack of good faith in ensuring the security of our voting records for our citizens.”
In Maryland, information on the state’s 4.3 million voters can be accessed legally when used for electoral purposes, with Democrats and Republicans typically using the lists for campaigning, for campaigning. Besides providing the feds with the process for requesting the voting list, DeMarinis said he also asked about the electoral purpose of the Justice Department request. He told the board that the response was to demand the list with all personally identifiable information.
Nearly 30 states including Maryland have received such requests, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and public policy organization. Many have turned down the request or supplied copies that are already available to the public.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

The requests maybe be part of an effort by President Donald Trump to build a national voter database, according to the New York Times. So far, the Justice Department has filed lawsuits against California, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and New Hampshire, seeking court orders for the records.
House Republicans noted the lawsuits to DeMarinis, adding, “We hope that Maryland can avoid costly litigation.”
Chief changes
Old hands are becoming new chiefs of staff for Maryland legislators on Capitol Hill.
Jim Notter, a longtime staffer for Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), will move over to become the new chief for Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D). He replaces Zephranie Buetow, a former Homeland Security assistant secretary of legislative affairs, whose hiring was praised in January by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies for ensuring diversity in congressional staffs.
Notter has worked in Hoyer’s office for more than a dozen years, the last two of which as Hoyer’s chief of staff. Before joining Hoyer’s office, Notter worked for former Maryland Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes.
Notter’s replacement is Margaret Mulkerrin, who previously served as Hoyer’s deputy chief of staff and has worked for the congressman since 2021. After a press conference Monday on Capitol Hill, Hoyer called the chief changes “good news” for both him and Alsobrooks.
“Angela called me up and she said, ‘I want to get a new chief of staff.’ Jim had been interested in that job,” Hoyer said Monday. “She asked me if that would OK. I said, ‘I want you to succeed, Angela. I want you to have the best.’”
He then looked toward Mulkerrin and said, “I had a wonderful, wonderful alternative.”
McCray the author
In addition to being an electrician, entrepreneur and elected official, Sen. Cory McCray (D-Baltimore City) can now add the title of his author to his resume.
McCray’s book, “The Apprenticeship that Saved My Life: Guidebook to Navigating the Earn-While-You-Learn Opportunity of a Lifetime,” was officially released Tuesday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The 42-year-old senator said he began working on the book project in June 2022. He said the book not only delves into personal details of his youth (incarcerated at age 13 for 30 days at Cheltenham Youth Facility in Prince George’s County for possession of a stolen firearm), but it is also a “self-help guide” for facing the unknown without fear (walking inside a large red-and-blue building in Southwest Baltimore to start an electrician apprenticeship program in 2003).
He graduated from the program five years later. He’s a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 24, but he’s also been into real estate with his company, McCray Properties, and has run for office.
A goal summary highlights each chapter, but also includes definitions, as in chapter 9’s “Understanding the Different Trade Apprenticeships,” which goes into the work of carpenters, electricians and roofers. Afterward, the book talk about how those trades can expand into health care, information technology and videography.
McCray, first elected to Hiuse of Delegates in 2014, has continuously advocated for apprenticeship programs as another avenue for young people who may not be ready to attend a college or university after high school graduation.
“It’s a guidebook for students, but the secondary audience is the most important: parents, teachers, guidance, counselors and mentors,” McCray said Monday. “Those are the folks that’s giving these young folks direction and giving them a framework that they can keep referencing to go back to.”
Those writing blurbs for the book inculde Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) and former U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez (D), and the foreword was written by Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D), who meet McCray in the spring of 2010, when he was a mayoral staffer.
“To those who read this book: I hope you recognize it for what it is — a love letter to the forgotten, the overlooked, and the underestimated. And in doing so, I hope you come to understand the incredible journey of a young man who once found himself behind walls, only to rise as one of the greatest public servants, husbands, and fathers I have ever known.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/board-of-elections-scaled-newsletter1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-09-30 03:56:26.416181

That is false.,"The cornerstone of our representative democracy is trust in our election process. As Secretary of the State and chief elections officer in Connecticut, my priority has always been to keep elections secure and accessible to all eligible voters.
That requires being proactive, working with registrars, town clerks, and federal and state partners to adopt best practices. But it also requires addressing any gaps when fraud or misconduct arises.

Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas
Recent articles claimed election fraud cases in our state failed to inspire a legislative response. That is false. They were immediately answered by legislation, proposed and championed by my office, to address the issue in the following elections.
In the last three years, the General Assembly has passed legislation adding new requirements on how absentee ballots are dated and marked, camera surveillance for ballot drop boxes, new restrictions for circulating absentee ballot applications, and expanded the definition of vote interference. This year alone, legislators approved new laws to extend the role of election monitors in Bridgeport, fund a public education campaign on absentee ballots, and strengthen curbside voting rules. These are tangible, immediate safeguards that make our elections more secure.
Election fraud is a direct attack on our institutions. The Bridgeport absentee ballot cases deserve a forceful response, and the combination of indictments and new legislation is that response.
Our work is not finished. We will continue to press for laws that protect both election integrity and access. No eligible voter should lose the right to cast a ballot in the name of security.
Fraud in Connecticut is exceedingly rare, and when it occurs, it is met with decisive action. Claims of “Faustian bargains” or a “dirty state” are not only false but dangerous to the democratic institutions that protect us all.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Attorneys for Colorado immigrant-rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra argued in a new court filing Monday that her six-month detention is unconstitutional.
They want a federal judge to grant her an immediate release or hold a bond hearing.
“She’s now been detained for longer than six months. At this point, the burden shifts to establish that continued detention is actually necessary,” Laura Lichter, one of Vizguerra’s attorneys, told reporters following a vigil outside the Aurora immigration detention center where Vizguerra is incarcerated.
“There’s not going to have much of a basis to do that, because Jeanette is not dangerous. She’s not going to run away,” Lichter said. “She wants to be right here doing what she’s been doing, fighting for her legal rights, within the warm embrace of her family outside of this private prison.”

The new filing rests on precedent set by a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court case. The government has about three weeks to respond.
Vizguerra, a longtime activist for the labor movement and immigrant rights, has been held at the Aurora facility since March, when she was arrested outside the Target store where she worked amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. Her lawyers immediately sought her release, alleging in a habeas corpus petition that she is being retaliated against in response to her constitutionally-protected speech and protest.
Vizguerra, who has lived in the United States for nearly three decades, has been publicly critical of President Donald Trump, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the country’s immigration system in general. She gained national attention when she sought sanctuary in a Denver church to avoid deportation during Trump’s first term, landing on Time Magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people.
“This administration, we believe, went after Jeanette and targeted her for who she is, for what she represents and what she means to this community,” Lichter said. “It’s not just shameful, but it’s unconstitutional.”










This administration, we believe, went after Jeanette and targeted her for who she is, for what she represents and what she means to this community ... It’s not just shameful, but it’s unconstitutional.


– Laura Lichter, Jeanette Vizguerra's attorney


Immigration authorities, however, say Vizguerra is a “convicted criminal alien,” referring to 2009 conviction of using a false Social Security number. She also pleaded guilty to entering the country illegally in 2013 — she had returned to Mexico to see her dying mother — and was sentenced to a year of probation.
Federal lawyers are relying on a 2013 reinstated removal order to justify Vizguerra’s detention and an effort to deport her, but her lawyers argue that the order was filed illegally and carries no weight. She has received several stays of removal since then, the most recent expiring last year.
Vizguerra addressed the crowd gathered outside the detention facility on Monday night through a video call.
“From the beginning, me making my case public meant that I became a target for the government, because I made them uncomfortable,” she said, translated by Miriam Ordoñez, the immigrant rights coordinator for the American Friends Service Committee.
“For the first time, I feel vulnerable. I feel my health is deteriorating,” she said. “I am extremely worried for my family and I need to be out with them.”
Vizguerra called for a boycott of the commissary and phone services within immigration detention centers across the country during the first week of each month so people who are detained can “stop these profits and take back our power.”
Ordońez said it takes between $80 and $100 to “survive” in a detention center like the one in Aurora, which averages about 1,100 detained people per day. Phone calls can cost about $1 per minute, and a pack of ramen noodles costs $7.

(Photo by Brittany Britto/Capital News Service)State officials said Monday they will close the 44-year-old Maryland Correctional Institution at Jessup, citing the prohibitive cost of renovating the Anne Arundel County facility.
More than 700 inmates and hundreds of staff — the facility is budgeted for 308 positions — will be transferred to other facilities ahead of the planned June 2026 closure of MCI-Jessup. Closure of the facility is projected to save roughly $21 million in annual operation costs, according to a statement issued Monday afternoon by Gov. Wes Moore (D).
“MCI-J has long outrun its facility lifespan and we refuse to kick the can further down the road,” Moore’s statement said. “Our plan to close this facility will save taxpayers money, ease strain on our hardworking and dedicated correctional staff, and honor the state’s commitment to meeting every Marylander with humanity, including incarcerated individuals.”
The facility, opened in 1981, is a medium security facility housing 709 inmates. The prison was an annex of the Maryland House of Correction, which was closed in 2007.
Moore, in the statement announcing the closure, said “prolonged underinvestment in routine and preventive maintenance have contributed to building and infrastructure degradation across the facility.”
Officials said the buildings at the facility suffer from foundation issues. Others have drainage problems. Renovating the property including grading, asphalt, plumbing and electrical upgrades and roofing could cost $200 million and take years to complete, according to Moore’s statement.

The decision to close the prison is “a fiscally responsible step forward for our state,” according to Maryland General Services Secretary Atif Chaudhry.
“By closing MCI-J, we’re saving Maryland taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in avoidable costs over the long term and refocusing our resources on more sustainable correctional solutions,” Chaudhry said in the statement.
Services including adult basic education, high school diploma equivalency, special education, vocational trade programs, job readiness, work release, public safety works and apprenticeship programs will be moved to other facilities, along with post-secondary education programs from the University of Baltimore, Georgetown University, Goucher College, Bowie State University and Wor-Wic Community College.
Consolidation of the facility will allow the state to redeploy staff to other prisons.
The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services has long struggled with understaffing, leading to increased overtime for the department and safety issues. The Jessup prison is budgeted for 308 staff.
“Adequate staff is proactive security,” said Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Secretary Carolyn J. Scruggs. “By shifting staff to surrounding facilities, we will not only provide coverage needed to deter incidents and make our facilities safer, but we can minimize the costly, constant and exhausting cycle of mandatory overtime, improve morale and reduce burnout.”
Moore said the state will work with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Emplouyees, the union that represents staff at the prison, during the closure process.
As part of the effort to close the prison, those incarcerated there will be transferred in phases. In the first phase, older prisoners serving life sentences as well as those with disabilities who require housing under the Americans with Disabilities Act will be moved first.
After that, others will be transferred to other state prisons including the Maryland Correctional Institution at Hagerstown, the Roxbury Correctional Institution in Hagerstown, and the North Branch Correctional Institution in Cumberland. Individuals will be transferred based on individual security needs, according to the statement.
Once closed, the buildings will be “shuttered and winterized” at a cost of about $1.5 million. Moore said the state will decide the future of the property later.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MD-prison-e1443819223464-1.jpg,,,2025-09-29 23:56:27.585689

(Photo by Chalabala/stock.adobe.com)The Maryland Attorney General’s Office is reviewing an Anne Arundel County judge’s decision to dismiss charges against two county police officers in connection with a high-speed chase that resulted in the death of a passenger in the car they were chasing in 2023
The attorney general’s office said Monday that it is “reviewing the court’s decision to determine next steps” in that case against officers Eddie Vasquez and Kieran Schnell.
When they were indicted in December on misconduct in office charges stemming from the chase, they became first officers charged by the attorney general’s Independent Investigations Division, which was created by the General Assembly in 2021 to investigate cases involving police officers that result in death or injuries likely to result in death.
The Anne Arundel County Police Department said in a statement that both officers, with the rank of corporal, were reinstated “to full-duty status” after last Tuesday’s ruling. Schnell is a six-year veteran of the department, while Vasquez has five years.
The charges stemmed from a December 2023 chase that began when Schnell followed a vehicle with its headlights off traveling 92 mph in a 35-mph zone on Fort Smallwood Road. Vasquez soon joined the chase. After more than 2 miles, at speeds reaching up to 109 mph, the car crashed into a utility pole, killing passenger Damione Gardner, 22.

The driver, Meziah Johnson, now 25, survived. According to court records, he pleaded guilty in June to negligent manslaughter, drug possession and theft up to $25,000.
At a hearing last week for the officers, Anne Arundel County Circuit Judge Stacy McCormack said the state hadn’t reached the burden necessary for the case to proceed. She also said the state did not prove that “compelled statements” made by the officers during an internal affairs investigation were kept separate between the attorney generals’ investigations division and the attorneys preparing for the trial.
“The burden is an affirmative one,” the judge said. “The AG must demonstrate that its evidence is not tainted by any direct or indirect exposures to the compelled testimony.”
“I think it’s very important to note that I understand that this is a serious case involving an accident where an individual lost his life,” the judge said, before dismissing the charges.
Andrew Jezic, an attorney representing Vasquez, said Monday both officers were back on duty about 45 minutes after the judge’s ruling.
“These are good officers. Their main focus was getting these two guys out of the car and into the hands of the emergency personnel,” Jezic said. “This ruling could not have benefited finer, more dedicated officers and extremely nice young men.”
After Vasquez “wiped away his tears” and hugged family and friends, Jezic said one of the first statements Vasquez said to him, “I can’t wait to get back out on the road.”
“This has been an incredibly stressful experience for him,” Jezic said. “I don’t think he did anything wrong.”
Jennifer Donelan, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, said in an email the division has completed 80 investigations of officers, and nearly none of them found officers had broken the law, but “when they did, we took action.”
“Throughout the process, we publicly release case information, body cam footage, and post updates to our website, all to keep the public informed on the latest developments in our cases,” she said. “This commitment to transparent reporting ensures that the community remains informed and that the IID is held accountable for its work.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AdobeStock_72920225-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-29 22:58:04.551102

Jeff Landry shakes hands with a Louisiana National Guard member during a May 10, 2024, trip to the Texas-Mexico border. (Governor's Office photo)Gov. Jeff Landry has formally asked the federal government to support a yearlong activation of up to 1,000 members of the Louisiana National Guard, pointing to the Trump administration’s “successful model” of deploying the military in Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee.
Landry’s office announced Monday evening he had sent a letter to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth with his request.
“Louisiana currently faces a convergence of elevated violent crime rates in Shreveport, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans coupled with critical personnel shortages within local law enforcement,” the governor wrote. “These manpower shortages limit their ability to effectively address this public safety threat and consequently, incidents of homicide, carjacking, and gang-related violence, significantly exceed the national average.”
The governor’s letter asks for federal assistance through the end of fiscal year 2026, which is Sept. 30 of next year.
Landry’s “proposed mission and scope” for Guard members would be “to deploy throughout the state to urban centers, support law enforcement presence in high-crime areas, provide logistical and communications support, and secure critical infrastructure,” according to his letter.
“All operations will adhere to established rules for use of force and prioritize community outreach, to ensure transparency and public trust,” the governor continued.
Landry’s request comes as members of the Tennessee National Guard are expected to arrive this week in Memphis, Tennessee. Gov. Bill Lee said the military members will not carry weapons or make arrests unless asked by local police, the Tennessee Lookout reported.
“Since taking office, we have made real progress in driving down crime across Louisiana — but the job is far from finished,” Landry said in a statement. “Federal partnerships in our toughest cities have worked, and now, with the support of President Trump and Secretary Hegseth, we are taking the next step by bringing in the National Guard. This mission is about saving lives and protecting families. To the criminals terrorizing our communities: your time is up. Law and order are back in Louisiana.”
In recent weeks, Trump has indicated he would deploy the military to other cities around the U.S., frequently mentioning Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans and most recently Portland, Oregon. The Republican president has also authorized the use of California National Guard members and Marines in Los Angeles, over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Landry has openly supported Trump’s suggestions to deploy troops to Louisiana cities. Earlier this month, the president indicated he was deciding between Chicago and New Orleans.
“Do we go to Chicago? Or do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite tough, quite bad,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
Last month, Landry committed 135 members of the Louisiana National Guard to support President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department. Trump declared a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital, despite its violent crime rate reaching a 30-year low.

(Getty Images)The virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic is still circulating, but some Alaskans seeking to be vaccinated against the disease may have to wait for that service.
State health officials continue to recommend wide use of COVID vaccines, according to a newly released bulletin from the Alaska Division of Public Health epidemiology section.
The wording of that recommendation, however, is modified to reflect newly released guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Health care providers should recommend vaccination “for all eligible patients” at least 6 months old, “especially considering those who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 infection,” the bulletin said.
That is slightly different wording from previous state recommendations, which was more general. The subtle change puts state recommendations in line with what the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended on Sept. 19: that anyone at least 6 months of age should be vacationed as “determined by individual decision-making.”
Advisory committee members who made the recommendation were appointed by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., a critic of vaccines. Kennedy fired all members of the previous board, which had recommended the vaccinations without the same qualifications.
Alaska’s COVID-19 case numbers have been declining since the peak of the pandemic, as they have globally, and the past year’s records were part of that trend, the epidemiology bulletin. Case counts are reported through laboratory testing and emergency room visits. The totals do not reflect cases among people who tested themselves but did not report the results.
Over the last COVID-19 season, which runs from early autumn to the end of summer, August was the month with the most lab-confirmed cases, totaling over 1,000 in number. That contrasts with seasonal trends in the rest of the nation, where there are surges in the disease during the winter.

	Alaska’s higher August numbers may reflect the flow of more people in and out of the state at that time of the year, said Sarah Aho, the Division of Public Health’s immunization program manager and a co-author of the bulletin.
“There’s a lot of travel in August,” she said.
COVID-19 vaccines are currently available in Alaska, mostly in pharmacies, Aho said. People who want to use those pharmacy services should have no problem doing so, even if they are not over 65 or otherwise in a group that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices considers to be at elevated risk, she said.
“There should be no issue for someone who wants a COVID vaccine to receive one,” she said.
Alaska is one of many states where pharmacies are allowed to provide vaccines without prescriptions. Pharmacies gained that authority in a 2022 bill that was passed by state lawmakers and signed into law. In some other states, that authority for pharmacists is new.
Beyond pharmacies, there are some vaccine supply problems in the state, Aho said. The delay is especially affecting pediatric offices that depend on supplies through the state program, which has not yet ordered the vaccines, she said.
Children who would be vaccinated at their pediatricians’ offices might have to wait until mid- or late October, she said.
The delay might affect some rural communities, where clinics also depend on supplies from the state program, she said.
Before ordering COVID vaccines, state officials are waiting for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, or acting director, to sign off on recommendations, Aho said.
“As soon as it happens, we are ready to start ordering and delivering,” she said. “Our intent is to have it wildly available.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/vaccinekids5andyounger-scaled-1-1024x6831692734565-1.jpeg,,,2025-09-29 22:58:04.551102

Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, following the annual State of the State address on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025, in the Alaska Capitol. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Monday vetoed his ninth bill of the year, canceling Alaska lawmakers’ efforts to fund public schools by rewriting a portion of the state’s corporate tax code.
Senate Bill 113, passed by the Alaska House and Senate in May by a combined vote of 42-18, would have required internet companies to pay corporate income taxes based on the location of their sales, not the location of their server farms or offices. 
That shift, already enacted by 36 other states, would have required companies like Netflix and Hulu, which do not have any in-state business presence, to pay corporate taxes based on sales to Alaskans. That shift was expected to generate between $25 million and $65 million per year for the state treasury once fully implemented.
In House Bill 57, which increased the state’s per-student public school funding formula, lawmakers included provisions that directed much of that money to vocational and technical instruction, as well as grants intended to help elementary school students improve their reading.
Without SB 113, those programs will not receive additional money.
In 2022, Dunleavy and the Legislature collaborated on the Alaska Reads Act, legislation intended to boost the reading skills of young Alaskans. Initial results have shown some benefits, and funding in SB 113 was intended to expand upon that effort. 
But in a message accompanying Monday’s veto, Dunleavy said he will not approve any tax measures unless they are part of a larger plan intended to bring state income and expenses into line over the long term.
Dunleavy said he wants to see a “truly durable fiscal plan” that includes “not only revenues but also clear guardrails: spending limits, statutory and regulatory reviews, and policies that make Alaska the most competitive state in the nation for investment and new business growth.”
Dunleavy called SB 113 “a simple tax bill that does not consider the comprehensive fiscal approach outlined above.”
The Legislature could override Dunleavy’s veto of SB 113, which would require 45 votes when lawmakers reconvene for the regular session in January, but that’s a level of support larger than the bill received when it originally passed.
Sen. Robert Yundt, R-Wasilla, sponsored the amendment that would have diverted SB 113 funding to education. He did not answer a phone call seeking comment on Monday afternoon. 
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, sponsored SB 113 in the Senate and lambasted the governor’s decision in a written statement. 
“SB 113 was a common-sense, bipartisan solution to help close our revenue gap without costing Alaskans or Alaska businesses a penny,” Wielechowski said. “The Governor had the opportunity to stand with Alaska families, students, and communities – but instead, he chose to side with tech corporations that profit from Alaskans and utilize our infrastructure, while paying nothing back to our state.”
Wielechowski said that the bill would have modernized Alaska’s corporate tax structure using reforms already adopted by other states.
“Every Alaskan knows Alaska is facing a revenue crisis, and that our education system needs critical resources. This bill would have been a step towards closing those gaps without taxing Alaskans while asking these corporations to contribute to the state that they use for their business ventures,” Wielechowski said. “The Governor’s veto sends the message that outside corporations come before Alaska’s schools, Alaska’s workforce, and Alaska’s future.”
Asked whether the governor had a comment about the veto’s effects on education funding, his communications director responded by email.
“Governor Dunleavy continues to encourage lawmakers, as he has done for the past several years, to work with him on a durable and comprehensive fiscal plan,” said Jeff Turner, the communications director. “Passing more taxes without spending limits and policies that give existing businesses the confidence they need to expand and new businesses the confidence they need to invest in Alaska will make our state less competitive.”
SB 113 was the last bill awaiting gubernatorial action this year. Of 33 bills passed by the House and Senate this year, Dunleavy vetoed nine, or 27%, the highest proportion since statehood. Legislators overrode two of Dunleavy’s vetoes during a special session in August.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/240128-State-of-the-State-copy-1024x694.jpg,,,2025-09-29 22:58:04.551102

(Getty Images)An Idaho legislative task force, aiming to make reductions and consolidations to improve government efficiency, dove deeper on Monday into considering changes or a repeal of Medicaid expansion. 
The DOGE Task Force – named for the federal Department Of Government Efficiency that was previously headed by billionaire Elon Musk — took a more detailed look at Medicaid expansion at a meeting at the Capitol in Boise, after members previously indicated the policy was a major target, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
“This is no longer that hand-up that it was sold as … This has now become just a straight handout program,” Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, said Monday. 
Medicaid expansion is a policy approved by voters in 2018 to provide health care coverage to able-bodied adults who fell in the gap between earning too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid and not enough for tax credits to be able to afford private insurance through the state marketplace. Its implementation also came with the elimination of funds used to pay for health care services provided to those who were uninsured. 
Since Medicaid expansion went into effect in 2020, there have been multiple unsuccessful attempts in the Legislature to repeal it. 
More than 87,000 Idahoans are enrolled in Medicaid expansion, according to numbers updated on Sept. 2 by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.

Deputy Director of Medicaid Sasha O’Connell provided task force members with an overview of the Medicaid program and answered pointed questions about potential cost-cutting changes that could be made, such as capping lifetime use and moving more participants onto private insurance through the federal premium tax credit. 
DOGE Committee Co-Chair Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, asked O’Connell what the state’s authority was to make changes to the program — which is largely funded by federal money, along with state funds. Medicaid is mainly regulated federally, though states may ask for permission to change the way they administer their own programs through waivers. 
O’Connell responded that states are given a range of options, but some of those options may mean taking a smaller matching rate from the federal government. Currently, Idaho receives $90 from the federal government for every $10 it puts into Medicaid expansion benefits; choosing to change the program so it doesn’t align with federal regulations around it may mean reducing this, she said. 
 What changes are already underway for Medicaid expansion?

The state is in the process of asking federal authorities to make certain changes, made through state legislative action and supported by passage of the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” including: 

Implementing work requirements, meaning participants will show that they worked, volunteered or participated in workforce training for at least 20 hours a week, with some exemptions for those above a certain age, parents of very young children, and caregivers for adult children with disabilities. 
The state will double how often it checks if people are eligible, going from once a year to every six months.  
Idaho Medicaid will increase cost-sharing among participants, which could include increased copayments or premiums.
The state will end automatic renewal that would use information from other public assistance programs to demonstrate continued eligibility.

The state is also looking to ask for permission to allow those who earn between 100% and 138% of federal poverty guidelines to shift to private insurance through the state marketplace using the federal premium tax credit. Idaho previously sought permission to make this change, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services denied the request in 2019. 
The premium tax credit is set to expire at the end of 2025, and thus far no proposal has advanced out of Congress to extend the credits. The health care advocacy group Idaho Voices for Children previously told the Sun that an estimated 35,000 Idahoans could lose health care coverage without the credits because health care insurance would skyrocket for many. 
Tanner asked O’Connell to come back with more policies the Legislature could enact that would cut costs of Medicaid. He expressed frustration that the program was growing, going from about 64,000 enrollees in January 2020 to 87,657 this month. 
“When you look at the labor reports, we have a ton of jobs out there, it’s not like we’re lacking in this,” he said. “… We need as many options as we can for cuts.”

Jim Pillen and school choice supporters get a victory as the state opts into federal scholarship credit from ‘Big Beautiful Bill',"Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen talking in front of U.S. Reps. Adrian Smith and Mike Flood at St. Teresa Catholic School in Lincoln on Sep. 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Reps. Adrian Smith and Mike Flood took a political victory lap Monday with a group of K-12 students at the capital city’s St. Teresa Catholic School. 
The group marked the day Pillen opted Nebraska into a federal school choice tax credit program that the state’s GOP members of Congress helped make sure was included in President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill that passed earlier this summer. 
Nebraska is one of the first states nationally to join the federal voucher program, and other states are likely to follow suit. 
“Let me just make it really clear … I am not opting this in … I am cannonballing it into the state of Nebraska,” Pillen said to claps from kids and parents.
Pillen and other supporters of school choice in Nebraska needed the assistance of the Trump administration after the state’s voters overturned legislative efforts to create a voucher program of the state’s own. Pillen and state lawmakers have pledged to keep trying to pass a state replacement.

The Nebraska State Education Association — the state’s largest teachers union — expressed concerns over the state’s participation in the federal program. 
“Today’s decision by Governor Pillen undermines the clear will of Nebraska voters, who just rejected state-level vouchers at the ballot box,” said Tim Royers, NSEA president. “This federal program is a backdoor voucher scheme that diverts public resources into private systems without accountability or limits.”
Pillen pushed back on the union’s premise, telling reporters that ballot initiatives in the state are flawed because “anybody that writes a big check can pay signature gatherers to get a [measure] on [the ballot]” and that Nebraskans “ totally agree” on school choice.
Voters in all but five of the state’s 49 legislative districts rejected the state’s voucher program in 2024.

“LB 753 and LB 1402 were signed into law in 2023 and 2024 and created similar tax credit programs at the state level for everyday Nebraskans,” part of the executive order reads. “The teachers union stole these opportunities for students in poverty to receive educational opportunities.”
Pillen, during the event, also said pursuing additional school choice legislation remains a high priority for him so Nebraska can be “competitive” with other states — if he’s given the “privilege to serve a second term.” Nebraska is one of the last remaining states without a school voucher program. 
Nebraska’s Smith is credited with leading the congressional effort to include the provision in Trump’s tax bill this summer. He said the motivation for the proposal was former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2021 saying he doesn’t “think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” 
“I found that particularly chilling,” Smith said. “[It] gave me more motivation here to work on this so that parents and families can be empowered.” 
The federal program begins in 2027. It allocates up to $1,700 a year in federal tax credits to individuals who donate to organizations providing scholarships for K-12 students to attend private and religious schools. 
Pillen, when asked by reporters, said he would be open to broadening the tax credit to people and organizations donating to the private foundations supporting public schools and public school districts as well. 
As the federal program now stands, scholarship funds would be available to families whose household incomes do not exceed 300 percent of an area’s median gross income.
Nationally, more than 138 million people could be eligible to make use of the tax credit in 2027, according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. 
Part of the push for more taxpayer-funded vouchers or programs for K-12 students to attend private schools has been the resistance from some teachers, advocates and lawmakers to reintroducing more religion in public schools, including in Nebraska. Recent efforts in Nebraska have been bottled up in committee or faced filibusters.
“Just think we can be in the environment here, where we talk about God the Father, God the Son, and the Holy Spirit all in one,” Pillen told the audience.

The program offered vocational and rehabilitative skills to people in DOC custody and supported U.S. Bureau of Land Management efforts to manage and protect wild horses and burros. 
The department’s contract with the BLM expires on Sept. 30 and can only be extended for 60 days.

“The Colorado Department of Corrections is immensely proud of the legacy of this program and the positive impact it has had on participants, staff, and the community,” Andre Stancil, executive director of the DOC, said in a statement. “While we regret the end of this chapter, we remain committed to working with BLM to ensure a smooth transition and to creating new opportunities that advance our mission of rehabilitation and public safety.”
Steven Hall, a BLM spokesperson, said the contract will not be renewed due to rising costs. He said the bureau will work with the state and wild horse friend groups to safely transfer about 100 wild horses and burros before the facility closes.
Prison leaders said they are already preparing to relocate the about 100 horses on site. 
The DOC will also work to reassign its five employees and about 30 incarcerated individuals affected by the program termination. 
Hall said the BLM “does not release information on contract negotiations” and did not provide information on the cost of the program.

Last week, Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte joined Gary Evans, chairman and CEO of the U.S. Antimony Corporation, to celebrate an expansion of the company’s smelting facility outside of Thompson Falls. It is the only operating antimony smelter in the United States.
“You may not realize it, but there’s not a bullet fired in the world without antimony,” Evans said during a groundbreaking ceremony on Sept. 25.
Antimony is used to harden and strengthen alloys, including lead used in bullets, and is used in primers, which initiate combustion. It’s also a key ingredient in flame retardants, lead-acid batteries, semiconductors, and various military applications such as flares, night vision goggles, and nuclear weapons production.
USAC was established in 1969 in Montana to mine antimony and operates a smelter and precious metals plant in Sanders County. The company has not conducted mining operations in Montana since 1983, according to its website, due to cheaper materials from foreign sources.
Currently, roughly 85% of the world’s supply and production of antimony comes from China.
“This allows us to disengage our supply chains from people who aren’t our friends,” Gianforte said. “We cannot and must not be reliant on China for these minerals. That’s why President Trump, Interior secretary, Doug Burgum and others have made the production of critical minerals like antimony a top priority. With Montana’s rich tradition in mining, we can and should be a national leader with this important facility.”
Evans said the company began expanding its operations in May and is approximately 40% complete. The facility is expected to be completed by the end of December or early January.
According to the governor’s office, the Thompson Falls smelter can currently produce up to 15 million pounds of antimony oxide, or 5 million pounds of antimony metal, and also refines silver and gold.
Once completed, the $15 million expansion project will increase production by 400%, and add roughly 25 jobs to Sanders County.
Last week, USAC also announced that the U.S. Department of Defense had awarded the company a $245 million sole-source contract by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency to provide antimony metal “to aid in the replenishment of the National Defense Stockpile.”
USAC also operates another smelter in Mexico, increasing its production capabilities, and has expanded mining operations in Alaska.
According to company press releases, USAC has been “stealthily reacquiring” mining claims across 1,200 acres in the area and surveys indicate sufficient quantities of the element could exist in three vein systems on the property.
The company filed a Small Miners Exclusion Statement with the state of Montana this summer, allowing immediate mining operations on five acres, with plans to file exploration permits with the state and the U.S. Forest Service.
“There continues to exist a worldwide shortage of this critical material necessary for our Department of Defense. The significant price increase experienced for worldwide supplies of antimony ore have made this decision to reopen our existing antimony mine adjacent to our smelting operations an easy one,” Evans said in a statement.
One of the largest domestic supplies of antimony is just to the southwest of USAC’s smelting facility, at the Stibnite Gold Mine in Idaho’s Payette National Forest. The mine ceased production in the 1990s, but the company that owns the mine, Perpetual Resources, is seeking to restart operations.
The U.S. Forest Service early this year approved the open pit mine which could become one of the largest gold mines in the country, as well as a top producer of antimony.
Conservation groups in Idaho have sued the state Department of Environmental Quality over the air permit for the mine.
However, the U.S. Army took part in a ground breaking event at the central Idaho mine earlier in September to highlight the importance of securing a domestic supply chain of military-grade raw materials.
In Montana, Evans said USAC planned for the expansion before the Department of Defense award, but said it “took the gamble” to boost smelting production in anticipation of the contract.
“We’re excited about how this expansion will not only help fulfill this contract, but add to the employment to this area. This region of Montana is very pristine, and we’re trying to do our best to keep it that way,” Evans said. “Montanans should be very proud of the contributions your state is making in this extremely important endeavor for our country. There’s a lot of patriotism in what we’re doing by providing antimony to the military.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image001-1024x700.jpg,,,2025-09-29 19:57:49.820769

Many calls to 911, visits to the emergency room, and hospital admissions are related to preventable falls, missed medications, or common infections.
That’s because too many folks can’t afford long-term care. They need someone to help them at home, ensuring they can move around safely, assisting them with prescriptions, bathing, or meals. Health insurance and Medicare won’t pay for the expenses of a home care aide, modifications like grab bars, or assistance with meals or transportation. 
According to a 2024 survey, nearly a third of Americans have no emergency savings at all, with 40% saying they would need to borrow money if faced with an unexpected expense greater than $1,000. Even middle-income families can’t afford the cost of long-term care.
The impacts on women are even more acute. Women bear the brunt of the long-term care crisis as the ones most likely to leave careers or cut hours to care for an aging family member, setting them back financially and personally. When it comes time for their own long-term care, women can face discrimination by private insurance companies, which charge them up to 70% more than men for premiums.
This November, Washington voters will consider Senate Joint Resolution 8201 to protect and grow Washington’s public long-term care fund dedicated to women, aging adults, and people with disabilities by allowing its investment in a balanced portfolio. By growing the state fund by billions more each year, this ballot measure will help keep premiums low and may even expand our long-term care benefits without costing taxpayers a penny.
If measure 8201 passes, 100% of investment income from Washington’s long-term care fund will go to caring for aging adults and people with disabilities. The revenue created from these investments cannot be raided or spent on any other programs or services, and would be subject to increased transparency and reporting requirements, making the program more accountable to the public.
This measure received bipartisan supermajority support in the state legislature with nearly every Republican and Democratic legislator voting in favor—128 for and just 16 against. It’s a rare day when both parties agree that something is so necessary that they come together to make it happen. Home health care aides, grocery workers, teachers, and organizations representing millions of people with pre-existing conditions, like the National MS Society, Lupus Foundation, and The ALS Association, are part of the broad coalition supporting measure 8201.
The measure will enable our Washington State Investment Board to invest a portion of the long-term care benefit fund reserves into a diversified market-based investment portfolio, getting higher returns while reducing risk, while continuing to include investments in conservative government bonds and Treasury bills. 
Based on the outstanding performance of the nonpartisan investment board, this change will bring the long-term care fund in line with the growth of many other state pension funds and other programs like pension and retirement benefits for firefighters, law enforcement officers, teachers, workers’ compensation, and unemployment insurance.
The Washington State Investment Board has a renowned track record, averaging over an 8% annual return over the last 25 years. 
According to an independent actuarial projection, even just a 1% boost in investment returns would mean $67 billion more for the long-term care fund over the next 50 years.

,DC,2025-09-29 23:10:22+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Governors call for Congress to avert federal shutdown but differ on how,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/governors-call-congress-avert-federal-shutdown-differ-how,,"State officials from both parties urged Congress to avoid a government shutdown Monday, though Republicans were pushing harder for an extension of current funding.Though they sometimes clash with federal directives, states depend on funding from the federal government for numerous programs. A government shutdown, which would have a wider effect than any in recent years because Congress has not passed any of the dozen annual funding bills, would delay or cancel that support.The National Governors Association issued a statement Monday from its chair and vice chair, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, calling on Congress to come together to avoid a shutdown. The bipartisan group comprising all the nation’s governors generally avoids commenting on controversial issues that divide its membership.“The consistent use of political brinksmanship when it comes to our government funding does not serve our states, territories or our people well,” they wrote. “It is long past time to stop kicking the can down the road and return to the regular order of debating and passing a budget, but at this juncture, Congress has a responsibility to ensure the government remains operational. We urge federal leaders from both sides to work to set aside political games and pass a budget that reflects the values and promises states commit to every day.”While members of both parties expressed a desire to avoid a shutdown, they proposed different solutions. Republicans urged lawmakers to approve the “clean” continuing resolution to keep the government funded at current levels, while Democrats backed up their party’s position in Congress to seek an extension of health insurance subsidies in a funding bill.“Allowing a shutdown would consequently and needlessly disrupt our economies, threaten public safety, and undermine public confidence in our institutions,” 25 Republican governors wrote in a Monday letter to congressional leaders. “Our families and communities would feel the pain with immediate effect and confusion.”Partisan differences over shutdown extend beyond the BeltwayThe U.S. House, where Republicans hold a majority, passed a stopgap spending measure this month, but it failed to clear the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the U.S. Senate, as Democrats have declined to support a proposal that does not address health care costs. At the state level, the debate has fallen along similar lines. “Put simply, a  government shutdown should not be used as political leverage to pass partisan reforms — these are not chips Congress should be bargaining with,” the Republican governors wrote “The proposed budget extension is a straightforward, bipartisan solution. There are no gimmicks or partisan poison pills; it’s a clean, short-term funding measure that both parties have historically supported.”Republican state attorneys general sent a similar letter, which noted a shutdown would affect state and local law enforcement.Democrats throughout the country, though, echoed congressional messaging that Congress should extend the health care subsidies that were included in the 2010 health care law known as the Affordable Care Act, and take more steps to reduce the cost of health care. Republicans’ failure to include such provisions would put blame for the shutdown on the GOP, Democrats have said.“Instead of supporting a plan that would lower costs and stop making health care more expensive, Senate Republicans are blindly following Donald Trump and pushing the country towards a devastating government shutdown,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who chairs Senate Democrats’ campaign organization, said in a Sept. 19 statement.In a press release last week, the Democratic Governors Association touted efforts by its members to call for extending subsidies.“DGA Chair Kansas Governor Laura Kelly, Delaware Governor Matt Meyer, and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham called on Congressional Republicans to extend critical Affordable Care Act subsidies that 22 million Americans rely on and avoid a government shutdown,” the release read. “Without action from Republicans in Congress, health care costs for hardworking Americans who rely on these subsidies will balloon by an average of over 75 percent.”",,,,2025-09-29 19:57:49.820769

Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho), left, and other members of a Republican task force on medical malpractice questioned NM Health Department Secretary Gina DeBlassie and others during a forum Monday. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Two days before a special legislative session convenes to focus on federal cuts to Medicaid in New Mexico, a panel of Republican state senators solicited testimony from doctors, patients and state officials regarding an issue Republicans here say is more pressing: Medical malpractice reform.
The NM Senate GOP’s five-member “Medical Malpractice Legislative Task Force,” in a three-hour forum Monday in Bernalillo, said Democratic leaders in the Legislature need to prioritize reining in the cost of medical malpractice insurance, along with other associated issues. 
“It’s time we change things in New Mexico,” said Sen. Craig Brandt (R-Rio Rancho). “It’s time we make it where our doctors can stay here, so that when we get sick, or our family gets sick, or loved ones get sick, they can be treated here and not have to be flown to another state to survive.”
NM Gov will add vaccine policy to Oct. 1 special session agenda

Republicans in both chambers called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Democrats in the Legislature to put medical malpractice on the agenda for the special session beginning Wednesday. But there are no plans to do so.
In particular, Brandt blamed “trial attorneys” in Democratic leadership for blocking progress on medical malpractice. 
Chris Nordstrum, a spokesperson for Senate Democrats, did not immediately respond to Source’s request for comment on that criticism Monday afternoon.
Health Department Secretary Gina DeBlassie was the first to testify Monday. She told the panel that New Mexico’s rate of medical malpractice claims per physician, which has long been above the national average, has grown in recent years.

Between 2020 and 2024, she said, New Mexico’s claims per physician has grown to two to three times larger than neighboring states, including Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Utah. 
New Mexico does not limit the amount a patient can receive in medical malpractice payouts, and it does not cap the amount in fees an attorney can receive. Those and other factors make  New Mexico a “risky” place to be a doctor, said Kaye Green, the CEO of a hospital in rural Roosevelt County. 
According to the National Physician Institute, 248 doctors have left the state in the past five years. Lawmakers and panelists cited that figure repeatedly as evidence of the acute shortage.
And Sen. Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho) mentioned his father, who he said is currently undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer. In an exchange with DeBlassie, Block cited his father’s doctor, who told him 15 urologists currently practice in Albuquerque, a city with 560,000 people. But in Durango, Colo., a city of 38,000 just north of the New Mexico border, eight urologists practice, he said. 
The American Urological Association, in a recent report, ranked New Mexico third-lowest in the country in terms of urologists per capita. The report says 60 urologists practice across the state. 
As a result of the shortage, Block said, “We’re talking months before people can get treatment for prostate cancer,” which is a rising threat for men.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_1021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 19:57:49.820769

Julie Fedorchak said Democrats have the “ball in their court” to prevent a government shutdown. Fedorchak, who hosted a virtual town hall Monday with North Dakotans, said the Republican-led House passed a continuing resolution last week to keep the federal government open past Tuesday night’s funding deadline. “This is something that [[...]","U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., speaks during a virtual town hall on Sept. 29, 2025. (Screenshot from livestream)North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak said Democrats have the “ball in their court” to prevent a government shutdown.
Fedorchak, who hosted a virtual town hall Monday with North Dakotans, said the Republican-led House passed a continuing resolution last week to keep the federal government open past Tuesday night’s funding deadline.
“This is something that Democrats have supported in the past,” Fedorchak said. “They are working in the Senate and have some demands that they are asking for.”
Senate Democrats are demanding any continuing resolution to keep the government open would need to extend the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year. Without the tax credits, individuals and families receiving assistance for plans covered under the ACA marketplace could see their premiums increase by thousands of dollars, according to KFF.
The Senate requires a 60-vote threshold to advance legislation. Republicans control 53 seats, which means they will need support from at least seven Democrats or independents.
In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor after the virtual event, Fedorchak said she does not see funding the government and the health insurance subsidies as the same issue.
“I tend to think they are just using this as a cudgel and I strongly believe that we should just pass the clean CR (continuing resolution) like we provided,” she said. “A government shutdown is really damaging to Americans and benefits nobody.”
US Senate Dems push GOP for extension of expiring health care subsidies

If the Senate passes the continuing resolution, Fedorchak said it would lessen the pressure on lawmakers and open up discussions on other issues, such as health insurance subsidies and federal agency budgets passed through the normal committee process.
The North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party on Monday criticized North Dakota’s all-Republican congressional delegation for not extending the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits.
“If Congress doesn’t act, 35,000 North Dakotans will see their health care premiums skyrocket. That’s more than the population of Williston,” said Adam Goldwyn, chair of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party, in a statement.
Fedorchak said she does not support stopping the subsidies without a “glide path,” easing the impact of their expiration. She also said the subsidies are part of the reason why health care costs have remained elevated.
In a statement, Sen. Kevin Cramer said Senate Democrats are the only thing standing in the way of keeping the government open.
“To avoid a Schumer shutdown, Democrats should join Republicans in passing the House bill and get back to negotiating more permanent appropriations bills,” Cramer said.
Sen. John Hoeven said members of Congress are already working to address the health care subsidies and accused the Democrats of holding the continuing resolution “hostage.”
“The enhanced health insurance premium subsidies do not expire until the end of calendar year 2025,” Hoeven said in a statement. “These enhanced subsidies were put in place to give additional assistance during COVID, and they need reforms.”
Agriculture policy
Participants in Fedorchak’s virtual forum also raised concerns about impacts to North Dakota farmers due to President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade and tariff war, which has hindered Chinese purchases of American soybeans and may require federal assistance payments to keep those farms afloat.

Fedorchak said Trump’s trade and tariff deals are aiming to correct a trade imbalance.
“Free trade was pretty one-sided in the past,” Fedorchak said. “There is a lot of uncertainty right now. I completely acknowledge that, but we are making progress.”
She said she is hopeful more trade deals will come to fruition in the future, such as Taiwan’s agreement to purchase an additional 25% of American agriculture products. She also said producers should expand to more domestic uses for their products, like biofuels, and encouraged more processing capability, citing the new soybean processing plant in Casselton.
When asked why farmers should get tariff support payments over other industries impacted by ongoing trade disputes, Fedorchak said farmers need to be supported because they lost their markets.
“That’s a pretty significant government impact on their business, so I think the bridge payments to farmers are in order for the immediate crop year,” she said. “There are other industries being impacted, but they aren’t losing their markets.”
Fedorchak said she will continue having virtual forums every six to eight weeks to keep North Dakotans informed on what’s happening in Washington. She also urged participants to sign up for office hours when she is in town. Future office hours will be posted on her official website and social media.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)School districts and county governments face cascading financial impacts as the ongoing state budget impasse starves them of funding, leaders said Monday. 
Lawmakers had a June 30 deadline to pass the 2025-2026 budget. But with September nearly over and the budget 90 days late, school programs and county agencies that depend on state and federal pass-through money are in jeopardy, representatives from the Pennsylvania School Boards Association (PSBA) and County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania(CCAP) said.
“Late budgets come with real impacts,” PSBA CEO Nathan Mains said. “Imagine trying to plan your own personal budget without a complete picture of your income, or trying to pay all of your bills without as much as 70% of your income. That’s the position school districts find themselves in because of this year’s late state budget.”
The partisan deadlock between the Democratic-led House and the Republican-controlled Senate will soon force school districts and counties to borrow money to keep programs running or reduce services. Some have already planned service cuts and hiring freezes starting in October.
Pennsylvania is the only state in the country that has been unable to pass some form of a budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
Gov. Josh Shapiro introduced a $51.5 billion spending plan in February that would require about $4.5 billion more than the state was expected to receive in revenue.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Republicans rejected the proposal, pushing for a balanced budget that wouldn’t dip into the commonwealth’s roughly $3 billion surplus or $7 billion rainy day funds. They also rejected a spending plan that passed the House in July that would have cut nearly $1 billion from Shapiro’s proposal.
The Senate approved  a temporary budget in August to allow funding to flow to schools and counties while lawmakers continued negotiations over transit and education funding, two of the major sticking points. House Democrats refused it, saying they wanted a fully negotiated budget instead of a stop-gap. 
CCAP Executive Director Kyle Kopko said that while it’s important for both parties to advocate for their priorities, every budget impasse pushes county governments closer to financial crisis. 
“We can’t normalize the practice of essentially missing a state budget deadline every other year,” he said, noting that 12 budgets in the last 25 have been late. “Without a state budget, many counties will be forced to raise property taxes, cut critical services, or both.”
Armstrong County announced last week that it would stop reimbursements to families providing foster care services, close some of its senior centers and freeze hiring and unnecessary travel.
Westmoreland County commissioners announced employee furloughs and park closures as its budget reserves run out.










Imagine trying to plan your own personal budget without a complete picture of your income, or trying to pay all of your bills without as much as 70% of your income. That’s the position school districts find themselves in.

And Chester County commissioners last week passed a resolution calling on Shapiro and leaders in the General Assembly to “prioritize their responsibilities and work collaboratively to finalize a budget without further delay.” The county will pay its human services contractors only 75% of what they invoice with the remainder to be paid when the budget is passed.
Kopko noted that even after Shapiro signs a budget, it will take six weeks or more for funds to be distributed to the agencies that are waiting.
CCAP has adopted a formal policy position asking Shapiro and lawmakers to support legislation to reimburse counties the costs and interest associated with short-term operation loans which now fall to local taxpayers.
“We cannot allow Pennsylvanians to be punished again simply because the Commonwealth failed to pass a timely budget, as required by law,” Kopko said.
Susquehanna Township School Superintendent Tamara Willis said the need to borrow money creates “double jeopardy” for districts like hers that are preparing to issue debt to build or repair schools.
With no new buildings in 60 years and the fastest growing enrollment in Dauphin County, the district’s schools are stretched to their limits, Willis said. 
“Any disruption or downgrade to our credit rating will increase the cost of that borrowing, making those bonds significantly more expensive,” Willis said.

In the long run, that means the district will have less money to hire teachers, pay for programs and purchase essential classroom supplies, she said. 
“These are the very investments that directly impact student learning,” Willis said. “So let me be clear, this is not a temporary inconvenience. It is a serious threat to both our daily operations and our long term fiscal health.”
Annie Strite, mental health director and administrator for Cumberland and Perry counties, said the impasse also has detrimental effects on the safety net programs that work hand-in-hand with schools and educators to ensure the wellbeing of students and their families.
Noting September is Suicide Prevention Month, Strite said suicide is the second-most common cause of death for children 10 to 14 and third-most common for teens 15 to 18 nationally. 
“It’s imperative the community mental health system collaborate with our education professionals at every level,” she said.
Strite said in the two counties where she oversees mental health services, five elementary school counselors serve 49 schools in 13 districts and helped more than 1,000 students. She recounted a recent case in which a teacher referred a student for academic and behavioral concerns. 
County mental health workers discovered a family in crisis struggling with, homelessness, financial instability, a recent family death and domestic violence witnessed by the student. The county connected the mother with counseling, the student with in-school therapy and the family with food assistance. 
There are thousands  of stories across Pennsylvania that are similar,” Strite said, adding that without intervention, such situations can lead to more costly involvement with child welfare agencies.
“If the budget impasse lingers still longer, difficult decisions will need to be made to stop services and furlough or terminate staff who serve in these roles,” Strite said.
Sherene Shereen Hess, an Indiana County commissioner and CCAP president, said county governments have not fully recovered from the 2015 budget impasse, when the Republican-controlled legislature and Democratic former Gov. Tom Wolf didn’t reach an agreement for nine months.
”We’re mandated to deliver these services, but it’s going to take a financial toll and it takes a toll on folks with stress too, and I see that,” Hess said. “I see that happening on people’s faces every day.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5507-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 19:57:49.820769

Free.,‘We’re headed to a shutdown’: White House meeting ends with no deal as deadline nears,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/were-headed-shutdown-white-house-meeting-ends-no-deal-deadline-nears,,"WASHINGTON — Democratic and Republican lawmakers remained far apart Monday with just over 24 hours until a federal government shutdown begins, after a White House meeting with President Donald Trump and congressional leaders meant to spur negotiations.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries emerged from the White House just after 4:30 p.m. Eastern still entrenched in their positions. Democrats are demanding promises to lower rising health care costs, and Republicans are pushing for a “clean” stopgap bill to keep the government running through mid-November.Schumer said he believed “for the first time the president heard our objections,” but “large differences” remained.“It is our job as legislative leaders to try and solve this problem, or at least fix the problem, and we focused in the room in particular on the (Affordable Care Act) and its extension,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, told reporters on Capitol Hill a short time later.Vice President JD Vance, flanked by Thune, Johnson and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, separately told reporters outside the White House, “We’re headed to a shutdown.”“If they want to talk about how to fix American health care policy, let's do it. The speaker would love to do it. The Senate majority leader would love to do it. Let's work on it together, but let's do it in the context of an open government that's providing essential services to the American people,” Vance said.Government funding runs out at midnight Tuesday. If no compromise is reached, hundreds of thousands of government employees would be furloughed, while many would be required to keep working without pay. States Newsroom published a guide explaining what happens.Health care premium increasesDemocrats point the finger to changes made in the recent tax and spending cuts law — commonly referred to as the “one big beautiful bill” — as the reason for rising health care costs.The law allows enhanced premium tax credits for those who use health insurance on the government marketplace to expire at the end of 2025. Republican lawmakers also cut roughly $1 trillion in Medicaid funding over the next decade to help account for the law’s extended and new tax cuts.“We're deadly serious about addressing the Republican-caused health care crisis, because it's a deadly serious issue for the American people — the largest cut to Medicaid in American history, hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health funding closing right now,” Jeffries, also a New York Democrat, said.Health insurance companies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace have requested or finalized price increases of at least 20% in 29 states, according to an analysis released Thursday by U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat.All marketplace insurer rate increase requests are publicly available at healthcare.gov.Schumer also pointed to the Trump administration’s impoundment and GOP lawmakers’ rescissions of federal funds, including those for medical research, foreign aid and public media, as another hard line for Democrats.“We made the point clear that how could we negotiate a bipartisan agreement and then have the president unilaterally through impoundment, or the Republican Party through rescissions, and the president unilaterally through pocket rescissions, undo it all without any input,” Schumer said.GOP slams ‘hostage-taking’ in shutdownRepublican leaders accused Democrats of “hostage-taking,” and pointed to a five-year, $50 billion fund for rural hospitals that was tucked at the eleventh hour into the massive tax and spending cuts package to compensate for health care cuts.Thune raised in his hand the GOP’s 24-page temporary funding bill that would keep the government open until Nov. 21 and said he didn’t understand why Democrats are “saying this is some huge partisan thing.”“This is something we do fairly routinely,” Thune, of South Dakota, said of temporary stopgap funding bills. “This is purely and simply hostage-taking on behalf of the Democrats,” he added.Johnson said the House had “done its job” roughly two weeks ago when all Republicans and one Democrat passed the seven-week stopgap funding bill. “That is the record, and don’t forget it,” the Louisiana Republican said.Republicans failed to gain enough Democratic votes in the Senate, which they control with 53 seats, to clear the final hurdle of 60 votes to advance legislation. Two Republican senators, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Kentucky’s Rand Paul, also voted against the measure.Jennifer Shutt and Shauneen Miranda contributed to this story.",,,,2025-09-29 18:57:32.211636

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — State Superintendent Ryan Walters will submit his letter of resignation from elected office on Tuesday, his senior adviser confirmed, bringing to an end a short but highly scrutinized tenure that divided even his fellow Republicans.
Matt Langston, who also served as Walters’ campaign manager, confirmed the state superintendent will formally step down the day before he is set to begin his new role Wednesday leading an anti-teacher-union nonprofit. His resignation will prompt Gov. Kevin Stitt to appoint a replacement to finish the final 15 months of his term.
Rather than launching a campaign for higher office, as many Oklahomans expected Walters to do, he announced last week that he would step down to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, an organization he said would “destroy the teachers’ unions.”
Walters’ office did not return requests for an interview in his final days in office, but others who spoke with Oklahoma Voice and issued public statements gave mixed reviews of his performance as the state’s public education leader.
The state’s largest teacher union, the Oklahoma Education Association, which Walters once called a terrorist organization, said he will be remembered for “plunging Oklahoma education into its darkest days.”
“We must leave this divisiveness behind and work together as a team with parents and communities by listening to and supporting our students and education professionals,” the union wrote in a statement. “Our public schools can once again become a source of pride and promise for every community in our state.”

Multiple parties and happy hours in Oklahoma City bars and restaurants celebrated his coming resignation, as Democrats and other critics of Walters’ sang the Ray Charles tune “Hit the Road Jack.”
Even among Republicans and in deep-red rural communities, some conservatives said support for Walters has not been unanimous.
In southwest Oklahoma, the chairman of the Stephens County Republican Party, Leon Farris, said he’s unsure his community would reelect Walters if he ran for state superintendent again.
Walters won Stephens County in dominating fashion in the 2022 General Election with 68% of the vote.
Although Walters still has supporters in the area, Farris said some Republicans became disillusioned with the superintendent’s frequent media appearances, believing “he was just running for the next office.”
“We’ve got people that think Ryan hung the moon and are sad to see him go,” Farris said. “We’ve got people that are very disappointed in his performance and are glad he’s gone.”
Local school district leaders, whom Farris described as widely respected conservatives in Stephens County, complained of frequent headaches dealing with Walters’ administration at the Oklahoma State Department of Education, he said.
Not everyone enjoyed seeing Walters at the center of every firestorm, Farris said, but voters in the area still supported his efforts to bring the Bible into public school classrooms, to empower parents, and to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
“That message resonated with Republicans,” Farris said. “Maybe his methodology didn’t resonate as much with everybody as he had hoped it would.”
Walters’ widespread name recognition didn’t always translate into voter support, said the state’s former Republican Party chairman, A.J. Ferate.
Ferate said he heard Walters’ name constantly while knocking on doors for Republican candidates two years ago, far more often than he heard mentions of taxes or abortion issues. 
For voters statewide, particularly in the Oklahoma City and Tulsa areas, the question “How do you feel about Ryan Walters?” seemed to have become a litmus test for other political candidates, he said. Rather than expressing policy differences with Walters, voters seemed concerned with the “combative approach” that he brought to elected office.
Ferate, an Oklahoma City attorney, doubted that those concerns have dissipated.
“I don’t think that it’s gone away,” he said.

However, in northeast Oklahoma, Walters has remained “very popular” among Osage County Republicans, said Jeff Clymer, the county’s GOP chairman.
Some local Republican Party members believed Walters pushed the envelope too much while others didn’t think he went far enough, Clymer said, but many in the community agreed that the state superintendent was too often unfairly attacked.
Walters would have been well received as a candidate for reelection, Clymer said. It’s less clear what level of support Walters would have in Osage County if he joined the 2026 race for governor.
“The most I heard was he should stay where he is and complete the job,” Clymer said. “It won’t matter now, but that’s what I’ve heard in the past.”
Walters gained national attention for his efforts to require public schools to teach biblical stories and for his order that every district’s classroom keep a copy of the Bible. He spent his 33-month tenure in office under constant media attention as he attacked perceived liberal influence and “transgender ideology” while seeking to give religion a greater role in public education.
His resignation prompted a flood of enthusiasm from local and national organizations advocating for church-state separation and LGBTQ+ rights.
“We’re excited for parents in Oklahoma, who no longer have to deal with Walters’ gross politicization of their children’s education,” said Lauren Powell, of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group. “We sincerely hope their next superintendent will be more focused on educational outcomes than culture wars.”
However, some expressed excitement not over Walters’ departure, but because of what he aims to do next.
The head of the Oklahoma Republican Party, Charity Linch, celebrated that his new position with the Teacher Freedom Alliance means a “new weapon of words has been unleashed on the liberal machine in education.” 
“Oklahoma will miss him in the state role,” Linch wrote on social media. “Giants must be slain. Davids must go. We are with you, Ryan!”
Walters’ new organization bills itself as a conservative alternative to teacher union membership.
In a news release announcing his hiring, Walters said the organization will “arm teachers with the tools, support, and freedom they need, without forcing them to give up their values.” 
“For decades, union bosses have poisoned our schools with politics and propaganda while abandoning parents, students, and good teachers,” he said. “That ends today. We’re going to expose them, fight them, and take back our classrooms.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked the state license of Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Ian Roberts Monday following his detainment and arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The Des Moines School Board was scheduled to meet Monday night to place Roberts on unpaid leave following the BOEE decision on Sunday. The school board had met Saturday to put Roberts on paid administrative leave. A news release published Monday from the DMPS school district said the action to place Roberts on unpaid leave after this decision is required by law.
The school board meeting is one of the latest actions in response to Roberts’ detainment. According to ICE officials, Roberts was approached by ICE agents in his vehicle during a “targeted enforcement operation” Friday. The agency reported Roberts was found in possession of a handgun, a hunting knife and $3,000 in cash. He then allegedly attempted to evade arrest, the ICE press release stated, and Iowa State Patrol officers assisted the federal agents in locating Roberts after his vehicle was found abandoned.

Roberts was given a “final order of removal by an immigration judge” in May 2024, according to ICE, after he had come to the U.S. in 1999 on a student visa.
There have been several questions about DMPS’ vetting process for Roberts. Officials with the school district have said they were unaware of the 2024 removal order or that Roberts may have misrepresented himself as a U.S. citizen, though school board president Jackie Norris said the district has not yet been able to independently verify much of the new information shared following his arrest.
School officials have confirmed Roberts completed the I-9 employment eligibility verification form and submitted the required documentation showing he was eligible for employment with the district when hired. In a news release, officials also highlighted that Roberts’ license had been approved by the BOEE in July 2023 and that he had worked in education leadership positions in other U.S. states, including in California, Missouri, and Pennsylvania, for more than 20 years.
At the Saturday board meeting, DMPS associate superintendent Matt Smith was appointed to serve as interim superintendent. On Sunday, Smith sent a letter addressed to families in the school district acknowledging the “difficult time” parents, educators and students in Des Moines schools are facing following the arrest and detention of Roberts. Smith said he was working with Norris, members of the DMPS executive cabinet and school leaders over the weekend to “to process and distribute factual information as it becomes available to us.”
“What we cannot lose focus on is our children,” Smith wrote. “Communities show their identity in times of crisis and the way we respond will make a difference in the lives of the children we love and serve. We all have strong feelings about what we are experiencing, and healthy expression of those feelings is appropriate. But we must remember to move with empathy and self-regulation and know that our children are watching.”
But others have criticized Des Moines school officials for hiring Roberts, who ICE alleged was arrested on a gun charge in Feb. 5, 2020. DMPS officials said they were informed of a firearms offense in 2022 and that Roberts had pleaded guilty to a charge related to having a loaded weapon in his vehicle while hunting. District officials said they were not informed of any other offenses.
The situation has drawn national attention and political fallout.
Samantha Cantrell, regional press secretary for the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm the National Republican Senate Committee criticized Norris, who is running for U.S. Senate in 2026, for hiring “an illegal alien with a rap sheet to be her Superintendent and work with children.”
“Jackie Norris has put every single Des Moines student and family in danger,” Cantrell said in a statement Friday. “Democrats will stop at nothing to protect criminal illegal aliens.”
Norris gave a statement on behalf of the school board Saturday saying she wanted to be clear “about one fact that cannot be ignored: of course, the school district ensured that a background check was conducted before hiring Dr. Roberts. That is done for every person who is hired by the district and periodic reviews are conducted on a regular basis for all current employees.”

The suit is the second the Montana Environmental Info[...],"The Laurel Generation Station power plant in Laurel Montana as seen in September 2023. (Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)Two environmental organizations that have previously challenged the construction of a new power plant are suing the Montana Department of Environmental Quality accusing the state agency of failing to follow the state Supreme Court’s order to consider the station’s impact on human and environmental health.
The suit is the second the Montana Environmental Information Center and the Northern Plains Resource Council have filed on the Yellowstone County Generation Station, and it raises similar issues because it alleges state officials ignored court orders to meaningfully assess the risks to human health as well as address climate change.
The lawsuit leans heavily upon the landmark Held vs. Montana case, and is one of the first to use it in new litigation. The Held case gained national attention by becoming one of the first lawsuits in the country, filed by a group of youth plaintiffs, who said that the Montana Constitution protects a “clean and healthful environment” and that state leaders were derelict in their duty to protect the state’s environment for current and future generations.
The lawsuit filed Monday in Yellowstone County District Court said the DEQ failed to look at how the plant’s emissions would affect the residents and the environment.
The power generation station, which sits approximately 300 feet from the Yellowstone River near Laurel, has been the subject of multiple lawsuits and challenges, as residents have balked at the 18 natural gas generators.  Attorneys for the two groups argue that the plant will contribute much to climate change and increase health risks for Montanans living in the state’s most populated county.
Furthermore, they allege that the state DEQ failed to consider the individual and cumulative effects of the plant, and instead just estimated the amount of pollutants, including carbon dioxide, that would be released without requiring any action to curb the effects.
“The final environmental assessment fails to adequately evaluate the environmental impacts of the Yellowstone County Generation Station’s greenhouse gas emissions despite the Montana Supreme Court’s clear direction to DEQ in January 2025 to consider and disclose such information,” the lawsuit reads.
Earthjustice attorneys E. Lars Phillips and Melissa Hornbein of the Western Environmental Law Center are representing the groups.
NorthWestern Energy, the owner of the plant and the state’s largest public utility, more than doubled its methane-fired electricity capacity when the plant went online. Court records said NorthWestern plans on keeping the plant operational until at least 2057, while emitting 769,706 tons of carbon monoxide year, translating to more than 25 million metric tons during the course of its estimated lifespan.
The lawsuit also outlines how the Montana economy will increasingly feel the effects of climate change, including more wildfires, smoke-related health problems, including respiratory and cardiopulmonary issues. Furthermore, it alleges recreation, agriculture, and tourism will wane, caused by a variety of factors including, “decreased snowpack and water levels in summer and fall, extreme spring flooding events, accelerating forest mortality, and increased drought, wildfire, water temperatures and heal waves.”
Crops are also predicted to suffer.
“Decreasing snowpack is forecasted to lead to decreased streamflow and less reliable irrigation capacity, during the late growing season, which would have the greatest impact on hay, sugar, barley, market garden, and potato producers across Montana,” the lawsuit said. “Increased temperatures are forecasted to allow winter annual weeds, like cheatgrass, to increase in distribution and frequency in winter wheat cropland and rangeland, resulting in decreased crop yields and forage productivity and increased rangeland wildfire frequency.”
The lawsuit also attempts to quantify the costs of the plant by using the Social Cost of Carbon calculator — a tool which helps experts measure the economic cost of carbon.
Using a rate of $190 per ton of carbon dioxide release, the lifetime estimate of the plant’s impact is pegged at $132,078,050.
“The (Montana Supreme) court directed DEQ to evaluate the direct, secondary and cumulative impacts of the Yellowstone County Generation Station,” the lawsuit said. “DEQ’s brief discussion (of) potential mitigation measures, consisting entirely of summary references to geological carbon sequestration, industrial carbon sequestration, and biological sequestration, completely fails to analyze and disclose emissions control technologies and operational limitations that could reduce the (plant’s) greenhouse gas emissions and related climate impacts.”
Nearby residents say they’re already feeling the impacts of the operational power generation station.
“It is deeply disappointing that the Montana DEQ granted NorthWestern Energy an air quality permit based on a flawed and misleading assessment that ignored the daily harms this plant inflicts on Laurel’s community,” said Steve Krum, member of Northern Plains Resource Council and Laurel resident. “Our families see the brown clouds, feel the vibrations, and live with the hidden toxins every day, proof that a full environmental impact statement is required, not a superficial review. This plant should never have been sited in a populated area, and certainly not without constitutional protections for our community’s health and safety.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Methane-Plant3.int_-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-09-29 18:57:32.211636

The former state Senate leader was leading in campaign cash but far behind in the polls. 


Democrat Toni Atkins is dropping out of the crowded 2026 race to succeed Gavin Newsom as California governor, she announced Monday. 
Atkins, the former Senate president, wrote in an email to supporters that she was leaving the race with a “heavy heart” but that “there is simply no viable path forward to victory.” She made the call after failing to poll at higher than single digits, according to a person familiar with the campaign, and does not plan to run for another office in this election cycle.
Atkins launched her campaign more than a year ago in what has become an open field since former Vice President Kamala Harris declined to run this summer. Another early entrant to the race, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, also dropped out in August to run for state treasurer instead.
Newsom terms out next year. At least six other Democrats are running to replace him, including former Rep. Katie Porter, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. The field could still change, with Sen. Alex Padilla also reportedly considering a run.
Atkins had more than $4.2 million in her campaign account this summer, more than any of the other Democratic candidates, had the support of several allies in the Legislature and held a series of town halls throughout the state in August. 
But Atkins faced steep odds in name recognition having never run for statewide office before. She came in third last in an August Politico poll, with just 4% of voters picking her among the Democrats. Leading the pack was Porter with 21% of voters. On Sunday, Atkins did not appear at a Los Angeles candidate forum, reportedly citing illness. 
Atkins supported publicly funded universal health care and was a prominent advocate in the Legislature for increasing housing construction. She would have been the first openly LGBTQ governor in a field of other history-making Democratic candidates.
On the Republican side, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News commentator Steve Hilton are vying for the seat.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/011923-Toni-Atkins-Governor-Campaign-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-29 18:57:32.211636

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Lawmakers should be careful in their approach to property tax reform and education funding, superintendents from two of South Dakota’s largest school districts said after a panel discussion Monday.
Jamie Nold is superintendent of the Sioux Falls School District, which has the state’s highest enrollment with more than 24,000 students. Jennifer Lowery is the superintendent at Harrisburg School District, the third largest in the state with 6,000 students, and the fastest growing.
“Property taxes are complex, and you can’t have simple solutions without unintended consequences to a complex mechanism,” Lowery said.
The two shared their perspectives with the Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary Club, reacting to ideas generated by lawmakers on the Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force this summer.
The task force is aiming to reduce property taxes for South Dakota homeowners. It’s heard ideas including state government funding cuts that could be redirected toward property tax relief and new sales taxes to replace property taxes.
From property to purchases: Task force considering fundamental tax shift to reduce homeowner burden

One focus of the task force is to analyze education funding’s connection to property taxes. Task force member and House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, said at the last task force meeting that school funding is the number one cost driver of high property taxes because schools are “incentivized” to spend and collect more property taxes. Some task force members, including Odenbach, have expressed interest in simplifying the process by rewriting or adjusting the school funding formula.
During Monday’s panel and in media interviews afterward, Lowery worried that shifting toward sales taxes and eliminating property taxes for schools would disconnect taxpayers from their communities and shift the onus of investing in school infrastructure onto the state rather than local taxpayers.
Lawmakers should continue to study the issue to identify the property tax “breaking point” for different communities, Lowery said, and seek out a more tailored approach to expand property tax relief programs for some South Dakotans, such as elderly and disabled residents.
“How much tax is too much,” Lowery said, “and how much is an investment in your community and school?”
Lowery added that for the first time in two decades, Harrisburg School District is not constructing a new building. The debt for an old project is also paid off, which will decrease the levy used to determine property taxes in the district.

The change comes at the same time as a “small” 1.25% increase in annual state funding for schools and “detrimental” impacts from Gov. Larry Rhoden’s recently adopted property tax relief package, Lowery said. The package sets five-year, 3% annual caps on countywide growth in owner-occupied home assessments and the amount that school capital outlay budgets can increase as a result of new construction, which means districts growing at a higher rate than 3% are losing funds.
“It’s not allowing us to just take care of our general operation needs, such as our roads and parking lots and brick and mortar,” Lowery said. “Growth causes expense.”
Nold, of Sioux Falls, told attendees he doesn’t care what source the funding for the district comes from as long as it “continues to provide the quality services that we do for our kids.” 
The two superintendents are monitoring the property tax discussion, as well as other legislative issues that’ll affect South Dakota education during the annual legislative session that begins in January. Nold added that task force members “don’t have the final say” on property tax reform.
“There will be a lot of other input that’ll take place outside of what was said in that committee, so we’ll see what the final outcome is,” Nold said.

They’ve been formally designated as critical infrastructure, alongside our power grid and water supply. Yet we treat them as an afterthought in our budgets.","IMAGINE THE US GOVERNMENT declared part of our critical national security infrastructure at risk — then offered barely $1 million per state last year to protect it. That’s not a hypothetical. That’s the reality of how we fund elections in America. 
Our elections are the backbone of our democracy. They’ve been formally designated as critical infrastructure, alongside our power grid and water supply. Yet we treat them as an afterthought in our budgets. The system we rely on to uphold the will of the people — to choose presidents, governors, mayors — operates on shoestring funding, especially at the local level where the work of democracy actually happens. 
American elections are intentionally decentralized, with local governments playing the central role. This design keeps elections close to voters and makes large-scale interference harder. But decentralized doesn’t need to mean underfunded. We can have locally run elections and provide the consistent, predictable funding needed to ensure they are free, fair, and secure. 
Elections are so decentralized that we don’t even know precisely how many election jurisdictions exist in the United States. Estimates range from 8,000 to 10,000 — a 25 percent spread that underscores just how fragmented and opaque our system has become.  
Small rural jurisdictions make up most of our electoral system — according to the MIT Election Lab 75 percent of jurisdictions serve just 8 percent of voters — and they are especially vulnerable. In the small Franklin County town of Buckland in Western Mass., with fewer than 1,400 registered voters, the clerk has to conduct her own outside fundraising if she wants to offer food for poll workers or create professional signs to direct voters to the polling location.  
Despite the vital role elections play in sustaining our democracy, the amount America invests in them falls short. MIT estimates it costs $4 to $6 billion annually to run elections properly nationwide — yet that’s about what the federal government has contributed in total over the past 20 years. 
After the 2000 Bush v. Gore recount exposed glaring weaknesses in our voting technology, Congress responded with the Help America Vote Act of 2002, delivering a much-needed injection of $1.5 billion — including $650 million to replace outdated voting machines. But since then, federal funding has been sporadic, reactionary, and far below what’s needed. In recent years, Congress has appropriated just $75 million in 2022 and 2023, and $55 million in 2024 — barely more than $1 million per state. 
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts alone spent the same as the federal government during the 2024 election cycle — but still less than one-tenth of one percent of the state’s overall budget.
​That funding helps cover critical statewide needs like ballot printing and early voting, easing the burden on local officials. Like elsewhere in the country, towns in Massachusetts need to cover the most expensive items like salaries and equipment. That forces small town clerks in places like Buckland – where the annual election budget is just $10,200, or about 0.1 percent of the town’s budget – to be creative to cover basic costs. Nationally, the picture is similar: in the 36 states where counties run elections, elections receive on average around 0.5 percent of county budgets. 
The Edward M. Kennedy Institute and the Robert J. Dole Institute recently convened a bipartisan group of 20 election experts and practitioners and they confirmed: the backbone of our democracy rests on underfunded electoral jurisdictions. They pointed to the dramatic growth in demands on election officials. Now they must manage cybersecurity risks, defend against misinformation, handle record levels of public information requests, and even deal with threats and harassment. All this, with shrinking resources. 
Local election administrators — many part-time, juggling multiple roles — are on the front lines of defending our democracy. In Buckland, for example, the town clerk isn’t just the chief elections officer; she also handles licenses, parking tickets, and more. We are asking these officials to protect a national security asset — our elections — without giving them the tools to succeed. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. We can continue to run elections locally while providing consistent funding, uniform minimum standards, and the resources necessary for security and integrity. It is time for Congress to expand national security expenditures to consistently bolster elections infrastructure. Our democracy depends on it.

Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, appears at an agriculture forum on Sep. 25, 2025,  in Kansas City, Missouri, where he discussed health, trade and the politics of a government shutdown. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said in-person town halls will lead to violence, but he doesn’t plan to stop holding them.
Marshall said he visited 100 sites throughout Kansas in August and made 20 visits last week, though those numbers could not be independently verified and were not exclusive to town halls.
“Right now, doing in-person town halls will lead to violence. I am very fearful that these two groups will assault each other, and I just don’t think it’s a very good idea right now,” he told reporters Thursday following an appearance at the Ag Outlook Forum in Kansas City, Missouri, where he discussed the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, effort.
However, Marshall said he doesn’t plan to cease holding in-person town halls.
“I’ve never seen such hatred coming out of people’s mouths at President Trump and his agenda,” Marshall said. “I don’t know why people are upset that the borders are safe and the price of gas and groceries are down and the economy’s looking better.” 
His concerns arose after the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at an event this month on a Utah college campus. In June, a Minnesota state representative, Melissa Hortman, was killed alongside her husband. In the wake of their deaths, politicians have expressed worry for their safety at public events.
Marshall claimed without evidence that he has had the most town halls of anyone in Congress in the past eight years. He drew controversy this year for walking out of a town hall in Oakley after he was heckled by a standing room only crowd.
A September report by LegiStorm found that Congressional town halls have reached their highest level since 2021 this year, led by Republican U.S. Sen Kevin Cramer with 74 town halls, followed by Oregon’s Democratic U.S. Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, with 40 and 37 town halls, respectively.
At the Thursday agriculture conference, Marshall addressed misconceptions about the MAHA movement and his efforts to educate U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on agriculture. He also opined on the potential government shutdown and reasoned that trade cannot be a cure-all for agriculture woes.
“Anyone that’s sitting there thinking — ‘Oh, we got all these trade deals. Done. That’s going to solve all our problems,’ — is amok,” Marshall said during his session with moderator Sara Wyant. She is also the founder and publisher of Agri-Pulse.
He emphasized the importance of converting American crops into protein or biofuel, such as beef and dairy products or ethanol.
Marshall said the looming government shutdown is a matter of politics. He claimed that Democrats want to add excessive costs to the budget and contribute to a bloated national debt. He called the national debt the No. 1 threat to America’s success.
“Until Congress is willing to go on a diet here, we’re going to continue down this road,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250925_marshall1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-29 18:57:32.211636

(Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Justice)The Trump administration is accusing pro-Palestinian groups and several activists of violently disrupting an event at a West Orange synagogue last year in a new civil complaint that offers a starkly different version of events than one proffered by Essex County prosecutors.
The 21-page complaint, filed Monday in federal court, alleges that a “mob” of protestors descended on Congregation Ohr Torah to protest a real estate event and memorial service held there on Nov. 13, 2024, taunted people with antisemitic chants, and assaulted worshippers. Essex prosecutors earlier this year claimed pro-Israel counter-protestors were the aggressors.
Federal officials on Monday said the pro-Palestinian protestors’ actions were intended to interfere with the Congregation Ohr Torah community’s right to freely exercise their religion. They are charging the protestors with violating a law traditionally used to prosecute people who obstruct or threaten abortion clinics.
“The practice of turning a blind eye to these attacks on houses of worship throughout the United States stops now,” Harmeet Dhillon, the head of the U.S. Department of Justice’s civil rights division, told reporters at a press conference. 
Spokespeople for the two groups named in the complaint, Party for Socialism and Liberation in New Jersey and Muslims for Palestine in New Jersey, could not be reached to comment.

They were at the West Orange synagogue that night to protest an event promoting the sale of property in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Such events have sparked protests across the region, with critics alleging the settlements are an illegal impediment to peace.
Monday’s complaint alleges event organizer Moshe Glick intended to host the event in his home but moved it to the synagogue when protestors indicated they would gather outside his house. About 50 protestors assembled at an intersection near his home, then marched to the synagogue when they heard the event had been moved, the complaint says.
Protestors broke through a line of police guarding the event, defied officers’ orders to stop, and marched onto the synagogue’s lawn, where worshipers had gathered, according to the complaint. The protestors blew long, plastic horns called vuvuzelas to disrupt the memorial service, the complaint says.
Two of the protestors — one identified as Altaf Sharif and the other called Jane Doe — walked over to Glick, with the woman then “blowing her vuvuzela directly in Glick’s ear as a weapon,” the complaint says. When Glick pushed the instrument away, Sharif blew his own vuvuzela in Glick’s face, then “charged at Glick,” according to the complaint.
Another worshiper named David Silberberg interceded and eventually pepper-sprayed Shariff, the complaint says, leading one of the other protestors to yell, “The Jew is here” while pointing at Silberberg. Sharif then attacked Silberberg, putting him in a neck hold and then flipping him over and drilling Silberberg’s face into the ground, the complaint says.
The two men tussled, and Glick then “hit Sharif on the head with his flashlight,” according to the complaint.
Justice officials are filing the complaint under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or Face Act. The law was signed in 1994 by President Bill Clinton in response to rising violence targeting abortion providers. Republicans have sought to repeal the law, saying the Biden administration used it to target pro-life Americans.
The Justice Department is seeking a court order barring the defendants from coming within 50 feet of the synagogue or Glick’s home, and from protesting within 500 feet of any place of religious worship during services or events. 
The filing comes as the Trump administration has sought to crack down on anti-Israel protests. Dhillon said this is the first time the Face Act has been used to civilly prosecute an alleged attack on a house of worship.
The federal complaint comes months after Essex County prosecutors filed charges against Flick and Silberberg, accusing them of attacking Sharif. The Bergen Record reported that witnesses alleged Silberberg had been wearing a ski mask that night and appeared to be with the protestors until he pepper-sprayed Sharif.
Prosecutors are seeking a civil penalty against each defendant of more than $84,000 and statutory damages for each person intimidated or prevented from attending the 2024 religious event.
Michael Bachner, Glick’s attorney, said in a statement that his client has “forcibly argued” to Essex prosecutors that the charges he faces are baseless since his actions were in defense of a third party. The prosecutor’s office dismissed the initial indictment but “maintains the legal right to present the charges to another grand jury,” Bachner said.
“Under no circumstances will Dr. Glick be entering a guilty plea to any charge,” he said. “The complaint brought by the Department of Justice recounts what occurred on that tragic day. We are gratified that finally the people who deserve to be brought to justice will be.”
A spokesman for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office did not respond to a request for comment.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said farmers should continue “making harvest headway” this week with nice weather in the forecast, though “conditions may be a bit dusty.” 
“Combines are rolling all across Iowa,” Naig said in a statement.
Temperatures for the reporting period were 8.1 degrees above the climatological normal, which according to the report, “quickly advanced crop maturity.” 
Across the state, 80% of corn acres have reached maturity, as opposed to 66% the week prior. The percentage of soybean acres dropping leaves jumped from just 62% last week to 83% this week. 
Soybeans rated 55% good and 18% excellent for the week, while corn rated 53% good and 18% excellent. 
Despite a below-normal weekly precipitation average of just 0.41 inch, soil moisture conditions remain mostly adequate. 
Sixty-five percent of topsoil moisture and 70% of subsoil moisture conditions were adequate for the reporting period. Southern regions of the state were slightly drier than the state average, while central and northern regions were slightly wetter. 
In southeast Iowa, according to the report, just 33% of topsoil had adequate moisture, while the majority, 66% of topsoil was short or very short of moisture. 
According to the seven-day precipitation forecast posted Monday by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, Iowa is projected to receive less than half an inch of rain for the week.

Josh Stein addresses members of the media on Sept. 29, 2025, following the shooting at a waterfront bar in Southport, N.C. that killed three people and left five hospitalized. (Photo:  Office of the Governor) “We have got to do better.”
Flanked by state and local law enforcement in Southport, Gov. Josh Stein said North Carolina must have a greater integration between its criminal justice system and mental health care system.
His comments came two days after a mass shooting at the American Fish Company in Southport which left three dead and five hospitalized.
The suspect, 40-year-old Nigel Max Edge, is charged with three counts of first-degree murder, five counts of attempted first degree murder, and five counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury.
Edge was allegedly traveling by boat on the Cape Fear River Saturday evening, paused briefly at the waterfront bar and opened fire, Southport Police Chief Todd Coring said. Shortly after 10 p.m., the U.S. Coast Guard observed an individual matching the description of the shooter, loading a boat at a public boat ramp in Oak Island.
Police say Edge acted alone in a “highly premeditated” attack.
“We understand this suspect identifies as a combat veteran. He self-identifies, injured in the line of duty. He suffers from PTSD,” Coring told reporters on Sunday.
Brunswick County District Attorney Jon David said Edge was known to law enforcement in Oak Island, but less well known in the criminal court system.
“There were some minor contacts over the years, but nothing significant in his past that would give us any indication that he was capable of such horror,” David said.
At Monday’s press conference, Stein said it’s not enough to just know that somebody may be a challenge within a community.
“We then have got to be able to connect that person with the treatment that they need — to address whatever their underlying conditions are,” Stein said.
During a first court appearance Monday, the district attorney said that while Edge had served in the military, he  had “significant mental health issues” and suffered a traumatic brain injury. The DA reiterated that Saturday’s attack on the waterfront was premeditated. Edge makes his next court appearance Oct. 13.
Identifying those who need help before a crisis 
Last week, North Carolina legislators met in Raleigh to pass expansive changes to the state’s criminal justice system, including moves to tighten pre-trial release requirements and streamline the state’s death penalty process.
The Republicans’ plan orders a study on mental health and its intersection with the justice system, but critics note the legislation does not appropriate money or make any specific directives on mental health initiatives and treatment.
Stein said it was unclear at this point in the investigation if a red flag law would have made a difference in the Southport shooting.
“There are people in our community who people know are a risk — a risk to others, a risk to themselves and they should not have firearms,” Stein said. “That’s what a red flag law allows for a judge through due process to simply remove dangerous weapons from people who are a risk. I think that this public will be well-served if North Carolina had a red flag law.”
Legislation was introduced in early April that would have allowed for extreme risk protection orders if a person poses a significant danger of harming themselves or others by possessing a firearm. That bill never received a hearing.
The governor said the vast majority of folks with mental health challenges pose no risk to others. But some can.
“There are too many people in our communities with dangerous obsessions, exhibiting threatening behavior who do pose risks. We have got to do better.”

A prominent advocate for racial justice and impartial policing in Vermont no longer works for the state.
Etan Nasreddin-Longo, co-director of the Vermont State Police’s Fair and Impartial Policing Committee, was removed from the position Friday, sources close to him say.
The Department of Public Safety confirmed Nasreddin-Longo is currently not a state employee and declined to further comment on personnel issues, according to a press release Monday.
“The department’s longstanding commitment to the principles of fair and impartial policing remains unchanged, and the work of the Office of Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs will continue,” the release states.
Mary Gannon, vice president of the Windham County NAACP, said that while many will think of this as a loss for the community — primarily in terms of the fair and impartial policing that he worked and advocated for — it’s more than that.

“The beauty of Etan and his work and his reach is that his work included the queer community, included the immigrant community,” and was very intersectional, she said. 
Nasreddin-Longo’s removal seems particularly ominous, Gannon said, at a time when there is a nationwide assault on equity efforts, including fair and impartial policing.
Regarded by many community members as a champion of equity and fairness in Vermont, Nasreddin-Longo has served on the committee since 2014 and became co-director in 2016.
He has also served on the Vermont attorney general’s Racial Disparities in the Criminal and Juvenile Justice System Advisory Panel but stepped down this year, a spokesperson from that office said.
State Rep. Kevin “Coach” Christie, D-Windsor 6, one of few Black representatives in the Legislature, said people of color in Vermont know that bias in policing persists in the state. Nasreddin-Longo’s presence on the committee and his work to change that “helped turn that dial down.” 
His recent removal, however, sends a very different message, Christie said. “It’s like we’re all better now. We’re fixed. We don’t need it anymore.”
“What does this say about the ‘Brave Little State’ and the exceptionalism we so often claim?” Christie wrote in a social media post last week. “Are we truly committed to fairness and equity, or are we beginning to placate anti-DEI sentiment in response to a shifting political landscape?”
State officials and Nasreddin-Longo did not immediately respond to comment.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Former Rep. RJ May told a federal judge Monday that he used an account under the name joebidennnn69 to send videos of children being sexually abused.
May, acting as his own attorney, signed a plea agreement last week, more than three months after his arrest on charges of sending child sexual abuse videos. Monday’s hearing formally changed his plea from not guilty to guilty, waiving his right to a jury trial.
The West Columbia Republican will remain in the Edgefield County jail until his sentencing hearing, which is scheduled for Jan. 14.
The 38-year-old’s plea agreement applied to five of the 10 videos with which he was charged. Prosecutors agreed to dismiss the remaining five counts. Each count could bring a sentence of five to 20 years, along with a fine of up to $250,000, plus more than $40,000 in other fees. Federal inmates can’t receive parole.
Prosecutors: App linked to ex-Rep. May sent child sexual abuse videos worldwide

A portion of the fine will go to children depicted in the more than 220 videos identified on the Kik account May said he operated. Through other cases, investigators have identified 21 of the 62 children in the videos, said U.S. Attorney Bryan Stirling.
Many of the same videos appear in multiple cases as people trade them around, Stirling said.
“Every download revictimizes these children and fuels this evil industry,” he said.
U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie will determine how much will go to the identified victims, who live worldwide.
A federal probation officer will prepare a report recommending a sentence, but Currie will have the ultimate decision over how much prison time May serves and how much money he owes. Currie will consider the plea agreement, as well as the dismissed charges, when deciding the sentence, she said Monday.
If May leaves prison during his lifetime, he will spend between five years and the rest of his life under supervised release, which requires submitting monthly reports and following other conditions a judge will set at a later date, Currie said.
May will also be required to register as a sex offender. As a felon, he can never again vote or hold public office, Currie said.
After advising May of his rights, including that he would not be able to change his mind, Currie asked May how he wanted to plead.
“Guilty, your honor,” May said.
The 10 videos May was charged with sending, including the five he pleaded guilty to Monday, were “the worst of the worst” of the videos found on the Kik account, depicting “some of the most disgusting and depraved stuff I’ve ever seen or heard about,” Stirling said.
Ex-SC Rep. RJ May to plead guilty to sending child sex abuse videos

Although prosecutors felt they had an overwhelming amount of evidence proving May sent the videos, the plea agreement takes away the unpredictability of a jury, Stirling said.
“This gives a certainty that he pled to five counts, and he will serve time in the federal penitentiary,” Stirling told reporters after the hourlong hearing.
May, wearing the same orange and white striped jumpsuit in which he has appeared in nearly every court hearing, stared straight ahead as Matthews read descriptions of each of the five videos in court Monday.
Under the plea agreement May made with prosecutors last week, he will not be able to appeal, unless he’s arguing the prosecutors engaged in misconduct, if the law changes in any way that would affect him, or if he claims his attorneys were ineffective.
At May’s request, Currie allowed May to rehire his public defenders, who have only been able to answer his procedural questions since he decided to represent himself, for the sake of his sentencing hearing.
May’s trial, which was set to begin Oct. 9, would have chronicled how investigators tracked a tip that an account on messaging app Kik was sending videos of child sexual abuse to the West Columbia home and personal phone of a state representative, prosecutors said. A founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus in the South Carolina House, May resigned in August from the seat representing part of Lexington County.
Jurors would have heard summaries of the videos during the trial, along with testimony from experts on child sexual abuse videos, logs of messages May exchanged with other Kik users and other activity on May’s cellphone and laptop while the videos were being sent, showing he was the one using the devices at the time, said Scott Matthews, an assistant U.S. attorney.
“The user of the phone was doing things RJ May would’ve been doing,” Matthews said Monday.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office is continuing to investigate who was running the accounts with which May exchanged videos, Stirling said, without giving more information.
A special election will determine who replaces May, who was first elected in 2020.
Five Republicans and one Democrat have filed for the race. The GOP primary will take place Oct. 21, followed by a general election Dec. 23.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4071-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-29 17:57:18.001978

The Jimmy Kimmel late-night show returned to Vermont TV screens last Friday after a sudden reversal by Nexstar Media Group. The national company owns the local ABC affiliate station WVNY, branded as ABC22 or MyChamplainValley, which airs Jimmy Kimmel Live!
Earlier last week, ABC’s parent company, Disney, reinstated the show, but both Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group, which own nearly 70 ABC-affiliate stations between them, said they would continue to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live!
Nexstar then had conversations with Disney executives that addressed their concerns, according to Nexstar’s statement announcing the decision to restart the broadcast.
Ultimately, the show was kept off Vermont television for three nights last week, but was available nationwide on Disney-owned streaming platforms.

“As a local broadcaster, Nexstar remains committed to protecting the First Amendment while producing and airing local and national news that is fact-based and unbiased and, above all, broadcasting content that is in the best interest of the communities we serve,” the company said in the Friday statement.
Nexstar’s media spokesperson, Gary Weitman, declined to elaborate further on the matter.
The show was originally suspended by Disney on Sept. 17, following Kimmel’s on-air comments about Charlie Kirk’s killing and amid threats of repercussions from Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees broadcast licenses.
But Disney announced the show would return on Sept. 22 after receiving intense criticism from across the political spectrum, with many people denouncing the decision to suspend the program as an infringement on free speech. Over 400 celebrities supported Kimmel and signed an open letter organized by the American Civil Liberties Union.
Both Nexstar and Sinclair ultimately decided to resume broadcasting the show on Sept. 26, just days after Disney resumed production.
MyChamplainValley’s general manager, Tina Marie Castano, did not respond to a request for comment Monday.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)Ousted London Mayor Randall Weddle has been reinstated to his post following a brief court battle. 
He wasted no time returning to office and led a special-called city council meeting shortly after the ruling.
Circuit Judge David Williams ruled in favor of Weddle returning to the office in a Monday decision. The order said “the London City Council failed to present sufficient grounds” for removing Weddle from office. 
Weddle had appealed an early September decision of the city council to remove him from office. After an hours-long hearing, the council members voted to remove Weddle based on three charges of misconduct and willful neglect, including that the mayor signed a $5 million mortgage for the city without council approval. 
According to court documents, Weddle’s attorney, Carmine Iaccarino, argued that city council members had engaged “in politics and score-settling” when removing Weddle from office “without legally sufficient basis or substantial evidence to support that drastic action.” Iaccarino had previously represented Weddle during the September city council meeting. 
Chris Wiest, who presented the city council’s arguments, wrote in a brief that Weddle’s appeal should be denied and defended the process. Wiest said Weddle “was given notice of the charges against him, several of which were the basis of the removals of other public officers that were upheld by the Kentucky appellate courts, he was given a full public hearing, evidence was adduced under oath, he was permitted to introduce evidence in his behalf, he was permitted to cross-examine witnesses, and where all necessary votes for unanimity” and state law was followed.
At the end of the September council meeting, Tracie Handley was appointed acting mayor. 
Williams, a judge for the 40th Judicial Circuit, was assigned as a special judge in the case filed in Laurel County, following a motion from Weddle’s attorneys. Williams is the former Republican state Senate president. 
Weddle and the city council have had a months-long brawl leading up to the courtroom drama. City Council meetings became public spectacles as the former mayor and the council members argued back and forth about the allegations. Plus, citizens packed meeting rooms to show their support for or opposition to the mayor.
Special city council meetings were set for Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon to discuss local tax rates, with a vote scheduled for Tuesday. 
Weddle led the Monday meeting, seated next to council members. A livestream on the city’s Facebook page had more than 1,000 viewers at the start of the meeting. 
Weddle told city council members he held “no grudges in what you’ve done. 
“Now that you’ve done what you’ve done, and the courts have overturned your ruling, I’m just asking now that you guys start working with me, and I with you, and let’s move the city of London forward,” Weddle said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5111_jpg-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 17:57:18.001978

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Researchers and environmental advocates said nuclear energy plants, like the Duane Arnold Energy Center that may restart in Linn County, have environmental, health and economic concerns that other renewable energy projects don’t carry. 
Speaking at a press conference Monday with the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, researchers from across the country said wind and solar energy projects would be cheaper, come online faster and pose fewer risks to Iowan’s health and the environment than reinvesting in nuclear energy sites. 
NextEra Energy, which operated the nuclear facility that began decommissioning in 2020, recently received approval from federal regulators to transfer its grid connection rights from three slated solar projects to the nuclear plant. NextEra is still waiting on several permits and licenses before operations to restart the plant can begin. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, said in the press conference that solar and wind generation are more cost effective than nuclear, and have lower carbon footprints. 
Jacobson said in general, nuclear energy facilities are more costly than wind or solar projects and can take 10 to 20 years to start new projects, while solar and wind infrastructure can be built and online in a fraction of that time.
While nuclear energy is considered a low-carbon form of energy generation, it’s not considered renewable energy since it still relies on uranium as a fuel source.
While Duane Arnold would be a restart rather than a from-scratch project, Jacobson said it “just makes no sense to go backwards into an albatross technology like nuclear.” 
Bill Orlove, a spokesperson for Duane Arnold Energy Center, said in a statement that the possible restart of the plant would help power “Iowa’s growing economy and to help meet America’s surging power demand.” 
Some metrics predict U.S. energy demand could grow as much as 25% by 2030.
Orlove said the plant would contribute 600 megawatts of generation, which fits with the Trump administration’s goal of adding 5,000 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030.
Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds has also noted nuclear energy expansion as one of her priorities in advancing Iowa’s energy systems. 
Duane Arnold began operations in Iowa in 1975. Orlove said it “operated safely for decades” and provided “reliable energy to Eastern Iowa homes and businesses.” It remains the only nuclear energy site in Iowa.
Safety concerns
Joseph Mangano, the executive director of the Radiation and Public Health Project, a non-profit dedicated to the research of low-level radiation impacts on public health, said proximity to a nuclear power plant can lead to higher rates of cancer, infant mortality and pre-term and low-weight births. 
“In a discussion about what to do with Duane Arnold in the future, one thing has been missing, and that is, what is the effect on the health of people living near Duane Arnold,” Mangano said during the press conference. 
According to statistics Mangano compiled from the Iowa Cancer Registry, rates of cancer in Linn and Benton counties from 1999-2022 were more than 10% above the state average for infants through 39 years old, while rates prior to 1975 when Duane Arnold began operations, were more than 5% below the state average rates. 
Research conducted by Mangano’s organization also found that following the closures of eight nuclear power plants, including Duane Arnold, infant mortality rates declined in the area. 
“The key point here is that these are just early statistics … there should be no final decision on the future of Duane Arnold unless these statistics, and additional ones, (are) thoroughly analyzed and thoroughly understood by officials and shared with the public,” Mangano said. 
Orlove said nuclear plants have “rigorous monitoring protocols” including radiation monitors, to “ensure the safety of employees and the public.” 
“The health and safety of the public is always our top priority,” Orlove said in the statement. “… Highly trained experts run America’s nuclear plants. With the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s) oversight and layers of safety precautions, a nuclear plant is one of the safest industrial environments in the United States.” 
Don Safer, a small modular reactors specialist and the co-chair of Sierra Club’s Nuclear Free Team, said in the call that additional safety concerns exist in the operation of the plant. Safer said the risk for serious accidents due to aging and disused reactors pose “a huge threat.” 
Sierra Club report gives Iowa utilities an F for clean energy plans

“About the Dwayne Arnold reactor: restarting it, I can’t say how much of a mistake it would be, how ambitious it is, and how unlikely that they really will be able to get it going again,” Safer said in the call. 
Safer said in addition to the risks of operation, nuclear power plants also generate nuclear waste that has been difficult to find storage for across the country. 
Safer also asserted there is a connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons. 
“If nuclear power does not exist, nuclear weapons have a lot harder time, even in the United States and the other nuclear weapons countries, of keeping itself going, because that’s not a big enough industry to train people,” Safer said. 
Duane Arnold is not the only decommissioned plant that might restart. Other projects in the works include Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania, which would reopen to power Microsoft data centers; Palisades Nuclear Generating Station in Michigan and Indian Point Energy Center in New York.
Driving this trend, according to researchers is an increase in government funding toward nuclear energy projects, which while initiated under the Biden administration, was protected in the Republican mega-bill that was enacted in July. 
Orlove said restarting the plant is a “serious undertaking.” 
“We have a dedicated team working diligently to pull together all the necessary pieces to return Duane Arnold Energy Center to service,” Orlove said. “The plant’s possible restart will bring millions of dollars in revenue to the county, the Cedar Rapids Community School District and other districts to fund critical programs and services for residents. It would also bring hundreds of permanent, high-quality, well-paying jobs to the area.” 
Many locals, labor unions and communities welcome the economic benefits anticipated with the plant reopening, the Cedar Rapids Gazette reported.
Wally Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter’s conservation and legal chair, opposed the restart of the plant, which he lives near, and said Iowans “should not let that happen.” 
“Nuclear power is not the answer to our 21st century energy needs,” Taylor said.

Contents of the analysis were first reported by WPRI-12. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson said late Monday afternoon they were “deeply troubled by the findings” of the audit, which identified decades worth of failures by the state and its contractors responsible for maintaining the westbound span of Interstate 195.
“Rhode Islanders who rely on the Washington Bridge have had their daily lives disrupted for too long,” Shekarchi and Lawson said in a joint statement. “The General Assembly intends to conduct an additional rigorous oversight hearing.”
Their statement did not indicate when a hearing would happen, but Lawson and Shekarchi promised “all options remain on the table” such as putting state officials, including Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) Director Peter Alviti Jr., under oath.
McKee’s office acknowledged multiple requests for comment from Rhode Island Current, but did not send an official response as of 5:20 p.m.
Lawmakers from the House and Senate oversight committees last met on Feb. 13, but couldn’t press for accountability then because of the state’s ongoing lawsuit. 
Rep. Patricia Serpa, a West Warwick Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Oversight, said she believed the decision to withhold the report was worthy of a hearing.
“It just blows my mind that this report existed all of this time, and no one disclosed it,” Serpa said in an interview Monday. “What the actual hell is going on here?”
Serpa’s Senate counterpart Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, did not immediately respond to request for comment. Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican, said in a statement she is convinced that an oversight hearing is the only way to get the truth from the governor and RIDOT officials about the Washington Bridge.
“If the executive branch is not held accountable, Rhode Island will remain at the bottom of every infrastructure ranking, and the Governor’s promised ‘day of reckoning’ will be a pledge as empty as taxpayers’ wallets,” de la Cruz said.
While the new report could invite further questions, Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, said he’s unsure how cooperative McKee’s administration will be.
“I haven’t seen any attempt to have a public reckoning or accountability from the DOT or the executive,” he said.

The forensic report is dated April 5, 2024 — three days after McKee indefinitely postponed its release in order to conduct its own public records request for the audit. 
Timothy Rondeau, spokesperson for the AG’s office, said WJE produced the report for defendants in the state’s case as part of the discovery process. It was posted publicly after the office learned an “unknown party” was releasing portions of it on Instagram, he wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current Monday afternoon.
“It has never been our intention, nor do court rules anticipate, releasing discovery materials publicly prior to trial,” Rondeau wrote.
WJE’s audit does not single out one party for the bridge’s sudden failure. Instead, it faults all those responsible for the highway’s condition — including state officials — for not recognizing the bridge’s problems before the emergency closure.
“Greater attention needed to be paid to the importance of the post-tensioning systems in overall structural performance and stability of the bridge,” the report states. “The deteriorating condition of the cantilever beams and corbels was clear.”
It’s a stark contrast to McKee’s message that contractors who worked on the bridge in the past two decades are the sole entities responsible for the bridge’s failure — a point his critics were quick to seize on.
“If you read this report in any detail, it’s obvious that what they’ve been telling you time and again has not been true,” Kansas-based geotechnical engineer and Kansas-based Casey Jones, who regularly posts YouTube videos about infrastructure topics including the Washington Bridge, said in a video posted Saturday. “They’ve done it for political reasons — it’s unfortunate because this should strictly be the realm of engineering.”
Locally, Rhode Island GOP Chairman Joe Powers called the decision to keep the report private a “political betrayal” from the governor.
“Our state leaders knew the bridge was failing for years, yet they kept Rhode Islanders in the dark while thousands of lives were put at risk every single day,” Powers said in a statement Monday. “We deserve leaders who will confront hard truths, not bury them.”
Former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes, who is challenging McKee in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary, said in a statement Monday that Rhode Islanders “deserve honesty and transparency.”
“Every day, Rhode Islanders are stuck sitting in traffic caused by the Washington Bridge debacle,” Foulkes said. “Governor McKee should immediately explain why the forensic audit was not released and provide clear answers to the decisions and actions of his administration.”
She called for Alviti to be fired as the state’s transportation chief and for the General Assembly to hold oversight hearings.
The westbound Washington Bridge is expected to be rebuilt by November 2028 and cost up to $427 million. Chicago-headquartered Walsh Construction Company was awarded the state’s contract on June 6 after two attempts by Gov. Dan McKee’s administration to secure a bridge builder.
The state’s lawsuit is scheduled to head to trial in late 2027.

Karl Ebbighausen, now retired from the southern Vermont police department, entered into an agreement approved by the Vermont Criminal Justice Council that results in the permanent revocation of police certification.

A now-retired Hartford police lieutenant facing allegations of sexually harassing “a number of persons” has had his law enforcement certification permanently revoked.
The Vermont Criminal Justice Council approved an agreement this month with Karl Ebbighausen that included the action, according to Christopher Brickell, the council’s executive director.
The revocation of Ebbighausen’s law enforcement certification was “effective immediately,” the agreement stated. 
The council received a complaint against Ebbighausen in June, the document stated, and the matter was sent to the council’s Professional Regulation Subcommittee for review.
Between July 2022 and March 2025, Ebbighausen allegedly “sexually harassed a number of persons who worked closely with the Hartford Police Department,” according to the agreement.
“The Subcommittee determined that the facts established by the investigation of the complaint supported a finding of unprofessional conduct,” the document stated.
As part of the agreement, Ebbighausen “acknowledges that if this matter were to proceed to a contested hearing, the State could prove” that he engaged in prohibited conduct.
“In the interest of resolving this matter,” the document stated, Ebbighausen and the council reached the agreement, avoiding a hearing before the full council. 
The panel then posted a public notice of the “Stipulation and Consent Order” on the organization’s website.
Ebbighausen could not be reached for comment. 
Ebbighausen, who retired from the Hartford Police Department earlier this year, had worked for three decades in law enforcement.
The permanent revocation of Ebbighausen’s certification in Vermont will be added to national law enforcement databases. 
He will also have to provide a copy of the consent order in this case to any “law enforcement agency to which he makes application for employment” in “any location or jurisdiction where he may apply,” according to agreement.

(Photo by mihtiander/Getty Images)As the clock ticks closer to 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday morning, Utah state officials are bracing for a looming government shutdown that could have widespread impacts on federal workers and programs across the nation. 
State officials have been scrambling to prepare for the shutdown that will take place overnight unless Republicans and Democrats in Congress reach an agreement on a stopgap spending bill before the deadline. While the Utah Office of Tourism says it’s “committed” to keeping Utah’s national parks “protected, open and accessible” during a shutdown — prepared to use state funds if necessary to continue at least some services — it’s urging the federal government to approve federal funds to support park operations. 
Hundreds of thousands of federal employees face furloughs under Trump shutdown plans

Meanwhile, the Republican supermajority controlling the Utah Legislature in both the House and Senate issued firmly worded letters to congressional leaders urging the U.S. Senate to “immediately pass a clean short-term funding extension to prevent a government shutdown that would harm hardworking Americans across our states.” 
“With the September 30 deadline days away, the Senate must fast-track the clean extension the House passed with bipartisan support,” says the letter signed by Utah House Republicans to both majority and minority U.S. leaders, dated Friday. 
“Holding government funding hostage is not a political game — it carries real, immediate consequences in every state,” Utah House Republicans wrote. “A shutdown would withhold pay from troops, first responders, and firefighters, disrupt vital services for seniors and veterans, and cut off food assistance for struggling families. These avoidable disruptions would inflict severe harm on the American people.” 
Utah Senate Republicans signed a similarly phrased letter dated Sunday, urging the U.S. Senate to support “a solution on the table that Senate Democrats should support, after all they did vote for this funding extension just six months ago.”
“The clean funding extension provides stability for our military service members, veterans, and their families, as well as the continuity of low-income assistance programs,” Utah Senate Republicans wrote. “Allowing a shutdown would consequently and needlessly disrupt our economies, threaten public safety, and undermine public confidence in our institutions. Our families and communities would feel the pain with immediate effect and confusion.”

They added that a government shutdown is “neither sustainable nor a responsible way to govern and the American people understand that.” 
“That is why we are calling on Senate Democrats to fulfill their duties, put their politicking behind, and do what’s best for the country: keep the government open,” the Utah Senate GOP’s letter continues. They added that there is “no path forward” for Democrats’ “nearly $1.5 trillion wish list,” which includes a proposal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies and provisions to roll back Medicaid restrictions in the “big, beautiful” law. 
In addition to signing on to the letter, one of Utah’s top Republicans, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, issued a prepared statement urging Congress to “act without delay” to pass the short-term funding extension. 
A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here’s a guide for what to expect.

“We strongly urge the U.S. Senate to put the country’s interests above politics and keep the government open,” Adams said. “The American people deserve leadership that prioritizes good governance over partisan gamesmanship.”
How will Utah’s ‘Mighty 5’ national parks be impacted?
The Utah Office of Tourism said in a statement issued Monday that “we are committed to keeping Utah’s parks, monuments and outdoor recreation experiences protected, open and accessible.”
“Our priority is to do right by visitors who have planned trips of a lifetime from all over the world to experience our national parks, as well as by Utahns and communities whose livelihoods depend on a healthy visitor economy,” the statement said. 
Utah’s national parks — Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Zion — generated about $3.1 billion in visitor spending for the state’s economy in 2024. 
“If the federal government does not provide an adequate solution, Utah stands ready to offer strategic state support to keep our parks open and accessible to all,” the statement said. 
Anna Loughridge, spokesperson for the Utah Office of Tourism, told Utah News Dispatch on Monday morning that some state funding has been set aside to help keep the parks open and fund a limited scope of services in the event of a government shutdown, but she didn’t have a specific number of how much state funding would be available, saying the situation “continues to evolve day by day.”

“Our primary focus is there are federal funds that should be able to support park operations,” she said. “We are committed to being a part of a solution and shaping a Utah that lasts. So ultimately, what we are doing is advocating for federal dollars to fund park operations. If that is not able to happen, then Utah does stand ready to offer strategic support to ensure that parks stay open and accessible.” 
It all depends on whether any federal funds do become available, but Loughridge said a government shutdown has the potential to impact park services like visitor centers, shuttles and custodial services.
“So who’s emptying trashes, cleaning bathrooms?” she said. “So many of those things that impact the visitor experience and, of course, are also sometimes a health and safety consideration.” 
Asked if there are risks of any national park workers getting furloughed in Utah, Loughridge said “that is a question for the federal government.” She said there are “still a lot of unknowns.” 
As of Monday afternoon, the Interior Department was on a list of federal departments that had not yet posted an updated contingency plan on its website to deal with the shutdown, according to States Newsroom’s Washington D.C. bureau. 
 What about other Utah programs?
Utah’s national parks may be the first to feel widespread impacts if the federal government goes dark, but other state programs that rely on federal funds could also be negatively impacted depending on how long the shutdown lasts. 
The Utah Department of Workforce Services — which has a wide range of social programs under its umbrella, including assistance for food, child care, Medicaid, and unemployment assistance — doesn’t expect immediate fallout, however. 
“With the possibility of a federal government shutdown this week, we don’t anticipate immediate impacts to our SNAP, Medicaid and child care assistance customers in the month of October,” a department spokesperson said. “In the event of an extended government shutdown, funding for these programs will likely be impacted.”

What about the Salt Lake City International Airport?
While airports typically continue to function under government shutdowns, officials warn it could bring longer security lines or other delays. 
Transportation Security Administration workers will continue to work — but with delayed pay — during a shutdown. According to the Department of Homeland Security’s updated contingency plan, 61,197 of TSA’s total 64,130 workers would be retained during a shutdown. 
Salt Lake City International Airport spokesperson Nancy Volmer told Utah News Dispatch on Monday that airport leaders will “partner closely” with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Federal Aviation Administration, and TSA “to ensure passengers reach their destination safely and efficiently.” 
Those workers will continue to work at the Salt Lake City airport in the event of a shutdown, Volmer said. During the last shutdown, the airport “supported these workers, however we could, with a food pantry, for example.” 
“We will look forward to supporting these workers again but would also ask that passengers be patient and understanding of the challenges these front line workers are facing,” Volmer said.

State records indicate that in October 2013, Mackenzie McCarroll was awarded an Iowa massage therapy license and subsequently began practicing in Cresco.
In July 2022, and again in January 2024, the Board of Massage Therapy fielded complaints that McCarroll had been hired to provide massage therapy services for hospice clients of Regional Health Services of Howard County, and that four clients receiving in-home care had reported missing morphine medication.
According to the board, its investigation revealed probable cause to believe McCarroll, now 32, had taken the drugs and had admitted to the theft of morphine from at least one of the clients. On Nov. 1, 2022, McCarroll was placed on the state’s dependent adult abuse registry as a result of the alleged thefts.
The board says its investigation also revealed probable cause to believe McCarroll suffers from substance use disorder and other mental health conditions, with her last inpatient treatments occurring in May 2023 and January 2024, and that she had been involuntarily committed for substance abuse issues in the past.
On Nov. 17, 2024, the board alleges, McCarroll was convicted of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, but then failed to report the conviction to the board as required. The board alleges she also failed to report her involuntary committal.
The board recently charged McCarroll habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs, obtaining or possessing controlled substances without lawful authority, and failure to notify the board of a criminal conviction.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma CareerTech plans to ask state lawmakers for an additional $68 million in its budget to expand workforce training, technology centers and career exploration programs.
The CareerTech board on Monday unanimously approved a more than $244 million request for the 2027 budget year, up from the agency’s current $175.5 million appropriation. CareerTech provides training and skills education. 
Director Brent Haken said the request is “bold and aggressive.” 
It includes $31.6 million for increased investments in workforce training in hopes of increasing program enrollments by 10,000 students over the next five years. 
Haken said the agency has requested the same amount for workforce training multiple times in past years, and CareerTech was appropriated $10 million of its $41.6 million ask for the current budget year. This year’s request is the remaining amount in an effort to stay “consistent.”
The board also wants a $20 million appropriation to expand career exploration services at technology centers, which includes reaching out to younger students to inform them of what programs CareerTech offers. Haken said he plans to use $3 million of this to provide an apprenticeship coordinator at every technology center in the state. 
The agency will make a one-time request of $10 million to expand technology centers to areas of the state not being served. 
This funding is used as a one time incentive for schools to “jump start” their CareerTech programming ahead of funding through voter-approved ad valorem tax dollars being available. 
“It jumpstarted that service, where they have four programs already in before they were getting tax dollars for that,” Haken said. “So it showed your people, your patriots, that voted on that ‘We’re gonna do what we said we were gonna do.’ And so you don’t have to wait. Your kid’s a senior or junior, they still have an opportunity.”
Another $5.5 million would develop new K-12 programs. A previous appropriation was successful in creating more than 200 programs across the state, Haken said, and the agency wants to continue that work. 
Haken will present the budget request to state House and Senate members and Gov. Kevin Stitt at a later date.

For the second time in recent years, a Vermont court has appointed an independent manager for Our House Residential Care Homes due to state findings of abuse, neglect and other care concerns.

A Superior Court judge appointed an independent manager to oversee the operations of three Rutland City elder care facilities earlier this month, after approving the state’s request for receivership in July. 
The decision, which cited reported abuse, neglect and chronic staffing shortages, marks the second time in less than five years that a court has appointed a receiver for those facilities. The violations that prompted the appointment also led the Vermont Attorney General’s Office to resume seeking $40,000 in earlier fines from the residential care homes’ owners. Those fines had been previously suspended under a 2022 settlement agreement.
The three facilities —- Our House, Our House Too and Our House Outback  —- are operated by Inn-One Home LLC, which does business under the name Our House Residential Care Homes. Together the facilities located east of Route 7 in Rutland are licensed to provide 35 beds, according to the Department of Disability, Aging and Independent Living.
The three facilities are designated as Level III residential care group-living homes. That means they serve people who cannot live independently and require as-needed help with daily activities but who do not require full-time nursing care. 
Owned by Paula and Pasquale Patorti, the company has a history of health, safety and care violations at its facilities stretching back to 2016, according to the original civil complaint filed May 23. Department Commissioner Jill Bowen brought the case with legal counsel by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office.
The department levied two counts against Our House under state statute on the regulation of long-term care facilities, due to substantial, habitual violations detrimental to resident welfare and situations that caused “imminent danger of death or serious physical or mental harm to residents.”
Washington County Superior Court Judge Benjamin Battles appointed Judy Morton on Sept. 9 as the independent manager — or receiver — of the three Our House long-term care facilities in Rutland City.
Morton is the administrator of the Thompson House Nursing Home in Brattleboro, and was selected due to her relatively reasonable hourly rate and “extensive experience working the long-term residential care industry in Vermont generally” and with the department, according to the receiver appointment order signed by Battles. Morton was not immediately available for comment.
“The primary concern that led the court to appoint a receiver in this case is a pattern of regulatory violations, primarily related to staffing and training, that posed risk to the welfare of defendants’ residents,” Battles wrote.

Verbal and physical abuse
According to the state’s lawsuit, first reported on by Seven Days, the Department of Disability, Aging and Independent Living substantiated evidence that the on-site facility manager for Our House Too allegedly verbally and physically abused a resident in April. 
Two teen staff members observed the manager, Dexter Agasi, yelling profanity like “Shut the fuck up,” throwing a chair and pressing his fingers into the neck of a resident who refused nail care, according to court documents. Agasi then wheeled the resident — who had cognitive impairment and earlier experiences of being abused — into their room and closed the door, and the staff members heard the resident crying “help” and “no,” court documents stated. The staff members reported the situation to Paula Patorti, who told the staff members Agasi knew how to calm residents through “pressure points,” according to court documents. 
After other staff members reported the incident to the state, Agasi was still working on-site when department representatives visited Our House Too on Allen Street in Rutland. During the visit, Patorti told the state inspectors that she did not think the situation rose to the level of abuse warranting a state report, according to court documents. 
The department banned admissions to the elder care home until the facility manager was removed and requested an immediate corrective action plan, department spokesperson Rebecca Silbernagel wrote in an email.
Agasi currently faces two criminal charges related to assault and abuse of a vulnerable adult, to which he pleaded not guilty in June.
At Our House Outback on Mussey Street, the department found residents to be in “immediate jeopardy” due to repeated staffing scarcity, with only one staff member being regularly present at the facility overnight, according to court documents. 
Lack of staffing led to residents not having physical assistance and movement aid for personal care needs including going to the bathroom, causing residents to be “‘double-briefed’ overnight in lieu of being provided more regular toileting,” according to the Battle’s ruling granting the state’s request for a receiver in July.
The department found “actual harm” to Our House Outback residents in March as a result of the “continued pattern of understaffing resulting in violations of resident dignity and skin breakdown due to neglect,” according to the May complaint. The home’s operator disputed the accusation of chronic understaffing causing residents skin impairment, according to the July ruling. 
At the third facility, Our House, on Jackson Avenue, the department found the home had previous regulatory deficiencies related to lack of staff, adequate training, written policies and facility maintenance.
Our House’s fourth facility, Our House Park Terrace, was shut down due to a dearth of staffing in November of last year and residents were moved to the other three Our House facilities. The lack of adequate warning for resident input on the relocation violated state regulations and caused confusion for the department, residents and residents’ representatives, according to court documents.
Our House’s attorney Antonietta Girardi Dutil was not immediately available for comment. 
Silbernagel, of the Department of Disability, Aging and Independent Living, wrote that receivership will remain in place until ended by the court, and the three facilities are still subject to the state’s regulatory requirements during the receivership.
Settlement reopened
This is not the first time Our House elder care homes landed in hot water with the state due to care concerns in recent years. 
The Our House facilities were placed under court-ordered short-term receivership in 2021, and entered a three-year settlement with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office’s Medicaid Fraud and Residential Abuse Unit in 2022 due to persistent problems with abuse and neglect. Our House was required to rectify these concerns, or pay $40,000 in damages and penalties. 
Amerlia Vath, a spokesperson for the Office of the Attorney General, wrote in a statement Thursday that the office’s Medicaid Fraud and Residential Care Abuse Unit is now seeking the total $40,000 from Our House due to the violations found by the state in recent months, even though the settlement had expired and the office had previously not sought to collect any fines.
In May, Our House paid $10,000, but failed to pay the remaining $30,000 by the Aug. 29 deadline, Vath wrote. Patorti then paid $3,000 and asked for a yearlong payment plan, but stopped responding to the Attorney General’s Office after its counter request for a six-month payment plan. Since then, the office has contacted the receiver for the outstanding $27,000 owed, Vath wrote. 
Kaili Kuiper, the state’s long-term care ombudsman with Vermont Legal Aid, said her office was not directly involved in the case, but that ombudsmen will continue to have a presence in the facilities to monitor resident care. Receivership is an important tool for the state to take over managerial and financial control of a facility to ensure the necessary services are being provided to residents at Vermont’s long-term care facilities, Kuiper said. 
“I really think this is an example of the state regulatory process working as it should,” Kuiper said. “It was clearly an issue, and the state stepped in.”

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said Monday he does not see a legal option for suing the state of South Dakota over that state’s eminent domain law regarding carbon dioxide pipeline projects. 
Wrigley had made comments on a Fargo-based radio station earlier this month that he felt a South Dakota law enacted earlier this year may infringe on interstate commerce and was researching possible legal action. 
“Our conclusion has been that there is not, at this time, a legal avenue available to us,” Wrigley told the North Dakota Monitor on Monday. 
Carbon pipelines have become a hot political topic in the two states in recent years as Iowa-based company Summit Carbon Solutions seeks to build a multi-state pipeline to capture carbon emission from ethanol plants. Summit plans a network of pipelines that would send the CO2 to an underground permanent storage area in western North Dakota. 
Summit has obtained pipeline route and storage permits in North Dakota. South Dakota has thus far denied Summit a route permit and the South Dakota Legislature passed a law making it harder for CO2 pipeline companies to obtain easements from landowners. 
North Dakota AG considering legal action over South Dakota eminent domain law

The South Dakota law, signed in March by Gov. Larry Rhoden, forbids companies such as Summit from using the legal tactic of eminent domain to force landowners to provide right-of-way for a carbon pipeline. 
Wrigley called the South Dakota legislation “a bad policy choice” and a “hostile act” against North Dakota in an interview with Scott Hennen on WZFG, The Flag, based in Fargo. 
South Dakota political leaders defended the legislation after Wrigley’s comments circulated, saying its Legislature was standing up for the property rights of citizens.
Wrigley, who voted for Summit’s CO2 sequestration permit as a member of North Dakota’s Industrial Commission, did not mention Summit in the interview. 
The main trunk of Summit’s pipeline would run through South Dakota. 
Opposition to Summit pipeline fueled by ‘horseshoe politics,’ on left and right, panelists say

Last week, David Owen, president of the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce before retiring earlier this year, told a panel at the Greater North Dakota Chamber’s annual policy summit that the idea Summit could route its pipeline through South Dakota without eminent domain was a “fantasy.” 
Summit recently has been trying to alter the terms of its pipeline permit in Iowa. It has obtained a permit for a small section of its route in Minnesota, which also does not allow eminent domain for CO2 pipelines. Nebraska does not have a state agency with authority over carbon pipelines. 
Wrigley on Monday also highlighted North Dakota’s role in siding with property owners on an eminent domain case with the U.S. Supreme Court. North Dakota and South Dakota were among 12 Republican-led states that earlier this month filed a friend-of-the-court brief taking the side of landowners as they seek to be reimbursed for legal fees after winning a court battle with an energy company. 
“There’s a lot of interest in pipelines and transmission lines, things that impact private property rights,” Wrigley said. “I am a strong private property rights advocate.”

Dan McKee is taking more hits to his job approval rating in the latest poll out Monday, Sept. 29, 2025, from the University of New Hampshire. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode island Current)Gov. Dan McKee can’t score a win with Rhode Islanders, with seven in 10 people disapproving of his job performance and almost as many saying he does not deserve to be reelected, according to results of a University of New Hampshire (UNH) survey published Monday.
The Ocean State Poll out of the UNH Survey Center surveyed 737 residents, including 666 likely general election voters. It comes two weeks after a separate University of Rhode Island survey showed equally unfavorable ratings for the incumbent Democratic governor. The UNH survey also suggests more Democratic voters prefer McKee’s Democratic rival, former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes, over him in a hypothetical 2026 gubernatorial primary, though most voters remain undecided.
McKee faces backlash for keeping Washington Bridge forensic audit secret for over a year

The margin of error in the survey overall was 3.6%, though questions specific to Democratic primary voters have a 5.9% margin of error.
“Rhode Islanders don’t need more political jockeying — they need results,” Christina Freundlich, a spokesperson for McKee’s reelection campaign, said in an email Monday. “Governor McKee is laser-focused on fighting for Rhode Island working families and standing up to extremism in Washington. That’s the kind of leadership that delivered fewer school absences, reduced overdose deaths, and strong economic growth to our state over the last four years — and that’s why Rhode Islanders can count on him to keep delivering in the years ahead.”
Foulkes took a swipe at McKee hours before the survey was published, accusing him of “failing to meet the minimum threshold” for honesty and transparency about the Washington Bridge failure. A state-commissioned audit report completed more than a year ago but only released publicly on Friday documents decades of structural problems with the westbound highway that state officials either overlooked or outright disregarded.
Jon Romano, a spokesperson for Foulkes’ campaign, again pointed to the Washington Bridge in a response to the poll results Monday afternoon.
“It’s no surprise that when our state leaders fail to handle our biggest challenges, the most glaring example being the Washington Bridge, Rhode Islanders are frustrated and fed up” Romano said in an email. “Rhode Islanders deserve competent leadership and shouldn’t settle for less. Helena will fight for every vote and restore trust in government.”
The UNH survey, conducted from Sept. 17 to 23, queried residents before the audit was released. Even before the damning report, more than a third of survey participants who disapproved of McKee’s job performance cited his handling of transportation and infrastructure — the top complaint, followed by poor leadership, named by 12% of disapproving voters.
Other recent polls more directly tie McKee’s poor approval ratings to the Washington Bridge problems: six in 10 survey participants in the recent URI poll said McKee was “highly” or “somewhat” responsible for the crisis, while more than eight in 10 of those who participated in a separate July survey by the Pell Center at Salve Regina University did not believe the reconstruction of the westbound highway would be finished on time and on budget.
Foulkes, who lost to McKee by 3 percentage points in the 2022 Democratic gubernatorial primary, has centered her second campaign around McKee’s handling of the Washington Bridge. In her Sept. 9 kickoff event, Foulkes suggested that Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. should be fired. McKee has fended off questions about Alviti’s responsibility for the infrastructure meltdown despite outrage from voters.
And the winner is: undecided
Foulkes’ strategy gave her a preliminary leading edge, with more than one-third of likely Democratic primary voters backing her in a hypothetical 2026 primary matchup against McKee, who drew support from under one-fifth of those surveyed. However, four in 10 survey participants were undecided or did not know who they would choose, while 6% had someone else in mind.
Widening the prospective September 2026 ballot to include House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, Foulkes’ remained the most popular of the three. But the 16% of Democratic voters with a favorable opinion of Foulkes — compared with 13% each for McKee and Shekarchi — fell within the margin of error. And again, the bulk of survey respondents appeared unsure, or neutral about all three. Notably, McKee had the largest chunk of unfavorable opinions — leading to a “net favorability” of negative 49 — compared with net ratings of negative 6 apiece for Foulkes and Shekarchi.
“I believe the University of New Hampshire poll confirms what other polling is showing at this time: that this is a wide open race for governor with the majority of voters yet undecided,” Shekarchi said in an emailed statement Monday. “As Speaker, I’m focused on the important issues facing Rhode Islanders, such as housing, health care affordability, jobs and the economy.  I have yet to make any decision on my political future.  However, I am encouraged by the poll results considering I have not run statewide for public office. I do believe a great many voters recognize the accomplishments I’ve made on behalf of Rhode Islanders.”
Despite Shekarchi’s influential role on Smith Hill as House speaker and sizable war chest — $3.8 million cash on hand as of June 30, the largest of any state official — half of voters surveyed don’t know enough about the Warwick Democrat to sway their thoughts about a potential governor run. Roughly 13% of survey participants overall “definitely,” or “probably” want Shekarchi to throw his hat in the ring, up to 18% among Democratic voters.
Monday’s poll is the first to gauge voters’ sentiments on a Shekarchi gubernatorial run.
A troubling pattern
But McKee’s standing among residents has been documented through countless surveys spanning his time in office, including by UNH in multiple editions of its Ocean State Poll. Two years ago, nearly half of voters surveyed by UNH approved of McKee’s job performance, but his favor plunged soon after, and has remained at or below 30% over the next 10 editions of the UNH Ocean State Poll. Most troubling for the governor, according to the poll, is the opinion among members of his own party: 36% of Democrats surveyed approve of his job performance — a slight improvement from 27% when the poll was last conducted in May. Roughly one in 10 Republican and independent voters, respectively, approve of his job performance. 
The survey also asked participants to weigh in on another term for U.S. Sen Jack Reed. More than half of respondents said he deserves to be reelected, though one-fifth were unsure or did not have an opinion.
On policy questions, a majority of participants supported Rhode Island working with other Northeast states on vaccine requirements and opposed the federal government’s stoppage of the Revolution Wind project.
The 65-turbine project, already 80% complete in Rhode Island Sound, was still in limbo when the survey was conducted, but has since resumed work under the Sept. 22 order of a federal judge in D.C.
Half of survey participants identified Democrats, compared with 30% Republican and the remainder unaffiliated. The survey featured participants across education levels, regions of the state, and ages, with near-equal participation among men and women.

Clerk Becky Hadlock did not appear Monday at a legislative committee meeting after being subpoenaed to do so.  
The post Wyoming lawmakers to pursue criminal charges against Weston County clerk for allegedly defying subpoena appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—Wyoming lawmakers will pursue criminal charges against Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock for allegedly defying a subpoena and failing to appear Monday at a subcommittee meeting. 
“This is a big violation,” Sen. Dan Laursen, R-Powell, said as the Wyoming Legislature’s Weston County Clerk 2024 General Election Subcommittee met Monday morning in Casper. 
The violation is a misdemeanor. If convicted, Hadlock could be fined up to $100 and sentenced to county jail for no more than six months. 
The Joint Management Audit Committee’s chair, Rep. Chris Knapp of Gillette, subpoenaed Hadlock to appear and testify at Monday’s meeting. But the clerk informed lawmakers via letter that she would not attend due to a scheduling conflict, Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, said at the meeting. Rodriguez-Williams confirmed to WyoFile that the lawmakers would pursue criminal charges against Hadlock due to her failure to appear. 
In the 2024 general election, Hadlock caused an initial ballot miscount in her county’s results after using the wrong ballots. Those results showed Rep. Chip Neiman received 166 votes for House District 1, while 1,289 left that part of the ballot blank, also known as an undervote. That count caught Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s attention. His office intervened and ultimately a hand count was conducted. 
That did not resolve the issue, however, for several Weston County voters who asked the Wyoming State Canvassing Board not to certify the results of the election. 
“I would like to state that if you certify this election, knowing that one county found flipped votes, and no other counties have been checked by hand, that you’re damaging the integrity of Wyoming,” Weston County resident Susan Love told the board at the time. 
The board unanimously voted to certify the results. However, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who chairs the board, said his office planned “a more full analysis evaluating [the clerk’s] conduct.”
The following month, eight Weston County voters filed a formal complaint with Gov. Mark Gordon’s office, alleging Hadlock committed “acts of misconduct and malfeasance.” 
Altogether, Hadlock faced accusations that she mishandled election ballots by ordering and using multiple ballot versions in the general election; improperly tested voting machines during the primary and general elections; used incorrect ballots in the general election, which necessitated hand recounts; and caused a significant undercount of votes. 
As laid out by state law, Gordon was not tasked with deciding whether to unilaterally remove Hadlock from office. Rather, he was required to determine whether to recommend that the attorney general seek the clerk’s removal in district court.
“Although I recognize that Clerk Hadlock made many serious mistakes in the 2024 Weston County elections, her actions do not rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance, as I understand the meaning of those terms in this situation,” Gordon wrote in his decision. “I do not believe there is a clear path to proving guilt.”
Ahead of Gordon’s decision, Gray released the results of his office’s own investigation and recommended that Hadlock be removed from office. 
“Most importantly,” Gray wrote, “we must highlight that Clerk Hadlock’s conduct in filing a false post-election audit in contravention to Wyoming law indicates a repeated and heightened level of misconduct.”
Hadlock did respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by publishing time.

Aug. 25, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A group of advocates who launched a petition drive last month aiming to cut property valuations in half are now also asking that voters approve the state pay all of Nebraska’s public school teachers at least $50,000 per year.
The new nonprofit “Advocates for All Nebraskans” launched two petitions in August, one intending to amend state law to halve the percentage of a property’s valuation subject to property taxes after 2026 and another to revise the Nebraska Constitution to add a cap on property valuation increases at no more than 3% or the growth level of the state’s general fund receipts, whichever is less.
On Monday, the group announced a third petition focused on guaranteeing a competitive base salary for all of Nebraska’s public school teachers. The proposal for a state-funded $50,000 base teacher salary was dubbed, “The APPLE plan” by members, which stands for “Assist Property Payers through Legislative Education support.”
“This plan is not a dream,” said Eric Underwood, the former chair of the Nebraska Republican Party and a leader of the petition drive. “It’s a blueprint for Nebraska.”
The three petitions will now gather signatures in hopes of making it onto Nebraska’s 2026 general election ballot. The two petitions seeking to change state law require just over 88,000 signatures — representing 7% of registered Nebraska voters — while the one seeking to amend the state constitution needs roughly 125,000 signatures — representing 10% of voters.

Ballot initiatives also need qualified signatures from at least 5% of registered voters in 38 of the state’s 93 counties. All signatures must be submitted to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office by early July.
Leading the effort along with Underwood is State Board of Education member Kirk Penner of Aurora, former Nebraska State Patrol Superintendent Tom Nesbitt of Lincoln and former Lincoln talk radio host Doug Fitzgerald.
In a campaign press release, Penner said the plan is designed to ensure K-12 schools are properly funded while moving them away from heavy reliance on property taxes.
Underwood argued offering a $50,000 base salary could make much of the state’s controversial school funding formula — known as the “Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act,” or TEEOSA — obsolete.
He said having the state cover the costs of offering all teachers a $50,000 salary would cost roughly $1.2 billion, which is about equal to the total state aid allocated to districts under TEEOSA for the 2025-26 school year.
Since a majority of most school district budgets are allocated to teacher salaries, Underwood claimed the proposal would allow some districts to cut levy rates nearly in half. However, he said the group would still like the state to continue providing foundation aid of $1,500 per student that the Nebraska Legislature approved several years ago.
Underwood said the group did not consult with members of Nebraska’s new School Financing Review Commission on this proposal, as the group is more focused on proposing improvements within the existing formula.
Underwood said the reason why Nebraska is struggling with a years-long teacher shortage is because it doesn’t offer competitive salaries compared to other states. Penner noted that 30 states already offer a base teacher salary, including Iowa which had a base salary of $47,500 for 2024-25 full-time teachers, and $60,000 for teachers with 12 or more years of experience.
“I hate losing football games to Iowa,” Penner said. “And I don’t want to lose our teachers to Iowa as well.”
Underwood claimed Nebraska’s average starting teacher salary is in the lower range of $40,000, while the overall average salary is around $56,000. He said teachers who are already paid more than $50,000 per year can still continue to be paid more, but it would be up to individual districts to cover the difference.
“The idea is that the state should fund the stability,” Underwood said. “The local communities provide the excellence in education.”
A total of $5.3 billion in property taxes was assessed statewide in each of the past two years. A 50% reduction would mean a property tax savings of more than $2.6 billion. The proposed caps do not detail how or whether the state would make up the local school funding being lost.
It would also mean a significant drop in revenues going to the state and local governments across Nebraska. Underwood acknowledged that some local governments may seek to raise their levy rates to make up the difference, but a large enough increase would require a vote of the people. This puts the conversation about tax rates back in the local arena, he argued.
While the proposals would reduce property tax revenue, Fitzgerald argued lost revenues could be balanced through increased economic activity. The property tax relief measures would give Nebraskans statewide more money to spend, and Underwood estimated it could generate about $150 million in extra sales tax revenue.
“When Nebraskans have more, they spend more,” Fitzgerald said.

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Complaints filed by professors “disrupted” by Florida’s ban against diversity, equity, and inclusion spending were mostly dismissed by a federal judge last week.
The academics, through American Civil Liberties Union attorneys, filed the suit against the state earlier this year, claiming SB 266 from 2023 imposed viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment, that the law is over-broad, and that it violates Florida’s Campus Free Expression Act.
University DEI spending prohibition challenged by professors in federal court

Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker dismissed the complaints that SB 266 “left instructors and students fearful for the future of not only education, but also free thought and democracy in Florida.”
The law banned general education courses “based on unproven, speculative, or exploratory content.”
“In short, this Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs fail to allege facts demonstrating that they have suffered a plausible constitutional injury with respect to their claims challenging the general education requirements,” Walker wrote. “Instead, Plaintiffs’ allegations and arguments attacking the language governing and application of the general education requirements are largely rooted in policy disagreements.”
Professors, in their original 66-page complaint, argued they’ve altered course titles and descriptions to comply with the statute “without clarity on how to comply with the law.”
The Legislature left it up to the Board of Governors to define diversity, equity, and inclusion; political or social activism; and social issues. 
The definitions, the plaintiffs argued in their original complaint, have been interpreted by the Board of Governors and university trustees “to align with Governor DeSantis’s viewpoints.”
The governor holds the power to appoint members to the Board of Governors and university boards of trustees. 
“Plaintiffs’ alleged injury in fact with respect to these provisions boils down to self-censorship, but their factual allegations demonstrate that this harm is self-imposed. The alleged chill and self-censorship of Plaintiffs’ in-class speech is a self-imposed injury based on the fear of losing a course designation to which no Plaintiff is constitutionally entitled,” Walker wrote. 
During a news conference at the University of Florida on Monday commemorating 10 years of Florida ranking as the best state in the nation in higher education by U.S. News & World Report, State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues celebrated the ruling.
“Our focus on academic excellence is why our system is so successful,” Rodrigues said. “And we’re the only state to have done that. The other states just don’t have the stomach to take on the fight to clear this out of their general education curriculum. But Florida has led the way and now we have shown it can be done, so let’s hope others follow.”

Walker did find that Sharon Austin, a political science professor at UF, has, on a First Amendment basis, “plausibly alleged standing to challenge the funding restrictions” SB 266 imposed on her when the university declined to fund her travel to a conference it had previously payed for her to attend. 
The university denied funding her travel to “the Global Inclusion Conference” in 2024, specifically citing SB 266, which also prohibits the state from expending funds to “advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion, or promote or engage in political or social activism.” She attended the conference on the state’s dime in 2023. 
“Given UF’s recent enforcement of the funding restrictions against Dr. Austin and her specific plans to apply for funding to attend and present at the same and similar events in the near future, this Court is persuaded that Dr. Austin, at this juncture, has alleged facts demonstrating a plausible injury in fact — the denial of funds and imminent threatened denial of funding — traceable to the Defendants’ enforcement of the challenged funding restrictions and redressable by an injunction prohibiting further enforcement,” Walker wrote. 
Walker, appointed by former President Barack Obama, said the plaintiffs may not file an amended complaint.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – About 125 commercial vehicle drivers, including some accused of being in the country illegally, were arrested during a three-day joint law enforcement blitz along Interstate 40, the Governor’s Office said Monday.
Last week’s arrests were part of “a targeted enforcement action” involving the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Oklahoma Corporation Commission. 
The enforcement effort focused on motorists who have been issued a commercial driver’s license and trucks licensed and registered in California, the Corporation Commission said in a press release.
California is one of 19 states that will issue licenses regardless of immigration status.
The arrests were for “various violations,” the agency said.
Gov. Kevin Stitt’s office said immigrants in the country without legal status were arrested. They came from several countries, including India, China, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.
The Oklahoma Highway Patrol would not comment on the enforcement operation, nicknamed Operation Guardian, on Monday. Officials with ICE did not respond to a request for comment. 
Stitt’s office said the Oklahoma Highway Patrol encountered numerous truck drivers with licenses issued by “sanctuary states” that have policies rebuffing federal immigration enforcement.
Stitt released a copy of what appeared to be a  New York-issued REAL ID commercial driver’s license that listed “No Name Given” as a licensee’s legal name.
“If New York wants to hand out CDLs to illegal immigrants with ‘No Name Given,’ that’s on them,” Stitt said. “The moment they cross into Oklahoma, they answer to our laws.”
Stitt said it is a safety issue to operate “commercial vehicles without proper verification.”
“Oklahomans deserve safe highways,” said Oklahoma Corporation Chair Kim David. “We appreciate the opportunity to assist ICE and DPS Troop S by removing non-compliant and dangerous drivers from our roads. By working together as law enforcement partners, we’re reducing risks for every driver.”
The Oklahoma Corporation Commission staffs the ports of entry, while the Department of Public Safety does the inspections, said Trey Davis, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. 
The state’s five ports of entry are designed to ensure proper registration, operation, permitting and weight limits for commercial trucks. In fiscal year 2025, more than 5.6 million trucks entered on a highway intersecting one of its ports of entry, which are also located along Interstate 35 and U.S. Highway 69.
“Our officers’ professionalism, training and use of technology quickly assess each driver and rig to resolve permitting concerns, issue a ticket with an associated fine, or require the driver to pull over and submit to further inspection of their credentials or truck,” said Commissioner Todd Hiett.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration cancelled funding for at least six biking and walking trails across the country, including a $5.7 million grant slated for Connecticut’s Naugatuck River Greenway Trail, or the NRG Trail.
In a letter dated Sept. 9, Maria Lefevre, executive director for the office of the under secretary of transportation, said the administration is prioritizing “projects that promote vehicular travel.” The U.S. Transportation Department rereviewed the grant individually, the letter stated, and withdrew funding because the project “no longer aligns with DOT priorities.”
The letter was addressed to Rick Dunne, executive director of Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, or NVCOG. Reached for comment Monday, Dunne stressed that the NRG Trail would not be built over any motorized routes, and that it would be used for transportation in addition to recreation.
“We were looking forward to being able to work with the administration on it… but they defined their goals for multi-modalism as funding vehicular access,” Dunne said.
Officials with the U.S. Transportation Department did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. 
The grant was funded through former President Joe Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure bill and the NRG Trail was selected for funding in June 2024.
The NRG Trail would connect 11 towns in the Naugatuck River Valley. The planned route snakes along the river for 44 miles, bridging towns from Litchfield to Waterbury to Derby.
The trail has been in the works for almost three decades, and the pulled federal grant would have helped close the remaining gaps. It would have funded segments of the trail totaling roughly 16.5 miles.
Progress on those parts of the trail — in Thomaston, Watertown, Waterbury and Naugatuck — will halt until NVCOG can secure alternate funding. 
Naugatuck has agreed to fund its section of the trail, according to Dunne. NVCOG intends to find replacement funding to complete the full project.
Since taking office, President Donald J. Trump has made efforts to revoke many grants across government departments. It’s an unusual strategy, particularly with respect to already funded projects, such as walking and biking trails.
Dunne said that colleagues in similar positions in other states have contacted him to join a lawsuit against the federal government over the canceled grants. Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller stated his intention to sue earlier this month.
Those affected by the lost funding include consultants involved in designing the trail and the communities the route passes through, who may lose out on economic opportunities, said Bruce Donald, Southern New England manager for East Coast Greenway Alliance, a group developing a trail network from Maine to Florida.
“This is fairly new territory,” Donald said. “Usually when money is awarded, you get it and you use it.”
Scott Goldstein, senior director of government relations at Rails to Trails Conservancy, a nonprofit that supports trail network development, said it’s difficult to keep track of the grants that have been revoked because the Trump administration is sending letters directly to communities, rather than making public announcements. 
“These cancellations are happening in the shadows,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PXL_20241002_1826196482-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-09-29 17:57:18.001978

Jared Polis has formally requested a federal disaster declaration for two wildfires that burned over 150,000 acres in Rio Blanco County this summer.

Jared Polis has formally requested a federal disaster declaration for two wildfires that burned over 150,000 acres in Rio Blanco County this summer.
The Lee and Elk fires grew rapidly and forced evacuations in and around the town of Meeker after they were started by lightning on Aug. 2. A combined total of more than 1,200 firefighting personnel were assigned to the fires at their peak intensity in mid-August, fueled by extreme drought and critical fire weather conditions.
In a letter Friday to President Donald Trump and officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Polis requested a presidential “major disaster declaration” and more than $27 million in initial FEMA assistance as Rio Blanco County recovers from the fires.

“Damage from these fires and the subsequent flash flooding puts Colorado families, major energy production, and the local economy at risk,” Polis said in a statement. “This is why Colorado is asking the federal government to continue supporting the state through these recovery efforts. By joining us in partnership, we can help communities in Rio Blanco recover from this disaster as fast as possible.”
The vast majority of the initial FEMA assistance the state is seeking would go towards repairing electricity infrastructure that provides power for natural gas production in the Piceance Basin.
“Both the primary and secondary transmission lines for electricity feeding the oil and gas industry in this area suffered over $24 million in damage from these fires,” Polis wrote to FEMA officials. “The failure to provide immediate and robust federal assistance will result in a significant, prolonged reduction in domestic energy supply.”
Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, significantly increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. The Lee Fire was briefly estimated to be Colorado’s fourth-largest wildfire ever, though its estimated size was subsequently revised downward to 137,758 acres, and it’s currently ranked fifth.
On Monday, all 10 members of Colorado’s congressional delegation signed a letter to Trump in support of Polis’ request.
“Without additional support, residents could face increased electricity costs, oil and gas production could slow, and important habitat and grazing lands could be lost,” says the lawmakers’ letter. “In addition, residents face ongoing hazards from the fire, including debris, burned trees, and threats to water quality and drinking water infrastructure.”
“A Presidential Major Disaster Declaration unlocks a number of federal assistance programs and allows local governments, homeowners, and businesses to be eligible for loans, insurance relief, and other assistance,” their letter adds. “These communities urgently need this relief to rebuild.”

(Photo by Robin Cartwright)Citing the “largest incursion into local home rule authority” since the adoption of the Florida Constitution in 1968, 25 local governments have filed suit seeking to block a new law that restricts local governments from regulating development.
They filed their request for declaratory and injunctive relief in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County on Monday.
The measure, Senate Bill 180, sponsored by Pinellas County Republican state Sen. Nick DiCeglie, was originally intended to help people rebuild properties damaged in hurricanes. But it goes way beyond that, thanks to a late amendment, with two sections in particular drawing the concern of local governments.
Section 18 freezes cities and counties from adopting land-use regulations deemed “more restrictive or burdensome” than those in place before recent or future hurricanes.
Section 28 says that the new land-use laws applies in counties listed in the Federal Disaster Declaration for Hurricanes Debby, Helene, or Milton plus “each municipality within one of those counties.” It covers every part of the state retroactively from August 2024 and prospectively through October 2027.
The law specifically says that “any person” can serve a local government with notification of intent to sue on the belief the local government has violated the law. The local government then has 14 days to correct any problem. If the government chooses to repeal the restriction, any case would be dropped. If it declines to repeal, that person can go ahead and file a lawsuit.
The suit lists specific examples of the new law that have harmed local interests.
Orange County, for example, received a letter in July from the Florida Commerce Department stating that its comprehensive plan amendment was null and void because it is “more restrictive or burdensome,” the lawsuit alleges, “without purporting to identity what it was more restrictive or burdensome than, or to whom it was more restrictive or burdensome.”
The suit also mentions how the Town of Windermere paused a tree-protection ordinance that would have required additional mitigation by developers.
Senate Bill 180 “violates the Florida Constitution and Florida law because it contains more than ‘one subject and matter properly connected therewith,’ has a defective ballot title, is a general law that classifies counties and municipalities on a basis not reasonably related to the subject of the law, constitutes an improper unfunded mandate on the Local Governments, conflicts with Florida’s Community Planning Act, and intrudes on Home Rule Powers.”
“SB 180 should be declared invalid, and the defendants should be enjoined from enforcing it,” the lawsuit reads.
The local governments in the lawsuit are: Alachua, Cutler Bay, Delray Beach, Deltona, Destin, Dundee, Edgewater, Fort Lauderdale, Homestead, Jupiter, Lake Alfred, Lake Park, Margate,  Miami Shores Village, Mulberry, Naples, the Village of North Palm Beach, the Village of Pinecrest, Palm Beach, Pompano Beach, Stuart, Weston, Windermere, and Orange and Manatee counties.
Environmental and smart-growth organizations have also been critical of SB 180. A group of 41 organizations wrote to state lawmakers earlier this month urging repeal of “excessive and dangerous” sections of SB 180.
“With SB 180, the Legislature has sabotaged its own efforts to create a safer, more sustainable and more affordable future for Floridians,” the letter says.
“Initiatives like septic-to-sewer and stormwater grants to improve water quality and comply with the Clean Water Act, lighting ordinances to protect sea turtle habitat, resilience funding programs, and flood insurance rating systems rely on voluntary participation by local governments and often require changes to policies and procedures that could be deemed as ‘more restrictive or burdensome.’ If SB 180 stands as written, these critical initiatives will be delayed or blocked.”
Sen. DiCeglie is familiar with the criticism of his legislation. Speaking Friday before the Tampa Bay Beaches Chamber of Commerce, he acknowledged the law “has been a hot topic.”
“Most of that had to do with planning and recovery efforts,” he said. “We’re going to potentially have to make some adjustments to clarify some of the language in that bill.”
The cities and counties are calling for the trial court to declare that SB 180 violates the Florida Constitution and Florida statutes codifying home-rule powers; to declare “the purported preemptions” in SB 180 invalid as impermissibly vague; to enjoin the enforcement of SB 180; and to grant “such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.”
The lawsuit was filed by the Fort Lauderdale law firm of Weiss Serota Helfman Cole+ Bierman.
The plaintiffs included in the lawsuit include Florida Secretary of Commerce Alex Kelly; Department of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie; Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia.

Garlin Gilchrist is staking out new territory for establishment Michigan Democrats in his campaign for governor, offering his support for Palestinians facing hunger and strife in the Israel-Hamas war and plainly calling the situation in Gaza a genocide.
Gilchrist first made his stance on Gaza clear over the weekend as a speaker at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee’s national convention in Dearborn, also known as ArabCon. The city has the nation’s largest cohort of Arab Americans and would be a key pick up in the Democratic primary next August.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe lieutenant governor, in a clip that was shared on his Instagram account, said that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was committing a genocide of the Palestinian people, to which the crowd erupted in cheers.
“This is not a matter of opinion. It is a matter of fact,” Gilchrist said. “This is has been established by the global leaders who study genocide. This is not something we should support. American taxpayer dollars should not fund offensive weapons of war while children are starving, while medical resources are being blocked to civilians, and while lineages of families are being erased.”

Gilchrist also said that candidates for office should not be accepting money from those who support the genocide, noting that he would not accept money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. That line similarly drew cheers and applause.
His commentary on Gaza and Palestine continued in campaign fundraiser alerts issued Monday – in both an email and in a text message.
“What’s happening in Gaza is a genocide. Families are starving. Children are being bombed. And our federal government is writing the checks that fund it,” Gilchrist’s campaign wrote. “I stand for human rights, dignity, and safety. That is why I am standing with the Palestinian people and their family, friends, and allies in Michigan – even knowing that AIPAC and its billionaire allies will flood Michigan with attack ads to try to shut me up.”
The text message sent by his campaign also addresses the controversial nature of his decision to come out in support of the Palestinian people, and positions Gilchrist as taking a bold stance in the face of what could be scorn for pro-Israel groups on both sides of the political aisle.
“Consultants told me not to send this text,” Gilchrist’s campaign wrote in the fundraising message, framed to be frank communication from the lieutenant governor. “They said it was ‘too controversial.’ They said it would cost us big donors. But if we’re afraid to tell the truth, what’s the point of running at all?”
Gilchrist is not alone in his position. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry have called the destruction of Gaza, the associated strife and the displacement of the Palestinian people a genocide.
Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, who is also seeking election to the governor’s office on the Democratic side, earlier this month called for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, a lasting ceasefire and said humanitarian aid should flow freely to those in need. Swanson said the situation “hurts his soul, and I know I’m not alone.”
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, also in the race, has called for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, neither has gone as far to call Israeli actions a genocide.

(Photo by Clark Kauffman, Iowa Capital Dispatch)A Des Moines nursing home has been cited for “free roaming” rodents, leaking ceilings, a flooded kitchen and an infestation of mice, flies and cockroaches that may have contributed to recent resident illnesses.
Inspectors from the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing visited Azria Health Park Place, located 2401 E. 8th St., in Des Moines, during the first two weeks of September and cited the facility for insufficient staffing and failing to provide a clean, homelike environment. The visit was in response to nine separate complaints, according to state records.
On Sept. 3, the first day of the state inspection, the home halted all food service from the kitchen and ordered meals from outside providers while the staff began cleaning and sanitizing the kitchen to address the state’s findings that residents of the home were in immediate jeopardy.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The inspectors reported standing water in the building, bed mattresses the staff described as “soiled and disgusting,” rooms the inspectors said “reeked of urine,” and mold-like substances in the kitchen and in the window air conditioners placed in resident rooms.  In the activity-supply room and housekeeping office, inspectors reported, the ceilings tiles had collapsed and a “dry, brown liquid streamed down the wall from the ceiling toward the floor.”
In the shower room, “grayish and brown, mud-like” debris marred the floor and the cracked shower tiles. In one resident’s room, a nurse lifted up the floor mats that were surrounding a resident who was “lying on a mattress on the floor,” inspectors said, revealing crumbs, dirt and debris.
According to the inspectors’ written findings, one of the home’s residents reported that the “bathroom ceiling in his room caved in and it flooded the entire room, then it flooded into the whole hallway this past summer.”
Other residents complained of being left to sit in urine, adding that the home “smelled like pee all of the time,” they could hear mice in the ceiling, and there were “many places” in the home where it dripped water after raining.
Rodent droppings, pooled water and mold  
The home also was reportedly short on wound-care supplies, bed linens, gloves, wipes and the briefs used by incontinent residents, with one worker saying a female resident “sat in a pool of urine because they did not have big enough briefs or pads for her.” The worker allegedly said she “had to stash briefs,” hiding them in the building, so the residents she cared for would have them when needed.
State inspectors also reported the kitchen and the home’s basement area had significant water damage as evidenced by collapsing ceiling tiles and the smell of spoilage and dampness.
“The entire floor of the kitchen appeared caked in sticky substances and food particles,” an inspector reported. “Numerous sticky traps were found with one of them showing what appeared to be rodent droppings, light grey fur, and numerous insects near the kitchen dry-storage area.”
According to the inspectors, records indicated that in May 2025, “large standing pools of water” had accumulated in a hallway of the building and in the kitchen.
On Sept. 3, the inspectors found peaches with an expiration date of Aug. 24, and the home’s director of food services allegedly reported the peaches had been served to residents that morning. Worm-like insects were seen on the kitchen floor, as were what appeared to be insect eggs, the inspectors added.
The inspectors also reported finding rodent droppings in the kitchen near the stove, and a “collection of coffee creamers” that were marred by “a mold-like substance with a strong smell growing on it. This mold-like substance was also found in all of the kitchen floor drains.”
In addition, the inspectors noted that the equipment “throughout the kitchen appeared to be covered in a layer of grime,” and cooking surfaces were “visibly blackened and appeared to not have been cleaned in some time.”
The rodent activity in the kitchen was so pervasive that fresh rodent droppings were spotted by inspectors during the inspection itself within minutes of the floor having been swept.
Manager: Years of neglect led to ‘mess’ in kitchen
The kitchen-cleaning logs indicated the area had last been cleaned in April or May, 2025, the inspectors reported. The home’s dietary aide allegedly told inspectors he had seen “rodents in the kitchen every single day since he started,” which was around January 2025.
The aide allegedly stated that the kitchen flooded periodically, and that the last serious flood had been the month before, in August 2025, adding that he had seen what he believed to be “cockroaches in the kitchen for a long time,” as well as a “significant number of flies.” A cook allegedly reported seeing one or two mice per day while working, adding that there were also problems with ants, crickets and flies.
Both the dietary aide and the cook indicated the kitchen was difficult to keep clean as it was simply too dirty and prone to flooding during periods of heavy rain. The situation had been “going on for years,” the cook allegedly told inspectors.
The inspectors reported that they also spoke to the home’s dietary manager, who allegedly stated that he “felt the kitchen was in extremely poor shape. He stated the kitchen has known issues with flies, cockroaches, and rodents that he believes to be mice. He stated the mice infestation is so bad they are catching one to two mice a day on glue traps since he started. He stated he has no idea how the kitchen got that bad and stated it was a mess.”










I don’t do critters.


– Acting Administrator Kristin Pauley at Azria Health Park Place, Des Moines


According to inspectors, the dietary manager also reported that a week before the inspectors arrived, he had picked up a box of food in the dry-storage area “and it contained a mouse nest” and indications that rodents had chewed into the side of the box. The manager allegedly added that in the past few weeks, he had “personally found at least 8-plus mice on sticky traps within the facility, with other mice seen free roaming the facility.” The state of the kitchen, the manager allegedly told inspectors, stemmed from “years of neglect.”
The home’s acting administrator at that time — identified in corporate and state records as Kristin Pauley, who also served as the parent company’s regional director of operations — reportedly told inspectors she had only recently been informed of rodent activity in the building. When the inspector asked Pauley when she had last been in the kitchen, Pauley allegedly stated she had not been there “in a while.”
The inspectors reported Pauley told them she “had never seen a mouse” in the nursing home, adding, “Thank goodness. I don’t do critters.”
Two-hour wait for call-light to be answered
While inspectors were in the building, one of them heard a resident hollering and found a woman yelling that her roommate needed help as she had been left on the toilet for a half-hour and couldn’t sit there any longer. “The emergency call-light was flashing, and the call-light was lit in the room,” the inspector noted.
A few minutes later, another resident called out to the inspector, saying someone needed to “help the little boy” who had been hollering for 20 minutes to get out of the bathroom. A subsequent review of the call-light data at the home indicated residents often had to wait more than 15 minutes for the staff to respond, with some of the waits extending to more than two hours.
A certified nurse aide allegedly told inspectors she had seen cockroaches and mice in the building for months now, but that management downplayed the issue and told the staff that the cockroaches were “just water bugs and the mice weren’t a problem.” A housekeeping supervisor reportedly told the inspectors she had seen mouse droppings in residents’ dressers.
The CNA and a licensed practical nurse stated they had noticed an increase in vomiting and diarrhea among the residents during the past month, and a nurse reported the facility “ran out of briefs” for residents during that time.
A female resident of home allegedly told inspectors she had “diarrhea all of the time” — an issue she hadn’t experienced until moving into the home. A male resident complained “he had projectile vomiting for three weeks,” the inspectors reported.
One staff member at the home allegedly told inspectors she could not eat the food served by the home as she had experienced “diarrhea all day when she ate the food.”
The staff also noted numerous residents had complained about the quality of their meals in the last month. One resident reportedly told inspectors that while he had seen no mice in his room, he sees flies “all the time” and complained that the food at times was “gross.”
Administrator: Staff is working to improve care 
State records indicate the inspections department proposed, but held in suspension, an $8,000 fine for failing to maintain the facility in a manner that keeps the facility free from pests and protects the 59 residents from food-borne illnesses. The inspections agency typically holds state fines in suspension so the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can decide whether to impose a federal fine in the matter.
This marks the third consecutive year in which Azria Health Park Place has been cited for a failure to provide residents with a clean, safe, homelike environment.
The new administrator of the home, Rand Rasmussen, said the facility’s roof was recently repaired and the home has undertaken extensive efforts to clean the building and address all of the issues cited by inspectors, including long response times to call-lights. There have been no sightings of vermin in the building since inspectors left on Sept. 11, 2025, Rasmussen said.
“Going forward,” he said, “we are wanting to change the standard of care that’s being received here and provide a more safe experience for the residents so they can obviously have a better-quality experience here.”
Federal records indicate Azria Health Park Place is owned by the for-profit Azria Health chain and its affiliate by BCP Union Park, with Aaron Kaminer having operational or managerial control of the companies. Chief Operating Officer Carrie Raemakers did not immediately respond to calls from the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
Azria Health Park Place has a one-star rating on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ five-star scale for overall care, inspection results and quality measures.
CMS reports that it has imposed no federal penalties against Azria Health Park Place in the past three years. During that same period, CMS reports, there have been 68 complaints pertaining to resident care at the home that have resulted in a citation by inspectors.
Federal records indicate Azria Health operates at least nine nursing homes or assisted living centers in Iowa and Kansas. Collectively, the nursing homes have a below-average quality rating from CMS.

(Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s plans to boost the country’s struggling coal industry by investing millions of dollars into coal power plants, opening more land to mining and loosening environmental regulations are a “major victory” for West Virginia and the United States, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a news release. 
The Trump administration announced plans to invest $625 million in coal plants and to open 13.1 million acres of federal land for mining leases. Officials also announced plans to delay environmental guidelines in order for power plants to affordably meet the country’s growing electricity demand, including for data centers.
“Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a news release announcing the $625 million investment. “These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption. Coal built the greatest industrial engine the world has ever known, and with President Trump’s leadership, it will help do so again.”
U.S. Department of the Interior director Doug Burgum said in a release that with the coal mining land policy initiative, officials are “strengthening our economy, protecting national security and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs.” The agency is also “lowering royalty rates to strengthen competitiveness, and streamlining approvals for projects in Montana, Wyoming, Tennessee and beyond,” the news release said.
“I commend President Donald Trump and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright for backing West Virginia’s coal industry and supporting our ‘50 by 50’ policy — which will rely heavily on coal and gas to empower our state to take the lead in securing America’s energy future and advance our position against China in the data and AI arms race,” Morrisey said in a news release.
“America needs to increase its energy production, and West Virginia has the opportunity to lead the way,” Morrisey added. “By upgrading our existing coal-fired power plants to run cleaner and more efficiently, we can lower energy prices for consumers and build the generating capacity we need to compete with China, all while supporting the hardworking West Virginians who work in our coal and gas industries.”
Sen. Jim Justice, R-West Virginia, also commended Trump’s announcement, saying the president is “right on the money” with the investment in power plants. 
“I’ve said for a long time that we are going to face an energy crisis of massive proportions, having to choose between powering our homes or powering industry unless we act,” Justice said in the news release. “This is smart policy in action. I’m proud of what we are getting done here with regard to energy because this $625 million investment is a massive win for our miners, our families, and America’s energy independence.”
The moves were decried by environmental advocates, including the Sierra Club, which said the administration is giving taxpayer money to “wealthy executives in the coal industry.”
“This is a transparent wealth transfer from everyday Americans, who are already making tough decisions at the kitchen table, to the millionaires that run the fossil fuel industry,” Laurie Williams, the organization’s Beyond Coal campaign director, said in a statement. “If Chris Wright, or anyone in Donald Trump’s administration, truly cared about bringing down the cost of electricity, they would be investing in affordable clean energy instead of taking a sledgehammer to the progress our country has made.”
In an email, Chelsea Barnes, director of government affairs and strategy for Appalachian Voices, said the announcements to “prop up” coal power plants and open land for coal mining were made with announcements to “allow coal power plants to further pollute our air and water.”
“But the announcements are no surprise,” she said. “The Trump administration has made it abundantly clear that they’re willing to sacrifice the health and safety of coal miners and the people living near mines and power plants to benefit the coal barons and other billionaires.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The majority of Minnesotans in recent polling want lawmakers to reconvene for a special session on gun control and pass a ban on so-called assault weapons, but that may not ultimately matter as Gov. Tim Walz and legislative leaders negotiate a deal to reduce gun violence and improve school safety.
The August mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church has brought the gun control debate to the fore, and Walz and legislative leaders have been meeting behind closed doors to see if they can come to an agreement for a special legislative session to pass gun control and school safety measures.
Results from a recent Everytown for Gun Safety poll were especially stark in the suburbs: 62% of suburban Minnesotans said they support the Legislature taking action to ban assault weapons. The results mirror a recent KSTP poll, which found 60% percent of suburban voters said there should be a special session and 60% said they support a ban on assault weapons.
Given the importance of those suburban areas in determining the next legislative majorities, you would think Republican lawmakers might be open to compromise.
But here’s another key finding of the Everytown poll, which surveyed 800 likely 2026 midterm election voters earlier this month: On the assault weapons ban, 93% of Democrats said they support it, while 68% of Republicans said they oppose it.
In other words, Republican lawmakers face the prospect of angering their own base, which could lead to GOP convention and primary challenges, especially because many gun rights voters are single-issue voters who can be activated to oppose Republicans deemed insufficiently supportive of 2nd Amendment rights.
Indeed, the Reformer called several suburban Republicans to ask them where they stand on an assault weapons ban. Reps. Andrew Myers of Tonka Bay, Tom Dippel of Cottage Grove, Jeff Witte of Lakeville did not respond to the Reformer’s messages seeking comment. Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove, declined to comment.
First-term Rep. Wayne Johnson, R-Cottage Grove, told the Reformer he doesn’t support an assault weapons ban.
“I am not wavering. I am not in favor of a ban … and I don’t see it working,” said Johnson, who won his 2024 race by 327 votes.
Without Republicans, new gun regulations are impossible. That’s because 67 Republicans and 67 Democrats share power. 
The Senate is currently short two members until a Nov. 4 special election, after which Democrats are expected to maintain their slim majority, but until then, they are a vote shy of the necessary 34.
While Walz is blaming Republicans for the special session stalemate, it’s unclear whether Senate Democrats have the votes in their own party to pass an assault weapons ban.
Three Senate Democrats, who were instrumental in holding up the assault weapons ban when Democrats controlled the Legislature in 2023, didn’t respond to the Reformer’s request for comment.
Minnesota senators recently convened for a working group on gun control, during which Republicans appeared steady in their support for gun rights while Democrats forwarded several gun control proposals.
For his part, Walz has said he will call a special session even if he fails to reach an agreement with Republican lawmakers but he has given no indication of when he would call one.
“It’s clear to me that Republican legislators want to talk about everything else except guns,” Walz recently told reporters, adding that “there is no appetite on the Republican side to hold a floor vote on guns.
On Saturday, parents of the surviving children of the Church of the Annunciation were joined by hundreds of community members at the Capitol calling on Walz to convene a special session.
Brittany Haeg, whose six-year-old son David was injured in the shooting, urged lawmakers to act quickly and decisively. “I’m here to tell you as a Catholic, as a mother, as a human: prayers in place of action when you have the power to act are a betrayal of prayer itself.”
For now, however, it appears gun control advocates have two options: Persuade Republicans to support new restrictions, or beat them in next year’s election.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250927_0003-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 16:57:17.741979

(Photos by Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The bomb threats targeting a New Mexico Democratic lawmaker’s home and office were emailed from a username titled “maga_terrorist,” according to state police reports released Monday to Source NM.
While no explosives were ever found, the threats leveled against Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth and House Floor Leader Reena Szczepanski, both Santa Fe Democrats, on Sept. 11 caused the evacuation of a nearby school and the lockdown of City Hall. The threats followed the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
The original complaint to New Mexico State Police, obtained through an Inspection of Public Records request, has a copy of the email issuing the threats against Wirth and the address from which it was sent.
The emails describe materials used to create a “pipe bomb” that was “set to go off in the next 48 hours” within Wirth’s residential mailbox or the next time the mailbox was opened.
“Even if Peter does not open the mailbox himself I’m still satisfied with the prospect of some family member losing their life or getting injured. MAGA,” the email concluded, using the shorthand for President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make America Great Again.”
The emails were not directly sent to Wirth, but instead were addressed to the governor’s office records email.
In a recent interview with Source NM, Wirth called the threats “a scary set of circumstances,” and said he was shaken by the impact, particularly on the children evacuated from a nearby school.
“It’s just an unfortunate place that we’re at with this political violence, and I hope we can figure out how to stop,” Wirth told Source NM on Sept. 23.
He said no additional safety measures beyond the already required metal detector scans will be necessary for the Oct. 1 special session.
“I certainly feel safer here, and I know the public does as well,” Wirth told Source NM last week. “Having said that, though, this is a challenging time and we’re certainly gonna be vigilant. ”
The Santa Fe Police Department previously took the lead on the  investigation into the threats made against Szczepanski, which were emailed to Mayor Alan Webber’s office on the same day — but subsequently forwarded its information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is now leading the case.
Bomb threats, lockdowns: A state on edge in wake of Charlie Kirk killing

“We learned similar threats had been made toward other lawmakers in Maryland in a similar manner as the ones received in our jurisdiction,” Santa Fe Police Deputy Chief Ben Valdez told Source NM in an email on Monday.
Source NM’s Monday request to the FBI seeking information on the case remains pending.
State police are still investigating the bomb threats made against Wirth, Officer Silver Wilson, a spokesperson at the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, told Source NM.
“So far, no arrests have been made in the Sept 11 incidents that NMSP handled regarding Senator Wirth,” Silver wrote in an email Monday. “The FBI has been made aware of the threats. Nothing has come across our desks relating to any other threats since then.”

This past week marked the one-year anniversary of Helene – a deadly hurricane-turned tropical-storm that wreaked unprecedented havoc in western North Carolina. Helene caused widespread and massive flooding that killed scores of people and caused more than $60 billion dollars in damage to North Carolina’s mountain west.
In the year since, clean-up and recovery have been ongoing – sometimes seemingly never-ending — tasks for the communities affected and state leaders. Indeed, since he took office just a few months after Helene, Gov. Josh Stein has made Helene recovery his administration’s top priority and recently Newsline was lucky enough to get a snapshot of where things stand when we caught up with the Governor’s point person in that effort, Matt Calabria.

As of 2022, the latest year with available data, people 55 and over made up nearly 1 in 6 prisoners — a fourfold increase since 2000 — and their numbers are projected to keep rising. A new report from the […]","An incarcerated person sits inside a housing block at California’s San Quentin State Prison. People 55 and older make up about 19% of the state’s prison population. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)America’s prison population is growing older at a pace that some experts say is unsustainable. As of 2022, the latest year with available data, people 55 and over made up nearly 1 in 6 prisoners — a fourfold increase since 2000 — and their numbers are projected to keep rising.
A new report from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab at the University of Texas at Austin warns that this trend is straining correctional systems that were not designed to care for older adults.
If current trends continue, the authors estimate that by 2030 as much as one-third of the U.S. prison population will be over 50.

“It puts it into perspective how bad that this has gotten,” said Alyssa Gordon, the report’s lead author. Gordon is an attorney and legal fellow with the ACLU National Prison Project. “People don’t realize that prisons are woefully equipped to handle this crisis.”
The findings are based on data from public records requests to all 50 state corrections departments, publicly available state prison population datasets and the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Some data, however, were not available for every state, limiting the authors’ ability to make extended state-by-state comparisons.
The report’s findings come as states face competing pressures: a nationwide crackdown on crime and public safety, tightening corrections budgets and severe overcrowding and staffing shortages.
The aging prison population is largely a product of the “tough-on-crime” era of the 1980s and 1990s, when lawmakers at both the state and federal level enacted a wave of punitive policies under the banner of public safety, according to the report. These policies, including mandatory minimums, “three strikes” laws and “truth-in-sentencing” statutes, led to significantly longer sentences and fewer opportunities for early release. Experts say many of those policies remain in place today.
The report also highlights the growing price tag of incarcerating an aging population. Corrections spending data shows an upward trend in medical costs across some states, according to the report.
Efforts to release prisoners from long sentences draw new interest

Prisons often lack accommodations for older adults, including accessible showers and beds, dementia care and hospice services, putting them at greater risk of injury or premature death, according to the report.
Emergency protocols also are frequently inadequate, the authors found, leaving older prisoners particularly vulnerable during natural disasters, disease outbreaks and other emergencies.
Some experts say that the costs of incarcerating older adults could create common ground for policymakers, as reducing this population may lower prison spending without significantly affecting public safety.
“If you want to figure out which population to target where it doesn’t have a public safety implication, this is the population to turn to,” Michele Deitch, one of the report’s authors and the director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab, told Stateline. “This is an issue that can gather bipartisan support.”
The report’s authors estimate that more than half of incarcerated people over 55 — more than 58,000 individuals — have already served at least 10 years, with nearly 16,000 behind bars for more than half their lives.
Older adults are less likely to reoffend, with recidivism rates reported at 18% in Colorado in 2020, 12% in South Carolina in 2021, and 6% in Florida in 2022. These rates are far below the national three-year rearrest rate of 66% for the general prison population, according to the report.
In recent years, more states have explored measures to address the aging prison population, including legislation commonly called “second look” laws or policies that expand parole eligibility for older or seriously ill inmates.
Most recently, a new Maryland law, which is set to take effect on Oct. 1, will allow certain incarcerated people to apply for geriatric parole. The law applies to those who are at least 65, have served at least 20 years, are not sex offenders, are serving sentences with the possibility of parole, and have had serious disciplinary infractions in the past three years.

Young I State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/mass-mcas-scores-still-not-back-to-pre-pandemic-levels/,"""The results show slight improvement in English language arts scores among students in grades 3 through 8 and no change in math scores for that cohort. Results for 10th graders, the first class to take the standardized test knowing that voters had already scrapped it as a high school graduation requirement, were down across the board.""","A SMALLER PERCENTAGE of Massachusetts schools made significant progress towards, met or exceeded their own goals in 2025, state officials said Monday as they released “sobering” results from the latest round of MCAS testing.
The results, which Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler and Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Pedro Martinez are making public during an event at an Arlington middle school, show slight improvement in English language arts scores among students in grades 3 through 8 and no change in math scores for that cohort.
Results for 10th graders, the first class to take the standardized test knowing that voters had already scrapped it as a high school graduation requirement, were down across the board. Officials at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education said they think last fall’s vote might have something to do with the slide.
In a call with reporters Monday morning, Martinez pointed out that there is not one single statewide student group that has bounced back to its pre-pandemic level of achievement in Massachusetts.
“There are other states that have actually already, as a state, already reached pre-pandemic levels. And there’s many states who have some of their groups of students who have reached their pre-pandemic levels,” the commissioner, who started here in July after having run Chicago’s school system, said. “We also continue to see achievement gaps, specifically for students of color, our students with disabilities and English learners. Look, these results are sobering, but they’re not insurmountable. I am confident that we can improve and that Massachusetts can continue to be a national leader in education.”
Tutwiler added, “I have long suggested that recovery from the pandemic will be a process, not an event.”
In English language arts, 42 percent of students in grades 3 through 8 met or exceeded the state’s expectations, an increase of 3 percentage points compared to 2024 but still 10 percentage points below statewide results from 2019. Most 10th graders, 51 percent, met or exceeded the English expectations, but DESE said that represents a drop of 6 percentage points from 2024 and 10 percentage points from 2019.
In math, 41 percent of third-through-eighth graders met or exceeded expectations, unchanged from 2024 but lagging 2019 results by 8 percentage points. Among 10th graders, 45 percent met or exceeded expectations. DESE said that is 3 percentage points below 2024 levels and 14 percentage points below pre-pandemic 2019 levels.
Forty-six percent of fifth graders met or exceeded expectations on the MCAS science exam, up one percentage point from last year but still down 3 points from 2019. For eighth graders, 37 percent met or surpassed expectations (down 2 percentage points from 2024 and 9 percentage points behind 2019 levels). Forty-six percent of tenth graders met or exceeded the science expectations, a drop of 3 percentage points compared to 2024. DESE officials say comparisons to 2019 are not meaningful for 10th graders because the exam has changed since then.
DESE’s Chief Officer for Data, Assessment and Accountability Rob Curtin said the state sees signs in the 10th grade MCAS results that students were likely influenced by the outcome of last November’s successful ballot question to break the link between MCAS passage and high school graduation. He said the “evidence” includes increases in the number of students who either left answers blank or “answered a question in an off-topic manner, in other words, they didn’t answer the question” compared to 2024.
“So these are things that we’re going to continue to look at and examine, but there is some evidence to suggest that there was an impact of motivation as it relates to the results from Question 2 back in November,” Curtin told reporters.
Across the state, 55 percent of schools either made substantial progress towards, met or exceeded their own accountability targets. And while DESE officials pointed out that a majority of schools at least made serious progress in 2025, it represents a decrease from 60 percent of schools that at least made significant progress in 2024.
Of 1,590 schools that serve MCAS-tested grades and had sufficient student populations, there are 280 schools, or 18 percent, that the state has classified as “requiring assistance or intervention” for meeting at least one criterion from a list.
Tutwiler and Martinez chose Arlington’s Ottoson Middle School as the site of the annual MCAS results announcement because the district is one of just 63 (of nearly 400 statewide) where MCAS scores have at least returned to pre-pandemic levels in English language arts, math or both. 
Arlington is one of 13 districts where scores for grades three through eight have at least rebounded in both English and math, along with Amherst, Benjamin Banneker Charter School, Central Berkshire, Cohasset, Excel Academy Charter School, Farmington River Regional, Libertas Academy Charter School, Pioneer Charter School of Science, Rowe, Sizer School: A North Central Charter Essential, Wakefield, and Williamsburg.
Lawmakers created the MCAS system in a 1993 education reform law that was aimed at improving accountability and school performance. The first tests were given in 1998, and students starting with the high school class of 2003 were required to achieve sufficient scores to graduate until voters approved a measure last November to decouple the two.
A panel assembled by Gov. Maura Healey has to make at least initial recommendations for a new statewide high school graduation standard by the end of the year and last week unveiled its first rough sketch of its thinking. Tutwiler, who co-chairs the group, said last week the recommendations “will include rigorous learning experiences and a mechanism to give us confidence that all students are meeting these high expectations.”
The Massachusetts Teachers Association that pushed for the elimination of MCAS passage as a graduation requirement responded by warning against the continued use of a standardized test to assess students.
“Educators and voters have made clear that such essential skills cannot be assessed by a standardized test. We will only nurture students to be ‘critical problem solvers, intentional collaborators, effective communicators, self-aware navigators, and responsible decision-makers’ if we design educator-led systems of assessment and provide the necessary resources that educators, students and schools need to fulfill these goals,” Max Page and Deb McCarthy, president and vice president of MTA, said.
MCAS results are sometimes accompanied by DESE’s corresponding school and district accountability determinations. But Monday’s announcement did not include any details on schools exiting or entering “underperforming” or “chronically underperforming” status. DESE officials said Martinez will evaluate each school’s status in the coming weeks.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Transportation_Education_School-Bus_Boston-3.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-29 15:58:08.950237

This valiant proclamation about the importance of free speech, attributed to the French philosopher and writer Voltaire, seemed to embody everything that was essential and noble about my chosen profession, about democracy, and about our great nation.
Untested youthful idealism and bravado are easy. 
Tacking a banner to the wall in 1984 was, I suppose, the equivalent of posting my personal creed to Instagram or X today, if even less impactful.
Living up to that idealism not just in word but in deed, through the tests of time as a writer, a professor, a father, an engaged citizen, and a college president, has proven to be much harder, especially in today’s fiercely divided political landscape.
I have beliefs and strongly held opinions, and like anyone else, I am gratified when my perspective prevails. 
Still, for the last four decades of my life and career, I have tried to keep Voltaire’s conviction in mind when faced with critical decisions about free expression on campus and in my community.
Because far more important than my perspective is the system of government and agreed upon set of cultural principles that allow me to have it and share it in the first place, and that allow others to do the same.
So, following the assassination of conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University earlier this month, I joined leaders from across the political spectrum who have expressed condolences and offered words of warning about the rising tide of politically motivated violence in our country.
There are very few matters of public policy that Charlie Kirk and I would have agreed on, and I found some of his rhetoric, particularly about civil rights and the LGBTQ community, odious.
But how I feel about Kirk’s politics and personality in this moment is irrelevant.
Political disagreement should be settled at the ballot box or mediated through the legislative process, not forced by an assassin’s bullet.
We are at a moment when extremists on both the left and the right use strategies ranging from public shaming and cancelling, to censoring and intimidating not just to disagree with the opposition, but to silence them—sometimes permanently.
A distressingly large proportion of college students across the country seem to agree with the tactics.
The recently released 2026 Free Speech Rankings from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) find that a majority of college students (from nearly 70,000 surveyed at more than 250 colleges and universities) feel that controversial speakers should not be allowed on campus, and that it is acceptable to block other students from attending a campus speech.
Even more alarming, a third of the students surveyed find it acceptable, at least in some instances, to use violence to stop a campus speech.
That is wrong, and college leaders everywhere have a responsibility to turn this troubling trend around.
Encouragingly, at this fraught political crossroads, some are trying to do just that.
Last year, StoryCorps founder Dave Islay created One Small Step, an initiative designed to get people with different viewpoints talking to each other, and now he is bringing his mobile recording booth to college campuses in an effort to bridge political divides.
Braver Angels, an organization launched by Donald Trump supporters and Hilary Clinton supporters after the 2016 election with a mission to bring Americans together to bridge partisan divides, now offers workshops and training to equip K-12 schools and colleges with the skills to navigate political differences.
Campus Compact, a network of more than 1,000 colleges and universities nationwide dedicated to effective community and civic engagement, offers tools like Better Discourse: A Guide for Bridging Campus Divides in Challenging Times.
And next month here in Massachusetts, the Department of Higher Education and Fitchburg State University are cosponsoring “Civic Discourse in Action: Advancing Debate, Dialogue, and Deliberation in Massachusetts Higher Education,” a conference for faculty and staff to explore how they can help students build better capacity for principled debate and dialogue across differences.
In 1943, halfway through its engagement in the Second World War, America’s best-known painter and illustrator, Norman Rockwell, delivered to his countrymen one of his most famous works: a series of paintings known as “The Four Freedoms.”
Inspired by President Franklin Roosevelt’s “The Four Freedoms” State of the Union address to Congress, Rockwell’s paintings illustrate, in his signature Americana style, “Freedom from Fear,” “Freedom from Want,” “Freedom of Worship,” and “Freedom of Speech.”
Framed prints of “Freedom of Speech,” which depicts a Vermont farmer standing up to express his opinion at a town meeting, hang above my desk at home and on campus, as a reminder of this bedrock American value.
When “The Four Freedoms” were unveiled in 1943, the Saturday Evening Post commissioned four authors to write essays to accompany each illustration in the magazine.
Booth Tarkington wrote a fictional, cautionary parable inspired by “Freedom of Speech,” which imagines a young Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini meeting in the Brenner Pass in 1912, where they plot to take over their countries by suppressing free speech and “purging” their enemies.
Over grapes, wine, and cheese, they lament nations like England and the United States, where people create their own governments, listen to each other’s points of view, and vote their consciences, while conspiring to create societies where dissent is punished and the people live in fear.
“Speech is the expression of thought and will,” the youthful Hitler observes, “Therefore, freedom of speech means freedom of the people. If you prevent them from expressing their will in speech, you have them enchained, an absolute monarchy. Of course, nowadays he who chains the people is called a dictator.”
America’s destiny has always been to be a beacon for free thinking, free speaking, and free democracy; not a nation for dictators or for those, like Charlie Kirk’s assassin, who would suppress the freedom of the people.
And the campuses of America’s colleges and universities should reflect this openness to ideas and contrary views—places for free inquiry where we can choose not to agree with what others have to say, yet defend for all we are worth their right to say it.

Brett Hulsey, known for controversial behavior in the Wisconsin Assembly, has joined the crowded Democratic field for governor in 2026.
“I am running for governor to make Wisconsin better for my family and yours. My grandkids and yours deserve the best schools, roads and clean lakes and beaches,” Hulsey said in his campaign announcement last week.

Hulsey represented Middleton in the state Legislature from 2011 to 2015. Prior to that, he served on the Dane County Board for 14 years, including chairing the Dane County Personnel and Finance Committee.
While in the Assembly, Hulsey was cited for disorderly conduct after police accused him of flipping a nine-year-old boy off his inner tube and taking pictures of him at a Madison beach. He also used $1,200 in campaign funds in 2013 to buy himself a 1987 Volkswagen Cabriolet, which he said he was going to use for parades and campaigning.
Hulsey decided not to run for reelection in the Assembly in 2014 so he could run for governor in 2014. He came in a distant second in the Democratic primary to Mary Burke. 
During his last campaign, Hulsey made national headlines for his plan to go to the 2014 Wisconsin Republican Convention in Milwaukee, dress up as a confederate soldier and hand out Ku Klux Klan hoods as a way of highlighting the policies of then-Gov. Scott Walker, which he said were racist.
Hulsey, a former teacher, cited his outspoken opposition to Act 10, a Walker-era law that stripped teachers and other public employees of collective bargaining rights, as a  reason he decided to run. 
“Attacks on teachers and cuts to school investment are coming home to roost with lower school performance. I will invest in our kids, schools, teachers, and support staff,” Hulsey said. 
Since his time in office, Hulsey has run the housing, energy and environmental consulting business Better Environmental Solutions LLC. 
Hulsey joins a growing group of Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls.
Candidates who have announced so far include Lt. Gov. Sarah Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, state Rep. Francesca Hong, former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes and Mukwonago beer vendor Ryan Strnad. 
The primary for governor is scheduled for August 2026.
Republicans in the race include U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann.

A year after seeking to reorganize its depleting finances in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Vermont Roman Catholic Diocese is struggling to cover about $1.5 million and counting in related legal bills.
Under federal law, an institution requesting Chapter 11 protection must pay attorney fees not only for itself but also for officially recognized creditors — which, in the diocese’s case, includes more than 100 claimants alleging sexual abuse by clergy.
The state’s largest religious denomination filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 30, 2024, after a series of misconduct settlements reduced its assets by half, to about $35 million. Since then, the diocese has spent almost 5% of its remaining money on legal bills, forcing it to cut the workweek for staff at its South Burlington headquarters to 30 hours.
“We also have encouraged employees to seek other possible employment opportunities because we cannot guarantee any position at this time,” Vermont Catholic Bishop John McDermott wrote in a letter to parishioners.

The church and creditors are aiming to mediate a preliminary plan by Dec. 31. But the diocese already “has exhausted its unrestricted investments” and is paying for its operating expenses and bankruptcy case with the $3 million gleaned each year from an annual bishop’s appeal and a tax on the income of its 63 parishes, McDermott wrote.
The diocese has paid $582,932 for its bankruptcy lawyers as of Aug. 31, court records show. The Minnesota-based firm of Fredrikson & Byron, which specializes in business law, has received $491,999. As local support, Burlington’s Dinse firm has received $47,369 and Bethel lawyer Raymond Obuchowski has received $43,563.
The church has paid out even more — a total of $843,089 as of July 31 — for the legal fees of three groups who represent abuse claimants and their Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. The national law firm of Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones has received $564,670, the California-based Berkeley Research Group has received $257,140 and the New York state law firm of Lemery Greisler has received $21,278, records show.
When filing for bankruptcy a year ago, the church said it had no choice in joining 40 other U.S. Catholic entities who’ve sought Chapter 11 protection. The Vermont diocese had paid $34.5 million to settle 67 clergy misconduct lawsuits yet still faces 118 more claims dating as far back as 1950.
Going to court hasn’t been cheap. As the church’s chief counsel, Fredrikson & Byron is charging $235 an hour for a paralegal, $485 an hour for an associate and between $565 and $975 an hour for a lawyer, records show.
Pachulski Stang Ziehl & Jones, acting as lead attorneys for the creditors committee, usually charges as much as $2,250 an hour for a lawyer, but “for the entirety of 2025, the firm will continue to cap its rate for attorneys working on the case at $950 per hour,” a court filing stated.
Vermont Bankruptcy Court Judge Heather Cooper, who must approve all legal fees, has tried to cut costs. She asked the creditors’ counsel to reduce its first quarter expenses by $4,208 after noticing the firm had incorrectly sought compensation for its online legal research platform.
But all involved know legal bills can add up. In an extreme example, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre on Long Island, New York, reported $70 million in attorney fees over four years before reaching a record $323 million bankruptcy court settlement last December.
Under the Chapter 11 process, the Vermont church must present the court with a tally of its assets and liabilities. A judge then will decide whether to allow it to develop a reorganization plan that would require approval from both the court and creditors.
Vermont abuse claimants are seeking church records detailing the diocese’s assets, including a reported $35 million tied to its headquarters and state-level holdings, and all local operations it oversees, starting with 63 parishes with an estimated collective worth of $500 million. The findings are expected to spark future court debate on which assets can be used to compensate creditors.

Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville to restore funding cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.
The protest, part of the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign Moral Mondays, was organized by clergy and pastors from across the South, and led by Rev. Carolyn Foster of Greater Birmingham Ministries. The group sang a chorus while they marched from the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church to the Capitol.
“Somebody’s killin’ our people, and it’s gone on far too long. And we won’t be silent anymore,” the group sang.

The OBBBA cuts to SNAP will impact the state more than any changes to Medicaid eligibility because Alabama has not expanded Medicaid. Lenice Emanuel, director of the Alabama Institute for Social Justice, said the cuts in the OBBBA should be considered attacks on human rights. According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009.
“These institutions, they depend on Medicaid reimbursements just to exist. So when Medicaid gets cut, hospitals literally close,” Emanuel said. “And when hospitals close, we have people with heart attacks who are being untreated, and we have families traveling for miles when they have an emergency.”
More than 750,000 Alabamians are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), but SNAP is a completely federal program. Starting in fiscal year 2028, the state will have to pay for 10% of SNAP benefits. In Alabama, that would mean the state would have to pay an additional $208.7 million with current enrollments, according to an August estimate from the Alabama Department of Human Resources.
“This is not just cruel. It is not just bad policy. It is immoral,” Emanuel said. “We should consider childcare a human right. We should consider food in this state a human right. Healthcare should be considered a human right. Dignity should be considered a human right.”
A presbyterian pastor in Vestavia Hills, Leanne Pearce Reed, and a Montgomery pastor, Gary Brower, said they were protesting because it is what Jesus Christ would do.
“That is why we serve the least of these. And in our congregation, like so many faith communities in this state, we give food to our food pantries so that families can come and have enough to eat,” Reed said. “We do all of these things, and then our lawmakers do not do their part to stand up for the least of these. Our lawmakers say we are going to take health care from those who are already vulnerable.”
Hanna Broome, the religious director for Repairers of the Breach, said it is important to remember Alabama’s history in the Civil Rights Movement and to carry that history to bring change today.
“The South is home to deep pain, but I truly believe also transformative potential when the South shifts towards justice, the nation follows,” Broome said. “This is why we gather, not in protest alone, but in prophecy, to organize and to lead. Moral Mondays are our declaration that we will not be silent while policy makers drag this nation backwards.”
Brower urged lawmakers to be more like the Good Samaritan.
“Jesus makes a point of it being good, because there were two people who did walk by, and they were people with power,” Brower said. “They were people with prestige. They were people with voices. They probably even had podcasts. They were able to shape opinions, but when they saw someone on the side of the road, beaten up, stripped, robbed. They walked by.”
Valtoria Jackson, an organizer, said organizers planned to deliver a letter with data of the impacts of the OBBBA to the Montgomery offices of Britt and Tuberville.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)SEATTLE — The mayor of Washington’s biggest city and the state’s attorney general implored President Donald Trump on Monday not to send federal troops here.
This comes after Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed plans over the weekend to dispatch Oregon’s National Guard to nearby Portland. Local leaders fear Seattle could be next as the president federalizes National Guard troops and deploys them to major American cities.
“We do not need the federal government bringing in armored vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, military personnel to make us ‘safer.’ There is not an insurrection here,” Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said in a Monday morning press conference at City Hall. 
“Our message today is very clear: Stay out of Seattle,” Harrell added.
Federal officials have repeatedly called Seattle unsafe, including last week when Trump suggested moving 2026 FIFA World Cup matches out of the city due to safety concerns. 
Donald Trump Jr. last month called Seattle and Portland “craphole cities” and raised the possibility of sending federal troops.
Harrell appeared alongside Attorney General Nick Brown, Police Chief Shon Barnes, Fire Chief Harold Scoggins and City Council members Sara Nelson and Alexis Mercedes Rinck. 
Seattle City Attorney Ann Davison, a Republican, was not there, though city officials made clear she’s been involved in discussions about how to respond to a troop deployment. 
Harrell and Brown emphasized they haven’t heard anything from the federal government about its plans for Seattle.
In the coming days, Harrell plans to issue an executive order that “will establish how we will specifically communicate and protect our communities, preserve our local control,” and “will strengthen our policies to prevent unconstitutional and unlawful encroachment” in the city. 
On Sunday, Hegseth told Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek that he was sending 200 members of the Oregon National Guard for two months to protect federal property and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Portland. The state and city quickly sued the Trump administration over the deployment. Hundreds protested outside Portland’s ICE facility.
Trump has launched similar military crackdowns in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Federal troops are also expected to arrive in Memphis this week. 
The deployments to Los Angeles and the nation’s capital resulted in legal battles. In California, a federal judge this month ruled sending troops there violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th-century law that bars using troops for domestic policing with limited exceptions. 
In that case, Trump cited federal law allowing the president to call out National Guard troops if “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” The statute also allows for deployments in the case of foreign invasion or if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”
Washington, D.C., also sued this month over the deployment there.
After the deployment in California in June, Gov. Bob Ferguson, Harrell and other leaders pleaded for peace at local protests to avoid giving Trump a pretense to send troops here.
Brown said attorneys in his office have been working to “make sure that we will be ready to respond if Washington state is ever put into the same position.”
“The only thing consistent from the president’s policy is that he indeed is attacking the people in places that didn’t vote for him or that he views as an opposition,” he said. “And it’s entirely possible, based on the president’s comments and those in his administration, that what we are seeing in Portland will be attempted here.”
Brown attended a conference last week in Washington, D.C., where he saw what the military policing a city looks like.

“To see American troops walking the streets and what that does for that city, and the tension that the residents of Washington, D.C., are feeling, and the fear that business leaders and community members and people who are just visiting that city are experiencing is unprecedented,” he said. “It is un-American and I think it’s ultimately unlawful.”
Harrell was set to talk Monday afternoon with state Adjutant General Gent Welsh, who leads Washington’s National Guard. He said he talked to Ferguson earlier Monday morning. Ferguson posted to social media that his office has been in communication with Kotek’s team in Oregon. Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, was set to be out of state on vacation this week, and then on work-related travel on the East Coast through Oct. 9. 
In February, Ferguson’s top aides debated sending 200 troops from the state’s National Guard to the Canadian border to combat drug trafficking — and get ahead of the president potentially federalizing the Guard.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4634-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 15:58:08.950237

The biggest H-1B employer is Triad National Security, which is Los Alamos National Laboratory’s primary contractor, but many rural school districts in New Mexico all have one or more H-1B employee. (Westend61/Getty Images)
President Donald Trump recently announced a new, huge fee for H-1B visa applications, making it far more expensive for employers to hire skilled, foreign workers in a variety of industries. 
In a proclamation Sept. 19, Trump justified the new $100,000 fee for H-1B applications as a way to “address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.”
Particularly in tech, Trump wrote, companies have used H-1B visas to replace American workers. According to the White House, the number of foreign STEM workers in the United States more than doubled between 2000 and 2019 to almost 2.5 million. Employers, Trump said, have brought in so much low-wage, high-skilled foreign tech labor that “a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens” has resulted. 
Trump’s $100K fee for H-1B visas could have “huge” effect on tech industry

But data Source New Mexico reviewed paints a different picture, at least in New Mexico, and suggests that rural school districts, educational institutions and hospitals might take a big hit if prospective foreign employees have to pay $100,000 to apply to work here.
According to the latest data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, 479 H-1B employees received approval to work in New Mexico at 104 different employers. The figure includes those whose employers approved their applications this fiscal year, as well as cases in which employers allowed applicants to work in different positions or for new employers. 
While 30 of the employers can reasonably be categorized as “private,” including at tech or engineering firms in New Mexico, the vast majority of employees work in the healthcare, government or education sectors. 
Triad National Security LLC, Los Alamos National Laboratory’s primary contractor, stands out as the state’s biggest H-1B employer.  The contractor employs 69 H-1B visa holders, according to the USCIS data for this federal fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. 
A Triad spokesperson declined to comment. 
The other biggest H-1B employers include Presbyterian Healthcare Services, which has 62 H-1B employees, and the University of New Mexico, which has 50. 
Rural school districts across New Mexico have one or more H-1B visas, according to the data. Forty-seven of the state’s 104 H-1B employers are educational institutions or school districts, according to Source’s review. 
That includes 19 public school districts in New Mexico that each have one H-1B employee in rural areas all over the state, including in Zuni, Hobbs, Dexter, Cuba and elsewhere. 
In a statement to Source New Mexico this week, Stacy Johnston, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions, said H-1B visas are essential for a state with recent significant job losses, including during the recession that began in 2007 and the COVID-19 pandemic. According to DWS data, the state lost about 50,000 jobs between August 2008 and September 2010, then about 100,000 jobs at the onset of the pandemic.
“Even with all the incredible efforts going on in our state to train our homegrown talent, we know we need more people to make our economy thrive,” Johnston said. “H-1B is a long-established tool for businesses to meet their workforce needs, whether it’s world-class physicists and engineers for our cutting-edge tech industries; doctors and dentists to meet our urgent health care needs; or K-12 teachers in rural districts facing severe recruitment challenges.”

The facility in Pennsylvania is 189 miles from the courthouse.In the Maryland case, Abrego Garcia is challenging his removal from the U.S. and asking to remain in the country while he pursues his asylum case. Wrongful removal sparked conflict between branchesAbrego Garcia, who was mistakenly removed to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, has become a flashpoint between the judicial branch and the administration as President Donald Trump pursues an immigration crackdown. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered that the administration must facilitate  Abrego Garcia’s return, and immigration officials brought him back to the U.S. to face criminal charges lodged against him in June.Shortly after his return, the Trump administration tried to remove him to a third country to comply with removal protections from his home country of El Salvador. The administration has continued efforts to remove Abrego Garcia to Uganda and Eswatini, though Costa Rica has also agreed to accept him as a refugee. The Tennessee criminal charges stem from a traffic stop in 2022 that included Abrego Garcia and several people. No charges were filed at the time.The Department of Justice has alleged that Abrego Garcia took part in a long-running conspiracy to smuggle immigrants without legal status across the United States for money. He’s pleaded not guilty to those charges. Asylum denied in 2019Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. without legal authorization in 2011 when he was 16. He applied for asylum in 2019, but because he did not apply for asylum within his first year in the U.S. – the legal deadline for such claims – authorities denied the application. Instead, an immigration judge granted him deportation protections, known as a withholding of removal, because the judge found it likely that Abrego Garcia would face gang violence if he were returned to El Salvador. Federal immigration officials at the time didn’t object to the judge’s withholding of removal order and didn’t find a third country to deport Abrego Garcia.Earlier this year, Abrego Garcia was picking his son up when immigration officials detained him and said his status changed. Days later, he was deported along with hundreds of men to the mega-prison in El Salvador where he later said he experienced psychological and physical torture.",,,,2025-09-29 15:58:08.950237

And Julia’s VSAC Outreach Counselor, Monda Kelley, saw something different.
“She pushed me,” Julia says. “I tried to push her away, and she came back. She reminded me of who I used to be, this kid who loved being outside and in the trees, and who loved nature. Monda showed me that I could turn that love into a career and she showed me how to do it. Without her, honestly I don’t know if I would have gone to college.”
Finding her path
Family life has long been challenging for Julia. Julia’s older sibling faced substance use issues and money was often tight. In 2019, her father passed away from cancer, and her stepfather died in a motorcycle accident a few years later. But her parents always encouraged education, wanting Julia to succeed and have a rewarding career. Her mother, who works part-time from home, has always been a steady presence, encouraging Julia to figure things out and supporting her goals. 
When Julia began meeting with her VSAC Outreach Counselor, Monda, regularly, she grew to appreciate what VSAC’s Talent Search program could offer. “Monda told me I was smart and that she was going to help me,” she recalls. “We went on campus tours, worked on paperwork, and applied for scholarships together. I still remember taking the coach bus around to tour colleges with Monda and others from VSAC.”
Julia initially enrolled at Green Mountain College, where she was drawn to its forestry and ornithology programs, and its proximity to home. After the college closed, she transferred to nearby Castleton to finish her degree. 
The ‘Compost Queen’
At both colleges she attended, Julia immersed herself in hands-on learning and sustainability work. At Green Mountain, she worked in the campus office of sustainability, where one of her jobs was to bike around campus with a trailer to collect recycling and to monitor compost bins in the dining hall. “People used to call me the ‘Compost Queen,’” she says. Her mentor, a junior and the student manager in the Sustainability Office dubbed “Compost Carl,” showed her what environmental stewardship could look like. “I wanted to be just like him.”
At Castleton, she completed a class in student support networks that trained her to help people through tough conversations and crises—skills that now help her both professionally and personally.
From there, she started at the Eastwood Animal Clinic in Rutland as part of a required internship. She worked as a veterinary technician during her internship and later returned in a different role.
“Some of it was really hard,” she says. “Holding an animal’s life in your hands—it’s a lot. But I loved being around animals, and I still work there now as a receptionist and maintenance helper.”
She’s also stayed involved with conservation work. Every Thursday, Julia works on the trails at lands managed by Audubon. “I really love being there,” she says. “Getting to share the outdoors with kids and families—it reminds me of how I started.”
Music, another lifelong love
In addition to her environmental interests, music has been a constant in Julia’s life. “I’ve always played the saxophone,” she says. In middle school, she participated in music festivals and concerts and in high school at Otter Valley, she played in the band and jazz band, a highlight of which was performing at the Berklee Music Festival. During her junior and senior years, she attended Stafford Technical Center, where she studied music and joined the school’s touring “Road Show.”
In college, she continued with band and jazz band. “It got tough during COVID,” she says. “Trying to manage group dynamics in a virtual band practice—but I stuck with it.” She still plays today and plans to continue to incorporate music into her life.
“Stay curious and stay open”
Julia says that for students who don’t see a path forward, the first step is just staying open to possibilities. “Even if you don’t know what you want to do, find someone to help you figure it out. Try things. Ask questions. There’s more to life than what’s in front of you right now.”
She’s also a believer in staying connected to your roots. “The jobs I’ve had, the people I’ve met—I wouldn’t have found those if I’d gone to a different school,” she says. 
“VSAC helped me open that door,” she says. “They saw through me when I couldn’t see anything for myself. I’m really, really glad they did. And, Monda’s been my reference on every job I’ve had. Even when I didn’t want to listen to her, she kept nudging me forward.”
Now, with those experiences behind her and a strong support network still in place, Julia is looking ahead. Her dream job? Working with Vermonters to design gardens, lawns, and landscapes that support pollinators and wildlife, perhaps even with a focus on forestry and conservation.

The North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP has reelected Deborah Dicks Maxwell president. The term will be the third for Maxwell who in 2021 became the first woman to hold the office.
The State Conference announced the election results Sunday. Delegates from across the state cast ballots Saturday, the day the organization held its annual convention in Durham.
“I am deeply humbled by the confidence you have once again placed in me,” Maxwell said in a statement. “I hope to make you proud as we continue the fight to protect democracy, defend civil rights, and uplift our communities.”
Da’Quan Love, executive director of the state conference, said the nation is at a critical moment in its history. Strong leadership at state conferences across the country is needed to protect citizens against what he said are abuses of power by the Trump administration.
“We are at a time in history in which the president of the United States is attempting to wield unprecedented levels of executive authority to apply undue pressure to state legislatures, governors and other duly elected officials,” Love told NC Newsline.
Love noted that the 2026 midterm elections are approaching, and that the U.S. Senate race between former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, and former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley, will be an important one for the country.  That race could potentially flip control of the Senate in favor of Democrats.   
Love said Cooper and Whatley were invited to the State Conference convention but only Cooper attended.
Here’s a list of the other State Conference officers elected Saturday:

Corine Mack was elected 1st Vice President.
Antonio Blow was elected 2nd Vice President.
Mary Degree was elected 3rd Vice President.

,DC,2025-09-29 18:52:06+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Hundreds of thousands of federal employees face furloughs under Trump shutdown plans,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/hundreds-thousands-federal-employees-face-furloughs-under-trump-shutdown-plans,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration began posting plans over the weekend that detail how hundreds of thousands of federal workers will be furloughed during a government shutdown, while others will keep working without being paid. The updated guidance gives the clearest picture yet into how President Donald Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought hope to reduce the size and scope of government when given increased authority over the federal workforce during a funding lapse. A shutdown will begin Wednesday unless Republicans and Democrats in Congress reach agreement on a stopgap spending bill. Congressional leaders were set to meet Monday afternoon with Trump, but it was unclear if any agreement would result that would avert a shutdown.The Defense Department’s plan shows it would keep about 406,500 of its 741,500 civilian employees working without pay during the shutdown, with the remaining going on furlough. The nearly 2.1 million military personnel housed within the department would continue to work throughout a shutdown but would not be paid until after it ends. The plan says the Defense Department believes operations to secure the U.S. southern border, Middle East operations, Golden Dome for America defense system, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions are the “highest priorities” in the event of a shutdown. Medical and dental services, including private sector care under the TRICARE health care program, would largely continue at the Defense Department, though “(e)lective surgery and other routine/elective procedures in DoW medical and dental facilities are generally not excepted activities, unless the deferral or delay of such procedures would impact personnel readiness or deployability.”Thousands of workers to be sent home from HHSThe Health and Human Services Department plans to furlough about 32,500 of its nearly 80,000 employees during a shutdown. The various components of HHS — including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of Health — have individual plans for a shutdown. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services plans to retain 3,311, or 53%, of its employees during a shutdown and “will maintain the staff necessary to make payments to eligible states for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).”The CDC plans to have 4,891, or 35.88%, of its employees as well as those at the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry keep working. The contingency plans says that “(r)esponses to urgent disease outbreaks and continuing efforts to support the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA), and the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program” would continue during a shutdown. The CDC would not be able to undertake several other activities, including providing “guidance to state and local health departments implementing programs to protect the public's health (e.g., opioid overdose prevention, HIV prevention, diabetes prevention).”Departments with plansHere is a list of the departments that have posted updated contingency plans in September:Defense Department contingency planEducation Department contingency planHealth and Human Services contingency planHomeland Security Department contingency planLabor Department contingency planJustice Department contingency planState Department contingency planSocial Security Administration contingency planHere is a list of the departments that hadn’t posted updated contingency plans as of Monday afternoon:Agriculture Department contingency planCommerce Department contingency planEnergy Department contingency planHousing and Urban Development contingency planInterior Department contingency planTransportation Department contingency planTreasury Department contingency planVeterans Affairs Department contingency planStates Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau reached out to the  departments that didn’t have contingency plans posted to ask when those might become public.A spokesperson for the USDA wrote in an email the department “is prepared for all contingencies regarding Department operations, including critical services and supports.” A State Department spokesperson said leadership “is undergoing all necessary planning efforts to sustain critical missions.”Federal employees who work  without pay will be paid after the shutdown concludes. According to the Office of Personnel Management — the executive branch’s chief human resources agency — “after the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.” The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 requires furloughed government employees to receive back pay as a result of a government shutdown. That law does not apply to federal contractors, who face uncertainty in getting paid during a shutdown. Ashley Murray, Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda and Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-09-29 14:56:56.014178

Upstairs, groups of teens got to learn about topics such as starting a business and working at nonprofit organizations. Downstairs, one group of students browsed tables, talking to representatives from local colleges, nonprofits, and more. One table passed out free candy-colored popcorn.
Christopher Steverson, a senior at Jackson’s Callaway High School, was among the many students in attendance.

“I love making money,” Steverson said. “Money’s always there, you just have to find a way to get it.”
Steverson, 18, runs a lawn care business with his father, and is working on his own streetwear line and has two properties from his father.
He’s one of about 200 high school students from the Jackson metro area who attended workshops and received hands-on experience on college and career readiness, financial literacy and business skills Wednesday at the Entrepreneurship and Employability Skills Symposium. 
United Way of the Capital Area and Jackson State University TRIO Talent Search partnered to put on the event. Tiffany Anderson, the United Way affiliate’s economic mobility coordinator, said young people are working in the gig economy.
“They’re doing braids. They are doing makeup. They are influencers. They’re Ubering,” Anderson said. “They’re doing all the things, so we just want to set them up for success and to do things the right way.”

Steverson attended to network and explore his interests. He learned about improving his credit score and investing in an individual retirement account. He hoped his peers at the event learned new ways to make money.
“I feel like with money, I have the opportunity to change things that not too many people will be able to without,” Steverson said.
At lunch, students listened to a speech from Nick, Khaliq and Kareem Brown from Boss Brothers Universe, a Jackson-based company that publishes books and online videos teaching children about financial literacy and entrepreneurship.

Kymora Dorsey, who attended last year, was excited to volunteer this year as a youth ambassador for United Way. Dorsey, 17, is a senior at Callaway High School.
“I realized that it was a great idea for people to understand what it means to have a business and get an understanding of financial literacy as well as the opportunity to earn $200 as a reward for their ideas,” Dorsey said.
To cap off the day, teams of students competed in a “Shark Tank”-style competition for cash prizes. Each team was coached by a local business owner. This year, two teams won, and each participant earned $250. The students could choose whether to start a bank account with the money or invest it in their business.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The final credits were set to roll at the Providence Place Mall’s Showcase Cinemas by Jan. 31. But the court-appointed receiver for the mall wants to end the show early.
The move was prompted by National Amusements — Showcase’ parent company — opting not to renew its existing lease for Providence Place Mall Cinemas 16 after the Jan. 31, 2026 expiration, Mark Russo, the court receiver, wrote in a Sept. 19 motion in Providence County Superior Court, first reported by Providence Business News.
Rather than wait out the final months under the existing operator, Russo has asked Superior Court Judge Brian Stern for permission to break the lease with National Amusements and find a new company to run the 16-screen movie theater.
A hearing on the proposal is scheduled for 3 p.m. Friday in Providence County Superior Court.
The proposed swap comes as part of the nearly yearlong efforts to shore up and revitalize the downtown shopping center, which has struggled to retain its luster amid changing shopping habits and loss of flagship stores, some of which were never replaced. In October 2024, the property was placed into court-appointed receivership after a group of private lenders alleged they were owed $259 million from a 2011 mortgage loan taken out by the property owner, Brookfield Properties.
Russo and his former law practice partner John Dorsey — now a federal bankruptcy judge who has since been removed from the receivership case — were brought in by the court to manage the transition. Over the last 11 months, the pair of West Warwick attorneys brought in a new management company, added security and began investments to repair aging infrastructure. 
In July, they secured Stern’s permission to advertise the mall for sale to new owners, with plans for a listing to hit the market in September. 
As of Monday, the property had not yet been publicly listed online by Jones Lang LaSalle, the Chicago firm hired to serve as the broker. 
Russo in an email Monday dismissed concerns that losing Showcase could hurt a future sale, or other revitalization efforts.
“I’m not concerned at this point,” Russo said. “I feel good about the likelihood of the cinema space continuing to be an entertainment and movie venue for our patrons.”
He did not respond to follow up questions regarding other tenants’ leases and the pending sale listing.
Russo’s court motion seeks to retain the equipment and furniture in the top floor movie theater, giving National Amusements first rights in court to be reimbursed for the fair market value.
National Amusements and Showcase did not respond to inquiries for comment Monday. The Massachusetts-based media company has run the movie theater in downtown Providence since 2003, buying the adjacent IMAX Theatre in 2008. 
The 128,000-square-foot cinema paid 9.8% of the mall’s annual rent as of January 2024 — the second largest contributor after Boscov’s — according to a June 2024 report by ratings agency KBRA. In the same report, issued five months before the receivership, KBRA downgraded all six classes of its ratings for the mall’s commercial mortgage-backed security because of the heightened credit risk posed by the past due mortgage loan. 
The 1.4-million-square-foot shopping center opened in 1999 after a series of delays and changes to financing and development terms. The final funding package for the $460 million project featured a state bond and a tax treaty with the city of Providence. The state deal used mall sales tax revenue to repay the debt on the bond that paid for construction. The state made its final $73 million payment on the bond in 2019.
The 30-year tax treaty with the city of Providence is set to end in 2028. Under the current agreement, the mall pays $500,000 a year in city property taxes. If taxed at fiscal 2025 city commercial rates, the property would be paying nearly $24.9 million in taxes based on its 2024 city tax-assessed value of $708.7 million.
The pandemic has been widely blamed for the demise of malls nationwide. But in Providence, many consider the 2019 departure of founding anchor Nordstrom as the beginning of the mall’s decline. As of May 2021, the mall and attached parking garage were valued $240 million — less than half the $558 appraisal when the mortgage loan was secured in 2011. 
Meanwhile, movie theaters have struggled to find an audience in the post-pandemic era, with three-quarters of adults opting to watch new movies via streaming services rather than in a theater, according to a Sept. 25 survey from the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Those surveyed cited convenience and cost as reasons why they opted to stream from home rather than head to a theater. 
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.

Emanuel Cleaver, D-Kansas City, testified Sept. 11 against a redistricting plan that would gerrymander his district in favor of Republicans (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe on Sunday signed the new Missouri congressional district map intended to bring Republicans another seat, and opponents responded with a new lawsuit challenging the plan.
Lawmakers, acting at the insistence of President Donald Trump, finished a special session on Sept. 12 by passing a bill targeting the 5th District in Kansas City and placing a constitutional amendment on the 2026 ballot to make it more difficult to pass constitutional proposals by initiative petition.
The new lawsuit, like others filed previously, contends that no authority exists in the Missouri Constitution allowing lawmakers to revise congressional districts in the absence of new census data. The new case also argues that the districts are not legal because they stretch for hundreds of miles across the state.
Effort to force vote on gerrymandered Missouri congressional map hits roadblock

The law will take effect Dec. 11, in time for candidate filing in the 2026 elections, unless blocked by the courts or a referendum petition. 
To bring enough voters into the 5th District, which currently includes portions of only Jackson and Clay counties, the drafters destroyed the idea that districts should be as compact as possible, the new lawsuit filed in Jackson County contends.
U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat, has represented the 5th District since 2005.
Kehoe, who has said the courts will decide if what lawmakers did was legal, said in a news release that he signed the bill to make the state’s districts align with voter views overall.
“We believe this map best represents Missourians, and I appreciate the support and efforts of state legislators, our congressional delegation, and President Trump in getting this map to my desk,” Kehoe said.
Opponents have argued that the new map disenfranchises a large portion of Missouri voters. Democrats currently hold two of the state’s eight districts, or 25%, while statewide elections show about 40% of voters support Democratic candidates.
Filed by the National Redistricting Foundation, the legal arm of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the lawsuit enlists voters from around the state as plaintiffs, raising objections to changes in other districts as well the lines in the Kansas CIty area.
“Missouri’s mid-decade gerrymander is in clear violation of the state constitution,” Marina Jenkins, executive director of the foundation, said in a news release. “It was not prompted by the law or a court order; it was the result of Republican lawmakers in Missouri following partisan directives from politicians in Washington, D.C.”
The constitutional standards for redistricting include districts that are compact, contiguous, as equal as possible in population and do not split communities of interest.
“Every redistricting plan since the 1950s has placed as much of the Jackson County portion of Kansas City as possible in a single district, and more recently, also brought in a substantial portion of the Clay County parts of Kansas City as well,” the lawsuit states. “In fact, the Jackson County portion of Kansas City has not been split in more than 50 years.”
Under the new map, the lawsuit states, Kansas City’s central business district is in three separate districts. The new 4th District stretches from downtown Kansas City to Fort Leonard Wood in Pulaski County, 200 miles away.
Eastern portions of the city that remain in the 5th District are now in a district with Rolla, in southeast Missouri, also 200 miles away, while the remaining downtown portions are part of the 6th District, which runs across northeast Missouri to the Mississippi River.
“The configuration of congressional districts in the Kansas City area under (the redistricting bill) violates the mandatory compactness requirement on nearly every level,” the lawsuit contends.
The National Redistricting Foundation lawsuit is the fourth filed since Kehoe announced plans for the special session.
Judge hears arguments in case seeking to toss Missouri’s new congressional maps

The first was filed by the NAACP of Missouri, which contends that Kehoe did not have authority to call lawmakers into session for redistricting or to change initiative majority requirements. That case is in the hands of Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh, who heard arguments Sept. 15.
The other lawsuits are in their early procedural stages.
One, filed Sept. 12 in Jackson County makes similar arguments to the new case about the compactness of the new districts, while also questioning whether the bill mistakenly places the same precinct in two different districts.
Another, filed Sept. 12 in Cole County, is based on an argument common to all four cases — that the state constitution doesn’t allow mid-cycle redistricting. 
Only once since the current constitution was written have lawmakers altered congressional districts between censuses, and that was in the 1960s when a U.S. Supreme Court decision forced a national reexamination of districts to balance populations.
The redistricting provision of the constitution says that after receiving census data, lawmakers “shall by law divide the state into districts corresponding with the number of representatives to which it is entitled…”
The section is silent on the power to do it at any other time and that, the new lawsuit contends, means it is prohibited.
“The General Assembly ignored the state constitution’s procedural limitation authorizing congressional redistricting to take place only when new decennial census results are certified to the governor,” the lawsuit states.

(Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court sided Friday with a woman who lost a job offer when she refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine, rejecting the employer’s arguments that federal law supersedes a state law restriction on questioning the sincerity of religious beliefs.
Katlin Keeran, an occupational therapist who lived in Johnson County, initially cited concerns about the use of fetal cells in the development of COVID-19 vaccines. But under questioning by Powerback Rehabilitation, she said she had previously gotten the flu vaccine but didn’t want to get the COVID-19 vaccine because “I am not familiar with it.” The company rescinded its employment offer.
Keeran filed a complaint with the Kansas Department of Labor, saying the company violated a law passed by the Legislature during a 2021 special session that allowed individuals to opt out of a federal vaccine mandate and made it illegal for employers to question the sincerity of religious beliefs.
Because Powerback receives Medicare and Medicaid funding, it was subject to the vaccine mandate as a condition for receiving those dollars. Federal law empowers employers to question the sincerity of a religious belief.
Powerback argued it was impossible to comply with both federal and state laws, and that federal law should prevail.
Justice Caleb Stegall, who was appointed by Gov. Sam Brownback, wrote the opinion for a 4-2 majority. He said the company’s argument was “simple and alluring at first blush” but “incorporates a deft sleight-of-hand.”
Federal law allows, but doesn’t require, an inquiry, Stegall wrote, and the state has an interest in preserving religious liberty.
“Prohibiting an inquiry by an employer into the sincerity of a religious belief is clearly rationally related to protecting cherished liberty interests,” Stegall wrote.
The court reversed a Johnson County District Court ruling that found the state law unconstitutional.
Justice Melissa Standridge, who was appointed by Gov. Laura Kelly, wrote a dissent that was joined by Justice Eric Rosen, who was appointed  by Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.
Standridge wrote that Kansas law “stands as an obstacle” to federal objectives. An employer should be justified, she wrote, in seeking supporting information about an prospective employee’s religious accommodation.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4F5A1686-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

The FBI is also hoping to mine tips from the public as it continues its investigation into the incident in which authorities say the suspect, Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, also set the building ablaze before being shot and killed by law enforcement.
A total of 12 people were shot in the attack, police said, with five fatalities, including the alleged shooter.
It’s unclear exactly why Sanford chose the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the target for his attack.

On Monday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered all U.S. and Michigan flags on all public and state government buildings to be lowered to half-staff to honor the victims through Friday.
Whitmer, in a statement, said her heart is breaking for the community known commonly as the Mormon church.
“Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable,” Whitmer said. “I am grateful to the first responders who took action quickly. To honor those we have lost, I am ordering flags to be lowered across Michigan. Our state is in mourning alongside the victims, their families, and the entire community in Grand Blanc Township.”
Whitmer also spoke at press conference Monday afternoon in Grand Blanc Township.
“I know that this community is reeling right now, and I want you to know that the state of Michigan has your back. You’re grief is our grief,” Whitmer said. “There’s one thing I know about Michigan is that we get through hard things together, and that’s who we are.”

Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, a candidate for the governor’s office in 2026, said he was also devastated by the shooting.
“Such a horrific act of violence – towards anyone, anywhere – is unjustified,” Gilchrist said. “I’m grateful to the local police officers, fire, and EMS for their quick response. Let’s keep holding each other close.”
State Rep. David Martin (R-Davison), whose district covers Grand Blanc in Genesee County, called the incident a “cowardly attack” on the community.
“On a Sunday, in a sacred house of worship, families should feel nothing but peace and safety. That was stolen from them today in the most horrific and evil way,” Martin said. “My heart breaks for the victims, their families, and everyone in the community who has been shaken by this senseless violence.”
Martin also thanked what he said was a swift and “courageous” response from local law enforcement, as well as an officer from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, who responded in addition to emergency medical personnel.
State Sen. John Cherry (D-Flint), who represents a large portion of Genesee County, including Grand Blanc, said the incident was a tragic act of violence.
“To terrorize people in a place of worship, where their hopes are highest and their faith strongest, is particularly sickening and has rocked our entire community,” Cherry said in a statement. “The congregation, the people of Grand Blanc, and our Genesee County community as a whole will need to heal and rebuild emotionally and physically, and I hope we can all come together to support them and one another during these trying and terrifying times.”
U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) said she was praying for the Mormon community, the victims’ and their families, calling violence in a place of worship “despicable.”
U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) was quick to offer her support and prayers for the Grand Blanc and Mormon community, while also pushing the brake pedal on snap judgments regarding the shooter’s motives, which remain unknown.
“We will know more in the coming days and weeks. And there will be more to say,” Slotkin said in a statement. “But today, we send our strength to those involved who must now try and pick up the pieces and grieve.”
Little is known about Sanford and why he chose the Mormon church as a target for his attack. The FBI Detroit Field Office on late Sunday evening used social media to request any person with information that could assist the investigation to call its tip line or visit its online tip exchange.

UPDATE: Regarding the critical incident in Grand Blanc, Michigan, the FBI is asking that members of the public share any information that would assist in this investigation. We encourage them to please report that to 1-800-CALL-FBI or https://t.co/1WDK57FdRt. pic.twitter.com/Fw3wOUZb3I

What is known is that Sanford was a Burton resident who fought in the Iraq War, and the license plate of his truck, which officials say he used to ram into the building before opening fire on congregants, indicated that he was a veteran of the Iraq War.
Bridge Michigan reported that Google Maps images of Sanford’s home address in Burton, captured in June of this year, show that he had a campaign sign for President Donald Trump affixed to a fence surrounding the small brick house. Bridge also reported that records show Sanford signed two recent ballot proposal petitions.
The first was for the Unlock Michigan proposal that sought to repeal Michigan’s statutory allowance for sweeping gubernatorial powers during a state of emergency, which was wielded by Whitmer in the worst days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The other was supporting Right to Life Michigan’s attempt to keep the state’s abortion ban in place after the fall of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade precedent that protected abortion rights and access to reproductive health care nationwide.
Other reports have noted that his son had a rare pancreatic disease.

(Hughes campaign photo)Missy Hughes, Wisconsin’s former top economic development official, announced her campaign for governor Monday, positioning herself as an effective non-politician with a strong economic track record.
Hughes served as Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC) CEO and secretary from Oct. 1, 2019, until this past Sept. 19. She becomes the seventh Democrat to join the field for the party’s nomination after Gov. Tony Evers announced in July that he will not seek a third term in 2026.
“Listen, I’m not a politician. I’m different than other folks you’ve seen run for governor. That’s the point,” Hughes says in her launch video released Monday morning.
An executive for 17 years at Organic Valley before Evers appointed her to lead the WEDC, Hughes says in the video that the cooperative, which markets organic dairy products sourced from more than 1,800 farms across the U.S., topped $1 billion in revenue during her tenure.
At the WEDC, Hughes headed Wisconsin’s negotiations with major employers expanding their operations or relocating to the state. During her tenure, “major companies like Milwaukee Tool, Microsoft, Eli Lilly, Kikkoman and more committed to invest over $10 billion and create 45,000 good-paying jobs across Wisconsin,” the Hughes campaign stated in a debut email.
Hughes also raised the department’s profile in small business and local community economic development. The WEDC oversaw many of the state’s COVID-19 relief programs, which focused heavily on small business recovery from the short but sharp economic hit brought on by the pandemic.
Among the highest profile efforts was the Main Street Bounceback, which directed $10,000 grants to more than 9,500 small businesses across Wisconsin.
The WEDC is also the lead state agency involved in Wisconsin’s successful application for federal support to establish a technology hub centered on the state’s biohealth sector.
Hughes’ launch video pitches her campaign as focused on the economy but also nods to issues of personal freedom that have been part of Democrats’ messaging ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
“As governor, I’ll create a Main Street economy that includes you, and works for you,” Hughes says in the video. “Where we strengthen our Main Streets, make sure Wisconsinites have higher wages and housing they can afford, our families have child care and health care that doesn’t break the bank, and our public schools prepare our kids for the future.”
Over shots of the White House and then a gleaming urban office tower, she adds, “I’m not going to go looking for a fight, but I’ll stand up to anyone, from the White House to Wall Street, who comes after your rights or tries to make your life harder.”
Hughes is the second Democrat with an Evers administration background to seek the party’s nomination in the August 2026 primary. Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez was the first to enter the race, declaring her candidacy less than 24 hours after Evers announced he was not running.
Other declared hopefuls are Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison). Milwaukee factory worker and baseball stadium beer vendor Ryan Strnad and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey are also seeking the nomination.

A Mississippi infant recently died from pertussis, or whooping cough, the State Department of Health announced Monday. 
It is the first whooping cough death reported in Mississippi since 2012 and the third since 2008. 
Whooping cough cases in Mississippi are the highest they have been in at least a decade.
The infant was not eligible to be vaccinated against the disease due to his or her age, the agency said in a statement. 
State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney has repeatedly said that vaccines are the best defense against diseases like pertussis.
Because infants are not eligible for the pertussis vaccination until they are two months old, the health department recommends that pregnant women, grandparents and family or friends who may come in close contact with an infant get booster shots to ensure they do not pass the illness to children.
This year, 115 pertussis cases have been reported to the health department, compared to 49 total last year. 
Over 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported across the U.S. this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The highly contagious respiratory illness is named for the “whooping” sound people make when gasping for air after a coughing fit. It may begin like a common cold but can last for weeks or months and make it difficult to breathe. Babies younger than 1 year are at greatest risk for getting whooping cough, and can have severe complications that often require hospitalization. 
Mississippi for many years had the highest child vaccination rates in the nation. But rates have fallen since 2023, when a federal judge ruled that parents can opt out of vaccinating their children for school with a religious exemption.  
The pertussis vaccination is administered in a five-dose series for children under 7 and booster doses for older children and adults. 
Immunity from pertussis vaccination wanes over time, and there is not a routine recommendation for boosters. 
The Mississippi Health Department offers vaccinations to children and uninsured or underinsured adults at county health departments.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/01135248/3X0A5127.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

From left: Commissioners Kim Lowe of Kearney, Bruce Bailey of Lincoln (chair) and J. Michael Coffey of Omaha. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The last two members of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission who served with a former director who faces federal charges alleging public corruption are resigning at the governor’s request.
Liquor Commissioner Bruce Bailey of Lincoln, who served as commission chair, confirmed to the Nebraska Examiner on Monday that Gov. Jim Pillen had personally asked for his resignation as well as that of Commissioner Kim Lowe of Kearney. Neither commissioner is implicated in the federal indictment.
Bailey said Pillen personally called Thursday. Bailey submitted his resignation Monday morning and said Lowe was on her way in to resign at the time of the call. The Governor’s Office confirmed both resignations had been received.
“They’re moving on,” Bailey said.
Pillen’s office will accept applications to succeed Bailey and Lowe on the governor-appointed board by 5 p.m. on Oct. 17. Applicants must reside in either the 1st or 3rd Congressional Districts for the seats, respectively, and can apply online at https://governor.nebraska.gov/boards-commissions-open-positions or mail applications to the Governor’s Office.
“I appreciate the willingness of Bruce and Kim to serve, and I thank them for the time they have been on the commission,” Pillen said in a statement.
Pillen’s latest calls for resignations from the board came Thursday, Bailey said, a day after federal charges were unsealed against former Liquor Commission Executive Director Hobert “Hobie” Rupe. Rupe has pleaded not guilty to seven federal charges.
The calls also came the same day Pillen rejected all proposed rule changes by the commission that were still pending, including one the governor said would “effectively provide government permission for customers to touch the dancers at a strip club,” which he said was “particularly troubling” in light of Rupe’s indictment. 
Ex-Nebraska Liquor Commission director charged with taking cash, sexual favors in strip club probe

Federal prosecutors, who worked alongside the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office that had employed Rupe decades ago, allege Rupe solicited cash, lap dances, sexual favors and free drinks from two Lincoln strip clubs while also turning a “blind eye” to liquor license violations that Rupe should have reported. Rupe also allegedly used his position to investigate and target competitor venues.
Bailey and Lowe voted 2-0 in May to suspend Rupe, without pay, pending the investigation. Rupe resigned the following month, ending his service that began January 2004, ending his service that began January 2004.
Like Rupe, Brent Zywiec, a partial owner of The Office Gentleman’s Club and The Night Before Lounge who also is named in the federal indictment, has pleaded not guilty.
The other Liquor Commission member is retired Judge J. Michael Coffey, whom Pillen appointed in June. Coffey succeeded Harry Hoch. Jr., who had served on the commission since 2019. Hoch had 40 years of industry knowledge in liquor and told the Examiner his resignation came as Pillen sought “more cannabis experience” on the board.
Medical cannabis impacts
One reason: Voters in November approved creating the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission and placed the three members of the Liquor Control Commission on it, along with up to two at-large appointments.
Bailey said he felt Pillen also sought his resignation due to his more permissive view of medical cannabis in light of voters’ wishes. He said some in the executive branch viewed him as a “roadblock.” 
At recent meetings, Bailey had been vocal when he felt the commission was being too restrictive, mainly at the lead of Pillen’s at-large appointees, who prefer a stricter system. Among those positions, Bailey had called to allow smoking or vaping medical cannabis and to increase the number of cultivator licenses to boost the supply chain.

Michael Coffey of Omaha. At right is Bo Botelho, general counsel for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services contracted to work with the commission. Sept. 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Members of the public attending the meetings had also praised Bailey for meeting with them one-on-one and raising their concerns.
The Medical Cannabis Commission was set to meet Tuesday but appears unlikely to approve any cultivator licenses ahead of a voter-set Oct. 1 deadline to begin issuing the first licenses. Dr. Monica Oldenburg, commission chair, had been designated to review and evaluate any applications received by last Tuesday, alongside Lowe and Bailey.
The Liquor Control Commission had been set to meet on Wednesday but will no longer meet due to a lack of members. Bailey said the commission has a “great staff” in its stead. Lowe described the staff as “rock stars.”
Oldenburg did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment.
The resignations mean that, once replaced, Pillen will have appointed all three members to oversee liquor and the two others to oversee medical cannabis. Members serve staggered six-year terms.
Pillen has said the new appointments will follow his example with Coffey, whom he said “Nebraskans can trust to restore strong leadership and governance to this troubled independent agency.” Pillen’s office has said he has no intention of retooling and moving the agency under the governor’s direct control.
Reflecting on commission service
In Bailey’s 11 years on the Liquor Commission, he reflected on the group’s work to implement new software for license holders and to create a new education program for bartenders and others that is set to start soon and he said is “99% complete.”
“We’ve accomplished some good things,” Bailey said.
Bailey’s service also coincided with the 2017 vote to end liquor licenses in Whiteclay, Nebraska, establishments that were criticized for years of having contributed to alcohol-related problems on the adjacent Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where alcohol possession and sales were legally prohibited.

Lowe, who joined the Liquor Commission in 2021, said serving on the board was a great opportunity. She also highlighted the move to a new software system and said she was “very proud” of what had been accomplished in her tenure.
On the Rupe situation, Bailey said he is still surprised by the allegations, reeling and second-guessing himself and wondering, “Should I have seen something?”
“The governor said we should have known. I don’t know how we could have. We certainly don’t keep track what people do in their off time,” Bailey said.
Bailey said he partly wishes he had known and had an opportunity to intervene and at least say, “Hey, dumb s—, don’t do it.”
“I liked him a lot as a friend,” Bailey said of Rupe, “and I’m sorry that he just simply went off the deep end.”
Lowe said she had no knowledge of what Rupe is accused of doing. Hoch did not immediately return a call seeking comment Monday.
Asked her thoughts on the Liquor Commission moving forward, Lowe said: “I just hope the best for this organization.”

But while we celebrate, it’s important to remember that the biggest threats to Nevada’s public lands aren’t behind us. They’re moving through Congress right now, and if passed, they could forever reshape our landscapes.
Two pieces of legislation in particular deserve Nevadans’ attention: the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act (SNEDCA), which was scheduled to be heard in Congress on October 1 but has since been postponed, and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, which is advancing rapidly on Capitol Hill, having just passed out of House Natural Resources on September 17. Together, these bills would sell off and industrialize Nevada’s public lands on a scale we haven’t seen in years.
SNEDCA is being promoted as a balanced bill that conserves lands while allowing for development. Supporters point to provisions that designate certain areas as protected. But Nevadans should look closely. At its core, this bill is a sweeping public lands sell-off.
SNEDCA would open tens of thousands of acres in Clark County for disposal, turning our desert into a land bank for real estate developers. SNEDCA doubles down on a sprawl approach to development at a time when we desperately need smarter planning, water conservation, and genuine climate resilience. We know that sprawl raises costs for working class folks, both directly and indirectly, and detracts from mass transportation services. This bill fails to guarantee any of the land proposed for disposal would actually be used for affordable housing.
The consequences are not abstract. Development on this scale fragments wildlife habitat, threatens desert tortoise populations, and paves over landscapes that recharge groundwater and absorb carbon. Once developed, these lands cannot be restored. We lose them forever.
This is exactly the type of land sell-off Nevadans pushed back against during the federal reconciliation process, when proposals to liquidate Nevada’s deserts raised alarm bells statewide, and indeed, across the country.
At the same time, another bill moving through Congress threatens Nevada’s lands in a different way. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would fundamentally change how mining companies are allowed to operate on public lands.
Under current law, mining companies must demonstrate a valid mineral discovery before they can use federal land for waste dumps or processing. This safeguard ensures that sensitive lands are not simply commandeered for industrial use without scrutiny. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would gut that requirement, allowing companies to dump toxic mine waste on public lands without ever proving that valuable minerals exist.
For Nevada, home to more mining activity than any other state, the impact would be staggering. The result would be more toxic pollution on public land, more scarred landscapes, and less accountability for corporations.
Taken together, SNEDCA and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act represent a one-two punch: one bill sells off Nevada’s lands to developers, while the other makes it easier for mining companies to pollute what’s left. Both bills prioritize corporate profits over community well-being, over Tribal sovereignty, and over the conservation values Nevadans have fought to uphold for decades.
We know what happens when we fail to protect public lands. Red Rock Canyon, Avi Kwa Ame, and Gold Butte did not gain protections by accident. They were defended through years of community organizing, advocacy, and public outcry. Tribes, conservationists, recreationists, and everyday residents came together to demand that these landscapes be safeguarded for future generations. If Congress approves SNEDCA or the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, we risk unraveling decades of progress in a matter of months.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Nevada can pursue genuine conservation and responsible economic development without selling out our public lands. We should be expanding access to parks and trails, supporting Tribal stewardship of ancestral lands, and protecting biodiversity in the face of climate change. We should not be doubling down on extractive and short-sighted policies.
The choice before us is clear. We can allow corporations and their lobbyists to dictate the future of Nevada’s open spaces, or we can stand up for the values that make our state unique.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uscapitoljune302025ashleymurray-scaled-e1759166037351-1024x612.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

General Manager Rich Benton said Sikorsky will get years' worth of work.,"Stratford-based Sikorsky has won a $10 billion contract to build helicopters for the U.S. Marine Corps.
The recently-renamed U.S. Department of War announced the contract late Friday afternoon.
The contract calls for the company to make almost a hundred CH-53K transport helicopters.
Sikorsky General Manager Rich Benton said the company will get years’ worth of work.
“We’re gonna be building 53K’s at least from now to 2033,” Benton said. “So pretty big deal for workforce, here, pretty big deal for Sikorsky, but also a pretty big deal for Connecticut. We invested heavily in the Connecticut supply chain.”
Many other companies that make parts and supplies for Sikorsky also employ Connecticut residents.
“It really is a foundational element, when we think about the number of aircraft we’re gonna build, the hours that go into this aircraft, and the number of jobs,” Benton said. “It’s really gonna lay the foundation for the entire Sikorsky enterprise, really for the next five to 10 years.”
Sikorsky is a major employer in Connecticut, with more than 7,000 workers in the state. It has locations in Bridgeport, Stratford, Trumbull and Shelton. An additional 3,000 Sikorsky employees work outside the state.
The CH-53K helicopters are used to move troops and supplies.

The rollout comes more than a month after Virginia’s colleges and universities, as well as others around the country, opened for the 2026-2027 school year. The launch also follows a lengthy overhaul, which the agency said will “simplify” and “modernize” the application process. The department has also made changes to the formulas used to determine aid eligibility.
The deadline to publish the revamped FAFSA form was set for October 1 by Congress and then-President Joe Biden.
Virginia braces for changes to student aid programs

The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the coordinating body for the state’s colleges and universities, stated it has already begun promoting it to students and their families.
“We’re happy about the release of FAFSA and that things are going smoothly so far,” said Erin McGrath, SCHEV Associate Director of college access and PK12 Outreach, in a statement to The Mercury.
Virginia Community Colleges, which represents 23 colleges in the commonwealth, added that it is “pleased” about the release. The delay with the application process created uncertainty for  Virginia’s higher education institutions.
“After a few challenging years, the VCCS is pleased about the early release of the FAFSA for Aid Year 2026-2027,” said Laurie Owens, director of financial aid for VCCS. “We look forward to a more streamlined process for our students and families through the simplified contributor invite process as well as the real-time identity verification process. Financial aid will never be simple, but enhancements such as these will certainly help.” 
On Aug. 27, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon certified to Congress that the 2026–27 FAFSA form would launch “on time” in the fall after a “successful” beta test with education leaders, students and families took place in Florida in the same month.
The agency said 97% of respondents reported “satisfaction” with the form, and 90% said it took a “reasonable time” to complete it.
The number of 2026-2027 FAFSA applications has increased from 43,531 on Sept. 24 to 183,752 as of Sept. 25.
Out of a total of 183,752 applications, the agency reported that 53% had been submitted as of Sept. 25. A total of 31% had been processed, and 29% had been processed without rejection.
“I am extremely proud to announce the earliest launch of the FAFSA form in history, which ensures American students and families have access to critical resources as they begin or continue their postsecondary education journey,” McMahon said in a statement on Wednesday.

,DC,2025-09-29 17:00:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump asks US Supreme Court to take birthright citizenship case,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-take-birthright-citizenship-case,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has again petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court regarding birthright citizenship, this time on the merits of the administration’s effort to rewrite the constitutional right afforded to children born on U.S. soil. In two cases brought to the high court, lower courts kept in place a preliminary injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order that ended birthright citizenship. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer petitioned the court Friday to reverse those decisions. The high court case was docketed Monday. Responses from both parties are due by Oct. 29.Sauer is asking the justices to revisit the 14th amendment, arguing that it was meant to grant citizenship to newly freed Black people after the Civil War, not for the children of immigrants with temporary visas or in the country without legal authorization. “The mistaken view that birth on U.S. territory confers citizenship on anyone subject to the regulatory reach of U.S. law became pervasive, with destructive consequences,” Sauer wrote.Sauer did not ask the court to fast-track the petition, so if the justices decide to take up the case the earliest they would do so would be the summer of next year. One case is from Washington state on behalf of attorneys general in that state, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon. The other case is from New Hampshire, where a national of Honduras is due to give birth in October and fears her child will not be granted U.S. citizenship.Immigration policy stymiedSauer said the president’s executive order aimed to advance his immigration policy and that lower courts' decisions to block that agenda harms the U.S.“The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that American citizenship—the privilege that allows us to choose our political leaders—is granted only to those who are lawfully entitled to it. The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the President and his Administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” he wrote. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”The Trump administration in March brought the issue to the high court on an emergency basis, but did not ask the justices to determine the constitutionality of birthright citizenship. Instead, the administration asked the court to address the issue of nationwide injunctions from the lower courts. In June, the Supreme Court reined in nationwide injunctions by some lower courts that had blocked the executive order rewriting birthright citizenship.Executive order rewrote 14th AmendmentThe order Trump signed in January directs the federal government to not recognize or issue citizenship documentation to any child born after Feb. 19 to parents who are in the country without proper authorization, or if the parent is in the United States on a temporary visa and the other parent is a noncitizen or green card holder. Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the U.S. are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status, except for the children born to foreign diplomats. The administration interprets that phrase in the 14th Amendment that confers birthright citizenship to people “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” to exclude people in the U.S. without legal status or temporary legal status. Those people are subject to the laws of their home country, the administration argues.The Supreme Court has ruled on birthright citizenship many times, including a 1898 decision in which the justices upheld birthright citizenship in United States v. Wong Kim Ark.Ark was born in San Francisco to parents who were citizens of the Republic of China, but had visas giving them legal authority to be in the country. Ark’s citizenship was not recognized when he left the U.S. and he was denied reentry due to the Chinese Exclusion Act — a racist law designed to restrict and limit nearly all immigration of Chinese nationals.The high court ruled in Ark’s case that children born in the U.S. to parents who were not citizens automatically become citizens at birth.",,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-29 16:58:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Yale New Haven will pay $45M to end dispute with Prospect Medical over hospitals sale,Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/29/prospect-medical-holdings-yale-new-haven-health-435-million-deal-settlement/,The settlement ends a contentious saga over a 2022 deal in which Yale agreed to acquire now-bankrupt Prospect's 3 CT hospitals for $435M.,"Yale New Haven Health will pay Prospect Medical Holdings $45 million to settle dueling lawsuits in state court, ending a contentious saga over the proposed sale of Prospect’s three Connecticut hospitals — with Yale acquiring none of them.
The 50-page settlement agreement, filed in the bankruptcy court Friday, asks the judge to approve the settlement between Prospect and Yale by Oct. 10. 
In the filing, Thomas Califano, an attorney for Prospect, wrote “everybody’s pretty satisfied” with the outcome, although “I don’t think anybody’s happy with it.” 
Prospect signed a deal in 2022 to sell Waterbury Hospital, Manchester Hospital and Rockville General Hospital to Yale for $435 million. But that agreement hit snags and both parties sued each other. 
This January, Prospect Medical filed for bankruptcy. Less than a month after the bankruptcy filing, Yale announced it was pulling out of the deal completely stating the bankruptcy filing was “proof of their disinvestment and mismanagement.”
At an August hearing in the bankruptcy case, in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, the judge encouraged Prospect and Yale to settle their dispute through mediation. 
The two sides, along with Prospect’s landlord Medical Properties Trust, met for an in-person mediation session in mid-September with Judge Harlin D. Hale to work out the settlement.
“The settlement agreement is the result of good-faith negotiations among the debtors, MPT, and YNHH, during which the Committee was present and informed,” Califano wrote.
Yale New Haven Health spokeswoman Dana Marnane said Monday the “settlement will officially end all pending litigation between our Health System and Prospect allowing both parties to move forward and focus on the future.”
The two parties had been at odds since Yale sued to have the $435 million purchase price lowered after a cyberattack struck the three Prospect Hospitals two years ago, crippling some of their operations for months.
Yale officials said it would cost as much as $80 million for Yale to repair the damages to the hospital’s computer security systems because of the cyberattack. It also claimed Prospect had failed to pay some of its vendors for years and also owed the state of Connecticut at least $67 million in taxes.
Prospect then countersued, arguing Yale was trying to renege on the agreement and cited the stalled sale as part of the reason it needed to file for bankruptcy. Both lawsuits will be dismissed as part of the settlement agreement.
Meanwhile the fate of Prospect’s three Connecticut hospitals remains in bankruptcy court. Yale is no longer a player, but its main competitor Hartford HealthCare has stepped into the fray.
Hartford HealthCare has offered $86.1 million to purchase two of the three hospitals — Manchester Memorial and Rockville General.
ECHN Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, will serve as the “stalking horse bidder” for the two hospitals in the court-supervised sale auction, according to court documents. The “stalking horse” serves as the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid. 
Meanwhile, state officials are in high-level discussions regarding a deal in which the University of Connecticut Health Center would purchase the third Prospect facility, Waterbury Hospital, along with the independently owned Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals. Officials are considering a total for the deal that could reach nearly $400 million, sources said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DayKimball_Putnam_YK_file-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-29 13:58:27.649840

WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Shahrzad Rasekh to discuss her article, “This Ukrainian family fled war in Odesa and found a foothold in CT,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Shahrzad’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Shahrzad. How did you come across the Natsevych family, and why did you think their story would make such a compelling photo essay?
SR: Yeah, so I realized that Ukraine had just fallen out of the news cycle, and I was looking for local ways to be able to cover this issue, given that it still exists; we’re just not hearing about it as much. And so I wanted to find a personal angle that could tell the story that we know through numbers, but this time through a personal perspective, and kind of follow one family’s journey from Ukraine to Connecticut, and kind of see how the war is affecting people in Ukraine, but also what services they were able to benefit from, and what their experience was like as a Ukrainian family in Connecticut.
And so I connected with them through this one woman that my colleague Laura Tillman had met at a different event, who happened just to be Ukrainian, she works at Yale, and just by nature of being Ukrainian and being connected with the community, she happened to know this family and gave me their number, and I called her out of the blue, and she was gracious enough to be open about the idea, and we just clicked. And from there, it made it much easier to kind of follow them through this process of resettlement.
WSHU: Was the fact that she had these Instagram posts of what was happening in Odesa when the war came helpful to you?
SR: I actually didn’t know her Instagram or hadn’t seen her Instagram before reaching out to her. It did help that she had already been open about her experience. Some people don’t want to think about it or don’t want to process what they’ve experienced yet, but because she had a disposition to share this information, it made it easier to dig deeper and ask questions that might have been intrusive to some. She just wanted to be able to share this experience, and she just had fewer barriers than most people.
WSHU: Wow. Let’s discuss their experience a bit. What was the experience like?
SR: Sure. So Evgenia and her husband Vitalii were living in Odesa. They were from Ukraine. They’ve lived there their whole lives, and their whole families are there. That’s their home. And Odesa happens to be right on the Black Sea, relatively close to Crimea. It’s the largest city that’s that close to Crimea.
WSHU: It also has the largest port for Ukraine right now, correct?
SR: Correct. And so, I mean, since 2014, when Crimea was annexed, it was kind of in this fragile position geographically. And Evgenia and her husband’s home happened to be near a military outpost that they worried would be a target. On February 24, when they first saw these missiles flying overhead, they decided, in that instant, to try to go somewhere safer. It was kind of a shot in the dark where they went. They went to Vitalii’s parents’ home, which unfortunately happened to be even closer to the front lines. The battle for Kyiv was happening as they were sheltering underground. Eventually, they were able to make it out to Germany, and after a while, they found their way to the U.S. They actually connected while they were in Germany with a man in Arkansas who wanted to sponsor people coming in on U4U.
WSHU: So U4U is a special visa that was created by the Biden administration for Ukrainian refugees.
SR: Correct. So, U4U was a program that existed that was created for these Ukrainians who were caught in the heart of this war, and that was recently paused in January 2025 along with a set of other statuses, like TPS, temporary protective status, which is relevant to this story, because people who have come on you for you, on the earlier side, who were no longer eligible to renew U4U, are now trying to resort to TPS to be able to stay here. Those individuals are also in a fragile position, as most of the programs available to them in the past have been paused, leaving them in a state of uncertainty.

WSHU: And you use this family to illustrate the type of assistance that refugee families were getting that they no longer had access to.
SR: Yeah, so organizations like CIRI and IRIS here in Connecticut have seen major cuts to funding and programs and services that they’re able to offer. This family was lucky enough to be part of the last group of people who were able to receive these services, but Ukrainians who have similar life experiences to this family, who are only now trying to leave, will not be able to reach the same places that this family was able to reach, because all of the services that were available to them along the way have now been impacted by either cuts or just not existing anymore.
WSHU: Now, how is the family itself? How have they adjusted to being in America, and are they still in Connecticut?
SR: The first year or two were particularly difficult for the family. It was a shock in many ways, both in terms of culture, but also in terms of the professions that were available to them. This is a young couple, and they were pretty career forward in terms of their outlook on life, and they arrived in this country where one of them doesn’t really speak the language, and he had been a manager in a food company, regional manager, and so jumping from that to changing tires and coming home and smelling like this burnt plastic was a huge change. It would have been a huge change, even if they had just stayed in Ukraine. So that alone, and then not being able to speak the language, not knowing how to access certain services, all of that was a huge change for them. And once they reached Connecticut, and Vitalii had this job that was similar to what he had in Ukraine, then they kind of started to find their footing. And one thing that Evgenia particularly credited and that I mentioned in the piece is that Connecticut’s social services and the different organizations that exist within the state kind of reduce these barriers.
WSHU: You specifically mentioned the children being able to get onto HUSKY and being able to get some medical treatment that they hadn’t been able to for quite a while.
SR: Yeah, so during the first few days of the war, or even before it started, Angelina, who is Evgenia’s youngest daughter, had started to experience tooth pain. Obviously, they were caught in the whirlwinds of war and were unable to seek proper medical attention safely. This treatment was delayed, and they reached Arkansas, then they reached Florida and tried to seek medical treatment there, but the barrier of not having insurance was just too big, and so they had to wait until Connecticut. Fortunately for them, Connecticut’s immigrant insurance programs and the barriers that are reduced compared to other states were very helpful in allowing them to seek the treatment that they needed, and Angelina has been able to follow through and complete the medical treatment that she had needed since leaving Ukraine.
WSHU: Well, that’s fantastic. In the meantime, the services that were made available to them are no longer available. So what’s the situation with that going forward? Will we be able to preserve any of these services? Or they’re just gone?
SR: Well, in the case of IRIS, for example, they’ve had to close an entire office. So it seems like the future, I mean, some of these services just no longer exist. Entire portions of staff have been laid off in the past few months, and so it seems like we’re in a pretty bleak position. Individual funding can’t necessarily make up for all of the government funding that these organizations have lost. So I wish I had a better answer, but so far, the future of these organizations seems rather dire.
WSHU: However, this particular family has been able to tie into the local Ukrainian community, and that has been a lot of help to them.
SR: That’s correct. So I mean, even just the way that I was able to connect with this family was through the Ukrainian community, by nature of just getting breakfast with one Ukrainian woman based in New Haven and chatting about the Ukrainian community that exists within Connecticut, I was able to connect with this family.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0814_SR_EastHavenBeach_113-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 14:56:56.014178

Delaware’s 38th annual Coastal Cleanup drew more than 950 volunteers to over 45 sites on Sept. 13, clearing 5,121 pounds of debris from beaches, wetlands, and waterways from Fenwick Island to Battery Park, according to the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).
Participation held steady from 2024, but this year’s haul was 3,000 pounds heavier. Cigarette butts, food wrappers, and bottle caps topped the list of most-collected items, while larger finds included a car exhaust, other car parts, and a bean bag chair. 
“This annual event brings together neighbors and visitors willing to put a few hours into protecting our beautiful coastline, with all those individual acts adding up to a significant result,” said DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson, who joined Senator Kyra Hoffner, Senator Stephanie Hansen and other volunteers for the cleanup at Big Stone Beach. “Taking more than 2 tons of trash off the beach – much of it one bit of plastic at a time – shows the true power of collective action.”

DNREC noted that the data recorded by volunteers helps the state understand what’s washing up on Delaware’s shores and informs efforts to reduce litter. The results are also submitted to the International Ocean Conservancy’s Coastal Cleanup database to contribute to global trends and solutions for cleaner oceans and waterways.
“It has been a wonderful experience to be involved with coastal cleanup for 20 years,” said Jennifer Pongratz, DNREC Division of Watershed Stewardship environmental scientist, and longtime Coastal Cleanup committee member. “I love getting to see the same volunteers year after year that return to their favorite spots to give back in their community, as well as newcomers to the cleanup who get to experience the joy of this act of service for the first time.”
DNREC emphasized that keeping beaches and waterways clean is a year-round effort.

(Photo courtesy of the National Weather Service)COLUMBIA — Warnings to brace for the worst have subsided after incoming Tropical Storm Imelda’s predicted path turned out to sea, according to the National Weather Service.
Coastal residents should prepare for about 1 inch of rain from scattered storms Tuesday, followed by drier weather with temperatures in the 70s and 80s over the following days. Flooding is still possible in some areas, but not more than during a typical storm, the National Weather Service said in briefings Monday.
SC under state of emergency as possible tropical storm approaches

With the risks diminished, the state Emergency Management Division returned to normal operations Monday, according to a news release. But a state of emergency, which allows officials to more easily mobilize response teams and apply for federal disaster aid, remained in effect as of noon Monday.
Tropical Storm Imelda, which formed from an unnamed tropical disturbance over the weekend, could have made landfall in the Carolinas or parked just off the coast. Either option could have caused major flooding, and high winds could have knocked down trees and powerlines, the National Weather Service said previously.
Instead, meteorologists expect the storm to take a sharp right turn early Tuesday, away from the Carolinas and further east in the Atlantic Ocean, largely following the path of the much larger Hurricane Humberto, according to the weather service.
Swimmers and boaters should stay wary this week, and those with little experience should stay out of the water altogether.

(Leah Romero for Source NM)When David Gutierrez of Laguna had surgery to remove his gallbladder earlier this year, he and his wife of 45 years Rebecca Gutierrez thought his recovery would be simple and straightforward. Instead, several complications left the couple worrying about his care and their rapidly shrinking funds.
Rebecca Gutierrez previously worked at her local senior center in Laguna, where she interacted with many people who, she told Source New Mexico, worried about being unable to afford to leave their jobs or care for aging parents on their own. Then she attended one of the New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Services Department’s annual Conference of Aging and learned about New MexiCare, a program that helps fill the gaps for seniors who have cognitive or physical limitations and don’t qualify for Medicaid, but have limited financial means.
 After receiving funding during the 2024 legislative session, the program rolled out as a pilot that year, but only in limited counties and not in Cibola County, where the couple lived. NewMexiCare later expanded to 31 of the state’s 33 counties — everywhere but Bernalillo and Doña Ana counties —and, as of this month, became available statewide
According to a Sept. 16 news release from the ALTSD, 285 New Mexicans have been enrolled in New MexiCare since its official launch in October 2024, and over $1.2 million in financial assistance has been distributed.
While at the 2025 Annual Conference on Aging in Glorieta last week, Aging Secretary Emily Kaltenbach told Source that enrollment numbers have tripled since she took over the department last fall.
“The challenge ahead of us is money,” she said. “People get on the program, but attrition is not at the same rate as people coming on. And so, that’s going to be something we’re going to have to tackle at a legislative level.  We have to show how impactful it is so that we can get additional funding.”
The Gutierrezes were two of more than 1,400 senior New Mexicans and caregivers who attended the conference this week, and made a point to share their story with Kaltenbach.
After David Gutierrez became sick with gallstones in April 2025, he underwent surgery to remove his gallbladder and Rebecca became his primary caregiver. But he didn’t improve after the surgery.
“We went home and he’s not getting any better,” she told Source. “He still hurts and doctors would say, ‘You know, he’s older. He’s 71 years old, it takes longer [to heal].’” 
David ended up back in the emergency room and doctors discovered that fluid had formed where his gallbladder had been, and he had developed an abscess on his liver. The medical team asked if the couple could travel 45 minutes from their home to Albuquerque frequently for treatment, but the travel costs would have compounded their financial situation. “I’ve already used my resources taking care of him,” Rebecca said. 
She called New MexiCare and arranged an appointment for organizers to interview the two of them in their home to assess their needs. During the two-week wait, David’s situation remained complicated. “One week he had seven doctor’s appointments,” she said.
And because of the toll the surgery and subsequent complications took on his body, David was weaker than he had ever been and had trouble getting around. He had to use a walker for the first time in his life. After the assessment, he was approved for New MexiCare, including 17 hours a week for in-home care and four-and-a-half hours of transportation. The couple told Source that before they received a check from New MexiCare, their savings were almost completely used up. They said they were worried about how they would pay for the copays for all of David’s appointments.
“I’ve always advocated for the caregivers, but to become one was totally different,” Rebecca said. 
With help and financial assistance from New MexiCare and Social Security, the couple have been able to focus on David’s recovery. And Rebecca said she recently became the president of the advisory group in Laguna for seniors. 
“I told them, ‘I’m going to educate you guys how to take advantage of this opportunity that we finally have,’” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/New-MexiCare-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-29 12:57:13.149655

A proposed state constitutional amendment would increase Florida's homestead exemption for property taxes. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Although the specifics of such a proposal are still unknown, a majority of Floridians say that, if given the chance, they would vote for some form of property tax reform. That’s according to a public opinion survey commissioned by the James Madison Institute (JMI) released on Monday.
If a constitutional amendment to significantly reduce or eliminate property taxes were on the ballot, 65% would support that. Only 15% oppose it, with 20% unsure.
Constitutional amendments in Florida must win 60% support to go into effect.
Gov. Ron DeSantis has been campaigning for months on the idea that Floridians want and need property tax relief, and has floated the idea that Florida could become the first state in the nation to completely eliminate them.
But property taxes pay for crucial local services like police, fire departments, and schools. A study by the Florida Policy Institute concluded that eliminating property taxes for homesteaded properties would cost $18.5 billion.
As a way to preempt those arguments by local government officials, Florida’s recently appointed chief financial officer, Blaise Ingoglia, has been making appearances around the state calling out local governments for alleged “wasteful spending” (without specifying what reaches that definition).
Florida Speaker of the House Daniel Perez formed a select committee to study the issue earlier this year, and that group met twice last week in Tallahassee to determine how such a proposal could be written. It’s expected that the Florida Legislature will approve a resolution for a constitutional amendment sometime during the 2026 legislative session, which begins in January, with the measure to appear on the November 2026 ballot.
On the philosophy of property taxes, 39% of those surveyed said they are a “valid” revenue source but should be limited. Another 33% said property taxes should be eliminated outright. Only 20% said they were critical for funding local government services and should be preserved. Another 8% weren’t sure.
Sixty-six percent of Floridians worry they may not be able to afford to continue living in their homes or communities due to rising property taxes or other housing costs.
There were plenty of other nuggets in the JMI survey, including that 62% of Florida voters oppose a DeSantis administration proposal to eliminate vaccine requirements.
Jolly competitive in one-on-one matchups with top Republicans
Nearly one in three registered voters (30%) describe themselves as “politically homeless,” feeling unrepresented by either the Democratic or Republican parties.
Regarding the 2026 gubernatorial race, in a hypothetical matchup between Republican Byron Donalds, Democrat David Jolly, and independent candidate state Sen. Jason Pizzo, Donalds leads Jolly, 36%-32%, with Pizzo at 4%.
In a three-way race with former House Speaker Paul Renner as the GOP candidate, Renner leads Jolly, 34%-33%, with Pizzo at 5%.
In a GOP race between Donalds and Renner, Donalds leads, 29%-9%.
But when Republican voters were asked for whom they would vote among “announced and potential candidates,” it’s First Lady Casey DeSantis who gets the most support. She leads Donalds 26%-23%, with Renner at 7%, Lt. Gov. Jay Collins at 2%, and Agriculture Commission Wilton Simpson at 2%.
The survey’s questions did not refer to the fact that Donalds has been endorsed by Donald Trump for president.
The survey of 1,200 registered voters in Florida was conducted by Targoz Market Research for the James Madison Institute between Sept. 16 and Sept. 18, with a margin for error +/- 2.77%.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-29 15:54:13+00:00,CT Mirror,A federal government shutdown is nearing. Here’s a guide for what to expect.,"Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler, Ariana Figueroa and Shauneen Miranda | States Newsroom",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/29/federal-shutdown-explainer-health-immigration-politics/,Nearly every corner of the federal government will feel the pain in some way if a compromise isn’t reached by Oct. 1.,"WASHINGTON — Congress’ failure to pass a short-term government funding bill before midnight Tuesday will lead to the first shutdown in nearly seven years and give President Donald Trump broad authority to determine what federal operations keep running — which will have a huge impact on the government, its employees, states and Americans. 
A funding lapse this year would have a considerably wider effect than the 35-day one that took place during Trump’s first term and could last longer, given heightened political tensions. 
The last shutdown didn’t affect the departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Veterans Affairs, since Congress had approved those agencies’ full-year funding bills.
Lawmakers had also enacted the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, exempting Capitol Hill from any repercussions. 
[RELATED: As government shutdown looms, CT Dems push for ACA subsidies]
That isn’t the case this time around since none of the dozen government spending bills have become law. That means nearly every corner of the federal government will feel the pain in some way if a compromise isn’t reached by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. 
States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau offers you a quick guide to what could happen if Republicans and Democrats don’t broker an agreement in time.
How does the White House budget office determine what government operations are essential during a shutdown?
Generally, federal programs that include the preservation of life or property as well as those addressing national security continue during a shutdown, while all other activities are supposed to cease until a funding bill becomes law. 
But the president holds expansive power to determine what activities within the executive branch are essential and which aren’t, making the effects of a shutdown hard to pinpoint unless the Trump administration shares that information publicly. 
Presidential administrations have traditionally posted contingency plans on the White House budget office’s website, detailing how each agency would shut down — explaining which employees are exempt and need to keep working, and which are furloughed. 
That appears to have changed this year. The web page that would normally host dozens of contingency plans remained blank until late September, when the White House budget office posted that a 940-page document released in August calls for the plans to be “hosted solely on each agency’s website.”
Only a few departments had plans from this year posted on their websites as of Friday afternoon.
The White House budget office expects agencies to develop Reduction in Force plans as part of their shutdown preparation, signaling a prolonged funding lapse will include mass firings and layoffs.
While the two-page memo doesn’t detail which agencies would be most affected, it says layoffs will apply to programs, projects, or activities that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities.”
Trump will be paid during a shutdown since Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution prevents the president’s salary from being increased or decreased during the current term.
No one else in the executive branch — including Cabinet secretaries, more than 2 million civilian employees and over 1 million active duty military personnel — will receive their paycheck until after the shutdown ends. 
Are federal courts exempt from a shutdown since they’re a separate branch of government?
The Supreme Court will continue to conduct normal operations in the event of a shutdown, according to its Public Information Office. 
The office said the court “will rely on permanent funds not subject to annual approval, as it has in the past, to maintain operations through the duration of short-term lapses of annual appropriations,” in a statement shared with States Newsroom. 
As for any impact on lower federal courts, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said the federal judiciary was still assessing the fiscal 2026 outlook and had no comment. 
The office serves as the central support arm of the federal judiciary. 
During the last government shutdown from late 2018 into early 2019, federal courts remained open using court fee balances and “no-year” funds, which are available for an indefinite period. 
The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has said that if those funds run out, they would operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which “allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers.” 
Supreme Court justices and appointed federal judges continue to get paid during a government shutdown, as Article III of the Constitution says the judges’ compensation “shall not be diminished” during their term.
What happens to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid?
The three programs exist largely outside of the annual appropriations process, since lawmakers categorized them as “mandatory spending.” 
This means Social Security checks as well as reimbursements to health care providers for Medicare and Medicaid services should continue as normal.
One possible hitch is the salaries for people who run those programs are covered by annual appropriations bills, so there could be some staffing problems for the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, depending on their contingency plans. 
The first Trump administration’s shutdown guidance for the Social Security Administration showed 54,000 of 63,000 employees at that agency would have kept working. The CMS plan from 2020 shows that it intended to keep about 50% of its employees working in the event of a shutdown. Neither had a current plan as of Friday.
Will the Department of Veterans Affairs be able to keep providing health care and benefits?
Veterans can expect health care to continue uninterrupted at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics in the event of a shutdown. Vets would also continue to receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs contingency planning for a funding lapse that is currently published on the department’s website. It’s unclear if the plan will be the one the Trump administration puts into action.
But a shutdown would affect other VA services. For example, the GI Bill hotline would close, and all in-person and virtual career counseling and transition assistance services would be unavailable.
Additionally, all regional VA benefits offices would shutter until Congress agreed to fund the government. The closures would include the Manila Regional Office in the Philippines that serves veterans in the Pacific region.
All department public outreach to veterans would also cease.
Will Hubbard, spokesperson for Veterans Education Success, said his advocacy organization is bracing for increased phone calls and emails from veterans who would normally call the GI Bill hotline.
“Questions are going to come up, veterans are going to be looking for answers, and they’re not going to be able to call like they would be able to normally, that’s going to be a big problem,” Hubbard said.
“Most of the benefits that people are going to be most concerned about will not be affected, but the ones that do get affected, for the people that that hits, I mean, it’s going to matter a lot to them. It’s going to change the direction of their planning, and potentially the direction of their life,” Hubbard said.
The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for current VA shutdown guidance.
What happens to immigration enforcement and immigration courts? 
As the Trump administration continues with its aggressive immigration tactics in cities with high immigrant populations, that enforcement is likely to continue during a government shutdown, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance for operating in a government shutdown.
Immigration-related fees will continue, such as for processing visas and applications from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
And DHS expects nearly all of its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees to be exempt — 17,500 out of 20,500 — and continue working without pay amid a government shutdown. 
That means that ICE officers will continue to arrest, detain and remove from the country immigrants without legal status. DHS is currently concentrating immigration enforcement efforts in Chicago, known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”
Other employees within DHS, such as those in Transportation Security Administration, will also be retained during a government shutdown. There are about 58,000 TSA employees that would be exempt and continue to work without pay in airports across the country.  
DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for a contingency plan if there is a government shutdown.
Separately, a shutdown would also burden the overwhelmed immigration court system that is housed within the Department of Justice. It would lead to canceling or rescheduling court cases, when there is already a backlog of 3.4 million cases.
The only exceptions are immigration courts that are located within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detention centers, but most cases would need to be rescheduled. The partial government shutdown that began in December 2018 caused nearly 43,000 court cases to be canceled, according to a report by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC.
And 28 states have an immigration court, requiring some immigrants to travel hundreds, or thousands, of miles for their appointment. 
States that do not have an immigration court include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
Will people be able to visit national parks or use public lands during a shutdown? 
Probably, but that may be bad for parks’ long-term health.
During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the first Trump administration kept parks open, with skeleton staffs across the country struggling to maintain National Park Service facilities.
Theresa Pierno, the president and CEO of the advocacy group National Parks Conservation Association, said in a Sept. 23 statement the last shutdown devastated areas of some parks.
“Americans watched helplessly as Joshua Trees were cut down, park buildings were vandalized, prehistoric petroglyphs were defaced, trash overflowed leading to wildlife impacts, and human waste piled up,” she wrote. “Visitor safety and irreplaceable natural and cultural resources were put at serious risk. We cannot allow this to happen again.”
The National Park Service’s latest contingency plan was published in March 2024, during President Joe Biden’s administration. It calls for at least some closures during a shutdown, though the document says the response will differ from park to park. 
Restricting access to parks is difficult due to their physical characteristics, the document said, adding that staffing would generally be maintained at a minimum to allow visitors. However, some areas that are regularly closed could be locked up for the duration of a shutdown.
But that contingency plan is likely to change before Tuesday, spokespeople for the Park Service and the Interior Department, which oversees NPS, said Sept. 25.
“The lapse in funding plans on our website are from 2024,” an email from the NPS office of public affairs said. “They are currently being reviewed and updated.”
Hunters and others seeking to use public lands maintained by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, will likely be able to continue to do so, though they may have to make alternative plans if they’d planned to use facilities such as campgrounds. 
Land Tawney, the co-chair of the advocacy group American Hunters and Anglers, said campgrounds, toilets and facilities that require staffing would be inaccessible, but most public lands would remain available.
“Those lands are kind of open and they’re just unmanned, I would say, and that’s not really gonna change much,” he said. “If you’re staying in a campground, you’ve got to figure something else out.”
As with national parks, access to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges and other hunting and fishing sites will differ from site to site, Tawney said. The Fish and Wildlife Service doesn’t require permits for hunting on its lands, but access to some refuges is determined by a staff-run lottery drawing. If those drawings can’t be held, access to those sites will be limited, Tawney said.
What happens to the Internal Revenue Service?
How the Internal Revenue Service would operate during a government shutdown remains unclear. 
When Congress teetered on letting funding run out in March, the nation’s revenue collection agency released a contingency plan to continue full operations during the height of tax filing season. 
The IRS planned to use funds allocated in the 2022 budget reconciliation law to keep its roughly 95,000 employees processing returns and refunds, answering the phones, and pursuing audits. 
Ultimately Congress agreed on a stopgap funding bill to avoid a March shutdown, but much has changed since then.
The new tax and spending law, signed by Trump on July 4 and often referred to as the “one big beautiful bill,” made major changes to the U.S. tax code. 
Additionally, the agency, which processes roughly 180 million income tax returns per year, has lost about a quarter of its workforce since January. Top leadership has also turned over six times in 2025.
Rachel Snyderman, of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said workforce reductions combined with a string of leadership changes could factor into how the agency would operate during a funding lapse.
“It’s really difficult to understand both what the status of the agency would be if the government were to shut down in less than a week, and also the impacts that a prolonged shutdown could have on taxpayer services and taxpayers at large,” said Snyderman, the think tank’s managing director of economic policy.
Do federal employees get back pay after a shutdown ends?
According to the Office of Personnel Management — the executive branch’s chief human resources agency — “after the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.” 
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 requires furloughed government employees to receive back pay as a result of a government shutdown. 
That law does not apply to federal contractors, who face uncertainty in getting paid during a shutdown. 
What role does Congress have during a shutdown?
The House and Senate must approve a stopgap spending bill or all dozen full-year appropriations bills to end a shutdown, a feat that requires the support of at least some Democrats to get past the upper chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. 
Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., control their respective chambers’ calendars as well as the floor schedule, so they could keep holding votes on the stopgap bill Democrats have already rejected or try to pass individual bills to alleviate the impacts on certain agencies.   
Neither Johnson nor Thune has yet to suggest bipartisan negotiations with Democratic leaders about funding the government. And while they are open to discussions about extending the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, they don’t want that decision connected to the funding debate.  
Democratic leaders have said repeatedly that Republicans shouldn’t expect them to vote for legislation they had no say in drafting, especially with a health care cliff for millions of Americans coming at the end of the year. 
Members of Congress will receive their paychecks regardless of how long a shutdown lasts, but the people who work for them would only receive their salaries after it ends. 
Lawmakers must be paid under language in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the Constitution as well as the 27th Amendment, which bars members of Congress from changing their salaries during the current session. 
Lawmakers have discretion to decide which of their staff members continue working during a shutdown and which are furloughed.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, which is tasked with protecting members amid a sharp rise in political violence, said a shutdown “would not affect the security of the Capitol Complex.” 
“Our officers, and the professional staff who perform or support emergency functions, would still report to work,” the spokesperson said. “Employees who are not required for emergency functions would be furloughed until funding is available.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
BETA Technologies filed for an initial public offering on Monday morning, after reports of the move circulated last week. 
The South Burlington-based company plans to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange “as soon as practicable” under the symbol “BETA,” according to Monday’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The electric and hybrid aircraft company has raised over $1.5 billion in capital through private equity investment and development contracts since its founding in 2017. The company opened a 188,500-square-foot production facility in South Burlington in 2023, and also runs a battery testing site in St. Albans.
“Electric aviation is inevitable,” wrote founding CEO Kyle Clark in a letter within the filing. “We believe it will lower the cost of flight, improve safety, expand aviation’s utility, and do so in balance with our environment.”
Monday’s filing comes just weeks after the company announced a high-profile partnership with GE Aerospace, which plans to make a $300 million equity investment in BETA.
The filing’s primary underwriters, taking on the financial risk of the offering, are Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.
BETA is in an enforced “quiet period” following its filing Monday and declined to comment.
This story will be updated.

Jared Golden. 
A political organization titled “Dunlap for Congress” was established on Thursday, as Bloomberg News first reported on Friday. Dunlap, who previously served as Maine’s Secretary of State for seven terms, first floated the idea of his potential run for Congress in District 2 in May and previously said he’d planned to make a decision by Oct. 1.
Golden is in his fourth term representing District 2, which comprises the majority of the state geographically north of Augusta. Voters in that district have routinely split tickets, reelecting Golden while going for President Donald Trump each time he’s run for president. 
Dunlap, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, made a national name for himself during Trump’s first term when serving on the president’s voter fraud commission. 
Dunlap refused to hand over sensitive Maine voter information that the commission requested (which current Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows cited when defending her decision to do the same). He also won a lawsuit against the group after its Republican leadership intentionally excluded him from deliberations. And, after it was disbanded, Dunlap chalked up the commission to being set up to validate Trump’s voter fraud claims. 
Dunlap is seen as more progressive than Golden, who often breaks with his party on votes. Golden did so recently as the only House Democrat to back a Republican stopgap spending proposal that did not include an extension of a health care tax credit. 
The IRS filing provides some insight into those behind Dunlap’s potential run for higher office. 
Brandon Philipczyk is listed as the custodian of records and contact person. He happens to be the same person named on the form establishing the political organization for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner, who is challenging long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. 
Philipczyk is also listed on those forms for other progressive challengers running for Congress, including Morgan Coghill in Illinois, Eric Descheenie in Arizona and Joey Mendoza Atkins in Florida.

Bob Menendez and his wife Nadine at one of several dinners he and his friends treated the couple to during what prosecutors say was a wide-ranging bribery scheme that started in 2018. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York)Attorneys for a failed insurance broker who testified that he bribed former Sen. Bob Menendez are asking a federal court for a lenient sentence, arguing their client was instrumental in securing the senator’s corruption conviction.
They said Jose Uribe, who gave the senator’s wife a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for Menendez’s intercession in a state insurance fraud case against a friend, testified despite fears of harassment and intimidation, and that his role in the trial justified a non-custodial sentence.
“Jose has learned the hardest of lessons by accepting responsibility for his crimes and by doing one of the most difficult, scary and grueling things imaginable — cooperating and being the government’s star witness in a historic, ultra-high-profile trial of one of the most powerful politicians at that time in America,” Uribe’s attorneys said in a court filing.
Uribe is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 9.
Ex-senator’s wife gets 4.5 years in prison for global bribery scheme

Uribe in March 2024 pleaded guilty to seven counts of bribery, obstruction, wire fraud, tax evasion, and conspiracy as part of an agreement to exchange his testimony for prosecutors’ recommendation of a lenient sentence. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 95 years behind bars.
He served as a star witness during the Menendez prosecution, testifying for two days on how he bribed the senator.
Uribe’s attorneys said he faced risks testifying against Menendez, who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when charged.
They said two men stopped his ex-wife outside a bank in April 2024 before being scared away by a bank clerk, and that a “strange man” appeared unannounced and uninvited in Uribe’s office to arrange a meeting with Nadine Menendez, the senator’s wife, so the two could agree on a lie about why Uribe was making her car payments.
“In this case, he was only delivering a message … however, in that harrowing moment, Jose realized that if — instead of wanting to avoid prosecution by making up a false story — someone had wanted to silence him through violence, he was vulnerable,” Uribe’s attorneys said.
Nadine Menendez was also convicted as part of the bribery scheme, and earlier this month was sentenced to nearly five years in prison. Bob Menendez is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence.
Uribe’s testimony also helped lead to convictions for co-defendants Wael Hana, a halal meat exporter, and real estate developer Fred Daibes.
Along with the sentencing memo, Uribe’s attorneys submitted numerous letters from friends, colleagues, and family members who urged leniency.
Osvaldo Lopez, a longtime friend, said Uribe housed him and his family in an Elizabeth apartment after Lopez immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 2002.
“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.  I had only recently met Jose — he barely knew me — yet he was doing something truly generous and life-changing for me and my family. That moment told me everything I needed to know about the kind of man he is, someone who helps others without hesitation and never expects anything in return,” Lopez said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)At a moment of Republican soul‐searching about the state’s role in economic development, Bill Even says the choice is clear.
“The choice should be to grow, and being thoughtful about doing that,” he said. “Because the alternative — and I’ve seen it with farms and over the course of my career — when they stop growing, when they stop innovating, when they stop buying new equipment, when they stop building things, those farms wither up and they go away. And I think as a state, we don’t want that. We don’t look backward for inspiration. We look forward.”
South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden appointed Even in April to lead the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. Even previously led the office from 2006 to 2007.
Rhoden hasn’t officially declared himself a candidate to keep his job yet, while at least three other people are already running, including U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota. The other two candidates have been vocal in their criticism of the state’s economic development efforts. Gubernatorial candidate and current Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, has criticized Even’s office and pledged to end what Hansen calls “corporate welfare,” while Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden has said the state should focus on helping existing businesses thrive instead of recruiting new ones.
Even’s roots run deep in the state. He is a fifth-generation family farmer from rural Humboldt, where his ancestors homesteaded in Dakota Territory in 1884. His career has included stints as state secretary of agriculture, state energy policy director and CEO of the National Pork Board.
The following interview with Even has been edited for length and clarity.
What is your economic development philosophy? 
Everything grows, right? So as a farmer, we grow crops, and we grow livestock, and we as people, we also grow. We grow, not only physically, but we should also be growing in our knowledge, wisdom and faith. 
Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

I kind of bring that same mindset to the question of “what does growth look like for the state of South Dakota,” knowing that we all grow, because the opposite choice is stasis, which leads to decline. 
Recognizing that we’re living in a competitive environment — both in the United States amongst the states, as well as globally — I want to make sure that we bring that idea that we’re frugal, but not cheap. So, when we do build things, we’re going to build them and do it well and do it right. 
And then also I think a key point is that we’re bold but not reckless. You’ve got to be bold enough to take a leap of faith in business and to build things and do things. You’ve got to take some risks. But you don’t want to be reckless about it either. 
I think that’s where a lot of these conversations tend to land: Where’s that appropriate sweet spot, so that we are looking at expansion of businesses in South Dakota, retention of businesses in South Dakota, as well as any recruitment we want to do. We want to make sure it’s the right place and the right fit with the right business model. 
What is your message to Republicans calling the state’s incentive-based approach “corporate welfare?”
At a really high level, South Dakota is a conservative state. I reflect that as a person. And I completely understand that as a taxpayer in South Dakota. 
But I think it comes back to the question of, “Do we want to grow the pie here in South Dakota or look at everything as a fixed pie?” That’s this idea that everything grows. And if we want to grow our economy and grow our tax base, well, we’re operating in a highly competitive environment. I don’t think it would be wise for South Dakota to unilaterally disarm in this space. 
Number one, it starts with the retention of businesses in the state. Number two, then you move on to focus on what can be done to help them expand and make sure that they are successful here. And then third on the list are the businesses looking around the world and saying, “You know what? South Dakota’s got the business climate. It’s got the accessibility of its leadership. And they’re hard workers. This is a place where I would like to have my business located.”
We all came here from somewhere at some point in time, and I think we also need to acknowledge the fact that if businesses want to come to South Dakota, we want to make sure that we are open for that opportunity. 
How competitive is the recruitment and retention of businesses?
When states are looking to grow and expand, they’re always looking to recruit workers and businesses into their states to help grow their economies. They know that it’s not a zero-sum game and that by growing the pie, there are benefits. 
I worked in sales with Pioneer Seed. For three years, I ran their commercial business here in the Upper Midwest, and had 350 people on the sales team. And you’re in a competitive environment where there are other people trying to get to your customers. Our job was to be on their farm and be their provider of choice.

I kind of look at South Dakota as being in a similar position, where we’re in a highly competitive environment with other states. Instead of other brands that may be selling against you, it’s other states that are talking about their quality of life, their workforce, the tools they have available, like low-interest loans and the like. And so we operate in that space, whether we like it or not. 
We can choose to be in the game, and be in the game smart, or we can choose to be out of the game and sit on the sidelines. Those are choices. 
What do you say to those who feel economic development incentives are undermining the concept of a free market?
There are the rules of the game and the playing field. And if there were no incentives with any state, anywhere, anytime — if there were no partnership programs and no low-interest loan programs — then that would be the playing field that you were on and those are the rules you would follow. 
The way that the reality works in economic development and business is that there are 50 different U.S. states, and they are all in the business of looking to attract people, attract businesses and workers. I think South Dakota is merely playing by the same rules of the game and the way the field is set up today, nationally. 
I truly do appreciate the sentiment. But the reality is, on the ground, if we choose not to play and everybody else is still playing, I know how that’ll turn out. Sitting at the bench on the sideline doesn’t give you a chance. 
Are you looking to introduce any measures to alleviate the frustrations of some Republicans regarding economic development?
I said in front of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee right after I started, “Look, the question you always ask people is are you here to help fix the problem, or are you here to affix blame?” And I’m here to help fix problems, to the extent that there are any problems. And at the end of the day, if you are doing good work with good companies, you’re going to have a good track record.
For example, the default rate on the REDI [Revolving Economic Development and Initiative] loan program over 38 years is like two-tenths of 1%. It’s incredibly solid. Across the 38 years of just the Future Fund alone, 1,687 grants have gone out. Over $630 million adjusted for inflation. The successful track record here is incredible.
At the end of the day, we also know this is an election year. So, there’s a lot more talk and discussion, but my intent here, as a public servant, is to fix any problems. 
My pickup’s got a huge windshield. It’s got a small rearview mirror. You need to look in it from time to time to kind of see where you’ve been and what’s worked and what’s not, but I’m looking forward. 
How do you ensure your office’s return on investment is adequate?
We have a team whose job it is to track South Dakota’s status nationally, track what other states are doing, what our competitors are doing, and how the competitive landscape is changing. But they also do a return on investment analysis in conjunction with our finance and loan team and the Board of Economic Development. 
A lot of people call here, a lot of people talk to GOED, but only projects that are deemed viable are the ones that we bring forward. I think the public should rest assured that there’s a team and there’s a process in place that evaluates all of these things. 
Ultimately, out in the free market, you never know what will happen. Something may change. Circumstances may change. But at the end of the day, we try to tee up the ones that are best positioned for success, and that’s what we put in front of the Board of Economic Development for their evaluation. And they evaluate things separately and independently from us. They’re bankers and business owners in the state that are very experienced. 
There is a lot of anxiety regarding economic development opportunities like wind and solar energy, data centers, small nuclear reactors. How do you think about those developments?
As a businessperson, you evaluate every opportunity on its merits when it arises, right? 
We take a look at the project and say, “Is this project viable? Is this something that could fit in South Dakota? And if so, where would it be a good fit in South Dakota?” And then you take a look at the alternatives.
In many cases, if the alternative is carte blanche saying, “Well, I don’t want this particular business, I don’t want this type of business,” the marginal tax revenue is zero, because the business was never built, the people were never here, the money was never invested. That’s stasis. 
Versus saying, “There’s an opportunity to build something or do something, and well, let’s evaluate it. What’s the credibility of the business? Where might it be a good fit?” And when you do that, it should have a marginal increase to the gross domestic product in South Dakota. It brings jobs, it brings property tax revenue, and it brings sales tax revenue. 
It doesn’t mean that things don’t cost money, that roads don’t need to be built, and power lines don’t need to be built, and water lines don’t need to be built. But at the end of the day, you have a choice between stasis or taking a chance on something after you’ve had the opportunity to vet it.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0724-1-scaled-e1759155364582-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 10:57:41.625749

The Maine Department of Health and Human Services will mail more than 67,000 letters to Maine residents who qualify for the Maine Public Utilities Commission’s Low-Income Assistance Program, also known as LIAP. The program helps homeowners and renters reduce monthly electricity costs through bill credits.
“Programs like LIAP can make a real difference for those struggling to afford their electric bill,” said Public Advocate Heather Sanborn. “If you receive a letter, show it to your utility. This simple step could mean a real savings on your electric bill.” 
Credits vary based on income, household size and electricity usage. 
To be eligible for LIAP, a household must be eligible for the federal utility assistance program or participate in another income-based DHHS assistance program with a household income at or less than 150% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines. That would be between roughly $23,000 and $48,000 for households with one to four people. 
Households who are already enrolled in the federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, also referred to as LIHEAP, will be automatically enrolled in the state’s LIAP program. 
To receive the LIAP benefits, Mainers who receive a letter only need to present it to their utility company, according to a news release from the Office of the Public Advocate. Contact information for the utility company should be included as part of the letter. 
The release from Sanborn’s office urged residents to keep an eye out for these letters and apply for aid as soon as possible. Mainers who do not receive a letter but believe they may qualify to receive assistance should contact their electricity utility or local Community Action Agency.

The $10 billion behemoth will be as big as 70 football fields.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.
The colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, about 50 miles west of Vicksburg, Mississippi. But not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.
Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.
Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.
“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.
Private deals for public power supply
Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.
Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.
Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.
Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.
Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.
“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.
Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.
Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.
Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.
But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”
How is this tackled in other states?
Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.
Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.
And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a “kill switch” law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.
Locals have mixed feelings
Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.
“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.
In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.
But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.
“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

(Photo by Roman Dial/Alaska Pacific University)When scientists Patrick Sullivan and Roman Dial were heading to a remote area in the Brooks Range in 2019 to map the spread of woody plants there, they were looking forward to seeing a celebrated river that author John McPhee described decades ago as having the “clearest, purest water I have ever seen flowing over rocks.”
What they found in the Salmon River, a waterway that flows through Northwest Alaska’s Kobuk Valley National Park, was much different than what McPhee described in his landmark 1976 Alaska book “Coming Into the Country.” The waters Sullivan and Dial found were reddish-orange and murky from loads of minerals flowing into them.
The Salmon River and its tributaries had become transformed into “rusting rivers,” a phenomenon caused by climate change in permafrost regions.
“The permafrost is thawing, and it’s essentially acid rock drainage that’s occurring. These sulfite minerals are being exposed to oxygen and water for the first time in thousands of years and it’s releasing acid which is leaching metals out of the rocks to the streams,” said Sullivan, who heads the Environment and Natural Resource Institute at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
The problem goes beyond aesthetics, according to further research by Sullivan, Dial, who is at Alaska Pacific University, and their colleagues.
The Salmon River, a designated wild and scenic river, and its tributaries are so tainted by acid-rock drainage that their concentration of metals is considered toxic to chronically exposed aquatic life, they found.
Water samples taken in the summers of 2022 and 2023 found that the river and almost all of its tributaries were carrying metals at levels above U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state of Alaska standards, according to a recently published study by Sullivan and his colleagues. A variety of metals were showing up in amounts dangerous to aquatic life: iron, cadmium, aluminum, nickel, zinc and copper, their study found.
The “rusting rivers” pollution is similar to the kind of pollution that can happen from hardrock metals mining. But unlike the case with mining, it is happening in the absence of human development, and it is happening over diffuse spots, whereas a single point source at a mine that could potentially be controlled.
“This wild and scenic river in the heart of Kobuk Valley National Park, it’s about as protected as you can get and as remote as you can get. And it’s kind of falling apart,” Sullivan said.
The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, summarized the situation in its title: “Wild, scenic, and toxic.”
There are places around the Arctic where rust-red rivers have been that way for centuries, like Canada’s Arctic Red River, also known in the Gwich’in language as Tsiigehnjik, meaning “iron river.”
But for the Salmon River, the change was abrupt.
The Bush pilot who ferried Sullivan and Dial to the site in 2019, who described the river’s appearance as similar to sewage, said it had just happened that year.
The toxicity findings are potentially ominous for fish health.
The timing of the change suggests that thaw-induced acid rock drainage could be one of the many factors depressing western Alaska salmon runs, the study found.

	Salmon runs have been disastrously low in the region for the past few years, sometimes precluding even traditional subsistence harvests that are relatively small in scale but hugely important to culture and food security.
At the very least, the timing is a coincidence, Sullivan said. “It’s identical to what you would expect if these degrading streams were impacting spawning success,” he said, pointing out that most of the chum salmon that returns to the Kotzebue Sound area do so at the ages of four of five years, after emerging from the spawning rivers and swimming around in the ocean.
There is too little evidence for now to definitely link the rust-tinted waters of the Salmon River to poor salmon runs, Sullivan said. That is largely because there is too little known about that river’s fish populations, though the name suggests that the river was important to salmon in the past, he said.
It appears to have been that way in the 1970s, when McPhee was there boating there, fishing, camping and collecting information for his book.
At that time, the water was so clear that the riverbed was “as distinct as if the water were not there,” McPhee wrote. Those clear waters chock-full of oval-shaped salmon swimming upstream to spawn, he wrote. “Looking over the side of the canoe is like staring down into a sky full of zeppelins,” he wrote.
The recent proliferation of rusting rivers is not limited to Alaska and other parts of the Arctic. There are affected high-altitude areas that have permafrost, glaciers or both, including Switzerland and neighboring parts of the Alps, Peru and parts of Colorado.
In Alaska, the rusting rivers phenomenon is more pronounced in the western part of the North Slope than in the eastern part, Sullivan and Dial have found. Their past studies linked the vegetation changes in the northwest to more pronounced warming on the Chukchi Sea side of Alaska’s Arctic than on the Beaufort Sea. That spread of woody plants is detrimental to tundra caribou that eat lichen and moss, and could help explain the decline in the Western Arctic caribou herd, which has a habitat that is changing more quickly than that of the Porcupine caribou herd on the eastern North Slope, they found.
After Sullivan and Dial encountered multiple rusting rivers during their plant studies, they felt compelled to alert fellow Alaskans about the situation.
They penned a 2022 column for the Anchorage Daily News. And they embarked on their further studies, which wound up generating a small National Science Foundation grant, creating partnerships with scientists at other universities who are experts in biochemistry and, ultimately, the newly published study on toxicity.
But before then, when they were expecting to see the same conditions that McPhee did in the 1970s, Sullivan packed a fishing rod with the gear he took on the trip to the Salmon River.
His attempts to fish in the murky, opaque water proved futile, however. “I think I tried for, like, five minutes and then I quickly realized that I was wasting my time,” he said.
That experience suggests that there might be further ecological impacts of the cloudy, rusted waters, he said.
“I think it would be very hard, for instance, for a bear to fish for a salmon just because of the turbidity. Raptors would have a really hard time catching a fish if they were fishing there,” he said, citing the suspended solids that make the water opaque.
For now, Sullivan and other scientists are using satellite imagery to spot other rivers and streams that might be similarly affected. The imagery is useful not just for spotting acid-tinted streams but the point sources in the tundra, he said.
It would be helpful to have more research on the region’s fish to explore whether they are carrying metals in their bodies, he said. Another topic of study could be the response of chum salmon in the region, as the species does show the some ability to shift habitats, he said.

“It’s possible that this will kind of run its course over some period of time.

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Larry Lessig, Harvard law professor and activist 







THE LATEST NEW ENGLAND effort to limit money in politics looks from a distance like a doomed project, betting on a conservative high court’s appetite to revisit the landmark Citizens United ruling that opened the floodgates to unlimited fundraising and spending. But backers of a Maine ballot measure believe the Roberts court might want a chance to clarify how much influence the wealthy can flex in US elections.  
Efforts to restrict money flowing into super political action committees (PACs), which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on campaigns as long as they don’t coordinate with the candidates they back, keep bumping up against the same issue: lower courts consistently declare that under Citizens United, that is simply unconstitutional.  
The landmark US Supreme Court decision in 2010 declared that political spending is protected speech and, unless there is a risk of quid-pro-quo corruption, that restricting the independent spending of corporations, unions, and nonprofit groups violates the First Amendment. 
In his concurring opinion in Citizens United, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that “the First Amendment protects more than just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer.”  
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Harvard law professor and political activist Larry Lessig about an ill-fated attempt to restrict PAC contributions in Massachusetts and the successful ballot effort in Maine. A coalition spearheaded by Lessig thinks it has a shot at convincing higher courts to embrace their legal theory – not to overturn Citizens United, but to embrace an originalist argument that might clarify its boundaries. 
“Though there are Republican super PACs and there are Democratic super PACs, what we’re worried about is there are no working class super PACS versus the rich person super PACs,” Lessig said. “All these super PACs are basically funded by the super super wealthy in America.”  
While individuals can only contribute $3,500 to a federal candidate during an election cycle, Lessig noted that the last cycle puts a somewhat absurd point on the role of super PAC contributions. Elon Musk’s PAC spent about $200 million to help elect Donald Trump, largely funded through Musk’s own contribution of $239 million, and the world’s richest man contributed millions to other PACs backing Republican Senate candidates and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” message. 
“The idea that the risk of corruption from a $3,300 contribution,” which is where the limit stood in the 2023-2024 cycle, “is greater than the risk of corruption from a $277 million contribution is just crazy talk,” Lessig said. “It’s not any opinion that the Supreme Court has ever uttered.” 
Then-Attorney General Maura Healey’s office rejected a ballot measure in 2022 in Massachusetts that would have capped super PAC contributions to $5,000, arguing that it would violate free speech rights. The matter died without the state’s high court ever getting into the merits, so Lessig turned to the northernmost New England state. 
Maine voters in 2024 overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure limiting Super PAC contributions to $5,000. Super PACs sued and won in the US District Court for the District of Maine. Lessig said an appeal will be filed in October with the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.  
The law’s backers say they not only expected the lawsuit, but climbing the courts was the plan.  
It was “designed to force the legal question,” agreed on by lower courts but never by the US Supreme Court, on whether Citizens United means that someone has the constitutional right to contribute unlimited amounts of money to PACs.  
Spending from all partisan PACs is soaring, Lessig said. 
“There’s no partisan reason to like PACs anymore,” he said, “and I think this Supreme Court would look at the world they’re in right now, where money in politics, Pew reports, is the number one issue Americans’ care about, that we have to fix this if we’re going to fix everything else, and they would look at the kind of corruption that’s in very plain sight right now with the president and everything else going on, and find it very hard to uphold a rule that would continue to fuel all of that corruption.” 
On the podcast, Lessig discusses the intent of the Maine ballot effort (1:40), super PAC use in both parties (8:35), and how he hopes the US Supreme Court would rule (29:30).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-29 09:58:51.010590

WILMINGTON — Aternium marked its two-year anniversary on Thursday, September 25, with the announcement of a $1 million investment from the State of Delaware to support the company’s next phase of engineering toward producing industrial clean hydrogen.
Nearly 100 community leaders attended the event, where Lt. Governor Kyle Evans Gay and Delaware Division of Small Business (DSB) Director CJ Bell presented a ceremonial check to Aternium founder Dr. Andrew Cottone.
The state’s $1 million investment comes from the Delaware Accelerator & Seed Capital Program (DASCP), one of four initiatives funded through the U.S. Treasury Department’s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). Delaware is administering $60.9 million in SSBCI funds to expand access to capital for start-up and early-stage businesses.
Governor Matt Meyer praised Aternium’s work as an example of the innovation shaping Delaware’s future.
 “Aternium’s work represents the kind of forward-thinking innovation that will shape a healthier and more sustainable future for all of us,” Meyer said. “By investing in clean hydrogen, we’re not only supporting a Delaware company with incredible potential, but we’re also taking real steps to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment for generations to come.”

DSB Director CJ Bell emphasized the broader economic impact.
 “We are continuing to make significant investments in high-impact, high-growth companies to position Delaware as the Mid-Atlantic hub for innovation,” Bell said. “Supporting companies like Aternium is good for our state’s economy and our environment.”
Cottone said the funding validates Aternium’s mission and accelerates its progress. 
“We are grateful to the State of Delaware for this critical funding, which underscores the state’s commitment to innovation and clean energy,” he said. “This support accelerates our efforts to sustainably scale clean hydrogen production, strengthen our partnerships, and bring lasting economic and environmental benefits to Delaware.”
The anniversary event gathered strategic partners, elected officials, stakeholders, and members of the media to recognize Aternium’s achievements.

Wes Moore’s team is being promoted as part of a reorganization of the governor’s staff.
Emmanuel “Manny” Welsh will become principal deputy chief of staff and chief administrative officer. The move is part of a reorganization of the second floor offices of the State House by Lester Davis, Moore’s incoming chief of staff.
“Manny is a proven public servant with a deep well of expertise in the operations of government that’s vital to guiding Maryland through this unprecedented time,” Moore said in a statement.
“This moment is generationally defining for our state. We have a solid foundation to grow from as we diversify our economy to become less reliant on the federal government, but as that relationship changes, we need to ensure Marylanders continue to receive a high level of service from their state government,” Moore said. “His new leadership role will help ensure our agencies do just that.”
The changes announced this morning could be the first as Davis takes the reins as Moore’s new chief of staff.
“This will be an iterative process,” said David Turner, a Moore spokesman. “As Chief Davis integrates further with the team, roles and processes will adjust to ensure the administration better delivers at a high level for the people of Maryland.”

Welsh’s promotion takes effect Oct 15. Davis joins the governor’s office the same day. Welsh’s salary will be $202,000.
The model the office is moving to is relatively new to Maryland, though more than a dozen other states have similar organizational structures.
“Chief Davis brings his own experience and expertise to the role,” Turner said. “The model comes from his management experience in the City of Baltimore and at CareFirst.
“The Chief of Staff focuses on the most pressing strategic and political issues, orchestrates communications and political strategy, and manages upward to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor,” Turner’s statement said.
Davis, in his role, will serve as a gatekeeper to Moore — a traditional job for a chief of staff. Welsh, as second in command, will provide “executive-level oversight of state government operations,” Turner said.
“The Chief of Staff is responsible for the management, operations, strategy, policy, and external affairs of the Office of the Governor and the Moore–Miller Administration,” Turner said. “As the Governor’s highest-ranking aide and closest advisor, the Chief of Staff controls access and flow of information to the Governor, sets priorities, and ensures directives are executed across the Administration. All Deputy Chiefs of Staff will report directly to the Chief of Staff.”
Davis and Welsh take over at a time when advocacy groups, lobbyists, and others have complained over the last year that the second floor staff is unresponsive.
“The office of the governor takes seriously any critiques and suggestions for improvement,” Turner said. “Serving the state is a privilege, and during this unprecedented change in federal policy it’s vital the office adapts to the new environment. We’ll always look for ways to improve, as we have over the first two and a half years.”
Welsh’s promotion comes two weeks before Davis takes over as chief of staff.
Moore named Davis this month to succeed departing Chief of Staff Fagan Harris, who is leaving to become the president and CEO of the Abell Foundation in Baltimore.

Welsh will serve as “second-in-command” to Davis within Moore’s office. Welsh was one of several internal candidates for the chief of staff job.
He will also be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the office. As chief administrative officer, Welsh will work with Moore’s Cabinet and senior staff members. And he will continue overseeing Moore’s procurement policy and the Board of Public Works.
“This is a smart and timely decision as Maryland navigates changing dynamics with the federal government. By strengthening the Governor’s office with added structure, the administration will be able to respond more quickly and help agencies deliver critical services that meet Marylanders’ needs,” Kathy Hollinger, CEO of the Greater Washington Partnership, said in a statement provided by Moore’s office.
“Just as important, this model creates new opportunities to engage leading employers as partners — alongside government agencies — to ensure Maryland’s communities and economy remain strong,” her statement said. “This reflects the kind of forward-looking leadership this moment calls for.”
Moore, fresh off his 2022 election win, named Welsh as his liaison to the Board of Public Works.
Prior to that, Welsh worked for then-Comptroller Peter Franchot (D). Welsh, who was born in the Philippines, joined Franchot’s communication staff in 2015 and within a year, he was assisting the comptroller with the Board of Public Works. By 2020, Welsh was named Franchot’s chief of staff.

The low score was based in part on Evergy's decision to delay retirement of its coal power plant in Lawrence. (Jill Hummels/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Big utility companies nationwide lost ground this year in their plans to meet minimum climate targets, and Kansas’ Evergy received an F for a “multi-year backslide” from renewable investments, a Sierra Club report said. 
Evergy received 9 points out of 100 this year, dropping from 12 last year. The company earned a spotlight because of its move toward delaying the closure of a coal-burning plant and plans to build new gas-burning plants, the Dirty Truth about Utility Climate Pledges report said.  
The report grades 75 utilities across the country on plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035 and transition to clean energy through 2035, a press release said. 
“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club. “The average score was 15. The purpose of the report was to inspire utilities to move us forward towards a livable future. We didn’t expect to see it go backwards.”
Gorman said Evergy’s decisions about natural gas plants and delaying closure of coal plants is part of a national trend. The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said. 
Planning for a clean energy transition requires that utilities shift to running everything off of clean electricity, he said.
“There’s a good reason to increase load, but that’s at a steady pace that brings a lot of other benefits to the economy, to jobs, to ratepayers,” he said.
Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said. The Kansas Sierra Club was part of the work at the Kansas Corporation Commission recently to determine how utilities like Evergy should make sure costs associated with new customers, like data centers, aren’t borne by other customers, he said.
“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said. “I’d say that Evergy customers need to hold these large loads, these data centers, accountable to keep our bills low and lower our pollution by demanding that they use renewable energy.”
Gina Penzig, Evergy spokeswoman, said the company is delaying its expectations of a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.
“The reasons for this include growing demand growth because of the record economic growth in our service area and the need for new dispatchable generation, which is generation that can be turned on and off when our customers need it,” Penzig said. “The only sources of that would be natural gas, coal and potentially nuclear.”
Evergy announced last week that it is partnering with TerraPower to explore the possibility of building a nuclear power plant in Kansas, using advanced technology designed by TerraPower.
Penzig said Sierra Club has a narrow mission of retiring all fossil-fuel generation as soon as possible.
“At Evergy, we have to first ensure that it’s reliable, so it’s there when our customers need it. And what is the least cost combination of resources that we can use to get there,” she said. “If you look at our long-term plan, it has a considerable amount of renewables also being added to serve customers. The only reason we can do that is by combining it with traditional energy sources so that we can ensure we have reliable service.”
Penzig said the new generation of natural gas plants has advanced technology that makes them more efficient and cleaner than older plants.
Gorman said focusing on decreasing fossil fuel use is critical because of the effects of the climate crisis.
“We see them all across the country, the extreme weather, extreme heat, extreme cold,” he said. “They’re causing utility infrastructure to fall apart, especially gas and fossil fuel infrastructure. In response, these utilities in order to increase their profits are doubling down on that same gas and coal infrastructure that’s the most expensive.”
Gorman said it’s clear the utilities are going in the wrong direction. 
“(Evergy CEO) David Campbell is taking Evergy backwards, trying to increase fossil fuel product pollution and shareholder profits by spending as much as they can on expensive fossil fuel infrastructure, as much as the Kansas Corporation Commission will allow them to,” he said. That’s making our climate crisis worse. It’s making our bills higher, and it’s making our health worse.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Evergy-Lawrence-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 09:58:51.010590

Mike Braun denied clemency to death row inmate Roy Lee Ward in an announcement early Monday morning.
“After carefully reviewing the unanimous recommendation from the State Parole Board, I have decided to allow the execution of Roy Lee Ward to proceed as planned for October 10,” he said.
Unless a court intervenes, Ward will be the third person executed since Indiana resumed capital punishment in December 2024, after more than a decade-long pause. Braun denied clemency for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, earlier this year.
The Indiana Parole Board last week recommended against granting clemency to Ward.
The five-member panel cited the “brutal nature” of Ward’s 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne, emphasizing that Payne was conscious during the attack and her “final hours living with the injuries that Roy Lee Ward inflicted on her.”
“Candidly, this Board reviews thousands of cases a year, many with gruesome facts, but the victimization of Stacy Payne stood out to us,” wrote parole board chairperson Gwen Horth.
Ward clemency hearing: Victim’s family asks for ‘no mercy,’ defense cites autism diagnosis, remorse

Ward’s legal team has argued in court that Indiana’s current protocol creates a constitutionally unacceptable risk of pain and suffering, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
The inmate’s legal team continues to challenge the use of the drug pentobarbital, citing evidence that it can cause flash pulmonary edema and sensations of drowning. They point to Ritchie’s execution in May, when witnesses reportedly saw the inmate “lurch upward, as if to sit up, in a spasm” after the injection, a reaction they say is “inconsistent with the normal effects of unadulterated pentobarbital.”
In pending federal litigation brought by Ward, the Indiana Attorney General’s office confirmed last week that the Department of Correction has obtained “three sets” of pentobarbital.
Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal said in a sworn declaration submitted to the Northern District judge that two of those sets will expire at the end of October and the third set expires in March 2026.
The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent by former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.
State officials have not responded to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s questions about the amount paid for the latest three doses.
The state’s court filings also stressed that DOC is using “manufactured injectable pentobarbital” — not a compounded version — to carry out executions. Manufactured pentobarbital is produced in sterile facilities under federal quality controls, with longer shelf lives and stricter oversight than compounded alternatives, according to court filings.
Ward’s attorneys proposed that executions could be carried out more humanely if DOC administered a “pre-dose” of fentanyl or another opioid before pentobarbital, but Neal said in his declaration that the department “does not intend to use fentanyl as part of carrying out the death sentence” and that it is not included in the prison’s directives.

Filthy bathrooms. It’s among the things retired law enforcement park ranger John Lauretig remembers about the last government shutdown. National Parks staff were furloughed, but the parks remained open from December 2018 through January 2019, leading to a human waste problem: There was a half-ton of human waste alone at Death Valley outside the restrooms when parks staff returned. 
That crummy situation may be a sign of what awaits many Californians soon if the government shutdown takes hold Wednesday, writes CalMatters’ reporters.
A shutdown occurs when Congress and the president fail to agree over how to keep funding the government’s discretionary spending, which includes bridge repairs, disease detection and more. The White House says to check an agency’s website to see how programs would be affected during a shutdown. Some workers are deemed “essential” and continue to work.
Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare are mandatory programs that are excluded from the annual discretionary budget process, and, for the most part, should be unaffected by a shutdown. 
Congressional lawmakers must make a deal by Tuesday, 11:59 p.m. Democratic leaders want Republicans to undo the Medicaid cuts they implemented in President Donald Trump’s tax bill this summer and extend the federal subsidies for Affordable Care Act enrollees initially enacted under former President Joe Biden.
Meanwhile, Trump is floating the prospect of firing federal workers en masse should the shutdown occur. California is home to roughly 150,000 federal employees.
The National Park Service has lost nearly a quarter of its permanent staff since Trump’s return to the White House, according to an estimate by the National Parks Conservation Association. 
Read more about other government spending programs that could be affected in California during a shutdown, including air travel, disaster readiness and financial support for low-income families.

Protecting abortion providers

From CalMatters health reporter Kristen Hwang:
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a measure into law Friday that safeguards the identity of abortion providers in California. The law allows doctors, pharmacists and other authorized medical staff to prescribe abortion pills without putting their names or the patient’s name on the prescription label. It goes into effect immediately. 
Doctors in California and New York have been sued for providing abortion medication to residents in states where the procedure is not allowed.
The new law heightens the contrast between California’s abortion protections and laws in states like Texas, which heavily restrict or ban abortion, and allow their residents to sue out-of-state abortion providers.
Newsom said he was proud to sign the bill “in the face of amplified attacks on the fundamental right to reproductive freedom.”
The new law also requires state health insurance plans to cover the abortion pill even if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration yanks its approval.



Feds end tracking for food insecurity

From CalMatters’ health editor Molly Peterson:
California is showing alarm after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said that it would terminate the nationwide Household Food Security Report. Nearly one in eight households statewide are food insecure, according to the Public Policy Institute of California, meaning that they lack the resources to ensure that everyone has enough to eat to support active, healthy lives. 
The survey is a “gold standard,” said Barbara Laraia, professor and chair of the UC Berkeley’s Food Nutrition and Population Health Program. Without it, policymakers, researchers and nonprofits relying on the 30-year-old report’s annual data to track hunger trends and allocate resources will be “flying blind,” said Mauricio Torres Jr., a spokesman for the Sacramento-based nonpartisan California Budget & Policy Center.  
State-level data efforts still can inform some local responses to hunger. UCLA’s California Health Interview Survey has tracked food insecurity for more than 20 years, identifying greater needs among low-income households, communities of color and immigrants.
But the USDA’s decision comes as county public health departments report to CalMatters that even the threat of losing federal funding is starving food stamp education and nutrition programs that could help Californians in need.



Tribal regalia for CA high school grads

From CalMatters K-12 education reporter Carolyn Jones:
Native American students will face fewer obstacles if they want to wear tribal regalia at high school graduations, thanks to a bill Gov. Newsom signed Friday.
Assembly Bill 1369 allows students to wear eagle feathers, abalone necklaces, stoles and other regalia to graduation ceremonies without needing approval from the school district in advance. California already allowed students to wear tribal regalia, but at least half of school districts had pre-approval processes that some students said were overly cumbersome and arbitrary.

Assemblymember James Ramos, a San Bernardino Democrat and the bill’s author, in a statement: “Just acknowledging — once again — a student’s right to wear tribal regalia at high school graduation ceremonies is a far cry from early statehood, when California’s first governor called for a ‘War of Extermination’ against the tribes.”

Schools had said they need the pre-approval process to ensure that graduation adornments are respectful and appropriate. The process applied to all students, not just Native American students, although Native American students were more likely to wear regalia.
Regalia, which is often bestowed by a tribal elder or family member, is a way to celebrate the accomplishments of Native American students and raise awareness of the culture, Ramos said.

Brown’s home is elevated, so the water hasn’t reached the interior. Not yet. But she’s deeply worried about what the future will bring.
“If the water continues rising the way it is, I don’t want to be here,” said Brown, 58, who works as a medical driver. “… I love my area. But I think my life is more important.”
Just a half mile to the south, a massive new development — expected to bring stores, offices and 4,000 homes — is springing up. Brown fears that all the new concrete and pavement will only make flooding where she lives worse.
Charleston is one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities — and one of the most flood-prone. As climate change prompts sea levels to rise and storms to grow more intense, this historic city has become a warning bell for what’s to come along America’s coasts: Some neighborhoods will retreat and others will be protected, and still others — often lower-income communities — may be left behind.

In Charleston, those futures are colliding. The city and the federal government are planning a $1.3 billion seawall to defend the iconic downtown peninsula with its regal, pre-Civil War mansions and majestic moss-covered live oak trees.
On Sept. 9, the City Council approved spending $2.5 million for continued design work and authorized an agreement between the city and Army Corps of Engineers. The city’s share of the total price tag is $455 million, reported The Post and Courier.
But under the current plans, the wall would not extend to lower-income neighborhoods like Rosemont, a historically Black community bordered by a freeway and hemmed in by industrial sites. That could leave those families more exposed than ever.
“I’ve seen how all those floodwaters demolish people’s houses,” Brown said. “I don’t think I want to be part of that.”
What’s happening in Charleston is playing out in dozens of coastal cities from New York to California.
Driven largely by sea level rise, flooding in the coastal United States is projected to occur 10 times more often over the next 25 years, according to a recent analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central.
An estimated 2.5 million Americans could be forced to relocate over the next 25 years, the group found.
The increasing floods are prompting insurance companies to raise premiums and decline policy renewals. In fact, ZIP codes in coastal South Carolina are among those with the highest insurance nonrenewal rates, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. All of that is likely to push some residents to higher, or drier, ground.
To understand how Charleston reached this tipping point — and what makes it especially vulnerable — you have to start with its geography.

Rising water, growing crisis
Built along the confluence of three rivers and the Atlantic Ocean, the city was founded on marshland and mud flats. Flooding there was once far less frequent.
But now, even an afternoon thunderstorm or an unusually high tide can overwhelm drainage systems and submerge streets.
The problem isn’t just more rain — it’s higher water. The sea level in Charleston rose about 13 inches over the past century. But by 2050, scientists project it will accelerate, rising an additional 1.2 feet. And by the end of the century, the water is expected to be about 4 feet higher than it is today.
The ground is sinking, too.
Charleston is one of the most rapidly subsiding cities in the United States, mainly because of groundwater pumping and the settling of natural sediments and filled marsh areas. That double threat — rising seas and sinking land — leaves the city increasingly exposed to flooding.
According to Climate Central’s Coastal Risk Finder, more than 8,000 people and 4,700 homes in Charleston County will be at risk of annual flooding by 2050, even under moderate climate action scenarios. By 2100, more than 60,000 people could be affected.
The Lowcountry, as this region is known, was always low. But now, it’s getting lower, wetter and harder to protect.
Rapid development, meanwhile, is paving over forests and wetlands that once soaked up stormwater. Every new subdivision and strip mall replaces absorbent ground with impervious surfaces — asphalt, rooftops, parking lots — that send rainwater rushing into neighborhoods like Rosemont.
The uneven fight against the sea
After Hurricane Matthew sent water surging over Charleston’s iconic Battery wall in 2016, then-Mayor John Tecklenburg and other officials consulted with Dutch flood experts, seeking to tap the know-how of a country renowned for its expertise in holding back the sea.

Charleston developed a comprehensive city water plan to protect itself while promoting resilient growth. Federal officials proposed an 8-mile-long, $1.3 billion seawall to shield the city’s historic peninsula from future storm surges and sea level rise.
The city’s share will likely be more than $450 million. Tecklenburg said that won’t be an easy sell. But to the former mayor, the choice is clear.
He told Floodlight, “If you give up the peninsula, you might as well head for the hills.”
But neighborhoods like Rosemont — just beyond the wall’s reach — will remain exposed. Parts of the neighborhood are projected to be underwater by the end of the century. And some fear the wall could actually make flooding worse in unprotected areas.
Skip Mikell, a longtime community leader in Union Heights, a historically Black neighborhood, stood at the end of Peace Street in Rosemont, looking out over a nearby marsh.
“In 70 years, where we’re standing, if nothing’s done, it’s going to be water,” Mikell said, adding: “The gentry of Charleston have connections, they have money, they have a voice. These communities are voiceless.”
The long road to retreat

 
About 12 miles northwest of downtown Charleston, a tranquil expanse of weeds, marsh grasses and black-eyed Susans stretches across what used to be a neighborhood. Bridge Pointe was once a compact community of 32 townhomes.
The site was returned to nature after the city and federal government bought out its flood-weary residents. But like many buyouts across the country, the process was slow and bureaucratic.
SC is buying out more than 200 repeatedly flooded homes. Here’s how the effort has gone.

John Knipper was among those displaced. Newly retired, he moved from New York to Charleston in early 2015, buying a three-bedroom townhome in Bridge Pointe for $172,000.
But just six months after he moved in, an August thunderstorm turned a nearby creek into a river. Several inches of water crept into his living room. Then in October 2015, a stalled weather system dumped more than 15 inches of rain on the region. His first floor was submerged under 2 ½ feet of water.
Over the next few years, the storms and floods kept coming. In 2017, FEMA authorized $10 million to buy out Bridge Pointe residents and their neighbors. By then, it had flooded four times, making the homes, Knipper said, “really unsellable.”
It took nearly four years after buyout discussions began for residents to get money for relocation. A typical buyout can take more than five years, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office, meanwhile, found that there’s no national strategy for relocating people from flood-prone areas.
Building toward disaster
Just a mile away, many more homes are on the way.

Long Savannah, a massive new development, is expected to bring up to 4,500 homes. It’s one of several high-profile projects rising in flood-prone areas across Charleston County.
Like other mega developments planned for Charleston, Long Savannah will likely destroy wetlands, which work like nature’s sponges, soaking up rain and slowly releasing it to keep flooding in check.
Other massive developments on the books include Magnolia Landing, the 4,000-home project underway near the Rosemont community, and Cainhoy, a 9,000-home development that would fill wetlands on a low-lying peninsula near Charleston where flooding is already a growing threat.
“Charleston has a history of building in repetitively flooded areas,” said Robby Maynor, a climate campaign associate with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which sued to save some of the wetlands in the Long Savannah project. “We absolutely must stop building in low-lying and flood-prone areas to avoid making an already difficult situation even worse.”
Charleston city officials say they now require flood protections — such as higher elevation standards and better stormwater systems — for new buildings in flood-prone areas. But scientists and residents question whether those measures are enough, or whether building in risky areas simply shifts the danger to others.
“A similar story is playing out in cities all across the United States,” reports NASA’s Earth Observatory, “but the Charleston area stands out in one critical way — much of the new development has happened on low-lying land that is especially vulnerable to sea level rise and flooding.”
When leaving isn’t a choice
Ana Zimmerman and her husband bought their modest, one-story house on Shoreham Road — part of a close-knit neighborhood where neighbors looked after each other’s kids — in 2005.

The first sign of trouble came early one morning in October 2015. It was still dark when she put her feet to the bedroom floor, water lapping at her ankles. A powerful storm had overwhelmed the street.
Zimmerman rushed to save photo albums and the family cats, but the house suffered more than $80,000 in damages.
With the insurance payout and their own labor, the Zimmermans repaired the home.
But when Tropical Storm Irma hit two years later, Zimmerman remembers hearing neighbors screaming as 7 inches of floodwaters poured into her home — causing it to be declared a total loss.
Ultimately the couple abandoned the flood-damaged home and let it go into foreclosure, walking away from 12 years of equity.
They now live nearby in a house on an elevated foundation. Zimmerman, who calls herself an “unintentional flood activist,” has pressed public officials for stricter building rules and clearer flood-risk disclosures.
She says her experience is a “canary in a coal mine” for other low-lying coastal communities.
“Entire neighborhoods will have to move,” said Zimmerman, a college biology professor. “But the vulnerable among us, there will be no one there to help them, save them, and they will not be able to save themselves.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom will have to decide soon if renters can fight eviction if their Social Security checks are disrupted during President Trump’s second term


With the Trump administration again threatening mass firings of federal employees, Gov. Gavin Newsom must soon decide whether California landlords must accept Social Security benefit delays as an excuse not to evict tenants who fall behind on rent.
Earlier this month, the California Legislature passed Culver City Democratic Assemblymember Isaac Bryan’s Assembly Bill 246. The measure would give tenants legal protections in eviction proceedings if their Social Security benefits are “terminated, delayed, or reduced due to no fault of the tenant” and the federal problems caused them to miss rent.
Bryan introduced the bill this spring in the middle of the uproar over President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency campaign to slash the federal workforce and fears that Republicans would cut Social Security payments, which they ultimately didn’t do.
“It’s an assurance that if President Trump does come for our aunties and our granddads and our disabled brothers and sisters that California will be there to protect them and won’t let them slide into homelessness because their Social Security was cut off,” Bryan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July.
Newsom hasn’t indicated whether he’ll sign the measure. Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos declined to comment. He has until Oct. 13 to make a decision. 
Recent developments in Washington, D.C.could put fresh pressure on Newsom to sign the legislation. Trump’s top federal budget official, Russ Vought, sent a memo last week to the heads of federal agencies telling them to begin more mass firings of federal workers if the government shuts down because Congress can’t pass a spending bill. It’s not clear what Vought’s proposed cuts would mean for Social Security Administration staffing.
Democratic and Republican members of Congress are at an impasse on the government funding bill. Democrats are demanding Republicans restore billions of dollars of federal health care funding Republicans cut earlier this year. The federal government could shut down on Wednesday if they don’t reach an agreement.  Social Security payments haven’t been interrupted during previous government shutdowns. 
But the administration’s threat of more staffing cuts could pose a separate threat. 
This year, DOGE cut roughly 12% of the Social Security Administration workforce, contributing to backlogs at field offices around the country. Customer service problems at Social Security offices are still happening, The New York Times reported last week. 
What the bill means for California renters 
Roughly 6.5 million Californians receive Social Security benefits. It’s not clear how many of California’s estimated 17 million renters rely on the payments for rent. 
But older people eligible for Social Security benefits are an increasing share of renters. One rental market research company estimated that the number of seniors renting in the U.S. has climbed by 30% over the past decade, including a 31% increase in the Los Angeles area and a 24% spike in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The pending law would give renters in a court eviction proceeding the right to cite delays in Social Security payments to avoid being kicked out of their home or apartment. 
If a renter could prove the federal government was at fault for delaying benefits they use to pay rent, the court would be required to pause the eviction for up to six months. Within 14 days of the Social Security benefits being restored, a tenant would have to pay all past due rent or come up with “a mutually agreed upon payment plan” with their landlord. 
The pending law would be in effect until Jan. 20, 2029, the day Trump leaves office from his second term. 
Supporters include organizations advocating for the poor and disabled, such as California Council of the Blind and Disability Rights California.
“Due to recent actions by federal officials, including deep staffing cuts and office closures, any government program is at risk,” including Social Security, Eric Harris of Disability Rights California told lawmakers. 
The influential labor organizations Service Employees International Union and the California Teachers Association, which donate heavily to legislators, also support the bill. The two labor groups and their affiliate unions have donated at least $27.9 million to legislators since 2015, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.

Opponents included the California apartment and building industries’ associations and the California Chamber of Commerce. In total, those three groups have donated at least $13.6 million to legislators since 2015, according to Digital Democracy.
Republicans and some Democrats oppose
Debra Carlton of the California Apartment Association told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July that any delays in rent prevent “senior mom and pop landlords” from paying their mortgages on time.
Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican representing the Sacramento suburbs, shared those worries with his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. He also noted that “President Trump, both in his first term, as well as in this term, has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to touch Social Security.”
“If the president is good to his word, this bill will do absolutely nothing,” Bryan replied. “But … Californians can’t afford to trust this president. He’s shown several times early in this administration that he is not good to his word.”
No Republicans voted for the bill as it made its way through both chambers. Two Democrats also were apparently leery of it and voted against their colleague’s measure – a rarity in the California Legislature. As CalMatters has reported, Democrats vote “no” on average less than 1% of the time.
Norwalk Democratic Sen. Bob Archuleta cast the lone Democratic “no” vote for the measure on the Senate floor earlier this month. He didn’t explain his vote at the time, and a spokesperson didn’t return a message from CalMatters.
In the Assembly, Democratic member Anamarie Ávila Farías of Concord also joined Republicans in voting against it when it was before her chamber the final time.  
In an interview last week, Ávila Farías, a former trustee of the California Housing Finance Agency, said was worried about the bill’s “unintended consequences.” 
“There’s the flip side of individuals in the business of being property owners,” she said. “They also have struggles, too, when they are not able to meet their monthly obligations.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/062822-For-Rent-Housing-Sac-MG-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-29 09:58:51.010590

Social Security and Medicare benefits will keep flowing in a government shutdown, but federal employees will be working without pay and delays likely will occur across many services.


John Lauretig remembers the filthy bathrooms, the overflowing trash cans and the community of people who rallied to clean up Joshua Tree National Park the last time the U.S. Government shut down. 
For more than a month from December 2018 through January 2019, thousands of National Park Service employees were furloughed nationwide — but the Trump administration kept many national parks open.
Unsupervised, visitors drove through wilderness and historic sites, camped where they weren’t supposed to, and vandalized plants and buildings at parks across California. The trash — and the feces — piled up. In the days after the shutdown ended, park staff found at least 1,665 clumps of toilet paper littering Death Valley alone, where an estimated half-ton of human waste had been left outside the restrooms. 
“It was insane to leave the gates open and tell the staff not to show up in the park — for our public lands, and all of our special places in this country, to be unprotected,” said Lauretig, a retired law enforcement park ranger and president of the Friends of Joshua Tree nonprofit.
Now, facing the prospect of another imminent shutdown, conservation groups and retired park service employees including Lauretig are calling to keep the gates locked at national parks and historic landmarks. 
They’re among many Californians bracing for the shutdown, which is expected to begin Wednesday unless Democrats and Republicans can make a deal by 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday.   
As of now, the parties appear far apart, although President Donald Trump and congressional leaders are expected to meet today. Democratic leaders in Congress are demanding that Republicans reverse Medicaid cuts made in Trump’s signature tax and spending bill earlier this year and extend Biden-era subsidies used by a majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees. 
In response, the Trump administration has floated firing federal workers en masse if the shutdown occurs. 
“Democrats are hoping to use the one bit of leverage that they have left in Washington at this time to make it clear what they stand for,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego. “And the question is: Can they hold out against the political and policy pain that Donald Trump is hoping to impose by threatening more layoffs of government employees?”
The federal government shut down three times during the Obama and Trump presidencies. Each one presents a hardship for government employees, who are either furloughed or obliged to work without pay. 
About 150,000 federal employees work in California, not counting the military service members who also will go without pay during a shutdown.
In the past when facing possible federal shutdowns, the state had a contingency plan to try to avoid disruptions in certain services. In late 2023, it planned to pay one month’s worth of federal food assistance early to advance aid to families in the event of a shutdown.
But this year there’s no such commitment yet from the Department of Finance, as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration weighs the possibility of a lengthy shutdown. 
“There isn’t an open-ended long-term line of credit where the state’s general fund can be assumed to make up for any federal fund shortfall,” finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer said.
Here’s a look at what Californians can expect to happen if a shutdown occurs this week. 
Social Security and health care
Most Californians shouldn’t worry about a federal shutdown impacting their Social Security benefits or their health care access in the near term. 
About 6.5 million Californians receive benefits through the Social Security Administration and those checks are expected to continue going out during a shutdown. 
But, customer service could suffer depending on how many employees are told to stay home, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. 
That includes “benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards. The level of disruption will depend on how many (Social Security Administration) employees the Trump administration deems ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ during the shutdown,” Max Richtman, the organization’s president, said in a written statement. 
Medicaid and Medicare, which pay for health care for low-income individuals, people with disabilities and seniors, are mandatory programs that are exempt from the annual appropriations process.
Jan Emerson-Shea, spokesperson for the California Hospital Association, said “essential services” like insurance payments to hospitals and doctors will continue. 
Some discretionary programs, however, like food stamps and benefits for women, infants and children may be impacted by a shutdown.
One group that could be disproportionately affected by even a brief federal shutdown are native and indigenous populations. Many of the 723,000 American Indians living in California get health care at clinics that are funded through federal grants. The clinics are often small and may have very little reserves to weather a funding pause, said Nanette Star, policy director for the California Consortium for Urban Indian Health. 
“Even a short shutdown can mean staff furloughs, service cuts, patient service delays,” Star said. 
Airports and travel
You’ll be able to fly and take rides during a government shutdown, but you might experience more delays. 
That’s because air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents are among the government employees who would be expected to show up for work without getting paid. The longer a shutdown drags out, the more likely it is that the system will strain and workers will call in sick. 
The U.S. Travel Association, which advocates for the industry, released a statement last week that included a survey showing many people would cancel or postpone travel during a shutdown, which it argued would ripple through the economy. 
“A shutdown is a wholly preventable blow to America’s travel economy—costing $1 billion every week—and affecting millions of travelers and businesses while placing unnecessary strain on an already overextended federal travel workforce,” said Geoff Freeman, the organization’s president. 
Wildfires and disasters
A federal shutdown won’t ground firefighters, but could slow the money that pays for future disaster prep. 
Nick Schuler, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, said the agency does not expect a shutdown to affect its “ability to respond to and aggressively attack fires” and will continue to operate as normal. In past shutdowns, he said, U.S. Forest Service firefighters have still been available for emergency response and pointed to California’s “robust Master Mutual Aid System,” which ensures resources respond regardless of jurisdiction.

Still, he cautioned that what keeps engines running today might not pay for the prevention work of tomorrow: “Any disruption to grant funding that supports fire prevention and wildfire resiliency could have negative impacts,” he said.
Newsom’s office said the Federal Emergency Management Agency would keep “core life-saving operations” going during a shutdown but that payments to states would stall and recovery efforts would be put on hold. That means Californians could see first responders in action but face delays in reimbursement or recovery projects.
Other science agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey could face interruptions that affect California’s disaster readiness, the governor’s spokesperson said.
National parks
National parks supporters are worried that the Trump administration again would send home workers but leave open the gates. 
That’s “a recipe for even more disaster,” said Kate Groetzinger, communications manager at the Center for Western Priorities, an environmental advocacy group. “It will be worse this time than it was last time around, simply because the parks are already struggling.”
She was referring to federal staffing cuts the Trump administration carried out earlier this year. The National Parks Conservation Association estimates that the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since Trump’s second term began, and left thousands of seasonal positions unfilled. 
If a shutdown does occur, the association projects daily losses of $1 million in fee revenue for the parks, and $77 million for the gateway communities that surround them. 
Morale among National Park workers is bad already — and a shutdown would make it worse, said Bernadette Johnson, a former superintendent of Manzanar National Historic Site, where during World War II the U.S. Government incarcerated thousands of Japanese Americans. 
“The attack has just been so furious. And I think that federal employees are being demonized, as these lazy bureaucrats that we are not … It breaks my heart to watch,” Johnson said. “The people left behind are holding all of that work now, because the work didn’t go away.”
A spokesperson for the The National Park Service said the agency is reviewing and updating plans for a lapse in funding.
However a shutdown may play out, Lauretig over at Joshua Tree said he’s ready.

It would also provide legal and symbolic support to researchers who have been mostly fighting on their own.,"Guest Commentary written by

Blake Emerson
Blake Emerson is a law professor at UCLA.


The Trump administration’s assault on American higher education has recently been fixated on UCLA, where I teach administrative law and executive power. 
The White House has moved to cut off $584 million in federal funds for the university’s supposed failure to prevent antisemitism on its campus. It has demanded a penalty of almost $1.2 billion dollars, insisted that the university not admit “anti-Western” students, publicly disavow recognition of the transgender community, and end gender-affirming care at the university’s hospitals.
This a moment to stand up and fight. The University of California Regents must challenge the Trump administration in federal court. At the same time, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state legislature must provide the UC system with the financial support it needs to stand for the rule of law and academic freedom.
The university has the law on its side. My colleagues and I drafted an open letter to the UC Regents explaining why the funding terminations were unlawful. Over 170 professors at UC law schools have signed it. The Trump administration has ignored the clear procedural requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 — such as the requirement that it provide for a hearing before an impartial decisionmaker before terminating funds, report to Congress and offer substantial evidence for its charges.
Last week, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating UCLA’s funds. However, the Supreme Court has created jurisdictional doubts about this and other lawsuits, suggesting that some claims may need to proceed in the obscure federal Court of Claims. 
A suit by the regents in the Court of Claims would help to fill any gaps created by the Supreme Court’s unclear and evolving jurisprudence. It would also provide legal and symbolic support to researchers who have so far been fighting the university’s legal battle on their own.
These days the law is not always enough. Since the government has failed to provide due process, universities reasonably fear that failure to comply will only bring on more deadly funding cut-offs, and perhaps other forms punishment, such as loss of nonprofit status.
Given this climate of fear, the university and the state will need to partner to challenge the government’s illegal persecution. Newsom has already urged the regents to fight back against the Trump administration, asking, “How could you possibly accept this fine. Fine for what?” 
He’s right. But the university receives over $17 billion a year in federal funding, including $5.7 billion for research and program support. It would struggle to survive, much less maintain its status as a world-class research and educational institution, if all of those funds were withdrawn. 
Newsom and the state can help. Democratic lawmakers in California have proposed a ballot measure that would provide for $23 billion in funding for state grants for research. The proposal would leverage California’s unparalleled economic strength to check the Trump administration’s lawlessness. 
Faculty, staff and students know that we will bare serious burdens in a protracted legal battle with the Trump administration. But we cannot do it alone. We need the support of our state and of our fellow Californians.
California holds a unique place in the American mind — above and beyond the output of Hollywood. America would not be the same without that western boundary, where the endless and often destructive quest for imperial expansion once reached its limit.

This latest evidence of the opioid epidemic’s ongoing impact in New Mexico comes as the state ranks poorly on transparency in disclosing how it will use more than $850 million in opioid settlement funds, according to a OpioidSettlementTracker.com, a clearinghouse and accountability tracker for opioid settlement information created in 2019 by public health advocate and attorney Christine Minhee.

According to New Mexico state law, settlement funds must be primarily used to address the damage the drugs have done and to prevent future harms. But agreements the state made in the settlements do not require public reporting on how the money is spent or public input in spending decisions. According to the Opioid Settlement Tracker, New Mexico stands among a minority of states that earned a “0%” on its Expenditure Report Tracker, indicating the state has not committed to any public reporting of settlement fund spending. The data is based on research that included calls to the state and ongoing investigations of publicly available documents related to the settlements.
The Tracker notes that settlement fund spending is subject to examination by the New Mexico State Auditor’s office, but that the results of those audits are not made public.

By comparison, Colorado makes 100% of its opioid fund spending public through its Colorado Opioid Settlement Dashboard. Arizona likewise posts its state settlement allocations online. Wyoming, California, Georgia, Iowa, Wisconsin and several other states have committed to making at least some state opioid spending public.  
Patrick M. Brenner, president of nonprofit think tank Southwest Public Policy Institute, pointed to the importance of public understanding of the settlement funds’ purpose in creating an environment of accountability. 
“The state has not done a decent enough job of educating the public about the success story of holding these pharmaceutical companies accountable,” he said, “so not as many people know to ask questions.”
The opioid settlements, which total more than $50 billion nationally, rank historically among the country’s highest-dollar public health settlements. Because states must use the settlement money for opioid remediation, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health calls the settlements “an unprecedented opportunity” to address the decades-long opioid epidemic. States are receiving funds over 20 years from corporations including Johnson & Johnson, CVS and Walmart for their roles in creating, exacerbating and perpetuating the epidemic. 











“The state has not done a decent enough job of educating the public about the success story of holding these pharmaceutical companies accountable, so not as many people know to ask questions.”

New Mexico has been especially hard hit by the opioid crisis. In 2023, the most recent data available, the state had the seventh highest overdose rate in the U.S. While overdoses overall in the state have been declining since 2021, a recent state legislative analysis notes lack of evidence “that use of fentanyl or other opioids has also decreased.” Rather, the decline is attributable to increased use of harm-reduction medication such as Narcan to counter overdoses.
In 2023, Santa Fe County Community Services Department rolled out a public awareness campaign related to fentanyl that included “Never Use Alone” messaging. The New Mexico Health Department recently reported a surge of overdoses in Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Taos counties, possibly linked to increased amounts of fentanyl in the supply in the three counties.
“I’ve had a lot of conversations with people who just felt so blindsided [by opioid addiction]. They didn’t see it coming,” said Claire Carmony, a social worker and program manager with the New Mexico Crisis and Access Line, which receives nearly 40 calls and texts a day from people across the state seeking help with addiction. “We get a lot of calls from concerned family members, loved ones, friends and community members that are impacted,” she said. “So opioid use disorder really has a big impact on our community as a whole, and people really struggle.” 
Accountability
New Mexico’s management of opioid funds has been called into question before. A brief published last year by the state’s Legislative Finance Committee called attention to contingent-fee legal contracts that wiped out nearly $250 million from awards the state won against pharmacies. The brief also pointed out the relatively short period the state has to pay those fees. 
“The lawyers received their money a lot faster than the state or local governments will ever get their money in,” Felix Chavez, a financial analyst and former LFC staff member who worked on the brief, told Source NM. “If [New Mexico] were to have the same payout structure that these attorneys did, a lot more could be done” to mitigate the crisis, he said. 
The LFC brief followed a 2023 opinion by the New Mexico State Ethics Commission after the Walgreens judgement, from which lawyers were paid $159 million of the state’s $500 million award. The SEC wrote that “several public bodies” were illegally sidestepping the state’s procurement code in making deals with outside law firms. In a 2023 statement, New Mexico Department of Justice Chief of Staff Lauren Rodriguez said the Walgreens legal agreements “contained no limit on fees.” She added that Attorney General Raúl Torrez had “instituted a new policy that sets strict limits on contingency fee cases,” though she did not provide further details about what those limits were. She also noted that even with lawyers’ fees, “New Mexico ranks third nationally compared to other states’ total settlements (including their attorney’s fees).”
Brenner said that while the state is required to spend the settlement money on addiction prevention and treatment, safeguards to ensure that happens are lacking. 
“Even if people are well-intentioned in handling these funds, they’ve got this relatively large infusion of money,” making accountability loopholes risky, he said. 
This summer, another LFC report showed that state programs for medication-assisted treatment, or MAT, which are funded by opioid settlement money, were underused and lacked outcome data. MAT, in which people with opioid and other substance use disorders are treated with medication, is among the most effective ways to treat addiction. 
Making a dent

Accountability notwithstanding, Josh Swatek, policy and performance director with the New Mexico Department of Health, calls the settlement funds “a game-changer.” He told Source NM that the funds allow for systemic advances in addiction prevention and treatment, including medications for incarcerated people; education in schools; harm reduction resources; and behavioral health services.
“Without the settlement funds we would have a much smaller scope,” Swatek said. “We wouldn’t have the link to harm reduction, and we would have less staff.” 
Brenner pointed out that despite the state’s failure to safeguard accountability in spending, cities and counties have worked to ensure the money is allocated properly. 
At a September meeting of the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee, Dona Ana County Health and Human Services Director Jamie Michael told legislators funds were being used for prevention and treatment, including ensuring availability of MAT in doctors’ offices and purchasing Narcan for first responders, state health offices and emergency departments to have on hand. She noted that in just the past month, four people had overdosed in the county, two of them fatally. “This seems like a lot of money over a long period of time,” she told lawmakers. “With all the needs, it’s not necessarily a lot of money.” 
Last year, Bernalillo County and the City of Albuquerque teamed up with global health nonprofit Vital Strategies to create a strategic plan for dealing with the crisis, which includes bringing prevention education to middle school students. “People are dying from drug overdoses,” said Dr. Wayne Lindstrom, Bernalillo County’s deputy manager of behavioral health, who echoed Michael’s emphasis on harm reduction to save lives. “How many deaths is too many?”

Like Michael, Lindstrom emphasized how important it is to be “laser focused” when allocating settlement funds. “People hear about these large sums of money and they get the perception that this is really a significant investment,” Lindstrom said. “Bottom line is that $2.2 million is not going to make a significant difference relative to the scale and scope of the problem overall,” he said. 
With the Trump administration’s Medicaid cuts, poor transparency could make opioid funds vulnerable to diversion to other uses, said Brenner. Even if the state is well intentioned, “the absolute top level right thing is to make sure that these monies are only spent on what they are meant for—not plugging Medicaid budgets.”
Nationally, the final chapter in the opioid lawsuits is underway. In June, states across the U.S., including New Mexico, agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family.
The Purdue settlement will likely infuse the state with additional resources for prevention, treatment and recovery. Rodgriguez declined to comment on New Mexico’s likely share, but states with similar populations like Nevada and West Virginia have announced expected funds in excess of $50 million over 15 years. The funds’ impact remains to be seen. “We never seem to have the resources that approach equivalency relative to the extent of the problem,” Lindstrom said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/douglassachagettyopioid-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)To mark “10 years of impact,” the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute has issued a report highlighting key research on a wide range of Utah issues over the last decade. 
The report commemorates the 10-year anniversary since the institute’s doors first opened in September 2015. 
The man that the institute was named after — prominent business man and community leader Kem Gardner — said these words 10 years ago at an event celebrating its launch:
“I believe firmly that this policy institute can make life better for our state and for our children,” the Deseret News reported at the time.

From data on the COVID-19 pandemic, to research on housing affordability and the shrinking Great Salt Lake, Kem C. Gardner researchers have “emerged as Utah’s premier source for economic, demographic, and public policy research that guides community leaders and helps policy makers” make informed decisions, the institute said in a news release announcing the report Thursday. 
“Over the last 10 years, the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute has proven to be indispensable to achieving the University of Utah’s goal of creating positive impact,” University of Utah President Taylor Randall said. “The Institute provides trusted data, rigorous analysis, and forums for sharing ideas, contributing significantly to our mission of generating unsurpassed societal impact.”
The 10-year report includes key findings on some of the biggest issues that Utah has — and continues — to face. They include: 

Data and analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic
Long-term economic and demographic projections informing the state’s population growth and resulting changes.
Challenges with housing affordability and how Utah compares to other states.
Economic impacts of the 2034 Olympics and how Utah must prepare.
Research on the adverse effects of the shrinking Great Salt Lake and data to inform water management decisions.

While it highlights past research, the report also looks ahead. It lists seven reasons — what researchers described as the “magnificent seven” — that make up a “constellation of economic achievements that sets it apart from the rest of the nation.” 
Those include, according to the report, economic diversity, high household income and low poverty, high upward mobility opportunities, a “relatively equal distribution of income,” a well-trained and educated workforce, a fast-growing and young population, and high levels of social capital and strong community bonds. 
Researchers, however, also listed what they called “Utah’s troubling seven,” or challenges that could spell trouble if they go unaddressed. 
They included: 

Housing affordability and homelessness: “Utah’s housing market has become increasingly unaffordable, leading to a rise in homelessness and limiting access to homeownership for many,” researchers wrote. With a median sales price of a single-family home hitting more than $548,000 in the fourth quarter of 2024, Utah ranked as the ninth most expensive housing market in the U.S., according to the report.


Traffic congestion: The state’s growing population has “strained Utah’s transportation infrastructure,” the report says, “resulting in significant traffic congestion and reduced quality of life.” 


Public education: A “concerning number” of Utah third graders are not proficient in reading, researchers wrote, with only 46.7% of Utah third graders scoring proficiently on the RISE test, a state-mandated standardized test. 
Higher education: Compared to other states, Utah’s college and university enrollment and graduation rates lag behind other states, “limiting the potential of its workforce and economy,” the report says. 





Great Salt Lake: The lake’s declining water levels continue to “pose significant environmental, economic and health risks to the state,” researchers warned. 


Energy supply: Due to growing energy demand, constraints on supply and the need to transition to cleaner energy sources, Utah “faces potential energy deficits,” the report says.
Behavioral health: Like the rest of the nation, Utah is seeing a “growing behavioral health crisis, requiring a greater access to mental health and substance abuse services,” researchers wrote. 

To address those issues, researchers also listed the “starting seven,” or ideas to “serve as a conservation starter for a statewide dialogue” on the state’s biggest challenges. 

For housing affordability, they recommended the creation of a “statewide community land trust.” 
For traffic congestion, they urged prioritization of “connected autonomous vehicles.” 
To increase third grade reading proficiency, they encouraged education leaders to “place a reading pro in K-3 classrooms.” 
To improve higher education graduation rates, they recommended the expansion of “catalyst centers” into Salt Lake City. 
For the Great Salt Lake, they recommended the conservation of 250 kilometer acre feet (KAF) to 500 KAF each year. The KAF measurement refers to a thousand acre-foot, or a unit of volume representing 1,000 acre-feet of water. It’s commonly used to measure water in reservoirs, rivers or snow pack. 
For energy, they encouraged investment in the state energy research fund. 
For behavioral health, they said to “align behavioral health efforts and investments with Utah’s strategic plan.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Sentencing Commission said Friday that Alabama’s already overcrowded prisons could see inmate populations rise by nearly a third by 2030 due to new punitive laws passed by the Legislature.
The commission, working with Applied Research Services, a research firm that studies criminal justice, estimated the population in custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections could grow from 21,753 to between 24,000 and 28,000 inmates, depending on the number of people that the ADOC admits each month on average.
Those numbers, if reached, would come near or exceed DOC’s record inmate population, set 16 years ago. They would also further strain the state’s General Fund; the state’s prisons have taken up an ever-larger share of the budget over the past two decades.

“The system, even before all the changes that happened, was already trending up,” said Bennet Wright, executive director of the Alabama Sentencing Commission, on Friday. “All the things that I discussed, and that is not to say they are good or bad, but they are going to adjust the track up more.”
Wright said the projections factor  several changes implemented by the Alabama Legislature, from increasing the number of judges assigned to oversee cases to changes in statute related to split sentences, to a law passed in 2023 that further restricted the use of good behavior to reduce incarceration time.
Wright and the researchers said there are some uncertainties that are embedded within the simulations.
The long overcrowding crisis
Alabama has struggled with prison overcrowding for decades, and the crisis has been a major contributor to violence in correctional facilities. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state in 2020, saying the conditions in men’s prisons violated inmates’ Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment.
The state’s prison population fell after 2015 after the Legislature approved a series of sentencing reforms, dropping from about 26,300 in 2013 to 20,200 in 2018. It fell still further during the COVID outbreak in 2020, when Corrections temporarily barred the admission of new prisoners. The population was about 18,300 in 2021. Since then, the number of people in ADOC has steadily increased, going to 20,500 in 2022, 21,000 in 2024, and is currently at 21,753 for the year.
But the simulations run by the commission projected that the population would increase.
Even the lowest figure generated by the simulation estimates the population of people in custody of ADOC in 2030 would increase by 31% from a 2021 baseline of 18,300. The highest projected population, 28,000, by the end of the decade means that the prison would increase by more than 50% from the baseline.
Many of the estimates from the simulations predicted the prison population to be higher than the 26,500 in 2009, the highest number of people ever incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons.
Multiple estimates
The Sentencing Commission provided people who attended the presentation with multiple estimates instead of a single measure incorporating all the factors because of the uncertainty inherent in the model. One element that was not incorporated into the simulations to provide the estimate was the average number of people admitted into ADOC each month.
“The idea about the number of people coming in the front door has to be an independent determination,” Wright said.
One reason is that the number can fluctuate dramatically. The rate was more than 800 in 2018, but it is currently about 450.
“I know what you are thinking,” Wright said. “Well Bennet, look to the past. Well, that is the past, what part of the past do you want me to use?”
The composition of the ADOC admissions could also change depending on the laws enacted by the Legislature. When lawmakers enacted into law a rule that made the sentencing guidelines presumptive, fewer judges sent people to prison.
So instead of incorporating the admission rates for ADOC into the model, researchers calculated a population estimate by assuming a given rate for the number of people admitted into ADOC custody.
The lower estimate of 24,000 assumed that about 400 people were admitted into ADOC custody each month. The higher estimate of 28,000 assumed that 500 people were admitted into ADOC custody each month.
Contributing factors
Wright highlighted several changes that were factored into the model. One was that the Legislature increased funding to provide the judicial system with more judges, allowing more cases to be processed, which potentially adds to the number of people sentenced to prison.
Another factor is changes to statute enacted by the Legislature for split sentences. In the past, most cases in the criminal justice system required judges to apply split sentences once defendants were convicted.
“You either had to get probation or a split sentence,” Wright changed. “So now, everything is back on the table.”
The split sentence law was also changed.
“So even if someone is split, the split sentence law is amended to allow for longer sentences on splits,” Wright said.
The Legislature in 2023 reduced the amount of credit people in prison could receive on their prison sentences for good behavior. Prior to passing the law, people classified in the second tier could receive up to 40 days of credit for every 30 days served. SB 1, sponsored by April Weaver, R-Brierfield, reduced it to 15 days for every 30 days served.
“They reduced general good time and they reduced access to maximum good time as well,” Wright said.
Along with that, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles updated the guidelines they used to determine whether to grant an applicant parole.
All those changes factor into the prison population. Wright and researchers provided two numbers for every rate that people are admitted into ADOC custody. Wright said the three factors that drive the trend between the high estimate, and the low estimate are the percentage of people who will receive a split sentence, the parole rate, the number of people in prison who will be subject to the updated correctional incentive time laws versus the previous set of rules.
“With a high percentage of splits, high parole and a higher percentage of people coming in on good time, you would expect a prison population in five years of about 24,000,” Wright said.
The complement of that, with low numbers on split sentences, parole and good time allocation, that figure increases to about 26,000 if ADOC admits an average monthly rate of 400 people into the prisons.
“Look at what we historically do in Alabama,” Wright said. “Policy-wise, we do not have sustainable, slow growth, or slow decline. We typically have very accelerated growth, or very accelerated decline.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Flag-2019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

NapierAt the University of Michigan, seven more charges were handed down last week against pro-Palestine students and alumni.
These latest disciplinary charges represent a decision by University of Michigan (UM) leadership to double-down on its strategy of seeking to repress campus pro-Palestine activism. Beginning in November 2023, when former University President Santa Ono called in police from multiple jurisdictions to barricade his office building against students seeking to meet with him, the University has sought to repress students calling for divestment from Israel rather than engaging with them. 
This strategy of muscle over mediation was on full display in May 2024 during the forceful early morning police clearing of UM’s Gaza Solidarity Encampment, when students were sprayed with chemical irritants and their tents were ploughed by heavy machinery. In addition to being dragged through University disciplinary proceedings, student activists have been surveilled, banned from entering classroom buildings, followed off campus, and smeared in various all-university communications. 
University of Michigan denounced for using private investigators to surveil student protesters

Most recently, the art exhibit organized by pro-Palestine UM student activists as part of a weeklong “Freedom School” was kicked off of University grounds by the University’s Division of Public Safety and Security.  
Revealingly, some of those charged in recent months through the University of Michigan’s Office of Student Conflict Resolution (OSCR) and the new Office of Student Accountability (OSA) are members of the Encampment 11. These UM students and alumni successfully defeated Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s political charges in May, but they are now facing disciplinary probation, suspension, and re-enrollment bans for actions that Nessel declined to prosecute. These actions by University of Michigan leadership not only chill expressions of dissent on campus, but discourage the moral conviction to call out a genocide that is unfolding before the entire world.

Yet even as the University sinks to new lows in its repression of pro-Palestine student activism, resistance is spreading on campus in subtle yet new and important ways. 
Just last week, on September 19, University of Michigan faculty, staff, students, alumni, parents, and community members organized a vigil to honor the lives of Palestinian health workers. Standing across from the University’s Central Campus, vigil participants read the names, ages, and occupations of over 1,200 Palestinian health workers killed during the genocide in Gaza. Those reading names during the 4-hour vigil included a renowned poet and literary journal editor, a children’s book author, a senior faculty member in computer science and engineering, and the director of a local arts institution, among others. 
Standing with the readers were faculty and staff who are active in a variety of campus labor unions and in faculty government. Representatives of local faith communities joined in solidarity with multi-religious prayer offerings.  
And this spirit of resistance – against institutional efforts to direct public attention away from the genocide in Gaza – expanded and gained momentum on the University’s Ann Arbor campus over the weekend of September 20 and 21, when Doctors Against Genocide (DAG) convened its Second Annual Conference at the University of Michigan Medical School. 
Throughout the two days of conference sessions, several hundred participating doctors and medical students explored strategies for anti-genocide awareness raising within medical institutions, discussed their own experiences of practicing medicine under conditions of genocide, and heard the live-streamed testimony of doctors providing medical care in Gaza amidst the massive Israeli military assault now underway. 
Participants and visitors entering the lobby of the Biomedical Sciences Research Building encountered a massive three-dimensional model that visualized the destruction of all aspects of civilian life in Gaza. And alongside this cartography of genocide stood a wall of posters prepared by medical students that detailed the timeline of attacks on Gaza’s shelters, hospitals, universities, schools, cemeteries, archaeological sites, mosques and churches, fields and orchards, greenhouses, water wells, bakeries, and aid distribution sites.

A key message of the conference was that the systematic destruction of Gaza’s healthcare sector has critical consequences for the population and is itself an instrument of genocide.
Medical doctors are generally not known for being overtly political. But Doctors Against Genocide has been on the forefront of raising public awareness about genocides in Palestine, Sudan, Congo, Tigray, and elsewhere. For two days, UM’s medical campus was invigorated by the presence of physicians wearing white coats with DAG’s red logo printed across the back, who had come together to share best practices in medical care and public advocacy for those suffering the catastrophic health consequences of the ongoing genocide in Gaza.
Equally significant is the fact that organizers of the vigil and organizers of the DAG conference worked together to plan their events. Medical faculty and medical students participated in the Friday evening vigil. Likewise, UM faculty and students from outside the Medical School participated in the DAG conference that took place over the days that followed.

This intentional effort to bridge the divide between the medical side of the University and the traditional faculties of literature, arts, sciences, as well as other professional schools is important, because it builds on the critical vote by the UM Faculty Senate in May 2023 to unite faculty governance across campuses, including the Medical campus, where Michigan Medicine employs a large share of clinical professors.
With the already-urgent situation in Gaza worsening and a U.N. Commission confirming that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians, UM faculty are coming together in an effort to remind the entire University of Michigan community, including its top-tier hospital and Medical School, that we must act with intention and with courage before there are no more Palestinians in Gaza to protect. 
This is not to suggest that UM faculty in the past have been silent. Over the past two years, UM faculty and staff have found various ways to criticize the University’s heavy-handed efforts to silence pro-Palestine student activists’ calls for university divestment. 
For example, the University’s proposed “Disruptive Activities Policy” was widely condemned by faculty in March 2024, who criticized it for targeting student activism and curtailing First Amendment rights. The following semester, more than 1,300 faculty voted in November 2024 to pass a Faculty Senate motion censuring the University of Michigan Regents and calling on them to “cease the use of surveillance, policing, physical violence, and legal power as mechanisms to silence speech.” 
Over the past two years, the UM Ann Arbor Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has repeatedly issued statements critical of the University’s actions to curtail pro-Palestine student activism on campus. Moreover, as State Attorney General Nessel’s office moved forward with prosecuting student activists, faculty and staff participated individually in court support. And University of Michigan Faculty & Staff for Justice in Palestine (FSJP) was established with the explicit aim of providing support to pro-Palestine student activists facing repression.

Yet at the beginning of this academic year, something different is happening. The jointly organized vigil and DAG conference indicate a growing awareness among UM faculty that their role need not be confined to supporting students. Indeed, UM scholars and clinicians alike are coming to understand that they have their own role to play beyond supporting students. Faculty feel empowered in a new way to channel their own skills and training towards the task of calling out the University’s silence – and thus its complicity – concerning the ongoing genocide in Gaza. 
This represents a new approach for faculty in terms of how they understand their roles, both professionally and as citizens, in relation to the genocide in Gaza. It suggests that the sort of faculty-led resistance that took place earlier this year in leading opposition to the closure of the University’s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion might be spreading into new areas. In both of these examples, faculty mobilized around their vision of what the University’s mission entails, regardless of what central administration asserts it to be. 
Prayers and a solemn reading of names may not be what people initially think of as resistance. However, at a time when violence and repression seem to be worsening, and even the mention of Palestine or genocide draws ire, creating the discursive space on campus to collectively bear witness to the sacrifice of doctors saving Palestinian lives is momentous. In the present moment of unprecedented attacks on higher education, insisting on a set of values for the university community to uphold and then putting those values into practice is at its core an act of resistance. We need more of this kind of resistance.

The Legislature approved funding for reading coaches in schools. They established summer camps for students who need to get their reading scores up.
Granted, they also threaten to hold children back if they don’t hit key benchmarks by third grade. Making reading resources available should be enough. But still, the investments have shown enough promise that state education officials want to extend them to older students.

As someone whose paycheck depends on widespread reading, I approve this.
But I’m not sure the people overseeing Alabama’s libraries like it very much. And I think it’s because they’re frightened of literacy.
Literacy is much more than the ability to read. Literacy is what results from repeatedly exercising that skill with a wide range of books. Learning. Empathy. A broader understanding of the world and the people in it.
The Alabama Public Library Service Board does not seem to like that.
I can’t think of another explanation for why the state board keeps dragging members of Fairhope Public Library’s governing board to Montgomery. A handful of belligerent cranks are wasting the library’s time whining about books, mostly those with LGBTQ+ characters in them.
The Alabama Public Library Service considers this a priority.
Board member Amy Minton, who also happens to be running as a Republican state Senate candidate, introduced a resolution over the summer to classify as inappropriate “any material that promotes, engages, or positively depicts transgender procedures, gender ideology, or the concept of more than two biological genders.”
Quick aside: Gender-affirming care leads to better lives for people with gender dysphoria. I’m putting that here in case the state board prevents you from reading it in a library.
But zealots don’t want to have a reasoned discussion about care options and outcomes. They want fear and silence.
Gender ideology is so important that library board members earlier this month decided they would personally review the handful of outstanding complaints about books on Fairhope’s library shelves.
Which brings us to “gender ideology.” And this question: What the heck is “gender ideology?”
Is it affirming the dignity of transgender people? Acknowledging their existence?
Is it showing curiosity about the nature of gender — how much is innate and how much is societal?
Or is it the understanding that people of all genders are inherently equal and deserving of equal opportunities to live their lives as they see fit?
It could be one of those things. It could be all of those things. The Alabama Public Library Service, in constant terror of ambush by fictional LGBTQ+ characters, gets to decide.
And forgive me if I expect the worst possible outcome from that.
Remember that book-banning advocates started in Prattville by conflating books acknowledging the existence of transgender people with sexually explicit material. That was patently false. But it gave Alabama politicians leashed to the far-right the chance to pretend there was a problem where none existed.
And once they got that inch, they went for the mile. Librarians, of all people, must now carry out their duties knowing they could be served up as fuel for the far-right outrage machine.
To its credit, Fairhope fought back. When the board cut the library’s funding, private donors stepped up to support it. City leaders have expressed support for their library. Fairhope voters largely rejected a slate of pro-censorship city council candidates last month.
I hope the rest of the state is paying attention. Fairhope’s fight is a fight for dignity, curiosity and common decency. Three values that the Alabama Public Library Service and many state leaders appear to consider dangerous and illegitimate.
It’s a fight for actual literacy.
Not just the ability to read basic words, take orders and pass a test. But the process of consuming and processing rational ideas. Of encountering new ways of seeing the world and one another.
Some of the hardest work we do is understanding another person. It’s almost impossible without the narratives that books provide. Without broad access to those stories, society becomes static. Hidebound. Hateful.
And sure, teachers need resources to teach kids to read. But we all need libraries where trained professionals can stock diverse, rational and challenging books. Once you start tying their hands, you give Alabamians a limited, counterfeit version of reality.
It’s like restricting a musician to performances in C major. Or ordering a painter to use a single color palette. Or requiring football teams to run just three plays. You’re cutting off a world of possibility.
That’s what our state library board is trying to do. Make sure that children growing into reading get a stunted and deeply prejudiced view of the world. Where the only aspirations are conformity and obedience.
And that’s the opposite of literacy.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250918_141510-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-29 08:57:11.086397

Falls are the leading cause of death for Americans 65 years of age and older, and are responsible for more than 30,000 deaths a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The Nevada Health Care Association represents assisted living and skilled nursing facilities. It did not respond to requests for comment on the report’s findings.
Nationally, 43% of nursing home falls involving Medicare patients are not being reported, according to the report. In Nevada, 60% of nursing home falls were not reported. The rates for failure to report ranged from a low of 21% in South Dakota to a high of 64% in Washington, DC., followed by California with 61%. 
The data, which is supposed to be provided to the government by nursing homes, is used for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Care Compare website, which is intended to provide consumers with quality of care information. 
Failing to report “leads to inaccurate fall rates on Care Compare,” the report says. Facilities with the lowest fall rates on the government website were the least likely to report, suggesting that “low fall rates for nursing homes on Care Compare are likely driven by nursing homes’ failure to report falls, rather than an actual low incidence of falls.”
A large, nonprofit nursing home with more than 200 beds in New York had a 5-star overall rating on Care Compare, the highest possible, and reported three falls with major injuries that required hospitalization. The Office of Inspector General, which wrote the report, found the nursing home had 13 falls.
“Providers may have a disincentive to report events, such as falls, that could result in lower scores on quality measures,” says the report. “Previous analyses by OIG and others have identified under-reporting by providers.”
The report is based on data from falls reported to have occurred between July 2022 and June 2023. The OIG found: 

For-profit, chain nursing homes, and larger facilities failed to report falls most often;
Nursing homes failed more often to report falls of younger residents, male residents, short-stay residents, and residents with only Medicare coverage; 
Reporting of falls was worse in “nonrural” nursing homes; 
Most falls involved the oldest residents, and the percentage of unreported falls (38%) was lowest among those 85 years and older;
The percentage of unreported falls was highest (55%) among those younger than 65 years, who qualified for Medicare because of disability or end-stage kidney disease.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/long-term-care-getty-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

Here's a look at how candidates are chosen and how challengers qualify for a primary.","Connecticut’s Democratic primary election in 2026 could become uncharacteristically competitive, with several well-known incumbents drawing potential challengers for their seats. 
Gov. Ned Lamont, who is expected to launch his run for a third term as Connecticut’s chief executive, watched this summer as Josh Elliott, a progressive Democratic legislator, announced plans to primary him.
Meanwhile, more than four Democrats — including former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest — have announced plans to try to unseat U.S. Rep. John Larson, who has represented Connecticut’s 1st Congressional District for nearly three decades.
Many of the would-be challengers are already honing their messages and raising money in preparation for what could become bruising political battles. 
But just because someone announces a campaign on social media doesn’t mean they will be in contention during the primary next August. 
In Connecticut, political candidates — especially those challenging sitting incumbents — need to clear several hurdles just to have their name listed on the ballot.
Here is a look at how parties choose their candidates and the steps challengers need to take to qualify for a primary. 
How do candidates make it onto a primary ballot in Connecticut? 
There are several ways for statewide or congressional candidates from a major party to make it onto a primary ballot in Connecticut.
The two easiest paths run through the political party conventions, which are gatherings of top Democratic or Republican officials.
Anyone seeking a statewide office or a congressional seat will have their name added to the primary ballot if they receive enough support from the convention delegates, who get to vote on which candidates the party should endorse.
The person who wins the party endorsement automatically gets onto the ballot.
But Connecticut’s election laws specify that any candidate who also receives at least 15% of the votes during a round of balloting at the convention will automatically qualify for the primary. That means challengers can make it onto the ballot even if they don’t receive the party’s stamp of approval.
For those who don’t get a spot on the ballot at the conventions, the third way to throw their name into contention is to petition their way into the race by collecting enough signatures from eligible voters to qualify for a primary race. 
When are the conventions and who are the delegates?
The statewide party conventions in Connecticut, where delegates vote to endorse candidates for governor and other statewide offices, are held in the spring ahead of the party primaries in August. 
The same is true for the congressional conventions, which are separate events where party delegates from each of the five congressional districts in Connecticut choose who will serve as the party-endorsed candidates in primaries for the U.S. House.
The delegates at those conventions are made up of Democratic and Republican party members from each of Connecticut’s 169 towns and cities, and it is largely up to the local Democratic and Republican town committees and the local party chairs to determine who those delegates are.
The delegate selection process is one of the reasons that critics argue the system is set up to benefit party insiders and tamp down political upstarts. 
If you succeed at the convention, you can begin to campaign instead of spending money and time collecting signatures.
What happens if candidates fall short at the convention? 
If a political candidate can’t rally enough support from the party insiders at the convention, there is another way to keep their campaign alive. But the road to the primary gets a lot harder for those people.
That’s because candidates who are snubbed at the convention need to gather thousands of signatures from voters who are registered with their political party. 
Connecticut law requires candidates for governor and congress to obtain signatures from at least 2% of registered party members in the state or in their congressional districts in order to qualify for the ballot. 
In a Democratic primary for the 1st Congressional District, for instance, that threshold would currently require candidates to collect roughly 3,700 signatures. And in a Democratic gubernatorial race, it would obligate a petitioning candidate to secure roughly 15,800 signatures from registered voters, based on current voter registration numbers. 
The bigger hurdle, however, is the timing of those signature drives. The law specifies that petitioning candidates have just 42 days to pound the pavement and collect all of the necessary signatures.
What does a petitioning candidate need to do?
Plenty of candidates have shown that it is possible to run a successful primary campaign without the support of their party’s delegates.
Bob Stefanowski, for instance, gathered more than 9,000 signatures from Connecticut Republicans in 2018 in order to qualify for a crowded gubernatorial primary that year. 
Today, the 42-day window would require a potential Democratic gubernatorial challenger to collect more than 370 signatures per day from registered Democrats, based on current voter registration numbers.
State law requires those signatures to be collected in-person by people who are registered in Connecticut with the correct political party.
And when the signature drives are done, the petitions need to be notarized and turned over to the registrars of voters in multiple towns for each signature to be verified.
That means that some signatures can be tossed if the people who signed the petitions are not properly registered with the party, or if there are duplicate signatures. 
All of that sets up a hectic month-and-a-half-long race for petitioning candidates to earn their spot on the primary ballot.
What are the arguments for and against the ballot access laws? 
Supporters of Connecticut’s ballot access laws argue that the current rules enable the two major political parties to vet the candidates who are going to be running for office under their banner. The rules also ensure that anyone who makes it onto the ballot has a least a nominal level of support from party members.
Critics of the system, however, argue the state’s laws only serve to empower party insiders and to protect incumbent politicians from potential challengers.
Each state has their own unique requirements that specify how candidates can place their names onto primary ballots. Many states, for instance, allow people to make it onto the primary ballot simply by paying a filing fee. 
Opponents of the system in Connecticut have argued repeatedly that the state’s rules for ballot access are some of the most restrictive in the country.
Muad Hrezi, who attempted to challenge Larson in a 2022 primary for the 1st Congressional District, made that very argument in state court after he failed to gather enough signatures to advance his campaign that year. 
A state superior court judge overseeing that case, however, rejected the argument that the state’s laws were overly burdensome and unconstitutional. And the judge noted that a Republican candidate in the state’s 4th Congressional District that year was able to collect enough signatures to petition their way onto the ballot. 
To be sure, the state’s laws on ballot access have become slightly easier for challengers to meet due to legislative changes and court rulings in past decades.
Even so, no one has ever qualified for a primary in Connecticut against a sitting member of the U.S. House.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Pelto-petitions.jpg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The two candidates vying to become New Jersey’s next governor have insisted transparency would be a guiding value in their governing, with Democrat Mikie Sherrill unveiling a “transparency agenda” earlier this month and Republican Jack Ciattarelli bragging in speeches and on social media about how transparent he is.
But criminal justice reformers fear both candidates could slash public reporting on law enforcement, making policing in New Jersey less transparent just as the federal government increasingly expands its policing authority in states and cities.
Jason Williams, a justice studies professor at Montclair State University, noted that neither candidate has offered a detailed plan to expand police transparency.
“Jack Ciattarelli has aligned closely with law enforcement groups and has even suggested narrowing public access to police internal-affairs records, a step community advocates view as moving backward,” Williams said. “Mikie Sherrill, by contrast, has rolled out a broad ‘transparency’ platform, but her proposals focus mainly on fiscal and budgetary disclosure rather than on police discipline or use-of-force records. Both positions ultimately work to uphold the status quo.”
President Donald Trump’s cuts to police transparency — including his January revocation of former President Joe Biden’s executive order mandating body cameras and a misconduct database for federal officers — should spur policymakers to strengthen transparency at the state and local levels, said Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project.
While New Jersey voters have consistently cited the economy and taxes as the primary issues that drive them to the polls, police transparency also should be top of mind for voters, Bonds said.
“Police officers, more so than most other government officials, have incredible power in our society. They can literally kill you on the street before you have a trial, before you’re charged with a crime. They have the authority to take your money without due process. They have the authority to come into your home without due process,” Bonds said. “So even if you aren’t from a community that’s regularly impacted by over-policing or police violence, it’s incredibly important that we know who is doing those things in light of how much power they have.”
Ensuring police transparency is especially important, Bonds said, as Trump has dispatched military troops and federal officers to Democrat-led cities and ordered the hiring of thousands of new officers to enforce his deportation policies.
Ciattarelli and Sherrill are both vying in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat.

Sherrill’s spokespeople declined to make her available for an interview.
Sherrill, a congresswoman since 2019, has said little publicly about police transparency. During a recent talk with a police union, a Metuchen police officer asked her to defend her yes vote on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which was aimed at racial discrimination and excessive use of force in law enforcement. Sherrill told him she opposes “any ability for people to go after individual officers,” but supports accountability in police departments.
“So I do believe if there is a systemic problem, whether it’s at the municipal, county, or state level, that there should be accountability there. And I should think — I do think that if there — I think I agree with all of you, that if there are bad police officers, if there are structural problems in police departments which make every police officer look bad, that should be addressed and police should have accountability for that,” she said.
During that talk, she also said she supports civilian review boards as long as they do not have subpoena powers.
Ciattarelli, who recently landed the New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police’s endorsement, told the New Jersey Monitor after a town hall in Pitman earlier this month that he would scale back on reporting of police use of force and require reporting only on incidents in which officers fire a gun. He would not commit to continuing to report on major discipline and the names of officers involved in fatal encounters, transparency measures that then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal ordered in 2020.
Jack Ciattarelli said he wants to scale back reporting on when police use force. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
“I’m going to go by the way of my attorney general. I’m going to sit and talk with the attorney general about these things,” he said. “But let me say this — we are not going to demoralize these men and women in blue. They’re trained professionals. We’re going to let them do their job.”
He added: “I don’t know how much more transparency you can have when somebody’s wearing a body cam.”
On his campaign website and in social media posts, Ciattarelli has also said he would end the release of internal affairs records, opposes civilian review boards “with or without subpoena power,” would appoint a “pro-police” attorney general, and would protect qualified immunity to shield officers from liability for actions they take on the job.
Williams said New Jersey’s next governor should not weaken police transparency at a time when residents have deep concerns about police brutality and controversial police-involved fatalities.
Citizens should be alarmed at any plan to eliminate use-of-force reporting except when an officer fires a gun, Bonds said.
“That’s an arbitrary distinction. Obviously, we’re aware of so many situations of really extreme brutality that don’t involve the discharge of a firearm,” she said, pointing to George Floyd and Eric Garner. Floyd died after a Minneapolis cop kneeled on his neck for 9 minutes, while Garner died after a New York City cop put him in an illegal chokehold.
Law enforcement agencies should, at a minimum, publicly release officer misconduct records, substantiated and unsubstantiated civilian complaints, departmental policies, and footage captured by body-worn cameras and dashboard cameras, Bonds said.
Keeping those things secret hurts both the public and the police, she added.
“It hurts the public by depriving them of information, by leaving them in the dark about what happened to people they care about. It takes away information they need to advocate for policy changes,” Bonds said. “It’s not beneficial to police agencies to not be transparent either. We see this time and time again: If the public doesn’t have information, they’re going to fill in the gaps with what they know.”

Ingram said in a phone interview on Thursday that the amendment aimed to allow students to practice their religion.
“This is just to give [students] the option to be able to fellowship with other students who are Christians,” he said.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Alabama said in a statement Friday the proposed amendment violates the First Amendment.
“The U.S. Constitution allows for students and school employees to engage in private prayer during the school day, but students and school employees cannot be compelled, coerced, persuaded, or encouraged to join in prayer or other religious activity,” A’Niya Robinson, director of policy and organizing at the ACLU of Alabama said. “HB 43 is not only unconstitutional but also creates a hostile educational environment for students who do not adhere to state-sanctioned religious practices.”
Nik Nartowicz, lead policy counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a non-profit organization based in Washington D.C. that works to defend the right to freedom of religion, said in a statement Friday legislators cannot enforce religion in schools.
“Our Constitution’s promise of church-state separation means that students and their families – not politicians – get to decide if, when and how children engage with religion,” the statement said. “This bill would advance Christian Nationalists’ agenda to impose their religion on public schoolchildren,” Nartowicz said.
The amendment, if passed, would require students to have a signed consent form in order to participate in prayer and the reading of religious texts. If students have not consented to prayer and reading, it cannot be done in class.
Ingram said students who have given consent will be sent to a different classroom to not interfere with teachers’ instructional time.
Schools that have shown a “continued pattern of intentional refusal” will be investigated by the Alabama Department of Education and could have up to 25% of their state funding withheld.
“Some schools may not want to do it or put it to a vote for the students in their school system, so this is just where the school systems have to act on it and the board members have to vote on it,” Ingram said. “Even if it’s voted up or down, a position has to be taken. So if it’s voted down no money is going to be withheld.”
The proposed amendment to the state constitution would also mandate that each public school vote on whether to say the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of the day.
“Right now, it’s in the school policy to where you have to have the pledge, but a lot of schools are not doing the pledge. They’re not complying with the law, and that was a bill that Speaker Ledbetter passed years ago,” Ingram said in a phone interview Friday.
Any school that does not vote on whether they will say the pledge at the start of the school day, or does not say the Pledge of Allegiance after voting to say it, could have up to 25% of their state funding withheld. However, funding can be restored upon complying with the law.
“We don’t want to cut any school funding, but we want to make sure that they comply with the law and that they put it up to a vote of the school board within 60 days,” Ingram said. “If they vote yes, they have to comply and keep doing it every day, and if they vote no, they don’t have to do it.”
Robinson said forcing students to recite the pledge is harmful to their rights.
“Students should have the freedom to recite (or not recite) the pledge, and withholding school funds as enforcement further threatens that freedom that our country defends,” she said in a statement Friday.
According to Ingram, students have a choice on if they want to say the Pledge of Allegiance or not.
“It’s not mandatory for every student to stand up and hold their hand over their heart, especially if they’re not a U.S. citizen. We’re not making them do that, but the teacher has to have it as an option to do,” he said in a phone interview Friday.
Reed filed a similar bill for the 2025 legislative session, but the bill was postponed indefinitely.

Ruwa Romman, a Duluth Democrat, is running to be Georgia’s next governor. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderAt least one more Democrat is jumping into the race to be Georgia’s next governor.
State Rep. Ruwa Romman, a public policy consultant, once made history as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Georgia House of Representatives and the first Palestinian American to be elected to any public office in the state back in 2022.
Now, the Duluth Democrat is entering the race for the highest state office in Georgia, competing against Democrats like Atlanta state Sen. Jason Esteves, former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond and former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who was once a Republican.
Romman’s platform includes raising Georgia’s minimum wage, reopening shuttered rural hospitals, ensuring that children have enough to eat, and investing in the state’s small businesses. What sets her apart from the other Democratic candidates, she argues, is her willingness to embrace change and try something different.
“I firmly believe the politics of old aren’t working,” she said in an interview. “The business as usual isn’t working. And if we want to change the power dynamics of our state, we have to do something different.”
Romman, who worked for organizations like the Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the Asian American Advocacy Fund, and the Georgia Muslim Voter Project before running for office, also recently launched a statewide campaign called Project 159 with the goal of recruiting organizers and volunteers in every Georgia county in response to a similar grassroots effort from Republican U.S. Senate candidate and Congressman Mike Collins.
As the Democratic Party of Georgia gears up for the 2026 election cycle, Romman said, she hopes to see the party stick to a set of shared principles, such as advocating for people over corporations.
“We can build a broad coalition while holding on to our values, because they are popular values,” she added. “What Democrats actually believe in are very popular with voters, whether it’s raising the minimum wage, whether it’s expanding Medicaid in our state, whether it’s restoring access to abortions and life-saving care.”
Romman, who is currently the only Palestinian American in the Georgia Legislature, also gained national attention during last year’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago, when she was floated as a potential speaker on behalf of the Uncommitted Movement, which sought an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and an end to U.S. weapons transfers to Israel. The DNC ultimately denied the group’s request for a speaking slot, and Romman delivered her speech at a protest that was held outside the convention. The speech was later published in Rolling Stone.
Throughout her campaign, she said she hopes to carry a message of optimism for voters who are dissatisfied under current political leadership.
“I think right now, the greatest challenge we are having is this pervasive sense of cynicism and nihilism,” she said. “And in order to overcome that, you have to build a vision. You have to work towards big goals.”
While she acknowledges that some may see her bid for governor as a long shot in a Republican-dominated state like Georgia, she argued that an economic-centered campaign can motivate voters to turn out for progressive causes.
“To be clear, yes, this is a state that is predominantly Republican controlled, and has been for over 20 years,” she said. “But I think if you set a high bar, and you build towards a vision, and say, ‘look, let’s work towards this together, let’s build a movement, let’s imagine what’s possible,’ that kind of hope-centered, movement-centered campaign can go a really long way in our state.”
The winner of next May’s Democratic primary will go on to face the Republican nominee in the general election next November. The GOP primary is becoming increasingly crowded too, with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger recently launching a campaign for governor. Other high-profile Republican candidates include Lt. Gov.

[…],"The Washington state Capitol on Nov. 11, 2024. (Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)A contentious new sales tax on services that Democratic state lawmakers relied on to pay for Washington’s latest budget is set to take effect Wednesday. 
Senate Bill 5814 is one of the biggest moneymakers used to bring in an estimated $3.6 billion over the next two years to fill a shortfall in the operating budget. This law is expected to fuel $1.1 billion in the two-year budget that began July 1, and $2.6 billion over four years. Hundreds of millions of dollars will also flow to local governments, as they get a share of state sales tax proceeds.
But a key piece of the new tax law is in question. 
Cable juggernaut Comcast believes the measure’s sales tax on advertising services is illegal and is suing to get it overturned. The state attorney general’s office is expected to respond to the lawsuit in Thurston County Superior Court in the coming weeks. It could be months before a judge weighs in on the provision’s future.
The tax on advertising services is specifically expected to bring in roughly $475 million over the next four years. It’s unclear what would happen to collections made under the new tax if the law is later ruled invalid, a state Department of Revenue spokesperson said.
A block on the tax would throw a major kink into the $77.8 billion budget passed after months of negotiations in the Legislature. The next 60-day legislative session begins in January. 
The law earns the state money by applying the retail sales tax to more services. Beyond advertising, it covers temporary staffing ($833 million over four years), security ($127 million), live presentations ($360 million) and information technology ($189 million), among others. Temporary staffing services hospitals use are exempt.
Over the summer, the Department of Revenue hosted listening sessions with affected businesses. Over 90,000 businesses are expected to pay under the law. Companies complained of a lack of clarity on how the taxes would be implemented and the adverse effects this will have on their bottom line. 
The law also adds taxes on emerging nicotine products, like Zyn pouches, which don’t kick in until Jan. 1. Some other tax increases Democrats approved this year, including to Washington’s primary business and occupation taxes, also take effect on New Year’s. 
Also starting Wednesday, financial institutions with an annual net income above $1 billion will have a business and occupation tax they pay raised from 1.2% to 1.5%. During the session, Democrats estimated this would impact about 200 firms. 
The business and occupation rate for service businesses with a gross income over $5 million is increasing from 1.75% to 2.1%.
Republicans universally opposed this Democratic-backed package of new and increased taxes and fees. 
All of these proceeds go into the state’s operating budget, which funds the bulk of Washington’s state government programs and services. 
The budget for transportation is separate. 
The $15.5 billion two-year transportation budget approved this year also relies on a slate of new and increased taxes and fees, namely a rare gas tax hike implemented in July. 
These transportation funding streams are estimated to bring in $3.2 billion over the next six years to fund Washington State Ferries, highway megaprojects, maintenance of state roads and bridges, Washington State Patrol and public transportation.

A few transportation-centric fee hikes also begin Wednesday. 
The $9 annual fee for driver’s licenses and IDs is going up a dollar, a move expected to bring in $74 million over the next three budget cycles. The 50-cent capital vessel surcharge paid by state ferry riders is also increasing. This is projected to raise $47 million. 
And the latest transportation budget removes an exemption from tolls for public and private transit buses, vans, and rideshare vehicles on bridges. That’s worth $6 million over six years.
Further transportation revenue measures take effect throughout 2026. The taxes and fees respond to a gaping shortfall caused by diminishing gas tax receipts and ballooning costs for the state’s already-expensive road projects.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/washington-state-capitol-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

It’s a standard for how institutions should operate when people come forward about sexual assault and exploitation.
Nearly eight years after the #MeToo movement forced a national reckoning — and years after the horrific scope of Jeffrey Epstein’s network came to light — Indiana keeps confronting local headlines that remind us how far we still have to go. From City Hall to the Statehouse to our own workplaces, women continue to report harassment and abuse, only to face doubt, retaliation, or bureaucratic processes that prioritize liability over safety.
Recent investigations into harassment complaints in Indianapolis’ city government made that painfully clear, describing behavior that was “professionally inappropriate” and a culture that must change. That should be a turning point, not a footnote.
The stakes are not abstract. Indiana has some of the highest rates of sexual violence in the country. According to statewide data, about 60% of Hoosier women report experiencing sexual violence in their lifetimes, and roughly one in three have been raped. Those numbers are staggering—and they represent the people we care about most—our coworkers, neighbors, students, parishioners, and friends.
We also sit at the crossroads of human trafficking. Law enforcement data show a growing number of identified cases across our state, underscoring the need for coordinated prevention, survivor services, and prosecution strategies. Host city selection often emphasizes hotel capacity, travel accessibility, and entertainment infrastructure, but rarely prioritizes whether a city is prepared to address concerns related to trafficking. Yet those very characteristics — plentiful lodging, robust transit, and nightlife — are the same that traffickers exploit. Studies show traffickers may also take advantage of travel visas by disguising victims as spectators or luring women and girls with promises of legitimate jobs only to coerce them into
illicit activity once they arrive.
Senate Democrats elect new minority leader after second round of sexual harassment accusations

Believing women is not enough. We must commit to building systems that actually protect them. That starts with Indiana law. Today, our statutes still contain gaps — particularly around consent — that make it harder for survivors to seek justice. Women4Change supports closing loopholes and modernizing definitions so the law reflects lived realities, not outdated
assumptions. This includes addressing forms of sexual assault that exploit coercion, impersonation, and power imbalances.
While policy is important, we can’t dismiss the role of infrastructure to support women when at their most vulnerable moments. The federal Violence Against Women Act provides critical funding for crisis response, shelters, legal assistance, and prevention. We need to ensure those resources reach communities equitably and are paired with trauma-informed practices in schools, universities, workplaces, and public agencies. Survivors should not have to become expert navigators of a fragmented maze to be kept safe at work or school — or to find a counselor, get a protective order, or keep their job while healing.
And we must talk plainly about money. Violence is not only a safety issue; it’s a financial one. Survivors lose wages, housing, jobs, and childcare. That’s why Women4Change uplifts tools that help people rebuild economic security — like FreeFrom’s survivor-centered resources that offer cash assistance, employment protections, and practical steps to stabilize finances and plan for long-term safety. Dignity is hard to sustain without dollars.
Finally, we must recognize that culture change also requires accountability in where we work and how we govern. Public institutions need survivor-centered reporting processes, independent investigations, guaranteed non-retaliation, and transparent timelines. Training for managers and elected leaders on bystander intervention, trauma-informed response, and legal obligations cannot be a one-time event — it must be consistent and ongoing. And when patterns emerge, leadership must act swiftly and publicly. Silence isn’t neutrality; it’s complicity.
But accountability cannot stop at policy; it must also adapt to the realities of a digital age where exploitation is increasingly enabled by new technologies. National data underscore this shift: in 2021, 85% of sex trafficking cases filed in U.S. Federal Courts involved the Internet as the primary method of solicitation. This reflects a longer trend: between 2007 and 2012, the National Human Trafficking Resource Center found that in most pimp-controlled prostitution incidents — one of the most prevalent forms of sex trafficking—the forced sex acts were advertised or facilitated online. These patterns make clear that without vigilance, traffickers will continue to weaponize emerging tools and platforms, exploiting every gap in oversight.
At Women4Change, our commitment is twofold: advancing policies that center on survivors and connecting Hoosiers with concrete help. If you or someone you know needs support, we’ve compiled Indiana-specific information on consent and sexual assault, along with links to statewide partners such as the Indiana Coalition to End Sexual Assault & Human Trafficking, crisis lines, and legal resources.
Indiana can lead. We can be a state where survivors are believed, where laws reflect modern realities, where City Hall and every workplace are safe, and where healing is matched with real economic security. But that will only happen if we demand it —consistently, across party lines, and with the courage to examine our own institutions.
Believe women, and then build the systems that prove it.

Mike Braun, left) and Commerce Secretary David Adams sit during an announcement on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Secretary of Commerce David Adams remains both CEO and president of Indiana’s controversial Economic Development Corp. — five months after lawmakers directed Gov. Mike Braun to split the roles across two appointees.
But that’s expected to change next month, according to the Commerce Office.
“We have been evaluating the role of president and anticipate an announcement by the end of October,” a spokesperson told the Capital Chronicle.
The changes were tucked into Senate Enrolled Act 516, an economic development law that also created an entrepreneurship office on Braun’s behalf, plus established land notification and other transparency requirements for the IEDC.
Immigration cooperation, IEDC limits and more nab concurrence votes, head to governor

Until Braun’s May 1 signature, the secretary of commerce was required to be the agency’s CEO and president. But legislators crossed “and president” out of Indiana Code.
They added: “The governor shall appoint the president of the (IEDC), who shall serve at the pleasure of the governor. The president shall report to the secretary of commerce.” The edits were effective immediately.
Throughout the summer, however, Braun’s administration didn’t name an appointee to serve alongside Adams or offer specifics on a timeline, despite the Capital Chronicle’s repeated requests for information.
The Commerce Office’s Thursday statement didn’t include responses to questions of whether the administration was aware of the changes, the reasoning behind them or about the delay in compliance.
The law’s author — Sen. Brian Buchanan, R-Lebanon — said the idea came out of collaboration with Braun’s fledgling administration. The governor took office in January after former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s eight-year tenure.
“We worked with Secretary Adams and his staff, the governor’s office and the Legislature,” Buchanan said. “We all worked cooperatively, essentially, to come up to try to set up the best structure for IEDC to be successful.”
Splitting the roles, he said, allows “a little more focus,” to “build on our strengths and improve our weaknesses, and really dedicate the time it needs in order to to make sure we’re successful.”
The changes reset the provision to its original form.

Indiana had a traditional commerce department until 2005. That’s when, under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, lawmakers created the IEDC: “a body politic and corporate, not a state agency but an independent instrumentality exercising essential public functions,” per Indiana Code.
IEDC was established with two leaders, according to the 2005 law, House Enrolled Act 1003. They were merged in a 2021 law, House Enrolled Act 1418, under former Gov. Eric Holcomb. Under Braun, the roles are going back to the original design.
“I did ask that question about, ‘Does it need to be statute, or can it be administratively done?'” Buchanan recalled. “And I was told it is something that needs to be statute.”
The appointment will come within weeks of the release of a report about the IEDC and its partners.
Braun launched the investigation in May, after Indiana Legislative Insight’s April publication of allegations like self-dealing and side gigs.
The troubled agency, its foundation arm and several frequent collaborators were each dubbed an “entity of interest.” The analysis, conducted by Washington, D.C.-based FTI Consulting, took about four months — less than the year allotted in the $800,000 contract.
Braun led IEDC’s board in a unanimous approval of the report’s release at a Wednesday meeting. It’s undergoing legal review for redactions but is already driving new policies on investment, board voting and beyond.
That was the board’s second gathering in its new form. Braun remade it in June, replacing Holcomb’s eight selections with nine new appointees.
He has vowed to reform the quasi-public agency to increase transparency.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The headlines over the past few weeks have been unrelenting. The Trump administration is activating the full power of the federal government against perceived enemies, from liberal groups to elections officials to the former FBI director.
Meanwhile, autocratic powers like China and Russia are running influence campaigns and cyber attacks to pit Americans against Americans. China currently has the ability to track Americans’ locations and unencrypted communications on American telecom networks, as well as movements and communications abroad, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. Russia has been perfecting the art of social media influence, with apparently great success in the case of President Donald Trump’s first election.
China and Russia want to crack the idea that we are a rainbow of many colors, a multiracial, multi-faith, representative democracy where we respect each other and celebrate our diversity in all its joys. They know America is weaker domestically and on the world stage when we are fighting against each other, both online and in the streets. 
The more we hate each other, the more our fabric of American government pulls apart and frays. While I strongly disagree with Charlie Kirk’s message and its impact on marginalized groups, political violence is always wrong and is a dynamo that is hard to stop.
Here in Minnesota, we had one our toughest summers since 2020. House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark, and their beloved golden retriever Gilbert were assassinated. It’s only by luck that State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette survived the assassin’s bullets, and that the killer failed to harm the dozens of other leaders on the kill list.
One of my closest friends was on the first page of the kill list. It’s scary. It’s easy to be anxious and paranoid. I have been threatened at my own home.
The only way to defeat us if the Trump administration and the movement that undergirds it manages to divide us. We can’t let that happen. To win as a majority coalition, we must always invite everybody who believes in civil liberties and human rights.
In a time when the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, labor allies, and the left needs to be organized, there is an ongoing rift between factions of the DFL Party. 
In Minneapolis, the party convention’s endorsement for mayor of state Sen. Omar Fateh was appealed to the state party and invalidated. This did not end the question. If anything, it made each intra-party faction feel ever more strongly that the opposing side was corrupt and self-dealing at the expense of the greater Democratic project.
Minnesota has been a shining eight-pointed North Star, strong on civil liberties, human rights, and economic opportunity. Gov. Tim Walz recently announced that he is running for a third term. There is an open U.S. Senate contest with U.S. Senator Tina Smith retiring from public service next year. This is a real opportunity to earn back a DFL trifecta with two legislative majorities and the governor’s signature pen. The stakes are high.
Keeping a big tent party unified in these times is incredibly difficult. I know first-hand as the former chair of the DFL local party unit that trained the most volunteers and raised the most funds of any DFL local party unit statewide. But this commentary isn’t about water under the bridge.
This November, voters in Minneapolis and Saint Paul will elect city leaders for the next four years. The first Tuesday of next February, thousands of DFL members will gather in the cold night for precinct caucuses. We will host yet more intra-party contests at in-person conventions across the state of Minnesota. It will get nasty. There will be hurtful language that threatens the inclusiveness of our party. How we react and lead will decide the path forward.
Words matter. Actions matter more. We on the left side of the spectrum — from moderate Democrats to liberals to leftists — have a role to play to invite Minnesotans into the greater Democratic project. You can invite your friends to a virtual training. You can attend the “No Kings” protests across Minnesota on October 18. You can register your family to vote where they live so they can vote in elections that affect the community they call home. 
And you can give family, friends and random people online a little grace. There are plenty of bots trying to gin up conflict, and real humans like us don’t have to add to that.
We are in the real fight against fascism now, here, in America. If you thought Joe Biden was using rhetorical hyperbole when he said in 2019 that there was a battle for the soul of this country, well, we are here now. 
The words we use and the actions we take will have significant consequences over the next months and beyond. Majorities are only built with addition, not subtraction. To help make it happen, you can get involved, bring your friends, make calls, knock doors, write postcards, protest, and exercise our First Amendment rights to protect the Fourth Amendment rights and all the rest they are coming for. 
We can do this, but only if we do it together.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2237397769.jpg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

“It's a big deal that this is happening,” said state Sen. Ruth Hardy, while adding “I don't think it's going to solve the entire problem.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
When Rita Munro settled in Middlebury in 2016 to start a family, friends sent her spreadsheets of contacts for child care facilities across the county and encouraged her to get on waitlists as soon as she became pregnant. 
“It takes an incredible amount of executive function,” said Munro, 37, who works as a therapist. 
The word-of-mouth culture stemming from competition, particularly for home child care facilities, could be challenging for newcomers, she said, and the Covid-19 pandemic only intensified the situation. Eventually, she managed to find spots that worked for her kids.
In the coming months, Munro’s 2-year-old daughter and newborn twins are planning to attend the newly expanded and renovated Otter Creek Child Center in Middlebury. The organization’s $12 million transformation has been in the works since 2017.
“I think everybody’s excited,” said Linda January, the center’s executive director. “We’re ready to be in the building.”
The expansion will nearly double the program’s capacity, making it one of the largest child care providers in the state. The construction is expected to end by mid-November, January said, and comes during a period of growth for child care in Addison County. Local leaders said increased offerings in the area come none too soon, as a recent influx of public money to child care provides an opportunity for recovery from Covid-era hardship.
The new facility at Otter Creek Child Center is set to include a spacious, multistory addition to the original building, as well as a new expanded parking lot, several playgrounds, an elevator and a full commercial kitchen, January said. Though unfinished, the new rooms were beginning to bear hints of their future purpose on Friday, with cubbies taking shape in some spaces and miniature bathroom amenities in others.

The center plans to add up to 15 new teachers by next fall, in addition to several other operational positions.
“During the pandemic, Addison County lost more child care slots than any county in the state,” said Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison.
A 2022 analysis by the Burlington child care nonprofit Let’s Grow Kids found nearly 70% of infants likely to need care in Addison County did not have access to any regulated child care programs. Fifty-four percent of toddlers were in the same predicament, the report estimated.
Although Otter Creek will experience a huge jump in available slots — from its current daily maximum of 70 across two temporary locations to 139 in the single renovated building on Weybridge Street by next fall — there are currently 250 people on the waitlist, January said.
“It’s a big deal that this is happening,” said Hardy. “I don’t think it’s going to solve the entire problem.”

‘We fixed the business model, to an extent’
The two largest sources of funding for the expansion project were capital and land gifts from Middlebury College, the county’s largest employer and the project’s “biggest partner,” according to January, and congressionally directed spending from the office of former U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. Middlebury College’s contributions add up to more than $5 million, and Leahy’s office earmarked more than $3.5 million via Let’s Grow Kids. 
The child care center is still actively raising funds, January said, but does not anticipate any substantial, lingering debts. New levels of public support, in combination with her organization’s new structure, have given January confidence in the center’s financial outlook. 
According to Aly Richards, CEO of Let’s Grow Kids, the heart of Vermont’s child care problem historically lay not in initial capital for projects but rather in their long-term sustainability.

Act 76, which passed in 2023 via a veto override in the Vermont Legislature, commits $125 million annually to the state’s child care system in part via a .44% payroll tax. Families making up to 575% of the federal poverty level were newly eligible for tuition subsidies that year, and the state began paying out those subsidies at higher weekly rates.
“We fixed the business model, to an extent,” Richards said. “The money goes specifically to parents, who now can … better afford child care, and to early educators, who can have more resources to actually run their program.”
The state has seen 1,700 new child care slots and more than 100 new providers open since the act passed two years ago. Previously, more programs were closing than opening each quarter, and low pay combined with poor benefits made retention and hiring difficult, Richards said.
Under the new funding system and with a larger organizational scale, January said she has been able to increase the center’s salary floor to $20 per hour and add a retirement plan. Staff also now have vision and dental insurance, but health insurance coverage, while “more feasible,” is still a future goal.
January said the majority of the families she serves receive some tuition coverage, which can be equally transformative.
Without the subsidies Munro stands to receive, her cost for child care would exceed her take-home pay each month. While her husband, David, also works as a professor at Middlebury College, Munro may have needed to quit her job without tuition assistance.

“Our taxes are high,” Munro said. “We invest a lot into our school systems, so it makes sense to be investing a lot into early early child care.”
The impact of well-funded child care on the health of the state’s workforce should not be understated, Richards said. 
“There’s a massive return on investment for our economy and for businesses,” she said.
Otter Creek Child Center is not the only recent expansion to the Addison County child care landscape. The Red Clover Child Center in Middlebury’s congregational church, The Growing Tree in Addison and other providers have sprung up in the area over the past two years.
Michelle Bishop, who runs The Growing Tree, previously worked for the state’s federally funded Head Start program and observed the intense demand for child care providers through that job. Her program opened last month with a capacity of 20 and is still on a shoestring budget to some extent, she said. 
Bishop said it would not have been financially possible to open the center without public assistance from Act 76. Roughly 80% of her attendees receive tuition assistance through the program, which gives the organization some stability.
“It’s not a profitable thing,” she said. “That’s not the point, but it will keep itself alive.”
Hardy said projects like Bishop’s and January’s are a huge step forward for the county, as both a public service and a driver for the local economy. She said Vermont’s new funding provisions make the state a national leader for child care. 
“We’re very much on the cutting edge,” Hardy said.

On Tuesday, voters in Arizona elected Adelita Grijvala to Congress to fill a seat vacant following the death of her father, Raúl Grijalva. Both Grijvala, a Democrat, and her Republican opponent had said they would sign a discharge petition to force the House vote.
The petition needs 218 signatures — a majority of the House — to bring a resolution sponsored by U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, to the floor. The resolution would lead to a vote on a bill requiring the Department of Justice to “publicly disclose all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell,” Epstein’s longtime associate now being held in federal prison.
So far the petition, which Massie co-sponsored with U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, has 217 signatures — every Democrat in the House, including U.S. Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City and Wesley Bell of St. Louis — and four Republicans.
Rep. Mark Alford, right, introduces himself to Douglas Walther, left, before the town hall on Wednesday at the Lions Club in Harrisburg. An NPR tally reported that around 37 of the 219 U.S. House Republicans held town halls during the August recess (Aiyana Massie/Missourian).
Only U.S. Rep. Mark Alford of Raymore among Missouri’s six Republicans told The Independent how he would vote for the measure if it makes it to the House floor. While he opposes the discharge petition, he said, if the bill it seeks to advance comes up for a vote, he will support it.
“The Epstein case has cast a long shadow over our institutions, fueling distrust among Americans,” Alford said in a statement sent by email. “By releasing the files, we can begin to ensure justice for the victims and restore faith in our criminal justice system. Transparency is not a partisan issue; it’s a moral one.”
Alford said he was opposed to the discharge petition because it doesn’t allow for measured consideration of legislation.
“The discharge petition process bypasses regular order, skips the committee process, and prevents the people’s elected representatives from having a say until an up or down floor vote—that’s wrong and is not how our legislature should operate,” Alford said.
The only other Republican member of the Missouri delegation to respond to an inquiry about the discharge petition was U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner of Ballwin. Her emailed statement did not say whether she would vote for the measure if it reaches the floor or why she had not signed the petition.
“As I have strongly stated previously, Jeffrey Epstein was evil and I hope he rots in hell for what he did to so many innocent children,” Wagner said. “I have called for total transparency, to the extent the courts will allow, and ensuring victims are always protected.”
Wagner said she has voted in favor of investigations by the House Oversight Committee and that has already resulted in the release of thousands of documents.
“Any criminal activity must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Wagner said.
Seven days after the 218th signature is recorded on the discharge petition, any member who signed can call for House Speaker Mike Johnson to schedule a vote on the petition, which must come within two days.
The tumult over releasing records related to the Epstein investigation has created turmoil in Congress all summer. His death in 2019 in a New York City jail cell while awaiting trial on federal charges for sex trafficking minors has become the focus of many of the questions surrounding the case.
In 2007, a plea deal with then-federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta, who went on to be secretary of labor in the first Trump administration, ended an FBI investigation into Epstein. He was accused, the Miami Herald reported in 2018, “of assembling a large, cult-like network of underage girls — with the help of young female recruiters — to coerce into having sex acts behind the walls of his opulent waterfront mansion.”
Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida for procuring and soliciting minors for sex, and served about 13 months in jail under a work release arrangement.
President Donald Trump and his supporters, including some now working in his administration, dealt in conspiracy theories for years on the information surrounding the Epstein case, including whose names turned up during the investigation and the circumstances of his death.
The clamor for more transparency in the case, especially about Trump’s friendship with Epstein, has resulted in various attempts by Republican leaders in Congress to keep a lid on rebellious members.
In July, Johnson, the house speaker, sent members home early for their August break because of the pressure to release the files. 
And at home in Kentucky, Massie told reporters he and the other three Republicans who signed the discharge petition are being pressured to remove their names following the election of Grijvala.
Johnson and “some of the powers that be in DC are in full panic right now” about it, Massie said, according to reporting by Semafor.
The other Republicans who have signed are U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.
“They asked some of my colleagues who are co-signers,” Massie said. “And they actually threatened them politically, not physically.”
Among the Missouri delegation, The Independent did not receive responses from the offices of U.S. Reps. Sam Graves of Tarkio, Jason Smith of Cape Girardeau, Bob Onder of Lake St. Louis or Eric Burlison of Springfield.
The Independent could not find any sources for statements by Graves at any time on the Epstein files.

Smith, in a statement reported by KRCG in July, said more documents should be unsealed.
“The more transparency we can have the better,” Smith said.
In a July panel discussion on right-wing news outlet Real America’s Voice, Onder said the delays in releasing full details of the Epstein investigation are a symptom of “this idea that ‘deep state’ insiders control the levers of power.” 
Epstein used influence to escape justice, Onder said.
“I think it’s very much the question of whether, if you’re wealthy enough, powerful enough, well-connected enough, you can get away with anything,” Onder said.
In an interview with Missourinet in July, Burlison said the American people are “sick and tired of being lied to by their government or the government holding these secrets that they deserve to know the truth on.”

A lawsuit filed Friday in Cole County Circuit Court alleges state lawmakers unconstitutionally split residential property into different classes, choosing which counties would get a cap, and how much, on “simply the whim of individual legislators.” 
The bill was passed by lawmakers during a special session in June.
The bill’s funding for sports stadiums — up to $1.5 billion intended to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals in Missouri — was already in court. A hearing is scheduled Tuesday morning on a motion by the state to dismiss that challenge, filed by state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Gove, and others, alleging the bill violated procedural rules of the constitution.
Plaintiffs in the new case include a taxpayer from St. Louis County, which will not have taxes subject to the law’s caps and one from Warren County, which will have a cap that allows no growth in tax bills. The taxing districts listed in the petition are the Ozark Fire Protection District, along with school districts Warren County R-III in Warrenton, Crawford R-I in Bourbon, Ozark R-VI, Meramec Valley R-III in Pacific, Grandview R-II in Dittmer and Doniphan R-I.
The law requires each county subject to a possible cap to hold an election asking voters if they want to enact it.
Within two weeks of passing the legislation, House Speaker Jon Patterson had established an interim committee to study property taxes amid questions about the property tax provision’s constitutionality.
In 75 counties, voters could prevent property taxes from rising more than 5% per year from a base amount, or the rate of inflation, whichever is greater. In 22 other counties, voters could freeze their homes’ property taxes with exceptions for newly voted levies and additional value from improvements.
Lawmakers opted their counties into the legislation, deciding what level of relief they wanted for their area. Many legislators from the state’s largest counties asked to be excluded, leaving Boone, Greene, Jackson, St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis out of the law.
“No rational basis was used to categorize counties between those where the credit could result in a freeze on property tax revenue growth, a 5% cap on property tax revenue growth, or neither,” plaintiffs wrote in their initial filing.

Some of the school districts joining the lawsuit cover multiple counties that, if approved by voters, would have different levels of tax relief.
Their attorneys argue that this would violate Article X of the Missouri Constitution, which requires uniformity in taxation and limits state lawmakers’ power to divide real property into subclasses, among other things.
“As applied, (the law) may result in disparate treatment of otherwise similarly situated taxpayers because certain taxpayers for a single district may reside in political subdivisions that cover multiple counties — counties that may be subject to different property tax credit schemes.”
The lawsuit also challenges the statute under the state’s equal protection clause because the law only gives some taxpayers the right to vote on tax relief. 
The law “mandates varying levels of tax relief — either a cap of a five percent increase or no increase — denying all other similarly situated taxpayers the same level of tax relief thereby violating their equal rights and opportunity under the law,” plaintiffs wrote.
Plaintiffs’ attorneys further label the law unconstitutional for violating a section of the state’s constitution that restricts certain local or special laws.
“A law may not include less than all who are similarly situated,” plaintiffs wrote, saying the counties are grouped without a “conceivable state of facts that connect” them.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_colecountycourt2-scaled-e1757967844893-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

Mike Parson to fund voter-approved Medicaid expansion (Photo by Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).In the special session that ended Sept. 12, lawmakers approved measures that would block the ballot process that delivered medical marijuana, Medicaid expansion, reproductive care, and paid sick leave
Over the past two decades, Missouri’s broadest health reforms have come from the ballot box, not the Capitol. When the General Assembly did not act, voters legalized medical marijuana, expanded Medicaid, protected reproductive rights, and approved paid sick leave for workers who previously lacked it.
Each reform faced legislative resistance and saw its impact delayed or narrowed through lawsuits, refusals, and repeals. 
In 2018, after years of inaction in Jefferson City, voters approved medical marijuana. Opponents immediately filed lawsuits, and the state slowed implementation by tightly restricting licenses. By 2020, only a small number of dispensaries were operational statewide, showing how legal delays restricted access even after voter approval. Only after the Missouri Supreme Court upheld the measure did the program move forward, illustrating the limits of voter-led policy without strong legislative follow-through.
Missouri voters approved Medicaid expansion for low-income adults in 2020, ending more than a decade of legislative resistance. Implementation did not begin until 2021, after the Missouri Supreme Court ordered the state to comply. Governor Parson and budget chair Cody Smith contended expansion would cost hundreds of millions annually and force cuts elsewhere. 
They were wrong. Uncompensated hospital costs fell, patients paid less out-of-pocket, and federal matching funds eased pressure on the state budget. By 2022, emergency department visits covered by Medicaid rose about 15%, while visits by uninsured patients fell roughly 14%. The uninsured rate has dropped sharply over the past decade, with Medicaid expansion playing a major role once it took effect in 2021. Yet rural Missouri still lags behind, with higher uninsured rates and heavier reliance on Medicaid coverage than urban areas.
In 2024, a coalition led by Missourians for Healthy Families & Fair Wages gathered signatures for Proposition A. Voters approved the measure overwhelmingly, guaranteeing paid sick leave and a higher minimum wage for roughly 728,000 workers. Proposition A was upheld by the Missouri Supreme Court when business groups challenged it, but the legislature repealed the law in 2025, immediately leaving many workers vulnerable to lost wages and increased public health risks.
The same year, voters passed Amendment 3, restoring constitutional protections for abortion, contraception, and miscarriage care after Missouri’s near total ban in 2022. 
Missouri is one of the most dangerous states in the nation to give birth. Over 40% of Missouri counties are maternity care deserts, and Black women die at four times the rate of white women. In a 2018 state mortality review, 82% of pregnancy-related deaths were found to be preventable, with Medicaid patients dying at four times the rate of mothers with private insurance — all before Missouri expanded Medicaid in 2021.
These numbers reflect lethal systemic inequities across Missouri, making timely prenatal and miscarriage care difficult to access. Amendment 3 removed legal barriers, allowing care earlier and reducing some of the risks created by limited local access. 
In 2026, Missouri voters will be asked to repeal those protections while the state seeks to delay and complicate implementation.
Even with extensions to postpartum Medicaid coverage and modest increases to dental and provider reimbursement rates, many Missourians still face gaps in access. These are lawmaker-led reforms, incremental changes that improve some services but leave large portions of the population without meaningful coverage. 
Voter-led initiatives, by contrast, have reshaped the state’s health landscape—expanding Medicaid, protecting reproductive rights, legalizing medical marijuana, and guaranteeing paid sick leave—delivering broad and tangible impacts that the legislature alone has repeatedly failed to achieve.
Missouri has repeatedly shown that voter-led reforms, paired with stronger transparency, accurate fiscal notes, and safeguards such as sunset clauses or dedicated revenue, can deliver real benefit. 
The two measures passed in the special session would dismantle the process Missourians have relied on for two decades to pass reforms their representatives repeatedly blocked.
HJR 3 would require citizen-led initiatives to win not only a statewide majority but also in each of Missouri’s eight congressional districts, giving a single district the power to veto a measure for the entire state. This rule applies only to voter initiatives, not to measures lawmakers place on the ballot. HB 1 adds a new tactic by authorizing mid-decade redistricting, a rare move critics warn would allow politicians to redraw maps after seeing which areas supported or opposed a measure.
Together, these changes would have nullified past voter-approved reforms at the ballot box and made it far easier for lawmakers to overturn future initiatives, leaving Missourians without the protections and expanded access that citizen-led reforms have historically delivered.
In 2025, The Fairness Project tracked roughly 150 bills across 15 state legislatures that aimed to weaken ballot initiatives, nearly double the volume from two years earlier. In Missouri, the legislative majority has already added hurdles by stretching lawsuit timelines, titling ballot summaries, tightening donor rules, and even delaying an abortion measure under the former Attorney General’s office.
For Missourians, closing the ballot means shutting down the only proven path to major health reform in the past 20 years. Supporters of redistricting initiatives argue the process can be influenced by outside interests or lead to costly programs, but the record in Missouri shows otherwise: citizen-led reforms have consistently improved health in communities and strengthened the state. 
The real risk is not in letting voters decide, but in silencing them.

The excess application of fertilizer poses serious risks to public health, raises costs for people who get their water from public utilities or private wells and increases costs for farmers, the report found. 
Throughout the report, the environmental groups included input from residents who have had their health and wallets affected by nitrate pollution. 
“I own a daycare center, and the mental toll of just staying in business because I did not cause the contamination of my well and yet am expected to solve the problem is exhausting…” Kewaunee County resident Lisa Cochart says in the report. “This could put me out of business. I work hard to provide my community with a service that assures that each child is receiving the best care and it can be shut down because of a nitrate test that I cannot control.”
The report makes a number of recommendations to better track the amount of nitrogen spread on Wisconsin’s fields and in Wisconsin’s water systems while better enforcing regulations meant to protect drinking water. But agricultural industry representatives have said the report places too much burden on farmers — even though agriculture produces up to 90% of the nitrogen in the state’s groundwater. 
“Wisconsin cannot afford to delay. The cost of inaction — both financial and human — is rising,” the report states. “A coordinated, science-based policy response is essential to reduce nitrate pollution at its source, protect public health and ecosystems, and ensure clean, safe drinking water for future generations.”
The report recommends tougher state standards for nitrates, improved enforcement of nutrient management plans on individual farms, creating a statewide registration system for manure haulers and requiring regular groundwater monitoring for factory farms. It also proposes collecting data on the cost of nitrogen contamination to public water systems, expanding the state’s existing private well compensation program and increasing the state’s nitrogen fertilizer tonnage fees.
While the report’s recommendations are aimed at a wide range of policy areas and farming is the major source of nitrogen contamination, dairy industry representatives have pushed back on its findings. Tim Trotter, CEO of the Dairy Business Association, told Wisconsin Public Radio farmers are already doing enough voluntarily to address the problem. 
“Our work with solutions-minded environmental groups and other stakeholders through a statewide clean water initiative has resulted in tailored changes to programs and policies that open up more opportunities for on-farm innovation that addresses this important issue,” Trotter said. “Reports like this one do little to bring practical, achievable solutions to water quality challenges, and can be counterproductive to progress.”
In the past, the Dairy Business Association has sued state regulators to weaken the state’s ability to regulate pollution sources such as runoff. 
The report states that the state Legislature and the courts have limited the authorities of state agencies, including the Department of Natural Resources and Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, preventing them from doing all that is necessary to manage the contamination. 
“Because Wisconsin administrative agencies have been severely limited in their ability to establish new regulations, they have relied heavily on voluntary incentives, such as cost-sharing and price supports to incentivize farmers to implement conservation measures,” the report states. “However, it is clear that these voluntary incentives alone aren’t enough to solve Wisconsin’s nitrate problems.”
The report also found that in applying more nitrogen fertilizer than necessary, Wisconsin’s farmers are spending $8-$11 million more each year than they need to — “dollars that could be saved with more precise application.” 
More than one-third of the state’s residents get their drinking water from private wells, which are especially susceptible to nitrate contamination. The report recommends expanding the well compensation program, but adds that is just a band-aid solution. 
The program also limits participation to residents making less than $60,000 per year and includes a number of requirements that further restrict who is eligible, even if their wells exceed the state’s nitrate standard of 10 milligrams per liter, according to the report.  
Instead, the report argues, the state needs to better work to keep nitrates out of the groundwater in the first place. 
“Well compensation programs, while vital for near-term relief, are ultimately a stopgap,” the report states. “They do not address the root cause of nitrate pollution. Without stronger upstream controls on nitrate pollution, more families will face the high cost and growing scarcity of access to safe drinking water.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) is pursuing upgrades to technology used to track phones during investigations. Known as cell site simulators, the formerly murky equipment tracks phones by mimicking cell towers. Once connected to a targeted phone, cell site simulators are able to track the signal, allowing police to locate people. According to city purchasing division records, MPD aims to upgrade and acquire new components and extend a contract for the phone tracking gear by three years. 
The city’s contract with Tactical Support Equipment will be extended until 2028 and increase by $165,000 to $1.45 million. “MPD operating funds will be used,” according to records obtained by the Examiner explaining the purpose for amending the contract. The amendments will cover funds and coverage for two cell site simulators purchased in 2022, the records state. 
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
A separate section of the purchasing division records explains “this equipment is used on a regular basis to locate suspects and in exigent situations such as critical missing incidents.” It also states, “MPD used this equipment to help support other law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin, law enforcement in other states such as Texas, Ohio, and Michigan, and federal agencies such as FBI and DEA. At this time, MPD is seeking to upgrade the existing equipment, add additional equipment, and add warranty, support and maintenance for the new and upgraded equipment beyond what the department currently has in place. Tactical Support Equipment, Inc. is the only vendor that can support the equipment as the equipment and software is proprietary.”
MPD has used cell site simulators since at least 2010, according to logs the department uses to catalog its use of the gear. For years, the technology was used by MPD’s Fusion Center, an intelligence unit originally created for Homeland Security operations. A group of officers known as the Confidential Source Team – or CS Team – operates the cell site simulators. Logs of the technology’s use show that it’s mostly used to investigate crimes including homicides and shootings and for investigations related to overdoses or firearms. The logs also show the technology is used to locate material witnesses, kidnapping victims, but also for vague reasons like “drugs”, “long term”, or are redacted entirely.
By 2022, when Wisconsin Examiner first interviewed a member of the CS Team, both the team and its gear had been moved from the Fusion Center to MPD’s Special Investigations Division (SID), which focuses on fugitives, felonies and violent crimes. The team’s name invokes the technology’s secretive history. 
The Milwaukee department once signed non-disclosure agreements in order to acquire the technology leading to controversies in 2016, when MPD was accused of hiding use of Stingray-type devices from judges during court proceedings. When asked during a trial about how a person was located, officers used “oddly vague language,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin said, even stating that they “obtained information from an unknown source.” Things have changed over time, however. Today, the Milwaukee Police Foundation, which funnels private donations to MPD, publicly lists cell site simulators as among the technologies it helps MPD to purchase.
Like many other law enforcement agencies nationwide, for years MPD utilized phone tracking equipment produced by the Harris Corporation, a multi-billion dollar defense contractor. Harris’ devices were so common that one of its brand names, Stingray, became a common shorthand for all cell site simulators, which are also sometimes called “IMSI catchers.”

In 2019, MPD purchased a new model from Tactical Support Equipment, a North Carolina-based veteran-owned company which sells everything from K9 camera systems to cables and night-vision cameras. The company does not appear to advertise its cell phone tracking systems on its website. 
Tactical Support Equipment, which did not respond to requests for comment for this story, sold MPD a single cell site simulator in 2019 for $498,900, according to purchasing division records from the time. Later that same year, MPD purchased a C-Hostile Emitter Angle Tracker (C-HEATR), which is a remote handheld mapping device that works together with the cell site simulator. 
Three years later in 2022, MPD upgraded the cell tracking gear by adding a four-channel “5G enabler solution” for $328,700, and a 12-channel portable base station with full 5G coverage (as well as insurance, training, and supporting equipment) for $951,750. 
Responding to questions from Wisconsin Examiner, MPD said that the most recent upgrades will be to “support devices operating in 5G.” The department added that “MPD is the only agency in the area that has a [cell site simulator]. When an agency needs assistance with an investigation and their request falls in line with our operating best practices, we try to provide that agency with assistance.” 
Although cell site simulators are less of an enigma than they used to be, many questions still remain. While MPD states that its technology can only track location, cell site simulators as a family of devices are known to be capable of intercepting calls and text messages, and even more exotic abilities like sending fake short messages to a target phone. In Milwaukee, local activists have long reported strange phone malfunctions and service disruptions which they suspect may be caused by law enforcement surveillance.

MPD has repeatedly denied responsibility for the claims, and has said in the past that the department’s cell site simulators do not cause malfunctions to target phones. When the Wisconsin Examiner reached out for this story, however, MPD said for the first time that “the equipment already will disrupt service to the target phone when the target phone is located. That disruption is limited to the time it takes for the operator to narrow down the location of the device.” 
The department has also repeatedly stated that its cell site simulators cannot intercept calls or text messages. A different technology known as PenLink is used by MPD for Title III investigations, which involve intercepting content of communications. In responses to Wisconsin Examiner, MPD cited Department of Justice policies and U.S. law which state that “cell site simulator technology must be configured as pen registers, and may not be used to collect contents of any communication.” Wisconsin Examiner reached out to the Wisconsin Department of Justice for more information and has not received a response. 
From 2021 to 2023, Republicans introduced bills that would have changed  how pen registers are defined in Wisconsin. Supporters of the bills, which did not pass, said that they would allow law enforcement to pursue pen registers for social media. Telecommunications experts, however, warned that the bills could open a “back door” for police to use cell site simulator devices in ways not well understood by judges or the public. 
There have been more calls for more oversight of police surveillance in Milwaukee recently, with local activists pushing for  Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) ordinances. Over two dozen U.S. cities have already passed such ordinances, which provide more transparency about the purchase and use of surveillance technologies by police departments. MPD stresses that it uses cell site simulators in accordance with DOJ policy “and only after a court order is granted in cases that are not exigent,” the department said in a statement. “There is a process in place in which utilization of the equipment is only done with supervisory approval and oversight.”

The latest Clean Jobs America report — published by San Francisco-based business group Environmental Entrepreneurs, or E2 — indicated that clean energy occupations across the United States grew by 2.8% in 2024, adding nearly 100,000 jobs and outpacing broader employment growth of 0.8%.
In Indiana, however, the pace was slower.
The report found that Indiana saw just 0.4% growth in clean energy jobs in 2024, bringing the total to approximately 90,015 Hoosier jobs. That compares to Indiana’s 2023 base of around 89,600 to 90,000 jobs. In 2022, Indiana had about 88,400 clean energy jobs, and 85,298 in 2021.
Story continues below.

Within the clean energy job categories in Indiana, 53,445 jobs jobs were in the energy efficiency subsector; 20,331 jobs were related to clean vehicles; 12,017 jobs were in renewable generation; 3,404 jobs were in storage and grid modernization; and 818 jobs were in biofuels.
Energy efficiency — Indiana’s largest subsector — grew by just 0.1% in 2024, essentially flat compared to the prior year. Renewable generation jobs in the state increased 1.5% year over year, while storage and grid modernization rose 3.2%. Clean vehicles, meanwhile, grew by about 4.2% in Indiana, continuing as the fastest-growing subsector. Biofuels saw no measurable increase.
Regionally, the Midwest added around 13,293 clean energy jobs in 2024, equal to about 1.7% growth.
Though the overall growth was modest, clean-vehicle employment remains one of the stronger performing subsectors in Indiana.
Nationwide, clean-vehicle jobs more than doubled between 2020 and 2024, though 2024 saw a slight year-over-year dip.
Clean vehicle jobs across the U.S. declined by 3% last year — about 12,000 positions — even as Indiana managed a small gain. Energy efficiency nationwide grew by 2.6%, renewable generation grew 5.1%, and storage and grid modernization jumped 7.5%. Biofuels fell 0.4%.
Indiana’s clean vehicle jobs grew from 19,513 in 2023 to 20,331 in 2024 — an increase of 818 positions. That growth put the Hoosier State in the top tier of Midwest states for clean vehicle employment, trailing only Michigan and Ohio.
Indiana’s clean vehicle workforce is also heavily tied to manufacturing, according to the report. More than 70% of the state’s clean vehicle jobs are in making or assembling parts and components, compared to about 56% nationally.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Three weeks after cuts to Oklahoma providers were first reported, the Mental Health Department doesn’t have concrete numbers on how much needs to be cut to right size the agency’s budget.
Maria Chaverri, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, said the agency has not publicly identified a dollar amount for how many cuts are necessary, but knows there was previous overspending that the current administration is working to correct by making strategic cuts.
Nearly 800 contracts for mental health and substance abuse providers have been reviewed, but the agency’s final decisions on cuts are still being finalized, Chaverri said. Until the agency has completed its review process, a solid number of cuts or the total dollar amount saved won’t be provided, she said. 
But Chaverri said as of Thursday, 300 line items, or pieces of provider contracts for specific services, had been identified for cancellation or nonrenewal as part of its process to identify duplicative or unnecessary services. This is being done in an effort to right-size its state appropriated budget of $400 million budget under the direction of Interim Commissioner Gregory Slavonic.

In the tumultuous final weeks of Legislature’s session, deficiencies in the agency’s budget first came to light and led to weeks of investigative hearings, the firing of former Commissioner Allie Friesen and an emergency supplemental appropriation so the agency could make payroll. 
Various reports, including from the State Auditor and Inspector and the Legislative Office for Fiscal Transparency, found a pattern of overspending at the state agency. 
“We know because of those reports, we have to reduce,” Chaverri said. “We’ve been overspending for like 10 years. … It’s a difficult problem to solve. But that’s been the systemic approach. It’s not, ‘Let’s make cuts at random.’ It’s, ‘I’m going to go line by line.’”
No essential services will be cut from any of Oklahoma’s 77 counties, she said. “Essential services” include items like competency restoration, 24/7 crisis care like the 988 mental health hotline, inpatient psychiatric treatment, outpatient mental health and substance use treatment, direct services through state facilities, among others.
The agency has also cut more than 20 executive positions, leading to $3.5 million in annual savings, she said. 
If extra “non-essential” services need to be funded, the Mental Health Department will need additional funding from the Legislature, Chaverri said. 
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who led a legislative investigative committee into the agency’s finances, said lawmakers knew at the conclusion of session the supplemental appropriation wouldn’t fix the agency’s budgetary issues and it was expected that changes would be made at the Mental Health Department.

Lawson said it’s “appropriate” to not have a number at this point, and he’d rather that the agency be thorough and not put out erroneous numbers, which would sow instability and erode legislative and public trust. 
“In a field where every day is kind of uncertain for folks in crisis, we just want to have a stable and robust network of services to be there for people when they need it,” he said. “And the last thing I think we need across the board is uncertainty or ‘Well, they said it was this number last month, and now they’re saying it’s this number,’ so now there’s no trust.”
Lawson said the Mental Health Department has brought in financial experts to help rectify its budget issues, including the business management company Deloitte. 
Lawmakers from the House and Senate were briefed about potential contract cuts about a month ago and the Mental Health Department had initially identified around $50 million in contracts related to substance use disorder that could be duplicative, Lawson said. This doesn’t necessarily mean all $50 million will be cut. 
While he said there will be some disruption, if the cuts later result in a “glaring gap” in services, his committee will be prepared to deal with revisiting contracts.
He said he’s confident the Legislature will be able to work with the agency to reach an accurate budget for the next fiscal year, but there could be more “bumps in the road.” 
Providers have reached out to him and other lawmakers, Lawson said. He’s heard mixed answers about how they can handle the cuts. Larger providers have told Lawson they can pivot and adapt to the changes, while smaller providers are more concerned. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“You’re not going to find a single provider that says, ‘Hey, you know what? We really don’t provide any value to the state, or we don’t provide good service,’” Lawson said. “They’re not going to say that. They all think that they’re doing great work. And they’re concerned about the folks that they take care of. But then also their business, too, is if some of these proposed cuts are deep enough, it may cause them to have to make some very serious business decisions, including closing their doors.”
Sen. Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, was also briefed on the cuts and said she was surprised by them. Kirt said she asked the agency what the goal of the cuts was. She said she wasn’t provided a dollar amount but was told the agency is aiming to “live within its means.” 
“Yes, look for efficiency,” she said. “Yes, make sure you’re not wasting money. No question, we want them doing that, but automatically cutting a bunch with no clear number in mind concerns me.”
Kirt said she respects the interim commissioner and said he’s a “very honest player trying to do the right thing,” but she’s worried about overly focusing on the budget’s dollar amount rather than the sought-after improved outcomes. 
“The Legislature should not be micromanaging every contract,” she said. “But we do need to understand what the priorities are.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)It’s ironic that a man who built his political career railing passionately about teachers “unions” will soon be running one of his own.
But in a way it’s almost fitting that it will be the next move for Oklahoma education Superintendent Ryan Walters, who has made it his mission to babble bizarre, inflammatory rhetoric and launch random witchhunts against educators and their unions.
Maybe it will help him recenter on who is vitally important to the success of our public schools — the teachers. Because if he truly wants to be successful, the role will require him to collaborate with them and show some empathy toward their needs.
Those are two skillsets that he’s been sorely lacking the past two years and 10 months in his elected position. 
And maybe it will serve as a rude awakening that he’s betrayed the trust of Oklahomans who believed he could turn our schools around. They’ll now find themselves with a politically appointed leader they didn’t get to choose, for the remaining year or so of what should have been Walters’ term.
In case you weren’t randomly tuned into Fox News at 10:43 p.m. Wednesday, Walters was allotted just under 40 seconds on a national conservative talk program to announce he has accepted a new role as CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance. The group bills itself as an “alternative to traditional union membership,” but provides “professional support services and resources” for educators.
The group, which so far boasts a measly 2,800 members nationwide, is a new effort of the Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit “dedicated to fighting government overreach, defending workers’ rights and protecting constitutional freedom.”
“For decades, union bosses have poisoned our schools with politics and propaganda while abandoning parents, students, and good teachers. That ends today. We’re going to expose them, fight them, and take back our classrooms,” Walters said in a statement released by the Freedom Foundation. “At the Teacher Freedom Alliance, we’re giving educators real freedom, freedom from the liberal, woke agenda that has corrupted public education. We will arm teachers with the tools, support, and freedom they need, without forcing them to give up their values.”
The Teacher Freedom Alliance sure sounds like it has the same mission of a teachers union — you know, those groups Walters has loved to hate.
In January, Walters launched a tone deaf tirade attempting to link schools and teachers unions to the deadly truck attack in New Orleans and even used the phrase “terrorist training camps” to describe school classrooms.
This year, he also falsely claimed teachers unions love standardized testing (they don’t).
He pushed the state Board of Education to take away the teaching license of a former Norman High School educator for sharing a QR code to the Brooklyn Public Library’s free online catalog. He is trying to revoke two other educators’ licenses over social media posts related to the 2024 assassination attempt of President Donald Trump.
And most recently, he’s threatened to ban teachers for things they’ve posted on social media about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Now he’s going to be something of a union boss himself? That was not a square on my 2025 bingo card.
While the Teacher Freedom Alliance bills itself as a “viable alternative to unions,” it does appear to share many similarities with Oklahoma’s organizing groups. In Oklahoma, a few of the largest districts do have groups that collectively bargain for educators, but most don’t. However, one thing that makes Oklahoma’s associations different from unions in other states is that they cannot strike. But much like the Teacher Freedom Alliance, Oklahoma’s organizations provide their members liability insurance if they ever get sued as well as professional development training and an “engaged community of educators.”
In light of his new job, it sure appears that Walters has been spewing a whole lot of hyperbole about educators that he actually doesn’t believe. That’s pretty sad for our children and the teachers we’ve entrusted to educate them.
It also appears that Walters never intended to actually help fix our school system. Instead, he used the post that we entrusted him with to try to gain the attention of conservative groups so he could grab a cushy job.
Oklahoma voters — and teachers — deserve better. They deserve a public official who is committed to rolling up their sleeves and working together, and not someone who flees in terror when things get hard. And they need someone who is competent and understands how schools work and who isn’t motivated by grabbing headlines.
Hopefully fellow Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt will choose carefully when it comes time to fill the role. He’ll get to pick Walters’ successor once he officially resigns.
Walters has proven he doesn’t have a lot of respect for the voters who elected and believed in him if last night was any indication.
He couldn’t be bothered to let Oklahomans know he was leaving in a publicly accessible forum. Instead, he chose a late-night, cable talk show slot, which many Oklahomans don’t have access to, to announce he’s washing his hands of us.
Walters was likely a frontrunner in the 2026 gubernatorial race. I say that judging from the multitude of emails in support of him that I’ve received from people all over the state the past two years.
If he still harbored any plans to run for governor, I think he’s shot himself in the foot.
Oklahomans don’t like quitters. And they certainly don’t like hypocrites who preach one thing publicly while secretly believing something else.

The 441-million-ton coal lease that lingered for years for lack of industry interest is now on the selling block.
The post Feds set auction date for first major Wyoming coal lease in a decade appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. Bureau of Land Management issued a “record of decision” Thursday, greenlighting the sale of 441 million tons of coal in the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming — the first major federal coal lease offering in the region in a decade.
The West Antelope III coal lease will go to competitive auction on Oct. 8, the agency said. 
Though the 3,508-acre tract contains approximately 441 million tons of coal, the estimated “recoverable” volume is about 365 million tons, according to the BLM. “The recoverable coal volume and duration of leased reserves is driven by economics and subject to change,” the agency said.
The tract is associated with Navajo Transitional Energy Company’s Antelope mine and spans areas of Campbell and Converse counties. Navajo Transitional’s predecessor, Cloud Peak Energy, nominated the tract in 2015, kicking off the BLM’s review process. But federal action on the request went idle when Cloud Peak filed for bankruptcy in 2019. The company eventually sold its Powder River Basin mines to Navajo Transitional. The BLM revived the lease sale approval process just days after the One Big Beautiful Bill was signed in July.

“This coal leasing effort directly supports the Trump administration’s goals of reinvigorating the American coal industry, reducing reliance on foreign energy, and creating good-paying jobs in rural communities,” the agency said in a press release. “It also aligns with Secretary [Doug] Burgum’s vision of unleashing domestic energy production while streamlining federal processes and ensuring long-term economic growth.”
The West Antelope III coal lease, along with 14.5 million tons of extra coal reserves included in a pending modification plan for the Antelope mine, would add about 18 years to the life of the mine, according to BLM estimates. The Antelope mine extracts 20-25 million tons annually and employs about 400 workers, according to the company. It’s the third-largest coal mine in the nation in terms of production, federal records show.
The size of the coal lease, as well as the Trump administration’s expedited timeline to put it up for auction, is cause for concern, according to the Sheridan-based Powder River Basin Resource Council, which formed in the 1970s, in part, to watchdog the industry.
“Where’s the market for this lease, and does the lease make sense in the current market?” Resource Council Executive Director Donna Birkholz wants to know.
Though the Powder River Basin coal industry has benefited from a slowdown in coal-burning electric power plant retirements, it’s a long way from recovering from a steep market slide that began 15 years ago, cutting the mining district’s annual production by nearly half.
Lingering uncertainty about the industry’s future underscores concerns about potential environmental impacts if coal companies are unable to make good on reclamation requirements, Birkholz added.
The Resource Council, along with other conservation groups, has also noted that recent cuts to coal royalty rates — by both Wyoming and the federal government — will result in lower revenues to state and federal coffers compared to past coal leases.Visit this BLM website to learn more about the West Antelope III coal lease.

(Photo by Idaho Capital Sun)Getting a COVID vaccine is different this year. 
Under the Trump administration, federal government agencies limited eligibility and, just last week, softened recommendations for who should receive them.
But most people who want to be vaccinated for COVID should still be able to, and their health insurance would probably cover it, said Idaho’s state epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn.
“No one is prohibited from getting the vaccination based on those recommendations,” Hahn told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
Here’s a guide on how to get vaccines for COVID and the flu in the Gem State.
 Am I eligible for the COVID vaccine?

In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID-19 vaccines but limited them to people aged 65 and older and younger people (age six months to age 64) who are at risk for severe illness. 
There’s a long list of things that put people at high risk for severe COVID. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, says that can include mental health conditions, being overweight, not being physically active, being a current or former smoker, cancer, heart conditions, having a weakened immune system and more. 
Most adults can likely identify they have something on the CDC’s list, Hahn said. And even if you aren’t sure the vaccine isn’t licensed for you, she said doctors can still prescribe it.
“If you say, ‘I might not have this condition, but my spouse does. I take care of my spouse who has cancer, and I really want to be protected.’ That is certainly something that can still be done,” Hahn told the Idaho Capital Sun. “It is considered off-label, but this is … the same type of vaccine that you may have received in years past and should be safe for you.”
 Is COVID still spreading?

In Idaho, COVID spread is up, according to the limited public health data still available after officials scaled back reporting after the pandemic ended. 
There’s less COVID-19 data now. But here’s how to track the virus in Idaho.

Idaho’s hospitalizations are rising, and 30 nursing homes in the state recently had patients sick with COVID, Hahn said. 
“When we start hearing that, we know COVID is out there,” she said. 
Idaho’s wastewater levels for COVID are “very high,” according to the CDC’s tracker. 
ER visits for COVID-like illness are also up in Idaho to around 50 to 80 a day in the first couple weeks of this month, compared to around 40 a day in July, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s tracker. 
Flu is seasonal. But COVID isn’t, said Dr. Sky Blue, an infectious disease doctor in Boise. 
“It’s not a wait till October kind of thing if you want your protection,” he told the Sun. “And we know that there’s circulating cases right now.”
Research shows COVID vaccines reduce the risk of death, serious disease, visits to the emergency department and even long-COVID, a chronic condition that persists even after infection ends. 
Hahn said she still gets vaccinated to reduce the risk of getting long-COVID.
 Is the COVID shot recommended for me? 

Last week, the CDC’s top vaccine panel softened recommendations for who should get COVID vaccines.
The recommendations could emphasize the risk of COVID vaccines and stress individual decisionmaking, even though the CDC’s data shows that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people, the Georgia Recorder reported. But the panel didn’t pull back the CDC’s recommendations that younger people, between six months old and 64 years old, get vaccinated.
CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

To become official, the panel’s recommendations require approval by CDC leaders. 
In a statement, officials for the CDC’s parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the panel’s recommendations include “an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination in individuals under age 65 is most favorable for those who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 and lowest for individuals who are not at an increased risk, according to the CDC list of COVID-19 risk factors.”
“It’s a nuanced recommendation,” Hahn said. “But essentially, for Idahoans, what’s important to know is that if you would like to get the COVID vaccine, it should be available and recommended for you.”
Asked how people should decide if they should get the COVID vaccine, she suggested people assess their own risk — and the risk of people they are around.
As the federal government’s health agencies, led by U.S. health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., restricted vaccine access this year, more than a dozen states protected vaccine access, Stateline reported. 
Idaho wasn’t one of them.
“We felt that what (the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel) came up with last week actually can align with what we would like to do, which is that people 6 months and older who are interested in getting the vaccine, we believe should have access to the vaccine,” Hahn told the Sun. “We’re seeing that pharmacies are carrying it. We know our pharmacists can prescribe it, but if people want to go talk to their doctor about it, that they have that choice as well.”
 Will insurance still cover the COVID vaccines?

Many insurance companies say they’ll keep covering COVID vaccines. 
Before the CDC vaccine advisory panel’s vote, a group representing most major insurers in the U.S. pledged to continue covering COVID vaccines.
“Health plans will continue to cover all … immunizations that were recommended as of September 1, 2025, including updated formulations of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, with no cost-sharing for patients through the end of 2026,” America’s Health Insurance Plans said in a statement. 
In Idaho, at least two major insurers have made similar commitments.
“We continue to cover COVID-19 vaccines for our members, as we have in the past, and are monitoring the regulatory environment,” Blue Cross of Idaho spokesperson Bret Rumbeck told the Sun in a statement. “We encourage members to talk with their healthcare provider about the vaccine.”
Regence BlueShield of Idaho’s parent company issued a similar statement last week, saying “Coverage for COVID-19 vaccinations remains unchanged through the end of 2025.”
But if you wonder whether your insurer will cover a COVID vaccine, Hahn recommends checking with them or your doctor or pharmacist. 
 How will pharmacies give out the COVID vaccine?

How pharmacies interpret the new COVID vaccine eligibility could vary, Blue said. He recommends calling ahead if you want to know what the pharmacy would require from you to get the vaccine. 
 What about the flu vaccine?

Hahn recommends everyone consider getting the flu shot. Earlier this month, a CDC report found that the last flu season was “high-severity.”
“Even if you’re not too worried about getting a severe case, it could keep you from missing work, missing school, missing out on your day-to-day life,” she said. 
Doctors say it’s safe to get the flu vaccine at the same time as the COVID vaccine.
But if you like to get your vaccines separately, Hahn recommended getting the COVID vaccine first because the virus is already circulating. 
Some doctors recommend waiting until late September or early October to get the flu shot. That’s because immunity from flu shots can wear off, but the flu season usually reaches its peak around February each year, and can stretch into the spring.
But Blue said if people are already gearing up to get their COVID vaccines, they can get their flu shot at the same time. 
“I think the chances of missing it are a bigger risk,” he said of the flu shot.

(Photo via Palmyra Fire Rescue Facebook page)The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Under a proposed partnership with federal Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE), the Palmyra Police Department would focus on criminals — not on people simply because they might be immigrants without legal status, the department’s interim police chief told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview last week. 
Interim Police Chief Paul Blount also said that partnering with ICE would allow department officers to get access to databases and resources to better fight serious crimes, such as drug trafficking and human trafficking.
Along with the proposed partnership deal, the Palmyra department has the potential to receive payments for its involvement. According to CBS 58 News, Blount said last week that the agreement might “be the difference in this next year of having officers on the street during the daytime and nighttime.”
Blount spoke with the Wisconsin Examiner for about 40 minutes Thursday about the village’s proposed ICE partnership. The arrangement, under the ICE task force model, would grant officers limited authority to enforce immigration law while performing routine police duties. The department would also receive reimbursements from ICE. 
Task force agreements with ICE were discontinued in 2012, but the government has revived the program in President Donald Trump’s second term, Stateline reported.
The 287(g) program allows participating local law enforcement to enforce certain aspects of U.S. immigration law in partnerships with ICE. While 13 Wisconsin counties have a sheriff’s department partnering with ICE, Palmyra would be the only 287(g) partnership in Wisconsin between a police department and ICE. 
The Palmyra partnership would also be the only 287(g) partnership in Wisconsin using the task force model. Other models focus on people who are already in custody. 
The proposal still awaits approval by the Palmyra village board. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin issued a press release last week criticizing the potential partnership, saying the department is “partnering hand in glove with ICE to carry out this regime’s plan to deport our immigrant neighbors and loved ones.” 
Chief: Little change for police operations
In his interview with the Wisconsin Examiner, Blount said that under the arrangement with ICE, the village police department would not be operating much differently than it does now. 
In addition to cooperating with the federal government, Blount said,  “Obviously the financial incentive that was newly added that goes along with it was another reason why we looked at this program, and said, ‘We’re already doing a majority of what this involves. So why would we not collaborate with them, and then we could have the financial incentive that goes along with it.’” 
The ICE website says officers may also exercise limited immigration authority as active participants on ICE-led task forces. 
In its statement, the ACLU said that the task force model “gives officers the green light to stop people they think might be immigrants on the street, question them about their citizenship status, and even take them into custody.”
Blount said the department will not go door to door to check individuals’ documentation or profile people who they think may lack documentation. Palmyra police will collaborate with ICE when someone is involved in criminal activity, wanted on a warrant or facing criminal charges, he said. 
Blount, who is also the director of public safety for the village, said he is one of three full-time officers in the department, along with five part-time officers. 
Asked whether a Palmyra Police Department officer might ask people about their immigration status if they are pulled over for traffic violations — rather than something that would lead police to take a driver to jail — Blount said he didn’t think that was likely. 
 “For a simple traffic stop, that is something that we would be allowed to do,” Blount said, “and I would say that I haven’t made a final decision on that yet. If it involves criminal traffic, the answer to that would be yes, if it’s criminal traffic. So there are certain things that rise to the element of criminal traffic law…but basic traffic [offenses] like a speeding ticket, probably not.”
Blount said that distinction would potentially be detailed in a policy if the village moves ahead with the partnership.  
In its statement, the ACLU of Wisconsin raised concerns about racial profiling. A 2011 Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination in an Arizona task force. 
The ACLU also called for “a balanced approach to immigration that includes both humane border management and a pathway to citizenship.”
If Palmyra moves forward with the partnership, Blount said he is leaning “towards establishing policies and procedures to prevent any type of profiling that the agreement has the potential for.” 
ICE now lists Palmyra Police Department as a participating 287(g) agency with the task force model, with a signature date of Monday, Sept. 22. Blount said the department received federal approval on Wednesday. 
The department’s application for the task force model is pending review by the village board, Blount said, and the board’s vote will be posted on a meeting agenda before it takes place. 
Officers who will be involved must take 40 hours of training and education, which has not started yet, Blount said.  
A financial boon
Blount said the program would come with significant financial incentives from the federal government. 
At the time of his interview with the Wisconsin Examiner, Blount was unsure of the exact amounts that Palmyra would receive. He later sent the Examiner a press release from the Department of Homeland Security dated Sept. 17, which includes details about reimbursement opportunities that will begin Oct. 1. 
A 287(g) fact sheet on ICE’s website contains a section titled “Task Force Model Reimbursement Plan Benefits,” which include $7,500 for equipment for each trained task force officer, $100,000 for new vehicles, salary and benefits reimbursed per trained task force officer and overtime funds up to 25% of salary.
Agencies will also be able to receive quarterly performance awards, up to $1,000 per eligible task force officer, based on “the successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance to further ICE’s mission to defend the homeland,” the ICE press release states.
Members of the village board did not respond to interview requests from the Wisconsin Examiner.
In his interview, Blount said he believes he and the board are listening to community questions.
“We’ve had a fair amount of support and a fair amount of, lack of a better term, negativity and pushback for the potential pending agreement,” Blount said. “So we’re listening to both sides and listening to that feedback, and I think obviously the board then will make their decision based on that.”
Blount said he didn’t think the village board would weigh in on the specifics of how he participates in the agreement. 
“They usually don’t get involved in my operations per se,” he said.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner) LINCOLN — Conservative and liberal students at Nebraska colleges say they want to turn down the temperature on the heated political dialogue dominating national conversations in the weeks since the killing of Charlie Kirk.
But they’ve got their work cut out.
The call for a return to civil discourse among young Nebraskans comes against the backdrop of President Donald Trump pledging to use the federal government to investigate political foes on the “radical left.” 
Ethnie Barnhouse, the president of University of Nebraska-Lincoln chapter of Kirk’s political organization Turning Point USA, which was designed to engage college students, said she hopes more young conservatives will “be bold and be courageous” and speak openly with others about their views. 
“They’re going to think you’re some evil person … I want people not to be afraid to have those conversations,” Barnhouse said at a UNL campus vigil honoring Kirk days after he was killed. “Because a lot of the time, when people think that about you, it’s just because they haven’t talked to you, and they don’t actually know what you believe.” 
After the vigil — whose speakers included Nebraska volleyball middle blocker Rebekah Allick and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican – Barnhouse took questions from fellow students and community members who wanted to get more involved with Turning Point. Barnhouse said she was surprised by the turnout and level of interest.

Campus conservatives at some of the state’s largest schools in Lincoln and Omaha credited Kirk for encouraging them to be more open about their political views in what many described as environments hostile  to conservatism. Several said they plan to make sharper efforts to organize young people while also calling for more civil dialogue with people across the political spectrum. 
Young liberals also hope for more civil disagreement, rather than the rhetoric often seen on social media and among politicians. Troy Kallhoff, president of the UNL chapter of the Young Democrats, said he was deeply disturbed that people would try to “resolve political divide and political grievance” with violence. 
“Regardless of how much I disagree with him or any other political activist or politician, I would never wish for them to be murdered or killed,” Kallhoff said.  
Kirk was shot during a Turning Point event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, in early September. The 22-year-old man accused of killing Kirk, Tyler Robinson, had sent text messages to his romantic partner that he had “had enough of [Kirk’s] hatred” and that “some hate can’t be negotiated out,” according to Utah prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty.
The Kirk shooting was the latest instance of political violence in the U.S. An arsonist burned the Pennsylvania Governor’s Mansion in April. Two Israeli Embassy staffers were killed in Washington, D.C. in May. A Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband were shot and killed in June. A Georgia man was indicted in June for allegedly making threats across state lines against Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Nebraska U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer.

Dona-Gene Barton, a UNL political science professor who studies political behavior, said political violence isn’t new in American history. But she said this political moment is different because of high levels of “affective polarization.” 
“It’s a context where the rhetoric and the effect of polarization among political elites [and] average citizens is [already] at a dangerous [level] to begin with,” Barton said. 
Kirk and Turning Point, which he founded in 2012, were credited with mobilizing younger voters to support Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Trump made gains with young people, a demographic Democrats previously dominated, which helped him win the popular vote. 
But Kirk also appealed to some in the Republican base with his statements directed at minorities. He criticized LGBTQ rights, suggested more women should stay home and not work and criticized the Civil Rights Act of 1964, along with some of Martin Luther King Jr.’s work. 
Among Turning Point’s best-known projects was the “Professor Watchlist,” which published the names of college professors in a searchable format by categories including “anti-Christian views,” “feminism,” “climate alarmist” and “racial ideology.” 
Despite the controversies, many young conservatives, including UNL student Zoey Salem, credited Kirk for engaging students and encouraging them to speak freely.

“Even as a conservative, I didn’t agree with everything he said, but that wasn’t really the point of Charlie Kirk to me,” said Salem. “The point was that he was giving a platform to all people.”
Kallhoff, of the UNL Young Democrats, said he hopes that after Kirk’s assassination people can “come together and have civilized conversations” and understand that “we’re all trying to make the country better.” 
Creighton University students Emma Smith and Hannah Sobczyk said people need to stop hiding behind social media and start having face-to-face conversations again. At the end of the day, Sobczyk said, people need to respect that people have different political beliefs.
“We’re all people,” Smith said. 
Barton, the political scientist, said she hopes politicians will tone down the rhetoric used in response to Kirk’s death, because it “doesn’t do any good for trying to calm the tensions.”
“In the past, political elites, when you had incidents of political violence in this country, they would try to be more unifying,” Barton said. “Some … have responded by trying to weaponize this event.”
At UNL, Barnhouse said she is focused on honoring Kirk’s legacy.
“My life would look very different if it weren’t for Charlie Kirk,” Barnhouse said. 
Kallhoff said the next generation is tired of the political divide and government stagnation
“The only option is for it to get better,” Kallhoff said.

(Getty Images)As health insurance carriers change private plans for Medicare, Idaho officials are encouraging people to review their policies during open enrollment next month.
Open enrollment for Medicare — when people can change their insurance coverage — starts Oct. 15 and ends Dec. 7. But insurers have been changing, and even pulling out of, Medicare Advantage, which are private plans for the federal health insurance program for older Americans and people with disabilities.
“Consumers should use this annual Open Enrollment Period to compare plans, confirm that their doctors and prescriptions are covered, and seek free, objective help …” Idaho Department of Insurance Director Dean Cameron said in a statement. “Taking action early ensures uninterrupted coverage and continued access to quality care. Most importantly, consumers should know they are not alone — our team is ready to help every step of the way.”
He recommended several options to get help: directly from the Idaho Department of Insurance; through the agency’s program for Senior Health Insurance Benefit Advisors, also known as SHIBA; or from a local insurance agent. 
More than half of people eligible for Medicare are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, which tend to cover extra benefits than traditional Medicare. 
 How are Medicare Advantage plans changing?

Because of rising costs, less federal payments and new regulations, some insurers who offer Medicare Advantage Plans are reducing benefits, trimming provider networks and leaving some areas, the Department of Insurance announced in a news release last week. Last year, after many insurers pulled Medicare Advantage plans, more than a million patients needed to find new health insurance, Stateline reported. 
Idaho Department of Insurance officials expect plans to be withdrawn in 2026. But even if plans stay in Idaho, agency officials say benefits or provider networks could change. 
By Oct. 1, all people enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans should receive an explanation of any changes to their plan from the insurance carrier through a letter called an Annual Notice of Change.
Right now, seven insurance carriers offer Medicare Advantage plans in Idaho counties. 
If plans are canceled, people affected may be able to switch plans, through Medicare Advantage or traditional Medicare, if they qualify for a special enrollment period. 
 How can you get help on Medicare in Idaho?

In Idaho, contact the Department of Insurance’s SHIBA program for free assistance to help compare plans, answer questions, review coverage options, help with complaints and enroll in Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans.
To contact SHIBA or enroll in the program’s monthly Medicare webinar workshops, call 1-800-247-4422.

Finding caregivers to come to their home has been challenging, so Fabrello has learned to give the care that would ordinarily be performed by a doctor, skilled nurse, or highly trained therapist. (Aaron Marco/KFF Health News)Every day for nearly 18 years, Alessandra Fabrello has been a medical caregiver for her son, on top of being his mom.
“It is almost impossible to explain what it takes to keep a child alive who should be dead,” said Fabrello, whose son, Ysadore Maklakoff, experienced a rare brain condition called acute necrotizing encephalopathy at 9 months old.
Idaho cuts doctor pay rates for Medicaid. More cuts could come, Health and Welfare says.

Through North Carolina’s Medicaid program, Maklakoff qualifies for a large slate of medical care in the family’s home in Chapel Hill. Fabrello said she works with staffing agencies to arrange services. She also learned to give the care ordinarily performed by a doctor, skilled nurse, or highly trained therapist because she often can’t get help.
Now, broad cuts to North Carolina Medicaid will make finding and paying for care even more difficult.
Nationwide, states are scrambling to close budget shortfalls and are eyeing Medicaid, generally one of a state’s biggest costs — even before President Donald Trump’s hulking tax-and-spending law decreases federal spending on Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next decade.
North Carolina and Idaho have already announced plans to cut Medicaid payments to health care providers, including hospitals, doctors and caregivers.
In Michigan and Pennsylvania — where lawmakers have yet to pass budgets this year — spending on Medicaid is part of those debates. In Washington state, lawmakers approved cuts to the program that will not affect who is eligible, said Hayden Mackley, a spokesperson for the state’s Office of Financial Management.
 What types of health services does Medicaid cover?

Medicaid is government health insurance for people with low incomes or disabilities and both state and federal dollars pay for the program.
North Carolina’s Medicaid agency announced it will institute on Oct. 1 a minimum 3% reduction in pay for all providers who treat Medicaid patients. Primary care doctors face an 8% cut and specialty doctors a 10% drop in payments, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Fabrello said her son’s dentist already called to say the office will not accept Medicaid patients come November. Fabrello fears dental work will become another service her son qualifies for but can’t get because there aren’t enough providers who accept Medicaid coverage.
Occupational and speech therapy, nursing care, and respite care are all difficult or impossible to get, she said. In a good week, her son will get 50 hours of skilled nursing care out of the 112 hours he qualifies for.
“When you say, ‘We’re just cutting provider rates,’ you’re actually cutting access for him for all his needs,” Fabrello said.
Shannon Dowler, former chief medical officer for North Carolina Medicaid, said that reduced payments to dentists and other providers will lower the number of providers in the state’s Medicaid network and result in “an immediate loss of access to care, worse outcomes, and cause higher downstream costs.”
The imminent cuts in North Carolina “don’t have anything to do” with the new federal law that cuts Medicaid funding, Dowler said.
“This is like the layers of the onion,” she said. “We are hurting ourselves in North Carolina way ahead of the game, way before we need to do this.” North Carolina alone is projected to lose about $23 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade.
More than 3 million North Carolinians are enrolled in Medicaid. Deadlocked state lawmakers agreed to a mini budget in July to continue funding state programs that gave the Medicaid agency $319 million less than it requested. Lawmakers can choose to reinstate funding for Medicaid this fiscal year, Dowler said.
“We all hope it changes,” Dowler said, adding that if it does not, “you’re going to see practices dropping coverage of Medicaid members.”

Each year since at least 2019, North Carolina’s Medicaid agency has asked for more money than it received from the state legislature. A variety of federal resources, including money provided to states during the covid-19 pandemic, helped bridge the gap.
But those funds are gone this year, leaving the agency with a choice: Eliminate some optional parts of the program or force every provider that accepts the public insurance to take a pay cut. The state opted mostly for the latter.
“It’s a difficult moment for North Carolina,” said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid. The cut in the budget is “absolutely the opposite direction of where we really want to go, need to go, have been headed as a state.”
For Anita Case, who leads a small group of health clinics in North Carolina, the cuts make it harder to take care of the “most vulnerable in our community.”
Western North Carolina Community Health Services’ three clinics serve about 15,000 patients in and around Asheville, including many non-English-speaking tourism workers. Case said she will look at staffing, services, and contracts to find places to trim.
 Medicaid cuts in Idaho met with backlash from health providers, operators and advocacy groups

Idaho has about 350,000 people enrolled in Medicaid. This month, state leaders there responded to an $80 million state budget shortfall by cutting Medicaid pay rates 4% across the board.
The broad cuts have raised backlash from nursing home operators and patient advocacy groups. Leaders of one nursing home company wrote in a recent op-ed in the Idaho Statesman newspaper that 75% to 100% of the funding at their facilities comes from Medicaid and the cuts will force them to “to reduce staff or accept fewer residents.”
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said the state faced tough choices. It forecasted 19% growth in Medicaid spending this year.
The Idaho Hospital Association’s Toni Lawson said the financial strain will be greatest at about two dozen small hospitals — ones with 25 or fewer beds — that dot the state. Lawson, the organization’s chief advocacy officer, said one hospital leader reported they had less than two days’ cash on hand to make payroll. Others reported 30 days’ cash or less, she said.
“Hopefully, none of them will close,” Lawson said, adding that she expects labor and delivery and behavioral health units, which often lose money, to be the first to go because of this latest state reduction in payments. Several hospitals in mostly rural areas of the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, she said.
Nationwide, Medicaid makes up an average of 19% of a state’s general fund spending, second only to K-12 spending, said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies for the National Association of State Budget Officers.
States generally had strong revenue growth in 2021 and 2022 because of economic growth, which included federal aid to stimulate the economy. Revenue growth has since slowed, and some states have cut income and property taxes.
Meanwhile, spending on Medicaid, housing, education, and disaster response has increased, Sigritz said.

In North Carolina, Fabrello has been unable to work outside of caring for her son. Her savings are almost exhausted, Fabrello said, and she was on the brink of financial ruin until North Carolina began allowing parents to be compensated for caregiving duties. She’s received that income for about a year, she said. Without it, she worried about losing her home.
Now, if the state reductions go through, she faces a salary cut.
“As parents, we are indispensable lifelines to our children, and we are struggling to fight for our own survival on top of it,” Fabrello said.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for the Tennessee Lookout)Residents of Memphis are expecting to see a surge in federal and state law enforcement officers in their city as early as today to carry out President Donald Trump’s order for “large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods with law enforcement personnel.”
More than a dozen federal law enforcement agencies, an unspecified number of National Guard members and 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol officers will be part of a “sustained” presence to fight crime in one of the nation’s largest majority Black cities beginning this week, There is no specific end date to the operation, Gov. Bill Lee said Friday. 
National Guard troops will be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service to support local law enforcement and will not be armed nor make arrests, Lee said.
The federal show of force includes immigration enforcement officers; the Tennessee Highway Patrol, under an agreement entered earlier this year, also has immigration enforcement powers.

Local faith leaders, community groups, elected officials and legal rights organizations opposed to hundreds of outside personnel authorized by the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force initiated a series of actions last week in response. 
On Saturday, protestors gathered separately in Memphis and at the state capitol in Nashville to formally launch the “Free the 901” campaign, a coalition formed by local and state nonprofit organizations after Trump issued his executive order Sept. 15 to “restore law and order” to Memphis.
The group has set up a text alert system and said it intends to provide training to residents and coordinate rapid volunteer response to law enforcement actions while advocating for policies to address root causes of violence.
Cardell Orrin, Tennessee director of Stand for Children, said the group’s goal is to find ways to “limit the harm” of the federal presence and identify and provide support to Memphians impacted. 
On Wednesday, the ACLU Tennessee sent a letter to Memphis Mayor Paul Young and Memphis Police Chief C.J. Davis detailing the city’s obligations to comply with a long-running consent decree that protects the First Amendment rights of Memphians.
The Kendrick Consent decree was enacted in 1978 in response to revelations that Memphis police had used a domestic intelligence unit to surveille and target civil rights leaders. The decree was updated in 2020 to include safeguards against police use of modern surveillance technology. 
The agreement between the ACLU and Memphis specifically bars cooperation by Memphis police with federal and state agencies in activities that violate First Amendment rights, including sharing information such as photographs, recordings and social media posts of individuals engaged in lawful protests, absent a legitimate law enforcement reason, according to Stella Yarbrough, ACLU-TN Legal Director 
“The Kendrick Consent Decree represents nearly five decades of protection for Memphis residents’ First Amendment rights,” she said.
Tennessee National Guard set for Memphis deployment next week

“Federal and National Guard involvement in local law enforcement doesn’t diminish these protections. In fact, it makes strict compliance more critical than ever. Memphis police cannot use federal coordination as a backdoor to conduct the very surveillance activities this decree was designed to prevent,” Yarbrough said. 
Memphis officials responded late last week with a request to a meeting with lawyers for the ACLU Tennessee, a spokesperson for the organization confirmed Friday. 
Some city officials in Memphis have also individually taken steps to prepare residents for a surge in law enforcement.
Shelby County General Sessions Clerk Tami Sawyer, who has expressed concerns about the potential impact of the law enforcement influx on already-overcrowded detention centers, issued a public “preventative maintenance checklist” for individuals to protect themselves. 
The list advises individuals to check for or clear outstanding warrants, memorize phone numbers of family or trusted friends and make an emergency plan for children and pets if detained.
Shelby County Commissioner Erica Sugarman, in Washington, DC last week, said she was also sharing information gleaned from advocates in the nation’s capitol after the National Guard deployment there.
Her deepest concern, Sugarman said, is “educating the people how to react and not to react,” particularly young people.

“We’ve got 12th graders who are driving around,” she said. “I want to make sure they know their headlights are working and understand their legal rights, that law enforcement isn’t the judge, jury and prosecutor.”
Appearing alongside the Tennessee governor last week, Memphis’s Democratic Mayor Paul Young, who previously said he had not asked for the federal presence, appeared more conciliatory. The mayor has noted that crime has fallen in Memphis by double digit percentage since January 2024. 
Not all Memphis leaders are opposed to the surge to fight crime in the city. Last week, a resolution to block the deployment and a resolution to set parameters, including a 90-day limit, on a federal law enforcement presence failed to pass at the Shelby County Commission.
“I know there are a lot of questions in our community. There’s a lot of feelings, passionate emotions, whether you’re for it or against it. But as the leader of our city, my goal is to make sure that as resources come into our community, we find ways to use them effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city,” Young said.
Last week, the city of Memphis launched a website to provide updates and information on the federal surge and provide residents with a contact number to lodge complaints. 
“This is our moment to show the world the truth about Memphis,” read a message from Young on the site. “We are a city that rises, a city that leads, and a city that defines itself not by challenges, but by our culture, innovation, and hope.”

Adrian Smith cruised to victory last year.,"Democrat Becky Stille is banking on her moderate approach. (Courtesy of Stille campaign)LINCOLN — Democrat Becky Stille is running for Congress against a 10-term incumbent House Republican in one of the nation’s most conservative districts. 
Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District includes central and western Nebraska and much of the state’s northeastern and southeastern edges. The district is currently represented by U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith of Gering, who, as is typical in Nebraska’s reddest red district, faces a GOP challenger to his right. 
Stille, who lives in South Sioux City, said she decided to run after one of her farmer neighbors had to put up one of his plots of land for auction. While she doesn’t know precisely why that triggered her bid, she felt it “was enough.” 
Another reason, she said, is that she knows President Donald Trump’s budget and tax bill that passed earlier this summer will hurt friends and family members. Stille said she feels the district hasn’t had effective representation in D.C. for a “long time.”
The district currently has 268,246 registered Republicans compared to 70,368 registered Democrats. Including nonpartisans and third-party members, it has 418,138 eligible voters, according to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office.

Stille says she considers herself a moderate Democrat. 
“I’m hoping that it’ll appeal to some of the Republicans … especially like the farmers that have had a bad taste in their mouth,” Stille said, pointing to the impact of Trump’s tariffs and trade disputes on agriculture. 
Stille’s top issues, according to her campaign website, range from supporting labor unions to securing the border and upholding the Second Amendment while having an “equally strong commitment to prevent violence” and  “support a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions privately with her own doctor.” 
She said she would listen to district constituents, which is something she argues Smith isn’t doing. 
The Smith campaign had no immediate comment on the Stille bid. Smith cruised to victory in 2024, winning by 61 percentage points against Democrat Dan Ebers. 
While traveling between work as an agricultural lab tech and campaigning, Stille says she is grateful for the help she is getting from the state party for her campaign. 
Stille acknowledges she is new to the inner workings of politics but said she hopes to help narrow the nation’s political divide. 
“Just because we have different opinions doesn’t mean we can’t work together to get things done,” Stille said.

(Photo: Adam Glanzman/Bloomberg)Livestock producers in nearly two-thirds of Tennessee counties who incurred extra feed costs in 2024 due to flooding brought by Hurricane Helene may be eligible for federal funding through the Emergency Livestock Relief Program.
The program, meant to help offset increased feed costs due to flood and wildfire disasters throughout the country in 2023 and 2024, is expected to pay out about $1 billion, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brook L. Rollins announced earlier this month.
Tennessee had no qualifying flood or fire events in 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency. But 59 Tennessee counties — including all of West Tennessee and multiple East Tennessee counties — are pre-determined as eligible for flood events in 2024.

Eligible livestock include beef and dairy cattle, buffalo, bison, beefalo (a bison-cattle hybrid), alpacas, llamas, deer, elk, reindeer, ostriches, emus, equine, goats and sheep.
Producers can receive up to 60% of three months of feed costs for a qualifying flood, according to the USDA. The program has a cap of $125,000 per producer for each program year, though. Producers who already received the maximum payment from the Emergency Livestock Relief Program for Drought and Wildfire, a program announced in May, are not eligible for additional flood relief payments.
The funding comes from the American Relief Act of 2025, which allotted about $940 million to flood and wildfire assistance. Should national demand for relief exceed that amount, the USDA will apply a “national payment factor” based on the number of eligible applicants, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Applications for assistance opened on Sept. 15 and will close on Oct. 31. Livestock producers in eligible counties are not required to submit supporting documentation for floods or wildfires. Producers outside of the counties identified by the FSA can apply for aid, but need to include documentation of a qualifying flood or wildfire in the county where livestock were kept, according to the USDA.
Cattle and calves are Tennessee’s number one agricultural commodity in terms of cash receipts, according to the USDA Tennessee Field Office.
Hurricane Helene dumped between 3 and 10 inches of rain in some areas of the state between Sept. 26 and Sept. 30, 2024, flooding some fields and interrupting the harvest. Floodwaters knocked out bridges and major infrastructure, most acutely in Northeast Tennessee.
“For livestock producers, the economic consequences were swift and severe,” the American Farm Bureau Federation stated in a Sept. 16 news release. “Transportation costs soared as washed-out infrastructure delayed feed shipments. Replacement feed was more expensive and harder to find, with crop failures adding to shortages.”
Tennessee Department of Agriculture representatives visited upper East Tennessee in June to survey ongoing recovery efforts. Hurricane Helene’s impact on Tennessee farmers and forestland owners is estimated at up to $1.8 billion, according to the state’s agriculture department.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Families in Cass and Grand Forks counties may soon have different options for college courses for high school students. 
The State Board of Higher Education last week approved a policy change that allows high school students in those counties to take dual-credit courses — earning both high school and college credit — through the University of North Dakota and North Dakota State University. 
Students in Cass and Grand Forks counties had previously been required to take dual-credit classes through one of North Dakota’s smaller public colleges, with the college getting the tuition revenue. Those students could only take a dual-credit course from UND or NDSU if it was not offered at a smaller college. 
Leaders of those smaller colleges have resisted the change in part because of the tuition revenue they get from students taking introductory college courses while they are still in high school.
Those colleges include North Dakota State College of Science in Wahpeton, Valley City State University, Mayville State University and Lake Region State College in Devils Lake. 
North Dakota State College of Science President Rod Flanigan (Provided by North Dakota University System)
Rod Flanigan, president of North Dakota State College of Science, a two-year school, said the change could cost his school millions of dollars in revenue annually. 
The college in Wahpeton in Richland County has about 1,500 dual-credit students this semester, most of them from Cass County, the neighboring county to the north. 
“It will have an impact on us,” Flanigan told the State Board of Higher Education when it met Tuesday at Minot State University. “We will compete as best we can.”
Advocates for the change said the policy should be about choice for students, not the financial health of the small colleges. 
State Board of Higher Education member Curtis Biller said during a Sept. 4 committee meeting that if there are financial implications for the small colleges, “we can deal with it as we move forward.” 
It will be up to NDSU and UND to work with high schools on which courses to make available through dual credit. 
NDSU Provost David Bertolini said the university will reach out to high schools in Cass County to understand what the schools, parents and students want for dual-credit offerings. 
“We get requests from students who want to do dual credit with us, and historically, we have to say ‘no,’” Bertolini said in an interview. “From the perspective of what families and students might want for themselves, their hopes and dreams for college or whatever their careers might be, student choice is paramount.”
Board appoints former lieutenant governor to lead North Dakota University System

Historically, the university system has encouraged campuses to operate in their own region.
Another college that could be significantly impacted is Lake Region, which has about 250 dual credit students from nearby Grand Forks County, home to UND. 
UND President Andy Armacost said it would work with Lake Region to minimize the impact on the two-year school.   
“We need to sit down and figure out how this is going to work,” Armacost said at Tuesday’s meeting. He acknowledged that there would be pressure from Grand Forks residents who would prefer to use UND for dual credit over Lake Region. 
Carmen Simone, who was appointed Lake Region president earlier in the meeting after serving as interim over the summer, said the college would work with UND. “I’m not afraid of this change,” Simone said. 
How dual credit works 
Lisa Johnson, deputy commissioner for the North Dakota University System, said in an interview that students generally take a dual-credit course one of two ways — either in person within their  high school or as an online course. 
In-person classes at the high school are taught by a high school instructor who has the required credentials, such as a master’s degree and a certain number of college credit hours in the subject area. 
For online courses, Johnson said those are typically taught by a college instructor. She said that option, while more expensive, is popular in rural school districts that won’t have enough students to justify an in-person class. Students from several schools can be grouped together for an online class, which can still take place during regular school hours. 
The North Dakota University System has targeted dual-credit offerings to high-demand classes, such as English 101 and college algebra that can help fulfill general education requirements and are easily transferable through North Dakota’s colleges.

Johnson said earning college credit through NDSU or UND, the state’s two research colleges, would carry no more weight than through a smaller college, though that perception might exist. 
“I think the extent to which they no longer enroll in community colleges and four-year regionals and gravitate to research institutions remains to be seen,” she said. 
Johnson said a high school can partner with more than one college on dual-credit classes. 
If two colleges were offering the same course, Johnson said the high school would select which institution to partner with. 
Growth in dual credit
Johnson said dual credit has evolved over the decades. She said it started with the two-year colleges such as Lake Region and the State College of Science back in the 1980s. 
Four-year colleges eventually began offering dual credit courses, and online courses have greatly expanded dual-credit opportunities. 
“We actually have hundreds and hundreds of online courses,” Johnson said. 
Enrollment up nearly 4% at North Dakota public colleges, universities

Johnson said growth also was spurred when the state Legislature approved funding for a scholarship program in 2021. The scholarship provides $250 per course, up to three courses. 
“We really saw a marked increase in students participating in dual credit after the announcement of that dual credit scholarship,” Johnson said. 
There also is a program through the Bank of North Dakota to cover dual-credit tuition for families who qualify for free and reduced school meals. 
Johnson said a goal of Brent Sanford, who was just named the University System’s commissioner, to expand dual-credit offerings at high schools with career and technical education centers. 
High school students have other options for earning college credit. Under early entry, a high school can take a college course that may not count toward high school graduation. Students also can take advanced placement classes, which may provide college credit depending on the student’s score on a standardized test. 
Bertolini  said an average student coming to NDSU already has 12 college credits, typically through dual credit, and he expects that to keep growing.  
“It’s one way to lower college expenses, reduce your time to degree,” Bertolini said. “It also allows them, in an earlier framework, to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives.”

Propositions LL and MM were referred to the ballot by the Colorado General Assembly earlier this year. Together, they aim to shore up funding for the Healthy School Meals For All program, which was authorized by Colorado voters in 2022 but has exceeded cost projections in its first years of operation.
Without additional funding, program administrators have said they will have to take steps to restrict eligibility to only low-income students and schools. Additional efforts to purchase locally-grown produce, increase wages for cafeteria workers and offset federal food stamp cuts would also go without funding.

Keep Kids Fed Colorado, an issue committee registered in support of Propositions LL and MM, has reported $152,000 in contributions, mostly from the nonprofit Hunger Free Colorado. The campaign touts a long list of endorsements from organizations including Children’s Hospital Colorado, Great Education Colorado, Mi Familia Vota, Rocky Mountain Farmers Union and Save the Children Action Network.
 Proposition LL
Three years ago, Colorado voters approved a ballot measure to create the school meals program, which provides free breakfast and lunch to all students regardless of their family’s income level. It was funded by limiting income tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 per year.
The program’s funding mechanism raised more than expected in the 2023-2024 fiscal year. Proposition LL would allow the state to keep the $12.4 million in excess revenue that would otherwise be returned to voters under the 1992 state constitutional amendment known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights.
That money has already been collected by the state. If Proposition LL is approved, the state would keep it and spend it on the school meals program.
If Proposition LL is rejected, the money would be refunded to Colorado households making at least $300,000 a year. Roughly 200,000 filers in Colorado, representing the richest 6% of households, would receive an average refund of $62.
 Proposition MM
While Healthy School Meals For All initially raised more revenue than projected, the program’s costs also exceeded projections, resulting in a budget gap that rose to roughly $50 million this year.
Proposition MM aims to permanently fund the full program by further limiting tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 a year, raising an additional $95 million annually for the program. Households in that high-income category would pay an average of $486 more in income taxes yearly, according to nonpartisan state fiscal analysts.
The program’s budget gap has led to delays in implementing two supplementary programs that were also included in the 2022 ballot measure: grants for purchasing locally grown food from Colorado farmers and increased wages for cafeteria workers. If Proposition MM is approved, those provisions would be implemented.
During a special legislative session in August, Colorado lawmakers also tweaked Proposition MM to allow the additional revenue to be spent on broader efforts to reduce food insecurity, once the Healthy School Meals For All program’s costs are covered. That would help the state partially offset the impact — estimated at up to $170 million annually — of reduced funding and higher administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as a result of cuts passed by congressional Republicans in July.
 Colorado voting basics
Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold certified the 2025 ballot on Sept. 8. In addition to the two statewide measures, the coordinated 2025 election will see voters decide on numerous candidates and issues at the local level, including municipal elections in Aurora, Pueblo and Fort Collins, and school board races in Denver, Aurora, Douglas County and many other districts across the state.
Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com.
Mail ballots will be sent to all active registered voters in Colorado beginning Oct. 10, and any eligible voter who registers to vote before Oct. 27 will receive a ballot in the mail. After Oct. 27, eligible voters can still register and vote in-person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Voters who receive a mail ballot can return it through the mail, deposit it in a secure ballot drop box, or drop it off at an in-person polling location. Information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites.

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor)COLUMBIA — Older teens and adults don’t need a prescription to get a COVID-19 vaccine in South Carolina, a state committee clarified this month.
The decision came days before a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel rejected a proposal that would have required anyone getting the vaccine first go to their doctor for a prescription.
The CDC committee still wants people to consult a health care provider about the vaccine’s risks and benefits. Following guidance for “shared clinical decision-making” could involve calling a primary care physician. People could also simply talk to the pharmacist on duty when they go get their shot, NPR reported.
However, the committee’s recommendations await formal approved by the acting CDC director.
South Carolina’s protocol for administering vaccines, updated by the Board of Medical Examiners during a Sept. 15 meeting, takes other medical groups’ recommendations into account. So, a change in CDC recommendations wouldn’t automatically change South Carolina protocol.
For children, the state board followed the American Academy of Pediatrics in recommending at least one dose of the vaccine for children older than 6 months.
It followed the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in recommending the vaccine for pregnant women.
State protocol calls for the vaccine to be available for all adults and recommends two booster shots for people 65 and older.
In South Carolina, children younger than 16 need a doctor’s note and parental permission to get the COVID-19 vaccine at a pharmacy. The same is true for most immunizations. An exception is the flu vaccine, as per state law.
However, confusion persists over who can get the vaccine. Despite the updated protocols from the Board of Medical Examiners, effective Sept. 17, whether a shot is available will depend on the pharmacy. CVS is offering COVID-19 shots at its South Carolina pharmacies without a prescription, a spokesman said. Walgreens is not, according to its website.
Part of that confusion may come from the CDC committee’s recommendations differing from U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In August, the FDA approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines, but limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with high-risk health issues. While the FDA regulates vaccines, the CDC recommends how to use them.
Most insurance plans should cover the COVID-19 shot, though major pharmacies’ websites recommend double checking before coming in for an appointment.
Medicaid and Medicare will cover the cost of the vaccines, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Many private health insurance companies promised to keep all CDC-recommended vaccines free for people on their plans through the end of 2026, according to a statement from American Health Insurance Plans, which includes major health insurance providers.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stkw5017-1-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

(Photo courtesy of KNOE-TV)The monitor that had been tracking Mearl Hodge’s heartbeat started to show an abnormal rhythm. A technician at Glenwood Regional Medical Center in West Monroe, Louisiana, alerted nurses that the electrodes that should have been affixed to Hodge’s chest seemed to have popped loose. No one checked. It was a granddaughter, arriving for a visit 20 minutes later, who discovered that her grandmother no longer had a pulse.
The circumstance of Hodge’s death is among more than 650 documented instances of deficient care at nearly three dozen hospitals across eight states that were owned by Steward Health Care before the entire system collapsed last year in a spectacular bankruptcy. 
Hodge’s death, four days after she was admitted to Glenwood with COVID-19 in the winter of 2022, triggered an inquiry by the Louisiana Department of Health. Beyond the unattached heart monitor leads and the granddaughter’s discovery, state records from the investigation show the mask helping Hodge, 90, to breathe was sitting useless on her stomach. And though her medical chart made clear she wanted to be resuscitated in any emergency, the staff hadn’t tried, the records indicate.
For these mistakes, other state documents show, the health department fined Glenwood $1,750. What is uncommon about the case is that the hospital was fined at all. The scarcity of sanctions when some Steward facilities made even grave errors is part of a pattern in government regulation of America’s hospitals. 
Steward Health Care’s collapse has attracted considerable attention, largely depicted as an object lesson in the perils of for-profit hospital owners financed by private equity. However, a close examination of the Steward system points to a less obvious culprit: Across the country, oversight of hospitals by states and the federal government is inadequate – at times weakly enforced, at times absent.
This portrait of the feeble regulation of a troubled health system emerges from a new data analysis of Steward’s hospitals by the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The multi-prong analysis reveals substantial flaws in how states and the federal government oversee hospitals. 
On the one hand, main ways that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require U.S. hospitals to publicly report on their finances and their quality failed to point to Steward’s deepening fragility. 
On the other hand, information that regulators do not routinely track makes clear that the company’s hospitals were increasingly in trouble. One is a roster of nearly 130 lawsuits that mounted as the bankruptcy neared, because vendors – from suppliers of medical devices to air-conditioning – went to court, alleging Steward neglected to pay its bills. The other is a growing pile of hospital deficiencies – flaws, including in Mearl Hodge’s care, of varying severity that states examined in response to complaints.
This combination – public data that didn’t show the problems, revealing trends that regulators didn’t watch – does not suggest that many hospitals across the nation are poised to fail. Evidence of whether for-profit hospitals have lower quality is mixed, though a small body of research into the more than 450 with private-equity financing indicates they tend to be more problem-prone. Still, the lax regulatory climate means that state and federal early warning systems for troubled hospitals are largely absent.
“We need to build some sentinels … to catch things before a crash happens,” said Jonathan Blum, who held senior roles at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Biden and Obama administrations. 
In the meantime, certain hospitals and communities that rely on them can be vulnerable, especially as looming cuts to Medicaid and other federal health funds are widely predicted to erode the financial underpinnings of rural and other already-strapped hospitals. Some may hunt for new, deep-pocketed owners.
“Unless states dramatically increase their oversight, I would certainly expect more Stewards to happen,” said Erin Fuse Brown, a health law and policy specialist at the Brown University School of Public Health.
Prospect Medical Holdings, another private equity-affiliated system with 16 hospitals in four states declared bankruptcy in January. 
“I do not think it will be the last,” Fuse Brown said.
Steward’s rise and fall 
Massachusetts, a hub of academic medical centers, had never been home to a for-profit hospital backed by private equity – an arrangement that was gaining traction in U.S. health care in which investors look for large, often-quick profits outside the stock market. But a local Roman Catholic health system called Caritas Christi was faltering after a priest sex-abuse scandal financially drained the Archdiocese of Boston. Caritas began looking for a buyer, and Massachusetts officials joined the search. They were having little luck, especially finding one open to Caritas’s no-abortion policy and other Catholic values.

So, Massachusetts officials viewed it as good fortune when Ralph de la Torre, a prominent cardiac surgeon who recently had become Caritas’s chief executive, proposed what he said would be a new model of care. In 2010, the system affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, an established private equity firm. They pledged to solidify Caritas’s pension system, strengthen its half-dozen hospitals and, for the first five years, be monitored by Massachusetts’ attorney general. The system would be renamed Steward Health Care. The attorney general and a judge approved the deal.
Though the fledgling system made some hospital improvements, Steward didn’t always adhere to the deal’s terms and, under de la Torre’s leadership, was aggressive from the start, health officials and other hospital executives recall. In 2011, the fledgling system took over four more Massachusetts hospitals and another in 2012. 
But Steward’s big growth spurt started in 2016, just after the monitoring ended, when it affiliated with Medical Properties Trust, a major real estate investment trust which is a type of company that pools money from many investors to buy and own income-producing real property. Medical Properties Trust bought all of the hospitals’ buildings and land in a “sale-leaseback,” offering cash in exchange for escalating rents. Steward, together with Medical Properties Trust and Cerberus, went on a buying spree. Less than a year later, it owned 36 hospitals in 10 states.
In none of the states into which Steward spread did regulators have a role reviewing the purchases, according to the Brookings analysis of health care “transaction” laws compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
In some of the states, such as Arizona, an attorney general reviews only sales of non-profit hospitals; Steward grew almost entirely by acquiring hospitals that already were for-profit. Other states, such as Florida, review sales of nursing homes, but not hospitals. Still others, such as Texas, do not oversee any health facility sales.
Financial troubles, staff and supply shortages and de la Torre’s spending on luxuries, including a $30 million yacht, eventually spilled into view. Steward sold seven hospitals in Ohio, Colorado and Utah. 
In January of last year, the Boston Globe broke the story of a 39-year-old woman who died of profuse bleeding from her liver the day after giving birth at Steward’s St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Boston; an unpaid vendor had repossessed common metal coils that doctors use to stem internal bleeding. In a statement to the Globe, Steward said it did its best to keep needed supplies on hand and noted that its surgical care had been “consistently recognized among the best in the nation and state by the likes of highly credible ratings organizations.”
Weeks after the Globe story, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said she wanted Steward, which had long balked at reporting financial information required there, to leave the state.
Less than three months later, in May, the whole Steward system filed for bankruptcy in Texas, where the company headquarters had moved several years before.  This summer, the remnants of Steward sued de la Torre, who resigned last fall, and three others, accusing them of “greed and bad faith misconduct” that had sunk the company. A spokeswoman for de la Torre, Rebecca Kral, said he “will vigorously defend himself” against the lawsuit. Lawyers for the former CEO have not yet filed a response to the suit in court. 
Attorneys for the Steward bankruptcy did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
The bankruptcy set off a scramble for new owners of Steward’s by-then 31 hospitals. Amid protests, two in Massachusetts closed outright. Most of the company’s hospitals, including Glenwood and the others mentioned in this story, have new owners.
 The limits of government data 

Even as Steward’s layered troubles became more evident, main types of public data that federal health officials collect from hospitals – about their finances and their quality – didn’t reveal them.
Every hospital that treats patients on Medicare must give federal regulators an annual “cost report” containing assorted financial information. Brookings analyzed these reports, looking at operating profit margins and three other common financial indicators, comparing Steward hospitals against U.S. hospitals overall. 
Over the years, the analysis found, Steward’s hospitals looked similar on average to all U.S. hospitals through 2022, the most recent data available. However, audited financial statements for the whole Steward system, available in separate public records, show the company struggling from early on, the analysis found.
The discrepancies reflect that Steward shifted many expenses to the central office – a common practice among health systems that Steward took to an extreme, according to Steward and other health care experts. As a result, “It’s not a valid data set for analyzing the financial condition of the hospitals,” said Nancy Kane, a retired professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
A report last year by KFF, a health information nonprofit, on gaps in hospital financial information noted that the data submitted in cost reports for individual hospitals is not standardized or rigorously scrutinized – and doesn’t reflect the financial condition of their parent health systems. Kane said Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service uses the cost reports to help ensure that Medicare is paying hospitals correctly, not to monitor their financial health.
Meanwhile, of the 10 states where Steward operated, seven require hospitals to report at least some financial data and make it publicly available, according to a canvas of state transparency laws. But just three – Colorado, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania – say they currently analyze the data for hospitals’ expenditures or financial condition.
The Brookings analysis, focused on information reported to Medicare about the Steward hospitals’ quality of care, found that, like the financial data, these quality measures failed to reveal the actual trouble occurring at many of the facilities. Looking at Medicare’s Hospital Care Compare data, their average was little different than hospitals nationally on seven quality indicators, including serious complications, patients’ length of time in emergency rooms and readmissions.
Asked for a response to the findings, a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid spokesman, Alexx Pons, said “The agency does not comment on external analysis.”
In January, days before the Biden administration ended, federal officials issued a report on health industry consolidation, including hospitals such as Steward’s with private equity backing. The report by the departments of Health and Human Services and Justice and the Federal Trade Commission said the agencies had repeatedly heard complaints that “HHS should do more to improve the quality of the data” it collects about health facilities’ owners, prices, staff levels and patient care.
Steward’s collapse has helped prompt a few states to increase oversight of health care transactions, though most merely require notification to a state, not giving power to approve or reject a hospital sale. In January, Massachusetts passed a health care law that does not prevent private-equity firms from affiliating with health care companies but says hospitals may not be licensed if their main campus begins an affiliation with a real-estate investment trust, as Steward did.
Still, Fuse Brown, the health law and policy professor, said, “There’s no one state body or federal body that is sitting there and saying, ‘Things are going off the rails at this hospital.’”
A reason for the scant oversight is that “the points of leverage are health law, and health law is very narrow,” said Rosemary Batt, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, who has studied private equity in health care, including Steward. “There’s no law that says [hospitals] need to maintain their infrastructure,” Batt said. “There’s no law that says you can’t sell your land.”
Even as two important types of federal data – on hospitals’ finances and quality – didn’t warn of Steward’s troubles, other loud hints could have revealed the escalating crisis.
One of those hints, unwatched by regulators, lies in a soaring number of lawsuits by vendors, alleging Steward and its individual hospitals hadn’t paid bills for services, according to Brookings’ analysis, based on records in bankruptcy court and elsewhere. The cases add up to $139 million in allegedly unpaid bills. 
One small company, Eklund Refrigeration, sued Steward for $32,640 in March 2023, contending it had sent 37 invoices for air-conditioning service to two Arizona hospitals since it had last been paid in 2021. Seventeen months after the suit’s filing, Arizona health officials shut down one, a Phoenix psychiatric hospital, when the broken air conditioning caused the temperature inside to reach 99 degrees in the August heat.

In a number of the lawsuits, vendors were notified of the bankruptcy before their cases advanced. However, in one case, a lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts in February 2024 by OsteoRemedies, which provides medical supplies to support orthopedic surgery, alleging that Steward owed it about $176,500 for services provided in several of its hospitals in five states. In a court filing the following month, Steward lawyers denied every allegation and asked that the case be dismissed.
Instances of deficient care also were becoming more frequent. These are verified by state health department surveyors, who work on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid to investigate complaints from patients, families or employees. Altogether, hospitals owned by Steward had nearly 680 deficiencies, federal and state records show. They climbed from 13 in 2020 to 108 last year, about 3 ½ times as many deficiencies per hospital, on average, as in U.S. hospitals overall the year before. Federal health officials define three deficiency levels. The worst, “immediate jeopardy,” is a problem that caused death or easily could have.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are not empowered to fine hospitals for deficiencies – only to ban them from receiving payment for services. Such a ban would be draconian and rarely happens because depriving a hospital of revenue from the two huge public insurance programs would threaten its existence. More typically, federal health officials or state regulators warn hospitals that they face being dropped from the programs unless they correct deficiencies – and then accept the hospitals’ correction plans.
Of the five states, besides Louisiana, that marked any deficiencies in the worst category, Massachusetts has no system of hospital financial penalties. According to the Pennsylvania and Utah health departments, they prefer to nudge hospitals to improve and issued no fines in these cases, including a 2023 incident at a Salt Lake City hospital in which a patient who objected to her discharge died just afterwards at a frigid bus stop.
The Texas Health and Human Services Commission issued a fine, totaling $7,200, for just one of 21 “immediate jeopardy” deficiencies involving Steward hospitals, records show, after finding a malfunctioning emergency room call system, dirt and debris on food carts and other spots, and leaks through ceiling tiles. After listing these and other flaws, however, the state’s May 2024 notice told the hospital the fine “was not a demand for payment,” if it was in bankruptcy. By then, Steward was.
Trouble at Glenwood 
Glenwood, the company’s only Louisiana hospital, racked up 47 deficiencies after Steward bought it in 2017, including four designated “immediate jeopardy.” Patients had started avoiding the hospital, according to local officials and former employees. Unpaid bills prompted vendors to cut off supplies needed to insert pacemakers and perform endoscopies, state records show. A vendor cut off the coffee supply.
Louisiana law allows penalties against hospitals that violate standards. In the months before the bankruptcy, state records show, the health department levied two fines, for $5,000 and $7,000, and said Glenwood would be banned from Medicare if conditions didn’t improve. 
Mearl Hodge’s death came before those fines. Called Meme by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, her obituary would say, Hodge was born and lived her life in Farmerville, a town of about 30 miles northwest of West Monroe with a summertime watermelon festival. She loved to cook chicken and dressing and to share afternoon coffees with her friends and family, including her husband of 76 years. She prayed for her family daily.
As a one-time “class A” violation resulting in death or serious harm, and an “immediate jeopardy” deficiency, state law permitted up to a $2,500 penalty after Hodge’s death.
On May 31, 2022, the state health department fined Glenwood $1,750. Three months later, the department dispatched a second notice. The check Steward sent, the notice said, had bounced.

(Photo courtesy of First Choice Services)By the time Beth Roach reached out to West Virginia’s Problem Gambling Help Network last year, her gambling addiction had already cost her relationships, her job, her vehicle and her house. It nearly cost her her life. 
“I knew that I had two choices: I could either get help or I was going to end my life,” Roach said. 
When she messaged the 1-800-Gambler helpline, Roach was connected to counseling and other resources for her addiction. 
“I’ll never forget — I chatted in on a Friday afternoon and I saw my counselor on Saturday morning,” she said. “They got me in that quick.”
This year marks the 25th anniversary for the Problem Gambling Help Network, which runs the state’s 24-hour 1-800-Gambler helpline. The network is operated by First Choice Services and funded through the West Virginia Lottery.
Last year the program helped connect about 1,500 people with help for their gambling addiction, said Sheila Moran, marketing and communications director for First Choice Services.
“….Every state has a 1-800-Gambler,” Moran said. “What we do is a little different than other states — we have a pretty comprehensive treatment program.”
Helpline employees offer caller crisis counseling and connect them to an array of treatment services, ranging from podcasts, self-help books and apps, on up to more formal mental health help, Moran said. 
“Some people are ready for serious treatment, and so in that case, we link them with one of our counselors who are trained in treating gambling addiction, and we pay for that treatment,” she said. “And they can go up to 20 times to see them.”
The network also offers occasional retreats where people interested in gambling addiction recovery can gather in person for two days at a state park or another venue to connect with others and with treatment counselors. 
A retreat was where Roach’s treatment really took off, she said.
“[The retreat was] where I really started doing better in my recovery,” she said. “Because at that point, when I went to that retreat, I was just barely getting through every day.”
The network’s website has information and a quiz to help people determine whether their gambling is a problem. The best indication, Moran said, is if people continue to gamble even though it has negative consequences, she said.
“We’ll get calls from people who say, ‘how can I have a gambling problem? I’m well off. I’m wealthy.’ Well, it’s really not about the money,” she said. “If you keep gambling, even though your wife is mad at you and you’ve lost your job, that’s a problem. So that’s kind of a global definition of addiction.”
At least one in 50 West Virginians struggle with problem gambling, according to the network. 
Often, people will start with safer gambling — setting rules and limits for themselves. Then they’ll break those limits, lose money they never intended to, and start gambling more to make up for that loss, she said. 
“That’s when it first starts to cross over, when people go from recreational gambling to maybe problematic gambling, especially when they start seeing it as a way to make money,” she said. 
Roach started gambling in 2017 after visiting a casino. The casino became something for her and her husband, then empty nesters, to do on weekends. But the weekend trips turned into every weekend. 
Then, she’d go throughout the week and she started going on her own, spending more and more money. 
“I would say within four months, it had become a problem, and not to the point of the problem that it was when I stopped gambling,” Roach said. “But it was a problem because I was going more than just recreation. I was spending a little bit more, and it was just too much time… it was more of a time thing.”
In Roach’s case, a medication she was prescribed for restless leg syndrome has been linked to compulsive behavior, including gambling. She only learned of the connection afterwards in counseling.
The most common types of gambling have changed through the years, Moran said. When the network first started in 2000, most people were calling about slot machines, then video poker parlors, she said. Nowadays, callers are mostly betting online. 
In the last few years, the helpline’s call volume has doubled, mostly because of young men calling about online sports betting, she said. 
“We’re getting a whole lot of calls from young men who, frankly, I never thought would call us, because I thought, ‘Oh, they’re not going to call a helpline,’” Moran said. “I was wrong. So now they’re making up a lot of our calls.”
Last year the program had about 1,500 intakes, which are actually people seeking help for their gambling problem. She distinguishes between intakes and calls because a lot of callers are mistakenly trying to reach customer service for whatever gambling organization they’re using. 
The number of intakes is up from 1,200 last year, and has doubled in the last five years because of online gambling, she said.
“It’s not only more access but of course there’s a lot of advertising,” she said of online gambling. “Years ago, there was some stigma, maybe, attached to the idea of going to a casino and gambling. I think that’s completely gone now, especially among young folks. So we’ll just see more and more of them gambling on a regular basis.”
Moran said a significant number of calls — 20 or 30% — come from the loved ones of people struggling with a gambling addiction. Sometimes spouses will find out their wives or husbands have cashed the couple’s retirement funds, or taken out a second mortgage, or racked up a bunch of credit card debt without their knowledge. 
“You can imagine how upset they are when they call us,” Moran said. “And so a lot of what our counselors do is probably some marriage therapy in addition to gambling addiction therapy. But we can help them as well, because sometimes they need a bunch of emotional protection, but some solid steps to take to protect themselves financially. 
“So we have financial counseling available to them as well as the gambler,” she said. 
Short of the telltale signs of losing their homes and 401Ks, Moran said lying is one sign a person may have a problem with gambling addiction. But it can be very difficult to tell, she said. 
“If you are with someone, and they do gamble on a regular basis, it’s worth having a financial conversation and maybe even looking into some of these accounts, as far as where the money is going,” Moran said. “If someone’s deceptive about it, it can be very hard. They may be stealing money from work or embezzling or who knows what to get the money to gamble, and you may not be aware of it until you’re also in debt along with them.”
About a year into treatment, Roach, 52, is still working to get her life back on track. She attends a support group, meets with a sponsor and still gets counseling regularly. 
She now works as a helpline coordinator at the same helpline that helped pull her out of her addiction. 
“I tell [Program Director Maricel Bernardoall] the time, how thankful I am for her for taking a chance on me, because I’m still kind of early in my recovery. But it’s helped me,” Roach said. “I mean, I’ve put in work in other areas, but it helps me. It helps me just as much as I help others.”

She admired her social studies and English teachers especially. After four years studying elementary education at Delta State University and a full-time teaching position in a local district her senior year, she felt she had cleared all the important hurdles to becoming a certified teacher in Mississippi.

But then came PRAXIS, a series of tests that nearly every teacher in Mississippi must take to become a certified teacher. 
“It made me second guess a career that I fell in love with,” she said. “Much of what I learned over the four years of college is not in the practice material.”
She’s not alone. In roughly half of public and private universities with education programs, 50% or more of students do not pass at least one section of the PRAXIS exam on their first try.
Some students even opted for more classes at school to bypass having to take the test, which would mean an additional $1,200 for Allen.
Nearly a quarter of the 1,892 Mississippi test takers walked away after flunking on the first attempt of the most commonly taken PRAXIS Elementary Education exam from 2015 to 2018, leaving fewer teachers to fill a growing list of teacher vacancies in critical shortage areas.
The Board of Education implemented a waiver during the pandemic to allow students to be certified without taking the PRAXIS, but that waiver ended in December 2021. Students graduating as late as December 2023 took advantage of the waiver.
Now university education departments, school district officials and teachers are struggling to re-adjust to a more rigid path to teacher licensure.
“It’s outrageous that effective educators are dismissed by the profession for not passing PRAXIS,” said Clayton Barksdale, a former public school principal in Greenville and executive director of the West Mississippi Education Consortium. “Many prove their impact while on emergency licenses, only to be fired then immediately rehired as a long-term substitute – doing the same work for a fraction of the pay, with no benefits or retirement.”
“We must do better.”
Shortage areas

Didriquez Smith has taken the PRAXIS content test three times and spent nearly a thousand dollars. He coaches football at Clarksdale High School and teaches physical education on an emergency license.
He failed just one of the three tests in his past two attempts: Foundations of Reading, which covers reading comprehension and teaching reading.
The Praxis exam has several parts. The content knowledge test covers the subject aspiring teachers want to teach, like biology or elementary English. The Principles of Learning test covers how teachers should prepare lesson plans and approach classroom instruction for different subjects. Students who don’t have at least a 3.0 GPA must also take an Academic Skills for Educators test, which is also called PRAXIS Core.
Per try, the elementary education exam costs $209, and the PRAXIS core test $90. Some of the content tests such as art instruction cost $130.
Smith had to travel nearly 300 miles to Birmingham to take his third attempt at the test because the test wasn’t offered closer at the end of the school year. He is currently saving up enough money to take it again.
He loves his job, particularly informing his community about the importance of healthy habits. 
He hopes he can continue to keep students healthy and active at school. In the Mississippi Delta, the obesity rate among children is 29%.
However, if he can’t pass each required PRAXIS test in the next year, he may be out of a job. As much as his boss in the principal’s office may want to keep him in his role, state regulations penalize schools in their annual accountability scores if they have faculty teaching without a license. Schools can also lose accreditation.
Since childhood, Skylar Ball had planned on becoming a kindergarten teacher. She followed her mother into education, even attending the same alma mater of Blue Mountain Christian University. 
“Teaching elementary school is like Disney World,” she said. “Elementary students, you can do so much with them. You can make an early impact.”
However, one and a half years after graduation, she remains an assistant teacher, making several thousand less a month than she budgeted for while she saves enough money to take the PRAXIS exam for the third time. 
She was two questions shy of passing on her latest attempt.
“I was so blessed to educate 20 amazing kindergartners last school year under an emergency license … I am currently a paraprofessional in an amazing district, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t upset about not being able to lead a classroom of my own,” Ball said.
She struggled with the Elementary Education exam, a PRAXIS test with the lowest pass rate in the state. Although she was aiming to become a kindergarten English teacher, her test covered kindergarten through sixth grade instruction as well as science, math, art, English, and social studies, among other subjects.
In an analysis conducted by the National Teacher Quality Association, the nonprofit found that Mississippi’s Elementary Education content test has a subpar job measuring whether would-be teachers have the knowledge and skills needed for a career in their classrooms.
“Does this test tell districts if they are prepared to lead an elementary school classroom in this content area? It does not,” said Hannah Putman, managing director of research at the National Council of Teacher Quality.
The university’s role
Universities in Mississippi play an important role in filling teacher vacancies with fresh talent. Pass rates on PRAXIS exams vary among universities with Alcorn State University posting the lowest first-time pass rates, according to the most recent data from 2022-2023 school year. Mississippi Valley State University posted that none of its students took two of the three main PRAXIS exams for the same year.
This data has a smaller sample size of teachers as a majority gained licensure under the  COVID waiver.
Mississippi College posted the best results with over 93% of students passing the pedagogy section test and 100% of students passing both the content test and the Foundations of Reading test. Over 90% of University of Southern Mississippi students passed their three PRAXIS exams.

Timolin Howard, a Mississippi Valley State graduate, doesn’t regret enrolling in the school’s masters in teaching program. She believes instructors have given her the tools to succeed in the classroom.
After finding out her test scores were insufficient for licensure, she had a stroke. She also says she received mixed messaging from the state licensure board regarding cut-off scores.
“I found that, while I was well-prepared for real-world teaching, I wasn’t fully prepared for the demands of the certification exams,” she said.
She said she can manage students, build lesson plans and come up with classroom activities that help students master common core competencies. But Howard realized she had gaps in her foundational knowledge when it came to studying for the PRAXIS exams. She reached out to her school for help.
The university cancelled a workshop taught on campus, which was preparing students for the Foundations of Reading exam. It wasn’t the first a PRAXIS preparation workshop was cancelled, Howard said.
“It left me feeling overwhelmed as I tried to catch up, and it significantly impacted my confidence, academic performance and health,” she said.
This year, her Delta school district released her from her contract because she lacked the right licensure.
Mississippi Valley State University’s education department did not respond to comment despite repeated attempts to reach representatives.
Grow Your Own
For eight years, Adrienne Hudson has led the nonprofit organization RISE, which helps recruit and retain new teachers in Mississippi Delta school districts.
Hudson had already been informally mentoring and tutoring teachers who struggled with the PRAXIS exam and other technical aspects of licensure in her Clarksdale school. She founded RISE to help more.
Hudson takes pride in the start of performance-based licensure in her district. Letting teachers become certified teachers through improving test scores in state-tested subjects will help schools retain talented teachers, said Hudson of the new path to teacher certification.
“Some of the responsibilities are on the university and some are the systems that require the test to be the measuring stick for becoming a teacher,” she said. “We have students getting dean’s list, who can’t pass the test.”
More would-be teachers are going back to school later in life than ever before. Fewer teachers are entering the traditional route, which involves majoring in education as an undergraduate as opposed to the alternate route through a masters. In the 2018-2019 school year, 27% of students getting an education degree went the alternate route in 2022-2023, 45% did.
Tony Latiker, dean of Jackson State University’s school of education, saw a similar trend. He theorizes the reason so many students are going the alternative route is because of the many requirements that await undergraduates at the end of their four years. Alternative route students have fewer testing requirements to meet.
One solution he has found is to have traditional route students take exams closer to when they finish coursework that corresponds. For example, he encourages students to take the Foundations of Reading exam after they complete their early literacy courses, which are offered in some form at all Mississippi universities with an education program.
Jackson State also offers an elective that prepares students for the PRAXIS tests and other technical requirements of licensure. Professors and visiting instructors also host workshops on campus.
“We really should be questioning the exams,” Latiker told Mississippi Today. “I’m not against the exams and testing, but I’m against them being the high stakes tests they are. It should be a part of a more holistic process, incorporating district personnel and university faculty input in classrooms, assessing pre-service teachers and interns at the end of lessons, to see if they’re actually effective.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05170616/makeshift-ESL-classroom-Flowood.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

UofL athletics director Josh Heird told the Kentucky Lantern he has been in contact with NCAA President Charlie Baker about revisiting the Cardinals’ vacated title and been encouraged by indications the NCAA is open to reconciling inconsistencies in its penalty structure.
The source of Heird’s newfound optimism are penalties imposed last month on the University of Michigan’s football program, which did not include any vacated victories despite scouting and signal-stealing violations far more likely to affect games than did the stripper scandal that invalidated Louisville’s title.

“I think the Michigan case is the first case where we can really point to the precedent and say we’ve been treated unfairly,” UofL’s Heird said. “You have an institution that actively put a scheme together to gain a competitive advantage by cheating, but they (the NCAA) didn’t take their championship banner away. That seems very unfair.”
The chair of the hearing panel in the Michigan case said no Wolverines victories, including the 2024 College Football Playoff championship, were vacated because NCAA rules preclude such penalties in cases where infractions did not result in athletes being ruled ineligible. 
“That was not a factor present in this case,” said the chair, attorney Norman Bay, in explaining the sanctions. “So it was not a penalty, in other words, that could be considered. And we did not impose it.”
Still, to the extent that distinction fails to account for the competitive impact of Michigan’s extensive and impermissible scouting and sign-stealing versus the sexual shenanigans in Louisville’s basketball dorm, the two cases reinforce long-standing complaints about the consistency of NCAA justice. 
Moreover, though the Committee on Infractions acknowledged a postseason ban was required in the Michigan case due to the severity of the infractions, the school’s lack of cooperation and its repeat offender status, a financial penalty was substituted for that sanction because “a postseason ban would unfairly penalize student-athletes for the actions of coaches and staff who are no longer associated with the Michigan football program.”
“Ultimately, Michigan was accused of some pretty egregious violations,” said attorney Jason Setchen, who has represented numerous athletes in NCAA cases, notably former Louisville basketball recruit Brian Bowen. “And what was different about (Michigan’s) violations was there were a lot of allegations about on-field advantages. It has been argued by some that it affected their getting to the championship game and winning it.
“I don’t believe that those were the same allegations in the Louisville case.”
Though Baker, the NCAA president, initially insisted, “No one believes at this point that Michigan didn’t win the national title fair and square,”  the Committee on Infractions found evidence of 52 games involving future opponents Michigan had improperly scouted and concluded those efforts “likely provided a competitive advantage” and that “the true scope and scale of the scheme – including the competitive advantage it conferred – will never be known due to individuals’ intentional destruction of materials and information.”

By contrast, Louisville loyalists have long argued that providing strippers and prostitutes to players and recruits (many of them underage) was clearly tawdry but not tactical; that it had no bearing on basketball games and provided no discernible recruiting advantage. 
“They had strippers in the dorm room,” Heird said. “From a morality standpoint, all those things, not a good look. From an extra benefits standpoint, from directly impacting a game, irrelevant. So you’re going to tell me that a program can devise a plan to actively find ways to get a competitive advantage and that’s not going to be punished as much as what we were?”
The NCAA did not respond to multiple interview requests for Baker or another executive to speak to UofL’s concerns. In response to an open records request for recent correspondence related to the vacated 2013 title, Sherri Pawson, UofL’s senior compliance officer, reported, “We have not identified any responsive records.”
Given the disparity in punishments between Michigan and Louisville and the open wound UofL’s vacated title represents to many Cardinal fans, the lack of a formal response to the Michigan sanctions more than a month later was curious. Heird explained that he prefers to make his case by telephone rather than by creating a paper trail and, more importantly, that his calls have found a receptive ear in Baker.
“I think the leadership of the NCAA right now is very reasonable,” he said. “I think they understand that college athletics has changed dramatically. And so, do I think there’s an opening? Yes, I do.”
An NCAA panel denied Louisville’s appeal of its 2017 sanctions on Feb. 20, 2018, which would normally be the last word on the subject. Yet NCAA bylaw 19.14.4 allows any institution or involved individual to initiate a review by submitting a brief to the Committee on Infractions hearing panel. The NCAA manual makes no mention of a statute of limitations regarding this approach.
Litigation is also an option. Three years after the NCAA vacated 112 of Penn State’s football victories among its sanctions for the Jerry Sandusky sex scandal, a lawsuit filed by Joe Paterno’s family led to a settlement that restored Paterno’s status as major college football’s winningest coach.
When it last did battle in an NCAA infractions case, U of L spared few expenses, paying star attorney Neal Katyal $2,465 per hour to successfully defend the university against allegations concerning Brian Bowen’s recruitment. Heird is reluctant to take Louisville’s case to court, however, fearful that doing so might result in retribution that limits the city’s opportunities to host major NCAA events such as last year’s women’s volleyball finals and the 2027 men’s basketball first and second rounds at the KFC Yum Center. 
“Let’s ask the appropriate questions before we get into full – I guess I’ll call it ‘Whatever It Takes’ mode,’ ” Heird said. “I’ve never been an advocate of we’ll just sue our way to getting what we want. It doesn’t feel like that’s the right way to go. I want to have all of the appropriate conversations and see if we can get to a place where we can all agree.”

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)A Philadelphia man’s conviction for openly carrying a gun has led Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court to reexamine a state law that treats firearm owners in the state’s largest city differently than in other parts of the commonwealth.
To carry a gun in Philadelphia, a person must have a concealed carry license, regardless of whether they carry it openly or not. That’s not a requirement in the state’s 66 other counties, where it’s legal to carry a gun without a permit as long as it’s plainly visible.
Listen to Peter and Emily’s audio recap here: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/29epphUFA-web-audio.mp3
 
Lawyers for Zaire Livingston have argued the state Uniform Firearms Act’s exception for Philadelphia violates the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions. 
Livingstone was arrested after Philadelphia police saw him selling drugs to another person in a dark alley. He was charged with drug possession and possession with intent to distribute. He was also charged with violating the Uniform Firearms Act because he had a handgun tucked in his waistband. He pleaded guilty to drug possession and the gun charge.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A panel of three Superior Court judges rejected that argument in Livingston’s initial appeal last December, upholding his convictions on other grounds. But scarcely six months later, a different three-judge panel reached the opposite conclusion in another case from Philadelphia.
Police arrested Riyaadh Sumpter after officers spotted him walking on a street with the grip of a handgun visibly protruding from his waistband. He was charged with and convicted of violating Section 6108 of the Uniform Firearms Act.
On appeal, the panel found the law unconstitutional on an equal protection basis, because it places people in Philadelphia at a “special disadvantage in the exercise of their Second Amendment right.” Prosecutors failed to show a compelling interest that was served by the restriction that would justify the infringement of Sumpter’s right to bear arms, the decision said.
The disagreement within the Superior Court, the commonwealth’s frontline appeals court, would be reason enough for the Supreme Court to review the cases, Craig Storrs, executive director of Pennsylvania Gun Rights, said. 
But he and Adam Garber, executive director of CeaseFirePA, said there has been a wave of litigation around the country in the wake of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that limited the scope of tougher gun laws in recent years.
“This is the court saying we’re taking a much closer look at these gun control laws and these carve outs, these special exemptions, we have,” Storrs said.
The Uniform Firearms Act has been on the books since 1972 and the restriction on openly carrying guns in Philadelphia has not been successfully challenged, Garber said.
And although the U.S. Supreme Court has issued two major opinions in the last 20 years that struck down state-level restrictions on gun ownership, Garber noted the justices have taken pains to make clear that they didn’t open the door to invalidate all local gun safety efforts.
Most recently in 2022, when a 6-3 majority struck down New York’s law requiring people applying for handgun permits to show a special need to defend themselves, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the decision would not bar states from imposing objective requirements for gun licensing.
In his concurring opinion, Kavanaugh cited the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s opinion in the court’s 2008 decision striking down the District of Columbia’s ban on handgun ownership.
“Maybe they’re trying to say there are reasonable restrictions under the Constitution and they’re thinking it’s time to define them properly,” Garber said.

The Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, led by District Attorney Larry Krasner, is in the position of defending the state law in the appeal, but Garber noted it’s possible the city itself could join in support of the law. 
A spokesperson for Krasner said in a statement that unlicensed open carrying of firearms in public should be a violation in every Pennsylvania county.
“This matter could be resolved by new legislation, rather than the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, if Republicans in the state legislature applied violations of [Section 6108 of the Uniform Firearms Act] to all counties across the state rather than unjustly singling out Philadelphia,” Krasner said.
While the state House is set to pass a suite of bills to tighten Pennsylvania gun laws this week, they don’t include an expansion of the concealed carry licence requirement to cover open carry. And in past sessions, when the GOP controlled both chambers, efforts to eliminate the concealed carry permit requirement altogether made it to former Gov. Tom Wolf’s desk, only to be vetoed.
In the Livingston case now before the state Supreme Court, the justices limited the question to whether the license requirement in Philadelphia violates Article 1 of the state constitution and the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, both of which guarantee equal protection under the law.
In upholding Livingston’s conviction, the Superior Court judges said they were bound by a 2014 decision of the Superior Court that found the right of people in Philadelphia to openly carry firearms on the street without a license was not fundamental. Controlling the “staggeringly disproportionate” incidence of gun violence in Philadelphia was a legitimate state interest that justifies any infringement on rights, the court said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0843-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-29 05:56:26.837228

It sits idle in a mostly low-income, historic part of town whose prosperous edges are dotted with expensive, modern apartments and homes.

Not too far from the empty Walgreen’s, the former Heritage Square Shopping Center is also idle. All stores are shuttered. The former retail center is surrounded by chain-linked fencing, wrapped tight even as potential customers fill hundreds of new apartments and condos nearby.
Residents in the area depended on the eclectic Food World and a Family Dollar store that operated in the shopping center.  When they closed more than a year ago along with the drug store, it created an improbable food desert near a part of Durham that has experienced unrivaled growth and unprecedented prosperity.  The store closures combined with federal cuts to safety net programs to ensure low income, elderly people don’t go hungry, has local organizations looking for community solutions to keep them fed.
At the 79-unit Veranda at Whitted School on East Umstead Street, the aging residents felt the loss of the stores immediately. The senior housing facility is in a repurposed school that once served Durham’s black children. It’s a short walk from the Walgreens and the shopping center. Now, the closest grocery store is a mile away, a Compare Foods on University Drive. The next closest option is a Food Lion on Fayetteville Street, nearly two miles away.
Both are long hikes for seniors, many of who do not own cars and some who use walkers. For some tenants, catching a city bus can present a challenge.
This month, The Integral Group, the Atlanta-based developer and owner of the Veranda at Whitted School, partnered with the Durham Housing Authority, CenterWell Primary Care Anywhere and Feed My Sheep of Durham Inc., to create an onsite food pantry to keep residents from having to “choose between a lengthy bus ride and a healthy meal.”

“We have some seniors who have more energy than you and me, but we do have some seniors who don’t drive, that have health conditions and the easier we can make things for them, the better,” Kimberly Williams, a project adviser for the Integral Group, told a reporter on a recent visit.
The food pantry is also a response to federal budget cuts that might impact tenants’ ability to feed themselves, Williams said.
“Even if some people might not need the food now, at some point they might,” Williams said. “With all of the cuts that are happening with food stamps and Medicaid and possibly SSI [Supplemental Security Income] benefits, I just want them [tenants] to know that it’s [food] available.”
Meals on Wheels and other agencies deliver food to tenants, Williams said, but those meals are perishable and sometimes go bad before tenants can finish them. It’s good to have the food pantry as an option to help sustain residents through the month, she said.
Williams got the idea for the food pantry after seeing a Facebook post about a pantry at J.J. Henderson Towers, a senior housing community operated by Durham Housing Authority.

“At some point, I want to do it [provide food] for the entire community, where if someone off the street needs food, we would set up something on a Saturday in that circle [in front of the building] and allow people to eat,” Williams said. “This world is getting tough.”
Williams is still working out the details about how food will be distributed with Feed My Sheep of Durham, but tenants told NC Newsline that they welcome the  food pantry.
‘We help each other’
“Oh, it means a lot,” said long-time tenant Regina Royster when asked about the pantry. “I’ve seen people and you can tell they need a little something [food] here and there and we help each other.”
The pantry is in an small room that wasn’t being used. Several shelving units are filled with cereal, pasta, dried beans and various canned goods. A refrigerator in the corner is nearly empty except for a few bottles of Gatorade and two cases of Ensure that a tenant donated during a reporter’s tour of the pantry.
“When I get my nourishments from the VA [Veterans Administration], they can kind of go overboard sometimes,” said James Mitchell, 72, an Army veteran. “This [the pantry] gives me an opportunity to share it with the residents.”

Mitchell has lived in the Veranda at Whitted School since it opened in 2017, and believes the apartment he occupies was his science classroom when he attended the school in the 1960s. He has a car and can travel to grocery stores but said some of his neighbors cannot.
“It [the closing of the stores] created an inconvenience for most people in my age bracket because we now have to travel,” Mitchell said. “We have some who don’t have transportation and some who do and we have to travel further out.”
Senior hunger a growing problem
Food insecurity among senior citizens is a growing concern for many organizations, particularly as the U.S. population aged 65 and older grows rapidly. The growth is driven by the the Baby Boomer generation. According to Population Reference Bureau, the number of Americans age 65 and older is projected to increase to 82 million by 2050.  There are currently more than 61 million people in the U.S. aged 65 or older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
As the population ages, they will need more health care services and assistance for government agencies and nonprofits that provide food and other necessities to help sustain them.
Amy Akroyd, director of development and communications for Meals on Wheels Wake County, noted that a report released by Feeding America a few years ago found that the Raleigh metropolitan area ranked high among the nation’s other metropolitan areas for senior hunger.
“So, we know that the constituency that we serve has certainly seen an increase in that need because of the way that things are going right now with food prices increasing, with fuel prices increasing,” Akroyd said. “Everyone’s just stretching their budgets to meet a greater and greater need every day.”

Meals on Wheels is 50% funded by the federal government. Program operators across the country were disappointed there was no funding increase to meet growing demand, Akroyd said.
“We were fortunate in that we were continued to be funded, but it was flat funded, so that extra push that we really needed to continue to meet the growing need is not quite there anymore,” Akroyd said. “We’re relying on our private community of donors, volunteers, supporters to continue to make sure that we can pay for the meals that are so desperately needed by our seniors.”
Determining the extent of hunger in America could become more difficult in the wake of a Trump administration decision to end the federal government’s annual report on hunger in America.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently announced that it is terminating future Household Food Security Reports, calling them “redundant, costly, politicized” that do “nothing more than fear monger.”
The 2024 report is scheduled for release Oct. 22. It will be the last under the Trump administration.
The decision to halt the annual hunger report follows the passage of the Trump administration tax cut and spending bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimates will kick 3 million people off of food stamps, which is also known as SNAP benefits.
“When you look at some of the things that are being cut in terms of certain entitlement  programs, SNAP has been cut, Medicare, Medicaid, they’re [seniors] are facing some tough choices,” Akroyd said. “Those are all services that our seniors rely on, so the less services that seniors have in their own day-to-day lives the more they’re going to find a need [for food] that we’re going to hopefully be able to fill.”

Green International Airport has been on display in the terminal since its opening in 1996. Renovation plans mean it will soon have to leave its spot near the baggage claim. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)One of the first sights to greet travelers waiting to collect their bags at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport is a symbol for the Ocean State: A fully rigged sailboat, its hull and sails sporting the names of regional maritime companies.
Welcoming travelers is a replica of a Whitbread 30, a mainstay near the baggage claim exit since the terminal named for former Gov. Bruce Sundlun opened in 1996. Getting the boat inside the building during construction was hardly smooth sailing.
“We had to get it in there before they put the doors on,” recalled Tom Rich, former co-owner of New England Boatworks, now Safe Harbor New England Boatworks, in Portsmouth, which built the model. “To get it through the frame, we had to turn it on a 45-degree angle and then had to refinish it inside because it got scratched up coming through.”
Never meant to be seaworthy, the Whitbread is purely decorative. The same goes for a public art installation that for more than two decades has been a fixture at the gate entryway after passing through the airport’s security checkpoint. Titled “Islands,” it consists of two sets of laminated wooden arches in a ribcage shape, adorned by rows of wire-mounted acrylic pods that resemble mussels, petals, or lacquered fingernails.
But now “Islands” and the Whitbread must be moved in order to make way for a $64 million renovation planned at the Warwick airport. So too will a small, Depression-era dinghy built by one of the state’s historic shipwrights and installed underneath the replica sailboat. 
Only the dinghy will survive the move.
Letting go
Public art has a tendency to fade away, said Peter Stempel, the artist behind “Islands,” in a recent phone interview. So he never expected his art to live in T.F. Green forever.  
“Even incredibly famous artists like [Alexander] Calder and Picasso, their pieces get moved,” Stempel said. “Things have a way of either getting put into a back hallway or an odd corner, or disappearing.”
Stempel’s overhead, cresting sculptures have blue pods on one variation, and red on the other. From a distance, their shapes gather like a tiny grove of trees on the horizon. Since being installed in 2002, three years after the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts (RISCA) awarded Stempel the $99,000 commission, “Islands” has provided a canopy and rendezvous point for travelers. Stempel said he often heard people say of the work, “That’s where I meet up with my family.”
“Islands” is scheduled to sink out of public view once renovations begin, as the walls near the artwork are going to be demolished. 
“I think the fact that that space has not been renovated in over 20 years is pretty remarkable,” Stempel said. “So it was always a possibility…There are very few buildings that change as much as airports.”
Boatmaker Rich, meanwhile, said his understanding had always been that the boat replica would forever be a part of the terminal. 
“People come to Rhode Island and think it’s an impressive thing — it kind of says who we are,” he said. “I don’t know how they’d get that thing out of there, I guess they could just cut it up.”
A 60-foot-tall water feature is going to be installed near baggage claim, right where the information desk and the Whitbread and a 13-foot “Amphicraft” dinghy next to it  are on display.
Other plans call for new flooring to replace the existing carpet in the atrium, new ticket counters and seating, and lighting intended to “create a sense of place,” according to a July 11 memo from airport CEO Iftikhar Ahmad to Rhode Island Airport Corporation’s board of directors. Terminal renovations are set to be completed by late 2027.
The idea, Ahmad wrote, is to build upon other cosmetic upgrades and amenities added to the airport in recent years, such as $10 million marble-lined bathrooms, automated coffee machines, new restaurants and colossal welcome signs off Interstate 95.
“I’m fully committed to transforming this place,” Ahmad told reporters after a recent board meeting.
The boat will likely need to be relocated, airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said in an emailed statement. But where exactly it will go is still up in the air.
“Discussions related to the sailboat’s future remain ongoing,” Fischer said. “Once material submittals from the contractor come back to us for review, we will have more details on the final aesthetic.”
The overall goal of the renovations, Fischer said, is to borrow aesthetics from notable buildings in Newport and Providence.
Ahmad told reporters the decorative sailboat could be relocated, but it’s not a top priority for airport officials.
“There is no compulsion for us to do this right now,” he said. “Maybe we just see things differently as to what’s important to us.”

The last of the Herreshoffs
The Whitbread is just for show, but the Amphicraft dinghy constructed in the 1930s by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company — the Bristol boatbuilder that dominated the state’s marine industry from the 1870s through the 1940s — can sail the sea.
You wouldn’t immediately know from looking at the small Depression-era craft tucked behind the welcome desk, but it’s an important piece of sailing history, said Bill Lynn, president of the Herreshoff Marine Museum in Bristol.
“It’s sort of the first shot at a boat you could actually tow behind your car and take somewhere, set it up, throw it in the water,” Lynn explained. “It’s a pretty cool little boat — it’s this kind of LEGO kit.”
The Amphicraft dinghy is also extremely rare. Only 15 were ever made, according to the museum.
There actually used to be three Herreshoff boats within the terminal, Lynn said.
The first to leave the terminal was a 15-foot wooden racing boat commissioned by the Watch Hill Yacht Club in Westerly during the early 1920s. It was pulled from the terminal by the museum in order to get refurbished for its 100th birthday at the yacht club, Lynn said. Airport officials never asked for it back.
“Now it’s parked in Connecticut waiting for what happens next,” Lynn said.
Then in May, Lynn said he was informed by airport officials he would need to move a steam launch built in 1902 and originally commissioned by railroad tycoon Henry Clay Pierce to make way for the planned renovations.
That boat has since returned to the museum on Bristol’s Burnside Street. Lynn said he remains hopeful all Herreshoffs can come back to the terminal.
“We’re sort of twiddling our thumbs waiting to find out whether we can bring any of these boats back,” he said. “I sort of worry that’s not going to happen, which would be too bad.”

Out of the airport, into memory
The state arts council voted unanimously on Sept. 15 to OK the removal of Stempel’s “Islands” so the airport corporation can carry out its plans. 
Stempel, now an associate professor of landscape architecture at Penn State University, was a Rhode Island School of Design graduate living and working in Providence in 1998 when he won the approval of a RISCA panel charged with choosing artworks to accompany T.F. Green’s gate expansion. State law dictates that at least 1% of funding be devoted toward public artworks for state-invested capital projects whose budgets exceed $250,000.  
According to Providence Journal coverage from 1998, Stempel’s sculpture — whose shapes reference “grape arbors…[and] shaded patios” and “upside-down boats” — was chosen by a 6-4 vote over a set of eight hanging shell-shaped sculptures. The panel debated its final choice at length, with some finding Stempel’s sculpture overly bold. 
“Those colors are just too shocking,” one RISCA board member lamented at the time.










I’m fully committed to transforming this place.


– Rhode Island Airport Corporation CEO Iftikhar Ahmad


The artwork is site-specific, meaning it was designed and fabricated to accommodate the precise location where it would be installed. The airport’s challenge to Stempel was to fill the slots atop a wall that had once been occupied by planters, but staff found upkeep of the live plants too demanding, Stempel said.
“They also didn’t want you to disrupt the advertising that was in the terminal — part of the terminal revenue,” Stempel said. “These are all the things that public artists deal with all the time.”
Stempel eventually noticed the “lens of space” between the install site and the surrounding advertising. A canopy, he decided, could elegantly fill the space and look sufficiently different from the ads that it couldn’t be mistaken for one. So Stempel installed the colorful arcs and bulbs from 2 to 5 a.m. on a morning in 2002, when post-Sept. 11 security measures were still fresh. 
“Every single piece of it went through a metal detector,” Stempel recalled. 
Stempel wonders how many people saw his sculpture over the years, although he estimates it’s a “tremendous number” given the high foot traffic in the area. The artist praised RISCA for its commitment to public art and said that “Islands” formed a milestone in his career.
“The difference between doing a $20,000 sculpture and doing a $100,000 sculpture in those years was incredibly significant,” Stempel said. “It’s really what allowed me to transition to being much more professional.”
But Stempel does not want the sculpture back as a “souvenir.” After RISCA informed him of the deaccession, Stempel waived his contractual right of recovery to the state-owned “Islands.” 
His preference is that the work would be destroyed. “It’s really very difficult to recover it in a meaningful way,” he said.
The removal process can begin once renovation permits have been obtained. 
“With site specific artwork such as ‘Islands,’ this typically means deconstructing and disposing of the artwork outside of public view so the public memory of the piece as a complete artwork is maintained,” Todd Trebour, RISCA’s executive director wrote in a Sept. 23 email.
“Remove it and demolish it with dignity,” Stempel said. “And then it will go into memory and history.”

Across the border in Virginia, Buchanan County is projected to lose nearly half its population by 2050, but the pattern in Kentucky’s coal counties is identical: Young people leave, older residents remain, and the math no longer supports schools, clinics, or small businesses. 
As one observer put it, “There are more hearses headed to the cemetery than moving vans pulling into the driveway.”
Yet buried in the demographic projections was a crucial caveat: Their forecasts could prove “too dire if people start moving into the region.” In other words, decline is not destiny. The question is how to reverse the exodus and transform Eastern Kentucky from a region people leave into one they choose to call home.
Recent floods underscore the urgency. In July 2022, torrential rain killed 45 people and forced families from their homes in Knott, Breathitt, and Perry counties — part of a pattern of repeated disasters that make rebuilding in the hollows increasingly untenable. Despite billions of dollars in federal investment since the 1960s, from highways to retraining programs, the region continues bleeding people and opportunity.
A Homestead Act for Eastern Kentucky

The problem runs deeper than jobs. It’s about land — who controls it, where homes can safely be built, and whether working families have secure, affordable ground beneath their feet.
A framework already in place
For years, I’ve advocated for a modern Homestead Act for Central Appalachia — not as nostalgia for the Homestead Act of 1862 but as a practical strategy built on existing legal and institutional frameworks. The tools for transformative land reform already exist; what’s missing is the political will to coordinate them at scale.
Kentucky passed land bank legislation that allows localities to create public land banks that can acquire tax-delinquent or abandoned properties and prepare them for productive reuse. Louisville has already pioneered one of the nation’s largest and most active land banks, demonstrating how city governments can move neglected properties back into productive use. 
Community Land Trusts (CLTs), pioneered in Georgia and operating successfully in rural Tennessee since the 1970s, keep land affordable while preventing speculation. 
Federal brownfields law shields new property owners from environmental liability when proper cleanup protocols are followed. Most importantly, billions in federal funding for mine reclamation, infrastructure development, and climate-resilient housing are already flowing through existing programs.
The legal infrastructure exists. The funding mechanisms are operational. What we need now is a comprehensive implementation plan.
The blueprint: 3 million acres across Appalachia
Here’s how a regional Homestead Act could work in practice, focusing initially on Eastern Kentucky while coordinating with similar efforts across the broader Appalachian coalfields.
A federal-state partnership administered through the Appalachian Regional Commission would target three categories of property for acquisition. Thousands of acres of reclaimed surface-mined land, already reforested under federal reclamation requirements, could be developed for housing, renewable energy or agroforestry systems.  Secondly, corporate-owned undisturbed land, much of it controlled by coal and timber companies, includes rich soils and abundant water resources; with companies facing bankruptcy or divestment pressures, prime tracts could be secured at below-market prices. 
Finally, underused federal holdings such as portions of national forests could be designated for homestead development, especially on higher ground suitable for climate-resilient communities.
Initial capitalization of $100 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act would support land acquisition, supplemented by state contributions and private partnerships. Funding could be raised through several methods. Strategic auctions at bankruptcy sales of distressed coal company assets would allow large tracts to be secured cheaply by government agencies and conservation groups. Negotiated sales with struggling corporations could provide tax benefits and structured payments in exchange for below-market land transfers. Land swaps would allow governments to trade less desirable holdings for prime private land needed for homestead development. Green bonds, issued by states or municipalities and backed by federal guarantees, would finance large-scale land acquisition and infrastructure expansion.

The program would offer 10- to 40-acre plots to eligible participants at nominal cost, in some cases as little as $100 to $500 per acre for reclaimed mining land, with higher prices for greenfield properties. To encourage long-term settlement, families would receive 10-year property tax exemptions, giving them time to establish farms and businesses before local taxes phased in.
 Development incentives would include relocation grants, low-interest loans for housing and agriculture, and five-year income tax exemptions for those committing to stay a decade or more. Each community would also be guaranteed modern infrastructure: improved roads, stormwater management and reliable broadband access.
If divided conservatively into 30-acre parcels, Kentucky’s potential 1.3 million acres could support over 43,000 homesteads — enough to stabilize population decline and lay the foundation for renewal.
Eligibility and priority systems
Three categories of participants would be eligible for the homestead program. The first would be families already living in Appalachia but seeking safer, more affordable housing or land for small-scale farming and business development. The second would be returning members of the Appalachian diaspora who left the region for work but could now return thanks to remote employment and homestead incentives. The third would be newcomers from outside Appalachia prepared to commit long-term to farming, renewable energy, health care education, or small business.
Priority would be given to applicants who pledge at least 15 years of residency, to families with children who would stabilize rural schools, and to those with agricultural or entrepreneurial skills most likely to contribute to long-term community development.
Infrastructure as foundation
Modern homesteading requires 21st century infrastructure. Every homestead community would be developed above the 100-year floodplain, ensuring safety while saving taxpayers from repeated disaster recovery costs. High-ground development would be paired with advanced stormwater systems using retention ponds, permeable surfaces, and native landscaping.
 Universal broadband would connect each home with fiber-optic service capable of supporting remote work, online learning and e-commerce. Cooperative service networks, rooted in Appalachian traditions of mutual aid, would allow communities to pool resources for equipment, purchasing, marketing, child care, and elder care — lowering costs and strengthening resilience.
Economic development through land use
Economic growth would be driven by land use tailored to the region’s landscape.
 Specialty agriculture such as orchards and vineyards could revive Eastern Kentucky’s fruit-growing heritage and expand into grape production for wine and juice. Agroforestry systems would combine tree crops with pasture, providing multiple income streams while restoring ecosystems. Controlled-environment agriculture — greenhouses and high vertical structures — would allow year-round vegetable and herb production. Non-timber forest products, from ginseng to mushrooms, could build on traditional mountain practices. 
Carbon forestry, replanting blight-resistant chestnuts and native hardwoods, would generate steady revenue through carbon credit markets. Value-added processing in food plants, sawmills and craft workshops would ensure local producers capture more of the wealth they create. Finally, tourism and recreation — from farm stays to outdoor adventure — would capitalize on the region’s natural beauty and cultural heritage.
Governance through democratic land trusts
Community land trusts would be the foundation of governance. Families would own their homes and improvements, but the trust would retain ownership of the land to prevent speculation. Resale formulas would ensure housing remained affordable across generations, while community assemblies would make decisions on infrastructure, land use, and cooperative ventures.
The role of educational institutions
Kentucky’s universities and colleges must serve as technical assistance and training hubs. The University of Kentucky and Eastern Kentucky University could lead mine land reclamation, agriculture, and engineering. Berea College could provide civic, cultural and organizational leadership, consistent with its historic mission to serve Appalachia. Together, they would create a research and training network to support homesteaders.
Learning from precedent
Gov. Andy Beshear’s response to Eastern Kentucky’s devastating 2022 floods demonstrates climate-resilient relocation in practice. Eight new high-ground communities are being built across the coalfields, including the Skyview neighborhood in Hazard. “We cannot keep putting people back in the same places and expect a different outcome,” Beshear said at one groundbreaking.

This model — relocating families to safer ground while building modern infrastructure — could be replicated across Appalachia. Other examples, from Valmeyer, Illinois, to Scotland’s Isle of Eigg, show how coordinated relocation and community ownership can create vibrant new settlements.
Economic impact and fiscal benefits
A comprehensive homestead program would generate significant economic activity throughout Eastern Kentucky. Initial infrastructure development — roads, broadband, water systems and housing — would create thousands of construction jobs in the first decade. Using conservative estimates of $150,000 per homestead for housing and infrastructure, 43,000 Kentucky homesteads would generate over $6 billion in construction activity.
Small business development would follow. If half of all homesteads created enterprises averaging $25,000 annually, that would represent more than $500 million in new economic activity. The property tax base would expand as reclaimed land bought for $500 an acre and improved with housing, barns and orchards reached assessed values of $3,000 to $5,000 per acre within a decade. Meanwhile, stronger employment and population growth would reduce demands on social services, stabilizing schools, clinics, and local governments.
Implementation timeline
The program would roll out in phases. Pilot projects in two or three Eastern Kentucky counties during the first two years would establish proof of concept. Regional expansion in years three through five would scale the model to thousands of homesteads. Full implementation in a decade would integrate Kentucky’s coalfields into a broader multi-state homestead strategy.
Monitoring and accountability
A modern homestead initiative must be accountable. Annual monitoring would measure job creation, business formation, income growth and rising property values. Demographic trends such as school enrollment, age distribution and family formation would show whether the program is attracting and retaining young residents. Environmental monitoring would track soil restoration, water quality, biodiversity and carbon sequestration to ensure development improves rather than degrades ecosystems. 
Community development indicators — participation in cooperatives, civic organizations and cultural programs — would reveal whether homesteads are building stronger, more resilient communities.
Beyond economic development: proving ground for democracy
The homestead program’s value extends beyond economics. By returning land and decision-making power to families, it strengthens the democratic foundations of rural life. It offers a path to renewal based on ownership, responsibility and cooperation.
Conclusion: from decline to renewal
Decline is not destiny if people start moving back to the region. A modern Homestead Act provides the framework, incentives, and community structures to make that migration not just possible but attractive.
The total new investment dollars I am proposing are small compared to the amounts the country has spent on other relief projects. The Appalachian Regional Commission’s designation of Central Appalachia is 60 mainly coalfield counties in four states: Southwest Virginia, Southern West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky and Eastern Tennessee. The 2020 census showed a population of 1,852,312 but declining. 
ARC designates 80% of those 60 counties as economically “distressed” out of the 118 distressed counties in all of Appalachia. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the U.S. spent $120.5 billion restoring New Orleans and the Gulf region. The total population there was 1.4 million. The total benefit to the nation in restoring the Appalachian coalfields far outweighs the projected costs.
The tools exist. The funding streams are available. The communities are ready. What’s needed now is the political will to coordinate these resources at the scale the challenge demands.
Eastern Kentucky stands at a crossroads. One path leads to continued decline, aging communities and economic stagnation. The other leads to renewal, sustainable prosperity, and communities that can weather any storm.
The choice is ours. The time is now. The land is waiting.

Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery (left), faces a rematch with Democrat Lily Franklin in the 41st House of Delegates District. (Photos courtesy of campaigns)Two years after a nail-biting finish, Democrat Lily Franklin and Del. Chris Obenshain, the Republican incumbent, are locked in a rematch in Virginia’s House of Delegates District 41 — a contest that could again turn on handfuls of ballots in a district that blends the university-anchored towns of Blacksburg and Christiansburg with more rural and suburban precincts of Roanoke and Montgomery counties. In 2023, Obenshain edged Franklin by just 183 votes.
As the campaign intensifies, both candidates cast themselves as uniquely suited to serve a district in flux — Franklin promising generational change and connection to working-class struggles, Obenshain touting continuity, legislative experience and a record of concrete wins. 
House District 41 is one of the state’s more demographically dynamic districts. It has a comparatively low median age, a substantial proportion of renter-occupied housing, and a mix of precincts that swing between college-town and exurban voters. The district also leans slightly toward competitive balance in recent elections — a swing seat more often than not — making it a bellwether for broader trends in Southwest Virginia politics.
According to data from the Virginia Public Access Project, money underscores the high stakes of this year’s election cycle. Obenshain had raised $490,440 through Aug. 31 and booked $782,602 in political ads set to run through the week of Nov. 3. 
Franklin had raised $893,914 and booked $573,599 in ads for the same period. VPAP also ranks Franklin among the top five Democratic House fundraisers as of the Aug. 31 reporting period. 
 Lily Franklin

A former teacher and legislative aide who grew up in a five-generation Southwest Virginia family, Franklin, 31, pitches herself as the candidate most closely tied to the district’s daily realities. 
“I’ve had lived experiences that are very similar to folks in this district. … I worked multiple jobs to make ends meet,” she said in a recent phone interview, adding that having lived paycheck to paycheck shapes how she approaches policy. Her campaign biography highlights work for Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, and a political science degree from Longwood University.
After losing by fewer than 200 votes in 2023, Franklin said her operation this cycle started earlier and is broader. 
“We’ve been talking to folks on the ground and knocking on doors since April. We have been connecting with students on campus all year round,” she said. What’s different, in her view, is an electorate “ready for new leadership and a change,” and a campaign that offers a future “we’re fighting for, not just voting against another candidate.”
Franklin’s read on the district is pointedly non-ideological. “People want their elected officials to deliver on everyday solutions, they just want their lives to be less chaotic. … ‘I just need my electric bill to be 20% less.’” 
That message is calibrated for a district she says is among the youngest in the state — with a median age of 29 — but also includes rural and suburban neighborhoods. 
“I connect deeply on the community values that unite us,” she said, adding that she’s felt the region’s housing crunch personally after being priced out of Blacksburg into Christiansburg.
On housing, Franklin backs a mix of renter relief and ownership incentives — a state tax credit for renters spending more than 30% of income on housing, stronger legal protections against unjust evictions, and public-private partnerships to help first-time buyers. 
She also favors curbing large-scale investor purchases.
“We should be banning hedge funds from buying out our homes and really trying to incentivize people who live here locally to take a little bit more ownership,” Franklin said. That position tracks with a growing debate in Richmond over investor activity in tight markets such as Blacksburg, where Virginia Tech enrollment has strained supply.
Transportation is another pillar of the Democrat’s campaign. 
Franklin said much of the Interstate 81 work through the New River and Roanoke valleys is underway and should be “wrapped up” as planned. She supports the Christiansburg Amtrak station as an economic catalyst and doesn’t approve of adding tolls, arguing Virginia should prioritize existing surplus dollars before new fees. 
Franklin’s economic blueprint leans on translating Virginia Tech’s research strength into local jobs: targeted incentives for firms that spin out of campus, stronger workforce training and a caution that budget cuts can reverberate through already fragile regional employers. 
On data centers, she favors local control over siting, with regional coordination on shared resources like the electric grid — a question Montgomery County leaders have pressed in recent months. 
On public education, Franklin argues Virginia’s funding formula is outdated and should be refocused on student needs. She supports raising teacher pay and incentives for hard-to-staff divisions and says the state’s surplus shows Virginia has a “priorities” problem, not a revenue problem.
Franklin draws a sharp contrast on reproductive rights, pledging to vote for the constitutional amendment to protect reproductive freedom, including access to contraception and IVF. She links the policy to access challenges on the ground, noting a “year-long wait list to see an OBGYN” in Montgomery County. The proposed amendment is expected to go before voters after clearing two successive General Assembly sessions.
On guns, Franklin frames her position as “Second Amendment, with safeguards,” backing safe-storage standards, background checks and restrictions for domestic-violence offenders — measures that have polled well in a range of Virginia communities.
Franklin also made campaign-finance reform part of her closing argument, promising an opening-day bill to ban donations from public service corporations and to create a faster, state-backed disaster-relief/resilience fund after storms — citing long waits for federal help after Hurricane Helene. 
Her bottom line: With Democrats favored to gain ground this year, HD-41 should send a member “within the majority party” who knows “how to pass legislation and get money back to the district.”
 Chris Obenshain

Obenshain, 47, counters with a record-and-relationships pitch. A Montgomery County prosecutor and Army Reserve officer who grew up in Roanoke County, he won the open seat in 2023 and says constituent service and concrete wins define his first term. His campaign biography cites stints in local, state and federal roles and deep family ties in the region.
In a phone interview with The Mercury, the Republican pointed first to passenger rail as one of his most significant accomplishments during his first term. 
“Getting passenger rail back to the New River Valley for the first time in decades” — with trains slated to roll into Christiansburg “very soon” — was a top promise, he said, crediting coordination across “local, state, (and) federal” partners. 
Obenshain called his locality a “very balanced … competitive district” and said that’s why “an experienced and effective voice” matters. Day to day, he said, the job is listening and solving problems — from unemployment benefits to paving requests — and coming prepared when session moves fast.
On housing, Obenshain said the state’s role is to speed supply by reducing “excess mandates and regulations that drive up the cost of housing,” and to help localities move projects “through the pipeline” faster because “time is money.” 
He also supports “guardrails” on large outside investors who buy and hold local homes, arguing the state should ensure first responders and new graduates can afford to live where they work.
I-81 remains his marquee infrastructure focus. Obenshain emphasized that he helped secure an extra $70 million in the budget to accelerate projects and wants to prioritize widening the backup-plagued stretch between Christiansburg and Salem, with expanded passenger rail also relieving pressure. He favors continuing to steer surplus dollars into the corridor rather than relying on tolls or new revenue until current plans are funded.
Obenshain leans heavily into workforce development to tie Virginia Tech innovation to jobs — expanding apprenticeships and career and technical education, with earlier exposure in K-12. 
He praised a new Career and Technical Education Center in Roanoke and growing offerings in Montgomery County, adding that community colleges are vital “to meet the jobs of the future.”
Like Franklin, he said data center siting should be a local decision, with regional collaboration on water and electricity but “no state veto from another part of Virginia.” On education policy, he backs “parents’ rights” and education savings accounts to broaden school choice, while emphasizing that “it’s always a team effort” with teachers.
On abortion, he opposes the constitutional amendment, arguing it would “overturn decades of existing law, require taxpayers to fund even elective abortions up to 40 weeks” and undo parental-consent rules — claims Democrats dispute. 
But he also renewed his support of exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother and said voters should scrutinize what the amendment would actually do. 
On gun policy, Obenshain said enforcement should target violent offenders and repeat gun crimes, not “law-abiding gun owners,” noting Democrats didn’t docket his bill to increase penalties for using a firearm in a violent felony. 
Environmental stewardship, he said, is about enforcing existing laws to protect places like the New River, McAfee Knob and the Appalachian Trail.
Obenshain touted two bipartisan proposals as examples for his willingness to work with lawmakers from across the aisle: He backed a regulated retail cannabis market, where he said public-safety concerns unite both parties, and anti-Semitic threat legislation he introduced that a Democrat carried and the governor signed.
His closing argument centers on continuity. “I’ve been an effective voice for Southwest Virginia, reducing costs on energy, healthcare and housing, fighting costly mandates, and investing in public education and public safety. … I hope people see the progress that’s being made and my passion for continuing that work.”

(Photo by Evan Visconti/Virginia Mercury) Approximately 60% of Virginia is located inside the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and those communities now have access to an updated map that shows precisely how their landscapes are changing over time. 
The Chesapeake Bay Program’s land use and land cover change mapping project compares the landscape across three different snapshots in time, offering a detailed view of the watershed up to as recently as 2021. 
The research shows Virginia has lost nearly 50,000 acres of tree canopy in its portion of the watershed to development over just seven years. 
The publically-available mapping project “empowers people with information that they can use to make longer term and more sustainable land-use decisions,” said Peter Claggett, research geographer with the U.S. Geological Survey and lead for the Chesapeake Bay Program land data team. 
“Overall, it enables you, down to a community level, to identify opportunities for restoration and conservation and for everyone to gain a perspective about how their community is changing over time,” Claggett said. 
The most significant change to the landscape between 2014 and 2021 that researchers hope to highlight with the data was a rapid loss of tree canopy and forests due to human development. 
Tree cover status and change fact sheets were created as part of the project to provide  county or municipality-level analysis of tree canopy and a summary of the local benefits those trees provide. 
Experts quantified several of the benefits trees provide with a tool called iTree Landscape, which estimates how much air pollution, stormwater runoff and carbon are removed from the environment by the trees in communities. 
The estimates provide a more concrete way for people to understand what tree canopy is worth, because “talking about acres of tree canopy between time periods is a little abstract in some ways,” said Elliott Kurtz, geospatial data engineer for the Chesapeake Conservancy’s Conservation Innovation Center, a contributor to the mapping project.
The iTree estimates show that “we’re not just doing this to protect the trees for the trees’ own sake; this is also providing real benefits to people in the community,” said Kurtz. 
In addition to the watershed-wide mapping project, the Virginia Department of Forestry (DOF) is currently working on creating its own map as part of a 2024 General Assembly bill that requires the agency to create a “Forestland and Urban Tree Canopy Conservation Plan” for the entire state by November 2026. 
The statewide data mapping project will compare how the landscape has changed between 2018 and 2023 through the use of aerial imagery and DOF’s “boots on the ground” knowledge of every timber harvest operation in the Commonwealth, Johnson said. 
This will ideally provide an even more accurate look at how Virginia’s landscape is changing, and identify precisely which tree canopy losses are temporary as a result of rotational timber harvests and which are permanent as a result of development. 
“The concern from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation is that when the land use changes completely to something other than forest, pasture or agriculture, then you lose the infiltration ability of the land,” said Ann Jurczyk, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s Virginia manager of urban restoration. 
“Generally, that’s when you have increased storm water runoff and increased heat and the other things that are detrimental to both the people and the critters that live in the Bay,” Jurczyk said. 
Claggett said one of the major benefits of landscape mapping is that it allows communities to zoom in or out and ask, “‘are we on a trajectory that we want to continue, or are we headed to become a place that we don’t want to become?’”
 Emerging threats to tree canopy

The watershed as a whole lost just over 100,000 acres of tree cover to development over the seven-year course of the study so far, with nearly half of those losses occurring in Virginia, according to data from the project. 
Researchers also analyzed losses of what they termed forested extent. These are lands that not only contained tree canopy with an unmanaged, natural understory when the images were taken, but also lands that were in the early stages of regenerating back into natural forest after being logged prior to imaging. 
Taking these lands into account, data shows the watershed as a whole lost about 177,000 acres of forested extent to development, with Virginia contributing a loss of over 70,000 acres.

The research uncovered several emerging threats to tree canopy in Virginia, which include the construction of utility scale solar arrays, warehouses, road expansions and electrical transmission lines. 
Landscape changes like these are considered permanent, whereas harvesting land for timber and then allowing it to regenerate, an industry that statewide adds over $20 billion to Virginia’s economy annually, is viewed as a temporary change to tree canopy and the forest structure.
Virginia’s portion of the watershed is seeing more development as a result of its emerging land uses, “and it’s very much along these sort of growth corridors from D.C. southward to Richmond and then from Richmond east to Hampton Roads,” said Jurczyk. “We’re growing by leaps and bounds; Charlottesville, Staunton, Harrisonburg all lost tree canopy as well.”
The timing of the mapping project allowed researchers to capture “the initiation of utility scale solar in the region,” said Claggett. The growing source of energy has major implications on how communities are making use of their land, particularly in Virginia where 54% of all solar panels that the project mapped throughout the watershed were found.
Between 2014 and 2018, the project mapped just over 600 acres of solar panel arrays in the Commonwealth. Then between 2018 and 2021, that number jumped to over 3,200 acres of solar panel arrays mapped.
“Unlike other states, in Virginia for the first time period, 74% of (land containing solar arrays) came from forested extent, and the second time period saw 68% come from forested extent,” Claggett said.
These percentages signify yet another competing land use in Virginia’s forestlands.
“Ideally, we’d like to see solar on reclaimed mine lands, on rooftops, on landfills, on land that can’t be used for agriculture or forestry,” Claggett said.  
The biggest solar operations currently in Virginia were installed shortly after the 2021 mapping imagery was captured. Claggett said he expects the next round of imagery to pick up between roughly 10,000 to 15,000 more acres of solar arrays in Virginia. 
The next update to the Chesapeake Bay Program’s land cover mapping project will analyze imagery from 2025 and 2026. Researchers expect to publish that data before 2029.
 A closer look at our streams 

The project also released new high-resolution hydrography data, or mapping of how water moves throughout the landscape, to provide the most comprehensive inventory of the watershed’s stream and ditch network to date, according to researchers.
Without updated mapping, if streams are modified or buried over, then we “lose track of how the landscape drains,” said Matt Baker, professor of geography and environmental systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. 
The hydrography data has the ability to pick up tiny streams and channels that exist in the headwaters of large rivers that eventually drain into the Chesapeake Bay. 
“It’s quite important for us to know about them in our mapping efforts because they are conduits for both the water, nutrients and other pollutants that might move across the landscape,” said Baker. “So in the context of the Chesapeake Bay Program, it’s really important to understand where the water is flowing and what it might be carrying on its way to the Bay.”
Mapping waterways improves researchers’ understanding of where aquatic habitats may exist and what is restricting the natural movements and migration of different species.

Possible blockades such as culverts, the drainage pipes beneath roads and other infrastructure, can create a barrier to threatened migratory species such as river herring and American shad that depend on making it upstream to spawn.
Updated mapping also allows researchers to identify streams that are missing from existing maps but could be providing aquatic habitat.

“We’re finding this data shows a lot more streams that hold fish populations,” especially for species found in the colder headwater streams that the research homed in on, said Mike Evans, deputy director of the Chesapeake Conservancy Conservation Innovation Center. 
 Community tree planting efforts

Despite the significant loss of tree canopy and forested extent to development, communities throughout the watershed still managed to plant a historic number of trees. 
“I know there is some discussion of loss, but we also have hit record numbers of new trees in the ground,” said Lara Johnson, the Virginia Department of Forestry’s urban and community forestry program manager. 
In 2024, there were about 5,700 acres of community trees planted throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the highest total reported since tracking began in 2014, according to community tree planting data compiled by the Chesapeake Bay Program.
“We’re so proud of our partner Bay states and also all of our partners in Virginia,” said Johnson, highlighting several of the “grassroots” community planting programs that DOF supports.

The Virginia Trees for Clean Water Grant Program is available to communities looking to fund tree-planting efforts that raise public awareness of the benefits of trees and their impacts on water quality. The Throwing Shade VA Program provides a discount on native trees purchased from a Virginia nursery. 
“Both of those programs have planted more than 70,000 trees just last year in Virginia,”  Johnson said. 
Riparian buffers, a major contributor to the overall health of the Chesapeake Bay, are strips of forest that border waterways and act as a natural filter to remove pollutants from runoff before they enter a stream or river. 
The Riparian Forests for Landowners (RFFL) program is unique in that it “establishes buffers on landscapes that we probably wouldn’t typically be able to,” said Patti Nylander, the Virginia Department of Forestry’s watershed program coordinator. 
The program is open to small, private landowners, a demographic which normally misses out on riparian buffer funding that typically targets large agricultural lands. The program has already added 110 acres of riparian forest buffer in Virginia, said Nylander.
The James River Buffer Program is also making progress on riparian buffer planting. Since its launch in 2019, the collaboration has installed about 1,300 acres of riparian buffer, equal to over 400,000 native trees.

In addition to planting new trees, Jurczyk said communities need to “put more emphasis on preservation of existing tree canopy and less emphasis on what we replace.” 
“Part of that is just understanding at the locality level just how hamstrung we are on enforcing tree canopy replacement,” said Jurczyk. 
In Virginia, localities can only require that up to 10% of trees be replaced after removal for developing a commercial or industrial site and 20% or 30%, depending on the district, be replaced after removal for developing a residential site. 
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has argued year after year that the replacement percentage should be “a floor, not a ceiling” on the amount of trees that a locality can require to be replaced after removal for a development, said Jurczyk.
Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, was chief patron of a bill in this year’s General Assembly session that would have given localities statewide the option to enforce higher tree canopy replacement percentages that are currently available only to Planning District 8 in Northeastern Virginia. 
After approval by both the House and Senate, Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill.
“The current law on tree canopy ordinances strikes a balance between the ability of a locality to hinder residential and commercial development with increased costs and the ability of a locality to preserve tree canopy,” Youngkin wrote in his veto statement.

(Photo courtesy of Kenda Sutton-El/Birth in Color)Seven years ago, Congress’ Preventing Maternal Deaths Act was signed into law by President Donald Trump — but the funding it provides to states to address maternal health disparities is set to expire at the end of this month. This year, its renewal was left out of Trump’s budget proposal. 
While competing priorities are at play as Congress deliberates continuing resolutions to avoid a government shutdown by Oct. 1., the funding has bolstered data collection that informs policies to help prevent pregnancy-related deaths in Virginia and nationwide. 
Dubbed the Enhancing Reviews and Surveillance to Eliminate Maternal Mortality, or ERASE MM, nearly $90 million has gone towards state committees around the country that review maternal deaths and analyze the causes. The committees’ findings have helped spur protocols aimed at preventing hemorrhage, sepsis or suicide. 
Virginia’s Maternal Mortality Review Team, for instance, collects data and the Virginia Department of Health also posts a data dashboard.
The data collection is in line with a broader effort to address maternal health disparities and underlying causes in maternal mortality. Data shows that deaths have decreased in recent years while collected data has also informed state policies, such as Virginia’s “Momnibus” packages that were signed into law this year.  Those measures enabled Medicaid reimbursement rates for midwives and pilot programs for remote monitoring for hypertension.
Not every proposal prevailed, such as a mutli-year effort to require unconscious bias training for license renewals — a measure to target one facet of why Black women are more likely to die in childbirth, but others have addressed support for maternal health workforces and Medicaid enrollment timelines for pregnant people. 
Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, said lawmakers will reintroduce failed or vetoed legislation again next year. She’s particularly hopeful about the unconscious bias bill, as it has consistently had bipartisan patrons. She also hopes a bill that would support businesses providing childcare to workers can pass. 
“You can’t talk about moms without talking about babies,” she said. 
Though Youngkin and some Republicans have noted support for addressing maternal health disparities and improving outcomes, Democrats have largely led on the issue. In an interview with The Mercury, Mundon King took a moment to stump for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger, who she believes will get the other Momnibus bills across the finish line. 
Be it Spanberger, or Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, either woman will be responsible for signing off on the state’s next budget — one that will likely need to address several federal funding losses. 
Not extending the ERASE MM program in Trump’s budget plans is what U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, called part of a larger push to “shrink the federal government willy nilly.” 
Throughout the summer she has cautioned that federal funding cuts will put more burden on states, and said some states will forgo certain services altogether. 
“Rather than looking at what are the important problems to solve,” she said, the cuts have culminated in a lot of health care infrastructure taking hits or bracing for them.
McClellan and Democratic state lawmakers have said throughout the spring and the summer the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to negatively affect the public health landscape with its changes to hospital funding mechanisms and Medicaid. So far, three clinics have closed in Virginia — citing the act as part of the reason — while hospital administrators have spoken out as well. 
On maternal health specifically, McClellan said letting ERASE MM lapse essentially erases the good intentions Republicans in Congress and the president have espoused with regards to both maternal health and the “Make America Healthy Again” movement.  
She juxtaposed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. MAHA initiatives against the different federal funding cuts to public health like the OBBBA, the tax credits that help people purchase health insurance which have yet to be renewed, and funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health. 
“It’s just a huge disconnect that I don’t think they see,” she said. 
Previous efforts to extend the ERASE MM funding have been unsuccessful — like a stopgap funding measure in December 2024 that failed with Republican opposition. The program was also missing from Trump’s budget proposals for next year. Legislation to extend the program introduced this year has not advanced so far. As Congress stares down a potential government shutdown before Oct. 1, it may not be included yet again. 
With the 2026 fiscal year beginning on that date, Congress needs to have resolved its appropriations bills or agree on a continuing resolution in the interim. Such resolutions have become par for the course in recent years for the nation’s legislative body. 
If McClellan and other federal lawmakers can’t extend the program in its current form this year, she plans to “absolutely” work on reauthorization in the future. 
North Carolina Central University nursing department chair Yolanda VanRiel is also watching closely. As a nursing professor, she helps oversee the education of future health care workers. She noted how programs like ERASE MM are an example of federal funding that helps states across the country.
“Maternal health is one of the most urgent equity issues of our time,” she said. “We know that solutions like community-based programs, culturally responsive care (and) consistent monitoring works, but we need the will to sustain them.” 
North Carolina is among the states to have maternal health data dashboards that help inform policy and has also its own Momnibus package in the works, but it has not passed yet. 
“Momnibus (legislation) shows what is possible when states lead boldly, but states cannot do this alone,” VanRiel said. “Federal and state partnerships ground the belief that every mother’s life matters.”

In 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and lawmakers sought to build a new system with “rigorous standards” for students, “best-in-class assessments, and a transparent and meaningful accountability and support system,” according to a Jan. 9 report. 
The agency suggested in a statement to The Mercury that lawmakers could have avoided delays by including ”mandatory carry forward language” when appropriating  $500,000 for the project, which would have allowed officials to begin soliciting proposals from qualified vendors immediately. 
“No General Assembly deadlines have been missed, and the General Assembly has been steadily updated,” said Kenita Matthews, a VDOE spokeswoman, in a statement last week. 
The response came after Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor and chair of the Senate Committee on Education and Health, raised concerns about delays and risks in a letter to Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera and Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Guillickson.
In her Sept. 22 letter, Hashmi noted that no Request for Proposals (RFP) had been issued following the legislature’s authorization for the agency to extend the existing Standards of Learning assessment contract with Pearson, an educational publishing company, through Dec. 31, 2027. The intent was to ensure “continuity of testing” while a new contract is secured. 
Hashmi added that lawmakers appropriated $500,000 for VDOE to hire a vendor to analyze options for an innovative new assessment system and to craft a competitive RFP with input from a work group of superintendents, teachers, principals, and assessment experts.
Under the budget language, a report with cost options and recommendations is due to the House and Senate education and appropriations committees by Nov. 1.
Hashmi wrote that the education committees were told the RFP would be issued by Sept. 1, but that deadline was missed and monthly updates had not been submitted.  
Without a vendor and a project plan underway, she warned, the timeline for releasing an RFP next year “cannot be met.” 
“The absence of market analysis and cost estimates will force the 2026 General Assembly to appropriate funds for a new multi-year assessment contract without the benefit of informed estimates or competitive bids, risking either underfunding the program or committing tens of millions of dollars beyond what is necessary,” Hashmi wrote. “Inaction now jeopardizes both fiscal responsibility and the quality of assessments for our students. The stakes are significant.”
Matthews countered that because the budget did not allow the funds  to carry over from fiscal year 2025 to 2026, the agency needed approval before moving forward. She said there was not enough time to properly hire a consultant before June, when the governor approved VDOE’s expedited discretionary carryover request on Aug. 25.
Typically, the governor must approve leftover funding for the following year in the fall, Matthews said.
“To ensure compliance with procurement policies and procedures the department had to ensure that the carryover request was approved, and carryover funding was allotted prior to posting an RFP and approved funding/appropriation was available to support the awarding of a contract to an assessment consultant,” she wrote.
Matthews said VDOE is now finalizing the procurement process for the mandated assessment vendor and expects to issue the RFP no later than October 6.
She added that VDOE will resume providing monthly updates to lawmakers. The work group also has six meetings scheduled before the end of the year, two of them ahead of the Nov. 1 reporting deadline.
Hashmi received a response letter from Gullickson, which she is currently reviewing.

“This is a substantial undertaking by the commonwealth that will impact our school districts, educators, and students for years to come, and we have a condensed time frame to act,” Hashmi said in a statement to the Mercury. “It is time to get serious with the Request for Proposal (RFP) process, continue a transparent process with stakeholders, and ensure our students are well-positioned for success in 2026.”

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Construction of Revolution Wind has been allowed to resume by a court, at least for now. But federal funding for renewables remains uncertain, perhaps signaling more trouble ahead for large infrastructure projects. What is the path forward to ensure Rhode Island, and New England more broadly, stay on track with the energy transition despite federal backtracking?
An energy transition away from fossil fuels must prioritize policy mixes that invest heavily in distributed and local mechanisms for energy production, such as rooftop and community solar, and give the state greater influence in the decision-making process. A robust public finance plan is needed to distribute funding and incentivize adoption for households and local businesses, even as the costs of renewables have dramatically fallen.
The relative success of solar photovoltaic (PV) incentive policies in Connecticut and New York shows that households at all income levels have started adopting solar though gaps persist in low-income neighborhoods. Such programs make solar a reliable and affordable tool for decarbonizing energy production and a way to deliver significant savings for households.
Rhode Island had at least 65 large-scale solar PV projects with nearly 400 MW of capacity by late 2024, potentially generating enough electricity to match the annual consumption of 50,000 to 80,000 households, with additional projects continuing to come online. Among the newest is the Exeter Mail Solar Field, the largest of three facilities commissioned by a collaboration of the state’s public housing authorities to offset their costs and reduce their energy bills.
The Exeter Mail project, dedicated on Sept. 12, would fit the definition of community solar, which are shared solar farms that let multiple households access solar power even if they can’t install panels on their own property. Participants receive cheaper electricity, reducing their overall energy costs. These projects are particularly valuable because not all households have suitable rooftops or the means to cover upfront installation costs. 
But there were only seven other community solar projects as of 2024, with most located around Providence and Bristol. These projects show that there is enough appetite for such infrastructure projects in Rhode Island. For example, neighboring Connecticut has 69 large-scale projects but with a combined capacity of only 300 MW. Despite these positive trends, there is a clear gap between the benefits provided by renewables and large-scale adoption. 










A robust public finance plan is needed to distribute funding and incentivize adoption for households and local businesses, even as the costs of renewables have dramatically fallen.


A study from NREL highlighted that Rhode Island has an upper-bound technical electricity generation potential of more than 3 million MWh from rooftop solar, out of which 1.3 million MWh are in low and medium-income areas alone. That would cover a large portion of electricity consumption in the state. However, technical potential doesn’t fully translate into real capacity due to economic, political and social factors. To get close to even a fraction of this capacity, governments need to emphasize robust pre- and post-purchase incentive programs that make households willing to adopt.
Evidence from California, where a policy reducing payments for excess electricity was established in 2022, before being recently overturned, shows how quickly solar markets can collapse if policy signals change. Similarly, the cancellation of Revolution Wind created uncertainty, and the state must step up to provide stability. For solar, the federal Residential Clean Energy Credit, which has lowered the costs of systems by 30% is due to end early at the end of this year, leaving a gap in the incentive structure for this technology.
Despite this uncertainty, one thing is clear: renewable energy projects can reduce the cost for the end consumer by stabilizing electricity prices, making it a winning message for policymakers. This is especially the case in Rhode Island as electricity prices for residential consumers have increased 65% since 2010, with transmission costs making up a great deal of the bill. One of the most consequential behavioral modifiers for households is rising prices. Reports have linked high electricity costs to fossil fuel production, a hotly debated issue and a significant burden for many households. The volatility in the price of natural gas and Rhode Island’s heavy reliance on it to power the grid is a recipe for continued uncertainty in electricity markets.
Policymakers in the local government need to see local renewable projects as a way to ensure energy independence and accelerate investment in them in the short term. The focus needs to be on making it attractive for communities to adopt renewables. Solar, especially, has become an economical way of producing electricity and with increasing capacity comes the benefit of lowering emissions for a sector that accounts for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions.
After all, everybody loves cheap, guilt-free electricity.

ODH’s Services for Homeless Youth and Homeless Pregnant Youth Grant operates on a two-year cycle, with the previous cycle ending June 30. The department gave Kaleidoscope $227,247 ($113,623 per year) in fiscal years 2024 and 2025. 
“This grant has been a significant source of funding for our housing program since 2021,” Kaleidoscope said in a statement. “Notably, this information was received approximately 45 days past the start date of July 1st, and we are now left with a pending deficit and the need to quickly relocate 10 young people without resources.” 
ODH received 18 applications for funding for the 2025-26 cycle and had $2.2 million to be awarded, ODH spokesperson Ken Gordon said. 
“Kaleidoscope Youth Center’s application was scored, and based on its low score compared to other applicants, the center was not one of the 15 applicants that were awarded the limited amount of funds available in the current grant cycle,” he said in an email. 
Kaleidoscope scored 120 out of 205 points, according to Gordon. 
“The executive summary section includes information about the target audience for the project, but without local data, it makes it difficult to understand why this population was picked,” ODH wrote in an Aug. 19 letter to Kaleidoscope. “… Overall, this application was missing important key requirements throughout the narrative, making it difficult to understand how each deliverable would be carried out.”
Kaleidoscope is able to re-apply for the next grant cycle, which starts July 1, 2027. 
KYC housing program  
Kaleidoscope, which serves LGBTQ+ youth ages 12-24, started the housing program in 2019 and informed current participants in the program about the closure on Sept. 8, Kaleidoscope said in a statement. 
“Although we do not have a current date by which they will need to move, the soonest would be early to mid-November,” Kaleidoscope said in a statement. 
Kaleidoscope’s goal is to maintain the housing program through July 2026 when the final lease ends. 
“This would provide the resources and time to safely and humanely transition current participants while decreasing the threat of returning to homelessness,” according to the statement. “Our youth are scared, and so are we. It is not okay that they are facing the threat of returning to homelessness.” 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine used his veto power to nix a provision in the state’s two-year budget that would have prohibited giving funds to youth homeless shelters that house transgender youth, even if they also serve youth who are not transgender. 
Nearly a quarter of LGBTQ youth reported experiencing homelessness or housing instability at some point in their lives, according to a 2022 report by the Trevor Project. Those who experiences homelessness or housing instability were also two to four times more likely to report depression, anxiety and self-harm, along with considering or attempting suicide, the report found.
LGBTQ+ youth are 120% more likely to experience homelessness than non-LGBTQ youth, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — A transplant from Miami, Anallive Calle learned her way around Kansas City from behind the wheel of a big yellow school bus.
The tablet near the dash provides turn-by-turn directions to every stop and checks each kid on and off the bus throughout her route. It’s helped her navigate the narrow roads and one-ways that stretch through one of the city’s oldest neighborhoods.
And from her phone, she can check on the status of her own son and whether he made the bus each morning and afternoon.
“So it’s transparent all the way,” she said. “You know when your child is picked up and where they’re at every moment.”
Last school year, Kansas City Public Schools started a new transportation contract with Zum, a company that provides busing services for districts across the country.
With the new vendor, drivers welcomed updates like air conditioning and tinted windows that keep the new fleet comfortable. But they also were given a suite of new technology — a main driver of the 15,000-student urban school district’s decision to ink a $100 million, 5-year contract with Zum.
Aside from navigation, the buses are loaded with live cameras inside and out. Checking in at the tablet allows parents to track their kids and schools to get a headcount on that day’s breakfast and lunch. From the bus barn’s dispatch office, a large screen shows the location of each bus, its exact speed, whether it’s running on time — and even the driver’s rating from parents.
Derrick Gines, a Zum driver and safety trainer with 10 years of experience, said the technology built into today’s buses make drivers and students safer.
“Versus yesteryear, they were designed for freight — human freight,” he said. “But now, there’s so much safety wrapped around this thing.”
While the iconic yellow buses might look like those of yore, school systems big and small are increasingly investing in a new wave of on-board technology.
New software programs monitor engine components, alerting transportation departments to maintenance needs. Other tools create the most optimal routes, saving on fuel, staff and bus costs. Turn-by-turn navigation and student manifests help ensure that no driver is lost and no kid is left behind. And live video feeds can help with student behavior issues — even allowing a school principal to speak to students on the bus in real time, in some cases.
This newfangled technology is a stark contrast to the machinery and aesthetics of the yellow bus, which have remained largely unchanged for decades, said Ryan Gray, editor-in-chief of School Transportation News, which covers the industry.
“Even when you walk onto a school bus, it still looks the same,” he said. “But the inner workings have just completely changed. All of the advanced electronics in it — the wiring to make all of this technology work, whether it be the hardware or the software — it’s grown by leaps and bounds.”
More states guarantee students the right to school-day religious instruction off campus

Schools see some of these technologies as intuitive progress: Technology has reshaped many other facets of public education, while many bus drivers were stuck with paper maps and CB radios. But with the rise of new technology comes new risks, and some advocates are cautious about the security of all the data flowing through yellow buses.
A booming market of vendors and limited regulations on bus tech has given more responsibility to school IT and transportation departments. But Gray said most school districts are embracing these new tools — if they can afford them.
“It always comes down to money,” he said. “I think that if they think they have the money, they’re going to want to buy this stuff.
School systems and tech companies say these tools can improve student safety, create efficiencies and help alleviate the chronic shortage of bus drivers.
“It’s a huge recruiting tool,” said Jason Salmons, transportation director for Bentonville Schools in northwest Arkansas.
Bentonville contracts with Transportant, a Kansas-based company, to equip its buses with new camera and tracking technology. Salmons said the navigation and student tracking provide peace of mind to drivers, who can easily traverse new neighborhoods. The seven live cameras on each bus also provide security if an incident arises.
About 13,000 of the district’s 20,000 students ride buses across 135 daily routes. In addition to an upfront cost, he said the school system pays a subscription of about $90,000 per year.
The software tracks not only every bus, but also every student’s boarding and disembarkment, even taking photos of the kids. If something happens, law enforcement can see where a child was and what they were wearing at dropoff — providing a “priceless” service, Salmons said.
With real-time tracking — much like a rideshare customer would see on their screen — parents and students view buses as more reliable, he said. With more precise pickup times, students don’t wait outside in the cold as long and older kids can even get a few more minutes of sleep, Salmons said.
“High schoolers use the app as their bible,” he said.
Data privacy
Given the national driver shortage and parents’ focus on reliability, Cassie Creswell understands the appeal of the new bus technology. But she has concerns about the growing loads of data being collected.
“It’s a mixed bag on this stuff,” said Creswell, the co-chair of the national Parent Coalition for Student Privacy, which advocates to protect student data.
That group has pushed to keep cameras out of classrooms, but hasn’t taken a formal position on school buses, she said. Creswell, a parent of a Chicago Public Schools student, said the more data that is collected — such as GPS locations and video footage — the more opportunities for that data to be sold or illicitly breached.
“Are we actually clearing away stuff that you really shouldn’t hold on to forever?” she asked. “We’re so careless with student data — even very sensitive data — and we’re very careless about the long-term protection of that data.”
More than half the states have issued AI guidance for schools

School systems interviewed by Stateline said their bus data is being securely stored separately from other student records and that data such as videos are routinely deleted.
Alan Fairless, a founder and chief technology officer of the tech provider Transportant, previously worked in building encrypted tech products.
He said the company doesn’t sell any student data and encrypts the memory of each device — so, someone stealing a tablet off a bus would have no access to its memory. The company was created in 2018 to tackle parent and school concerns about bus reliability and delays.
Fairless said he quickly learned many districts struggle with high driver turnover because of student behavior issues on board.
By providing multiple cameras that can be accessed live, he said, the company’s product provides a new layer of support to drivers.
“Now, when something happens, they push a button and a dispatcher or principal is going to watch that bus in real time,” he said.
Fairless said one school district has what it calls a seven-minute rule: When a driver alerts of an incident, a dispatcher aims to watch the video, figure out what happened and notify parents over text or phone call within seven minutes.
“The effect is, that video arrives to the parents, and now they know the real problem, and they know that before the student comes home and creates some other version of the story,” he said. “So now, it’s like the parents and the school district are working together to solve the problem.”

Since launching, the company has contracted with 88 school systems in 19 states to provide its all-inclusive tech suite that includes the app for families, on-board Wi-Fi, camera systems and routing services.
While prices can vary, school districts typically pay about $3,600 per bus up front and an annual subscription cost of about $69 per bus, said Jeff Shackelford, vice president of sales.
Changing parent demands
The addition of Transportant has helped keep parents informed in Oregon’s Estacada School District, which sprawls across 750 square miles southeast of Portland.
“It’s been great customer service for our families to just see, just like when someone orders an Uber, they can keep track of where their kid is at,” said Maggie Kelly, a spokesperson for the school system of about 2,000 students.
Kelly said the district expects to make up some of its initial investment in the technology as it realizes savings from more efficient bus routes.
Parents are demanding more real-time information on bus times and locations, said Rick D’Errico, a spokesperson for Transfinder, whose products build more efficient bus routes and provide tracking apps for parents.
“If I can track a burrito order, why can’t I track a bus?” D’Errico said. “Parents these days expect their districts to have ways to notify them on individualized ETAs and alerts for when their kid is on their routes, and not rely on schoolwide email blasts.”
Recently, school districts in Alaska, Texas and Wyoming have launched the company’s apps, which are free for parents.
Such services can provide savings by cutting back on the number of drivers and buses in operation. But they also relieve pressure on dispatchers, who can be besieged with parent phone calls during disruptions or delays.
Since rolling out a new bus tracking app this year, the St. Johns County School District in northeast Florida has fielded far fewer parent calls.
That app is just the latest addition to a portfolio of advanced onboard technology, said Jonah Paxton, transportation fleet technology foreman at the district, which serves about 27,000 bus riders.
The 52,000-student school system intentionally purchased separate products for bus cameras, parent tracking and driver navigation. Paxton said that allows the school system to avoid getting stuck with a single provider that could demand higher prices in the future.
“We’re not locked into a single sort of a walled-garden of products, which gives us a lot more freedom to pick and choose which products we like, which ones we don’t like, and gives us a little more negotiating power,” he said.
To ensure security, the school system stores video files on its own servers rather than those of outside vendors, he said. The district has a specific video retention policy and it blurs out student faces if videos are ever requested under the state’s public records law.
Paxton said student and driver safety drives many of the tech decisions for the school’s fleet of more than 300 buses.
“Buses are vastly different than they were even five,10 years ago,” he said. “I think many people who haven’t ridden a bus in a while can think of the bus as sort of an unpleasant place, or kind of the Wild West of schooling, but they’ve really come a long way.”

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)In the greater Merrimack area, where toxic forever chemicals are concentrated throughout the soil and a long-term cleanup plan is yet to materialize, keeping the contamination local is the best many feel they can do for now. But how well that’s working isn’t clear and guidance is scarce, creating headaches for developers and concern for activists.
“Soil is a major concern,” said Rep. Rosemarie Rung, of Merrimack. “There are no clear and distinct regulations on how to manage soil that needs to be removed.”
The prevalence of toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals, also called PFAS, in the Merrimack region is tied to the now-shuttered Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services contends that the facility released PFAS into the atmosphere in the course of its operations; the factory opened under different ownership in 1986, ended operations in May 2024, and was demolished earlier this year. 
Airborne PFAS settle into soils, from where the chemicals seep into water bodies and groundwater. In 2016, water testing revealed hundreds of contaminated wells in multiple towns. PFAS are extremely slow to break down in the environment and have been tied to myriad health concerns, including elevated incidences of certain cancers and other illnesses.
Saint-Gobain has paid for some short- and long-term drinking water solutions, including providing bottled water to some households, connecting others to public water, and filtering some public wells affected by the contaminants. 
When it comes to longer-term questions about how the soil contamination will be managed or cleaned up, however, the company, residents, and NHDES have struggled to reach an agreement, and New Hampshire has not yet settled on a remediation plan outlining Saint-Gobain’s cleanup responsibilities.
For soil contamination tied to Saint-Gobain emissions, NHDES considers the company responsible for any remediation that must occur, Waste Management Division Director Michael Wimsatt said. 
Saint-Gobain initially suggested “natural attenuation and institutional controls” as a management strategy for the contaminated area into the future, and the company continues to believe that strategy — involving monitoring levels over time as the chemicals dissipate into the environment — is an “appropriate remedy,” said company spokesperson Suzanne Loranc. 
However, NHDES disagreed and has sent a letter to the company requesting that Saint-Gobain investigate the soils in the area to understand more about the extent and nature of the contamination, spokesperson James Martin said in an email. The findings will inform longer-term action plans for both the Saint-Gobain site and broader area, Wimsatt said.
Loranc said Saint-Gobain anticipated conducting the preliminary investigation this fall. 
This will be followed by an initial report, then a next draft of an action plan, though this process could take months, Wimsatt said at the commission meeting.
Containment
In the meantime, life goes on in the Merrimack area — with added considerations for the proper care and containment of contaminated soil.
NHDES calls for PFAS-contaminated soil to be “managed appropriately to ensure it is conducted in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment,” Martin said.
That doesn’t explicitly mean that the soil cannot be removed from the area, Martin said. But there are limited options for what safe management of PFAS-contaminated soils could actually look like beyond containment, said Rep. Wendy Thomas, of Merrimack.
This is due, in part, to the sheer size of the area believed to be affected by PFAS pollution from Saint-Gobain.
“The Saint-Gobain site is a tremendously unique site,” Wimsatt said, larger than the other PFAS-contaminated sites NHDES encounters — meaning that traditional management guidance is not necessarily applicable. “The problem is that there are millions of cubic yards of soil. … It’s just not feasible, either technically or practically or economically, in any way feasible, to think that we’re going to pick up all those soils and bring them to a landfill somewhere, right?”
PFAS-contaminated soil can’t be placed just anywhere, and the dedicated hazardous waste landfills where it can be placed can also be costly. Other routes, like burning or heat-treating soil, are similarly difficult to implement, Thomas said. For now, strategies for managing soils center on keeping them in place — though, as Wimsatt noted, this strategy does not address the risk to groundwater from contaminated soils.
Unexpected costs
A common circumstance that might call for relocating significant volumes of soil is construction — and development is still progressing in Merrimack, where Saint-Gobain’s legacy “hasn’t really scared anybody away,” according to community development director Robert Price. But it has created the need for additional considerations, and sometimes costs, that not everybody expects, he said. 
“Developers, they’ve obviously heard of the Saint-Gobain contamination issue and all of that, but they aren’t necessarily aware fully of how it affects them,” Price said. “… So they realize later in the process, like, oh, by the way, you’re not allowed to remove soil from the property. And so they have to figure out, OK – what do we do with all this now?”
The town faces the same challenges.
Initial plans for a bridge construction project called for the town to relocate about 9,000 cubic yards of soil, Merrimack Town Manager Paul Micali said. But taking that soil to a dedicated facility is expensive, and it was unclear whether Saint-Gobain or any other entity would help pay for it.
“We are trying to come up with a plan to figure out what we can and cannot do with the soil,” Micali said Sept. 22. He’s concerned, he said, that the uncertainty will delay the project, which the town had hoped to put out to bid in the fall. 
Ultimately, according to Martin, plans were updated to keep all the soil contained on site, using the excess to construct berms and slopes. This path is similar to that taken by other developers who have struggled to determine what to do with their excess soil, Price said. Not all have found a path forward — leading to piles of dirt popping up from time to time along Daniel Webster Highway.
“There are a lot of projects up and down (Daniel Webster) highway that are affected by it,” Micali said. “All these projects are being affected … They can’t remove the contaminated soil.”
Unclear scope
Another challenge is establishing a border around the affected area. A commonly referenced zone is the boundary laid out in a 2018 consent decree between NHDES and Saint-Gobain, which includes portions of Bedford, Hudson, Litchfield, Londonderry, Manchester, and Merrimack. But the zone is a legal boundary and does not fully encompass the extent of pollution from Saint-Gobain, Martin said. 
Contaminated water supplies and illnesses associated with PFAS exposure have been found outside the boundaries of the agreement, Thomas said. And because PFAS leach into groundwater through the soil, activists such as Laurene Allen of Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water have said they find inaction, and the attenuation strategy proposed by Saint-Gobain, unacceptable.
“The contamination levels have not dropped over the years of site data and are not expected to drop as these are chemicals that will only decrease if the site is remediated,” Allen said. Citing the water filtration some residents were undertaking at their own expense, air quality concerns, and danger to those working in the area, she added that she felt the site should have been designated a federal CERCLA, or superfund, site, to put the authority to push for a remedy onto the federal government.
“DES lacks the authority to order action. The solutions are there for soil removal and management as well as groundwater remediation but it seems (New Hampshire) does not have the will to set a state policy of polluter accountability,” she said. “This site continues to add to our aquifer contamination that we are filtering at our own expense. … It’s a long overdue issue of environmental justice and we are paying for what we did not cause with not only remediation but also with (our) health.”
Wimsatt said NHDES believed holding Saint-Gobain directly responsible for cleanup was a more efficient way to proceed than going through Superfund. 
“What we always do is we look for a responsible party that has both the wherewithal and the willingness to do the work they need to do, and in virtually any case, we see that as a much more efficient way to get people protected than going through the Superfund process,” he said, pointing to Saint-Gobain’s work to remedy residents’ drinking water as an example of forward progress.
However, some advocates said they weren’t yet satisfied. 
“We’ve had to assume so much cost, headache, personal loss because of the actions of Saint-Gobain,” Rung said. “… We need to tighten up the regulations and the responsibility.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/saintgobain-soil-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 05:56:26.837228

(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)The monitor that had been tracking Mearl Hodge’s heartbeat started to show an abnormal rhythm. A technician at Glenwood Regional Medical Center alerted nurses that the electrodes that should have been affixed to Hodge’s chest seemed to have popped loose. No one checked. It was a granddaughter, arriving for a visit 20 minutes later, who discovered that her grandmother no longer had a pulse.
The circumstance of Hodge’s death in northeast Louisiana is among more than 650 documented instances of deficient care at nearly three dozen hospitals across eight states that were owned by Steward Health Care before the entire system collapsed last year in a spectacular bankruptcy. Hodge’s death, four days after she was admitted to Glenwood with COVID-19 in the winter of 2022, triggered an inquiry by the Louisiana Department of Health. Beyond the unattached heart monitor leads and the granddaughter’s discovery, state records from the investigation show the mask helping Hodge, 90, to breathe was sitting useless on her stomach. And though her medical chart made clear she wanted to be resuscitated in any emergency, the staff hadn’t tried, the records indicate.
For these mistakes, other state documents show, the health department fined Glenwood $1,750. What is uncommon about the case is that the hospital was fined at all. The scarcity of sanctions when some Steward facilities made even grave errors is part of a pattern in government regulation of America’s hospitals. Steward Health Care’s collapse has attracted considerable attention, largely depicted as an object lesson in the perils of for-profit hospital owners financed by private equity. However, a close examination of the Steward system points to a less obvious culprit: Across the country, oversight of hospitals by states and the federal government is inadequate – at times weakly enforced, at times absent.
This portrait of the feeble regulation of a troubled health system emerges from a new data analysis of Steward’s hospitals by the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The multi-prong analysis reveals substantial flaws in how states and the federal government oversee hospitals. 
On the one hand, main ways that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) require U.S. hospitals to publicly report on their finances and their quality failed to point to Steward’s deepening fragility. 
On the other hand, information that regulators do not routinely track make clear that the company’s hospitals were increasingly in trouble. One is a roster of nearly 130 lawsuits that mounted as the bankruptcy neared, because vendors – from suppliers of medical devices to air-conditioning – went to court, alleging Steward neglected to pay its bills. The other is a growing pile of hospital deficiencies – flaws, including in Mearl Hodge’s care, of varying severity that states examined in response to complaints.
This combination – public data that didn’t show the problems, revealing trends that regulators didn’t watch – does not suggest that many hospitals across the nation are poised to fail. Evidence of whether for-profit hospitals have lower quality is mixed, though a small body of research into the more than 450 with private-equity financing indicates they tend to be more problem-prone. Still, the lax regulatory climate means that state and federal early warning systems for troubled hospitals are largely absent.
“We need to build some sentinels…to catch things before a crash happens,” said Jonathan Blum, who held senior roles at CMS during the Biden and Obama administrations. 
In the meantime, certain hospitals and communities that rely on them can be vulnerable, especially as looming cuts to Medicaid and other federal health funds are widely predicted to erode the financial underpinnings of rural and other already-strapped hospitals. Some may hunt for new, deep-pocketed owners. “Unless states dramatically increase their oversight, I would certainly expect more Stewards to happen,” said Erin Fuse Brown, a health law and policy specialist at the Brown University School of Public Health.
Prospect Medical Holdings, another private equity-affiliated system with 16 hospitals in four states, including Rhode Island, declared bankruptcy in January. “I do not think it will be the last,” Fuse Brown said.
Steward’s rise and fall 
Massachusetts, a hub of academic medical centers, had never been home to a for-profit hospital backed by private equity – an arrangement that was gaining traction in U.S. health care in which investors look for large, often-quick profits outside the stock market. But a local Roman Catholic health system called Caritas Christi was faltering after a priest sex-abuse scandal financially drained the Archdiocese of Boston. Caritas began looking for a buyer, and Massachusetts officials joined the search. They were having little luck, especially finding one open to Caritas’s no-abortion policy and other Catholic values.

So, Massachusetts officials viewed it as good fortune when Ralph de la Torre, a prominent cardiac surgeon who recently had become Caritas’s chief executive, proposed what he said would be a new model of care. In 2010, the system affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, an established private equity firm. They pledged to solidify Caritas’s pension system, strengthen its half-dozen hospitals and, for the first five years, be monitored by Massachusetts’ attorney general. The system would be renamed Steward Health Care. The attorney general and a judge approved the deal.
Though the fledgling system made some hospital improvements, Steward didn’t always adhere to the deal’s terms and, under de la Torre’s leadership, was aggressive from the start, health officials and other hospital executives recall. In 2011, the fledgling system took over four more Massachusetts hospitals and another in 2012. But Steward’s big growth spurt started in 2016, just after the monitoring ended, when it affiliated with Medical Properties Trust (MPT), a major real estate investment trust which is a type of company that pools money from many investors to buy and own income-producing real property. MPT bought all of the hospitals’ buildings and land in a “sale-leaseback,” offering cash in exchange for escalating rents. Steward, together with MPT and Cerberus, went on a buying spree. Less than a year later, it owned 36 hospitals in 10 states.
In none of the states into which Steward spread did regulators have a role reviewing the purchases, according to the Brookings analysis of health care “transaction” laws compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. In some of the states, such as Arizona, an attorney general reviews only sales of non-profit hospitals; Steward grew almost entirely by acquiring hospitals that already were for-profit. Other states, such as Florida, review sales of nursing homes, but not hospitals. Still others, such as Texas, do not oversee any health facility sales.
Financial troubles, staff and supply shortages and de la Torre’s spending on luxuries, including a $30 million yacht, eventually spilled into view. Steward sold seven hospitals in Ohio, Colorado and Utah. In January of last year, the Boston Globe broke the story of a 39-year-old woman who died of profuse bleeding from her liver the day after giving birth at Steward’s St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Boston; an unpaid vendor had repossessed common metal coils that doctors use to stem internal bleeding. In a statement to the Globe, Steward said it did its best to keep needed supplies on hand and noted that its surgical care had been “consistently recognized among the best in the nation and state by the likes of highly credible ratings organizations.”
Weeks after the Globe story, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said she wanted Steward, which had long balked at reporting financial information required there, to leave the state.
Less than three months later, in May, the whole Steward system filed for bankruptcy in Texas, where the company headquarters had moved several years before.  This summer, the remnants of Steward sued de la Torre, who resigned last fall, and three others, accusing them of “greed and bad faith misconduct” that had sunk the company. A spokeswoman for de la Torre, Rebecca Kral, said he “will vigorously defend himself” against the lawsuit. Lawyers for the former CEO have not yet filed a response to the suit in court. 
Attorneys for the Steward bankruptcy did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The bankruptcy set off a scramble for new owners of Steward’s by-then 31 hospitals. Amid protests, two in Massachusetts closed outright. Most of the company’s hospitals, including Glenwood and the others mentioned in this story, have new owners.
 The limits of government data 

Even as Steward’s layered troubles became more evident, main types of public data that federal health officials collect from hospitals – about their finances and their quality – didn’t reveal them.
Every hospital that treats patients on Medicare must give CMS an annual “cost report” containing assorted financial information. Brookings analyzed these reports, looking at operating profit margins and three other common financial indicators, comparing Steward hospitals against U.S. hospitals overall. Over the years, the analysis found, Steward’s hospitals looked similar on average to all U.S. hospitals through 2022, the most recent data available. However, audited financial statements for the whole Steward system, available in separate public records, show the company struggling from early on, the analysis found.
The discrepancies reflect that Steward shifted many expenses to the central office – a common practice among health systems that Steward took to an extreme, according to Steward and other health care experts. As a result, “It’s not a valid data set for analyzing the financial condition of the hospitals,” said Nancy Kane, a retired professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.










There’s no one state body or federal body that is sitting there and saying, ‘Things are going off the rails at this hospital.’


– Erin Fuse Brown, professor, Brown University School Public Health


A report last year by KFF, a health information nonprofit, on gaps in hospital financial information noted that the data submitted in cost reports for individual hospitals is not standardized or rigorously scrutinized – and doesn’t reflect the financial condition of their parent health systems. Kane said CMS uses the cost reports to help ensure that Medicare is paying hospitals correctly, not to monitor their financial health.
Meanwhile, of the 10 states where Steward operated, seven require hospitals to report at least some financial data and make it publicly available, according to a canvas of state transparency laws. But just three – Colorado, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania – say they currently analyze the data for hospitals’ expenditures or financial condition.
The Brookings analysis, focused on information reported to CMS about the Steward hospitals’ quality of care, found that, like the financial data, these quality measures failed to reveal the actual trouble occurring at many of the facilities. Looking at CMS’s Hospital Care Compare data, their average was little different than hospitals nationally on seven quality indicators, including serious complications, patients’ length of time in emergency rooms, and readmissions.
Asked for a response to the findings, a CMS spokesman, Alexx Pons, said “The agency does not comment on external analysis.”
In January, days before the Biden administration ended, federal officials issued a report on health industry consolidation, including hospitals such as Steward’s with private equity backing. The report by the departments of Health and Human Services and Justice and the Federal Trade Commission said the agencies had repeatedly heard complaints that “HHS should do more to improve the quality of the data” it collects about health facilities’ owners, prices, staff levels and patient care.
Steward’s collapse has helped prompt a few states to increase oversight of health-care transactions, though most merely require notification to a state, not giving power to approve or reject a hospital sale. In January, Massachusetts passed a health care law that does not prevent private-equity firms from affiliating with health care companies but says hospitals may not be licensed if their main campus begins an affiliation with a real-estate investment trust, as Steward did. Still, Fuse Brown, the health law and policy professor, said, “There’s no one state body or federal body that is sitting there and saying, ‘Things are going off the rails at this hospital.’”
A reason for the scant oversight is that “the points of leverage are health law, and health law is very narrow,” said Rosemary Batt, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, who has studied private equity in health care, including Steward. “There’s no law that says [hospitals] need to maintain their infrastructure,” Batt said. “There’s no law that says you can’t sell your land.”
Even as two important types of federal data – on hospitals’ finances and quality – didn’t warn of Steward’s troubles, other loud hints could have revealed the escalating crisis.
One of those hints, unwatched by regulators, lies in a soaring number of lawsuits by vendors, alleging that Steward and its individual hospitals hadn’t paid bills for services, according to Brookings’ analysis, based on records in bankruptcy court and elsewhere. The cases add up to $139 million in allegedly unpaid bills. One small company, Eklund Refrigeration, sued Steward for $32,640 in March 2023, contending it had sent 37 invoices for air-conditioning service to two Arizona hospitals since it had last been paid in 2021. Seventeen months after the suit’s filing, Arizona health officials shut down one, a Phoenix psychiatric hospital, when the broken air conditioning caused the temperature inside to reach 99 degrees in the August heat.

In a number of the lawsuits, vendors were notified of the bankruptcy before their cases advanced. However, in one case, a lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts in February 2024 by OsteoRemedies, which provides medical supplies to support orthopedic surgery, alleging that Steward owed it about $176,500 for services provided in several of its hospitals in five states. In a court filing the following month, Steward lawyers denied every allegation and asked that the case be dismissed.
Instances of deficient care also were becoming more frequent. These are verified by state health department surveyors, who work on behalf of CMS to investigate complaints from patients, families or employees. Altogether, hospitals owned by Steward had nearly 680 deficiencies, federal and state records show. They climbed from 13 in 2020 to 108 last year, about 3 ½ times as many deficiencies per hospital, on average, as in U.S. hospitals overall the year before. Federal health officials define three deficiency levels. The worst, “immediate jeopardy,” is a problem that caused death or easily could have.

CMS is not empowered to fine hospitals for deficiencies – only to ban them from Medicare and Medicaid. Such a ban would be draconian and rarely happens because depriving a hospital of revenue from the two huge public insurance programs would threaten its existence. More typically, federal health officials or state regulators warn hospitals that they face being dropped from the programs unless they correct deficiencies – and then accept the hospitals’ correction plans.
Of the five states, besides Louisiana, that marked any deficiencies in the worst category, Massachusetts has no system of hospital financial penalties. According to the Pennsylvania and Utah health departments, they prefer to nudge hospitals to improve and issued no fines in these cases, including a 2023 incident at a Salt Lake City hospital in which a patient who objected to her discharge died just afterwards at a frigid bus stop.
The Texas Health and Human Services Commission issued a fine, totaling $7,200, for just one of 21 “immediate jeopardy” deficiencies involving Steward hospitals, records show, after finding a malfunctioning emergency room call system, dirt and debris on food carts and other spots, and leaks through ceiling tiles. After listing these and other flaws, however, the state’s May 2024 notice told the hospital the fine “was not a demand for payment,” if it was in bankruptcy. By then, Steward was.
Trouble at Glenwood 
Glenwood, the company’s only Louisiana hospital, racked up 47 deficiencies after Steward bought it in 2017, including four designated “immediate jeopardy.” Patients had started avoiding the hospital, according to local officials and former employees. Unpaid bills prompted vendors to cut off supplies needed to insert pacemakers and perform endoscopies, state records show. A vendor cut off the coffee supply.
Louisiana law allows penalties against hospitals that violate standards. In the months before the bankruptcy, state records show, the health department levied two fines, for $5,000 and $7,000, and said Glenwood would be banned from Medicare if conditions didn’t improve. 
Mearl Hodge’s death came before those fines. Called Meme by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, her obituary would say, Hodge was born and lived her life in Farmerville, a town of about 30 miles northwest of Glenwood with a summertime watermelon festival. She loved to cook chicken and dressing and to share afternoon coffees with her friends and family, including her husband of 76 years. She prayed for her family daily.
As a one-time “class A” violation resulting in death or serious harm, and an “immediate jeopardy” deficiency, state law permitted up to a $2,500 penalty after Hodge’s death.
On May 31, 2022, the state health department fined Glenwood $1,750. Three months later, the department dispatched a second notice. The check Steward sent, the notice said, had bounced.

Even as the number of youths who identify as LGBTQ rises, so has the number of state-level bills seeking to curtail their rights, a new analysis finds.
The number of bills aimed at rolling back or prohibiting in-school protections and health care access has tripled from 77 in 2020 to some 300 a year in 2023, 2024 and 2025, according to the Movement Advancement Project.
The drumbeat of legislation, report the researchers, has taken a steep toll on the mental health of the students in the crosshairs — regardless of where they live. When the dramatic escalation in legislation started in 2023, 90% of LGBTQ people ages 13 to 24 said politics had a negative impact on their well-being — up from 71% in 2022.
Policies enabling in-school support are particularly important to LGBTQ youth. Slightly more than half say they are accepted by peers or teachers at school, compared with 40% who are supported at home. The presence of even one supportive educator in a child’s life has long been shown to reduce rates of suicidality, anxiety and depression.
The number of young people impacted has risen sharply in recent years, though estimates vary depending on how data is tabulated. According to a recent Gallup survey, almost 2 million — or 9.5% — of teens ages 13 to 17 now identify as something other than straight or cisgender. That’s nearly twice as many as in 2020.
The project tracks state LGBTQ and elections policies using interactive maps featuring detailed information that is continually updated. For the new report, researchers tallied the number of states that enacted one or more of 16 types of laws commonly proposed in statehouses since 2020 — nine restrictive and seven protective — throughout the country.
They then combined that information with demographic data and surveys of LGBTQ young people’s well-being from a number of advocacy organizations. The top takeaway: Whether a student attends a school where teachers are able to talk about LGBTQ history, enforce anti-harassment rules, maintain confidences about a child’s identity and allow gender-nonconforming youth to play sports depends on where they live.
Nearly half of queer youth live in one of 27 states that have enacted one or more restrictions on their rights, ranging from bathroom bans to laws prohibiting schools from enacting anti-bullying policies. Thirty-eight percent live in the South, 24% in the West, 21% in the Midwest and 17% in the Northeast.
Of the nine negative state laws the researchers looked at, seven involve schools. The other two are bans on medical care for transgender youth and laws exempting providers of child welfare services, such as foster care, from nondiscrimination rules on religious grounds.



Tennessee has adopted eight, Arkansas, Montana and Idaho enacted seven each, and six other states imposed six or more new restrictions. Three-fourths of Southern states and two-thirds of the Midwest ban trans youth sports participation and medical care, while a third or fewer do in the West and Northeast.
While several states have adopted new, protective laws since 2020, MAP estimates that 6 in 10 LGBTQ youth live in places where there is no legal guarantee of support.
In 2023, 2 in 5 LGBTQ young people and their families said they had considered moving because of politics in their home state. Just 4% actually had — but if that rate is an accurate reflection of all affected families, at least 266,000 people have likely relocated, the researchers estimate.

Survey: More Than Half of LGBTQ Florida Parents Are Thinking About Moving

 




According to a survey released earlier this year by The Trevor Project, 25% of cisgender queer youth and their families and 45% of trans families have considered moving to a state with more protective laws. Seven in 10 families with a transgender member living in states with restrictive laws have thought about relocating, while 12% have crossed state lines for medical care.
Along with its state policy tally, the project released a second paper summarizing information gathered by half a dozen LGBTQ advocacy groups about the impact the recent political climate has had on queer young people. The data echoes the 2023 findings of a 74 investigation that found harassment, victimization and discrimination have spiked in blue states as well as red.



Recent surveys by The Trevor Project and GLSEN, which advocate for protective school policies, found there is no state where fewer than 93% of LGBTQ students reported hearing slurs in school in 2023. Nationwide, 83% were harassed, 54% were sexually harassed and more than 12% assaulted.
Research has long established that a hostile school climate translates to absenteeism, lower grade-point averages and graduation rates, and dramatically higher discipline rates, depression and stress — all of which can impact a student’s life trajectory.

Data Show LGBTQ Students Report Bullying and Attacks from Kids — and Teachers

 




The number of young people impacted has swelled, a change the report attributes in part to generational shifts. While 3% of Baby Boomers and 5% of Gen X identify as LGBTQ, a 2025 Gallup survey found the rate is 14% among Millennials and 23% for Gen Z.
Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the number of high school students ages 13 to 17 who identify as LGBTQ rose from 11% in 2015 to 26% in 2023.
Some of the sharp increase can be attributed to changes in how data is collected and categorized; to people realizing at younger ages they are not straight or cisgender; and to internet access to queer communities. But much of the rise can be attributed to the number of young people who identify as bisexual and/or nonbinary.
The number of transgender people of all ages, for example, has hovered around half a percent for the last decade, according to the University of California, Los Angeles’ Williams Institute. Meanwhile, Gallup found 59% of LGBTQ people in Gen Z, defined as those born between 1997 and 2006, are bisexual, and 76% of nonbinary adults are under age 29.

(Getty Images)As psychiatrists, we care daily for Granite Staters living with mental illness, addiction, developmental disorders, cognitive disorders, and the complicated medical conditions that often accompany them. We see firsthand how the decisions, or indecisions, of our public health leadership at the national level shape the lives of our patients and families. That is why we are deeply concerned about threats to clear, science-based information resulting from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other public health leaders. 
Medication safety and misinformation
Depression and other mental illnesses are some of the most disabling conditions in the United States. Safe, effective medications, in addition to psychological and social treatments, are a cornerstone of psychiatric care. Yet recently, the public conversation has too often been dominated by misinformation rather than rigorous science, sowing doubt into the safety and effectiveness of well-established mental health treatments. Psychiatric medications save lives, and have overwhelming evidence to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness when prescribed responsibly by trained medical professionals. Without steady, transparent, and evidence-based guidance from public health leaders at all levels, both patients and providers are left vulnerable to confusion, hesitation, and harm.
 Vaccines, autism, and public trust

The persistence of myths linking vaccines to autism is particularly troubling. The evidence is clear: Vaccines save lives and do not cause autism. Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition, and equating it with vaccine injury perpetuates stigma while undermining public health. Rates of autism diagnosis are increasing largely due to a wider recognition of the symptoms of autism, growing prevalence of screening programs in pediatric health care and schools, and a wider availability of early intervention programs that demonstrate efficacy in improving overall functioning and quality of life for people living with autism. When national institutions fail to forcefully counter this misinformation and provide clear guidance, vaccine hesitancy grows, preventable illnesses return, and vulnerable populations suffer. 
Threats to Medicaid and Medicare
For many New Hampshire residents, Medicaid and Medicare are lifelines. These programs ensure access to lifesaving health care, medications, and long-term supports. Unfortunately, these programs face continual threats, from budget cuts, eligibility restrictions, and political battles that treat health care as a bargaining chip. Patients with psychiatric illness, many of whom already navigate stigma and barriers to care, cannot afford further uncertainty as to whether they’ll continue receiving these benefits.
A call for responsible leadership
Granite Staters, and all Americans, deserve leadership at all levels, including the DHHS, that centers science, transparency, and the health of its people. That means issuing clear, evidence-based public guidance on medications, vaccines, autism, and the benefits of Medicaid and Medicare. It means actively combating misinformation. It means vigorously defending the integrity of Medicaid and Medicare as essential programs for our most vulnerable citizens. Recent misinformation, including attacks on the safety of vaccines and psychiatric medications, is eroding the public’s trust in and access to safe and effective health care. 
In the current environment, we urge providers and patients to seek guidance from authoritative and trusted sources that remain committed to an evidence-based and transparent approach to health care. Examples of trusted sources free from ideological biases include national professional societies including the American College of Physicians, the American Association of Pediatrics, the American College and Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Psychiatric Association. Similarly, state level public health experts are in the early stages of collaborating to provide evidence-based guidelines regarding public health and vaccines. Examples include the West Coast Health Alliance and the Northeast Public Health Collaborative.  
As psychiatrists, we will continue to advocate for our patients in clinics, hospitals, schools, nursing homes, and communities across the state and nationally. But we cannot do it alone and we call upon DHHS leadership, the policymakers who oversee it, and professional societies nationwide to fulfill their responsibility not only to Granite Staters but all Americans: to lead with science, to protect the vulnerable, and to safeguard the future health of us all.

Courtesy photo.An Ohio lawmaker wants judges to consider a defendant’s immigration status when they set conditions for bail or hand down criminal sentences.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Township, characterized the changes as a way to give judges “a full picture” of the defendant before them.
But critics argue the proposal might violate the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause or encroach on the federal authority over immigration enforcement.
More generally, they worry the measure targets immigrants — whether here legally or not — at a moment of rising fear and distrust of justice system. People with a target on their back, they argue, aren’t likely to report crimes or testify in court.
What the bill does
When it comes to setting bail, the central question a judge must consider is whether the defendant show up for their court date.
But state law carries a laundry list of other considerations judges should weigh when determining bail, parole or sentences. Did the defendant serve in the military? Did they exhibit remorse?  Do they have ties to the community? In 2022, state lawmakers even went to the ballot to explicitly direct judges to weigh whether a defendant is a threat to public safety when setting the amount of cash bail.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
House Bill 282 would add the defendant’s immigration status to that list. Williams thinks judges should be considering whether a defendant is in the country illegally or subject to a federal detainer when they’re setting conditions.
“It’s always a factor, one, in bail, whether or not an individual is going to return to court,” Williams said. “I think immigration status has a direct effect on that, whether or not an individual is going to be here to answer to justice or not at the conclusion of the case.”
When it comes to criminal sentences and parole, Williams contends, a defendant’s immigration status should be given the same weight as their criminal history.
“Just like probation and parole, if you are actively on those at the time that you commit an offense, and you are an American citizen, that goes against the idea of you being able to be rehabilitated, absent incarceration,” Williams said. “I think it also should be a factor that an individual is here unlawfully, already breaking the law in the state of Ohio and they commit another criminal offense.”
Committee questions
Williams’ proposal got pushback from Democratic committee members, including state Rep. Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus. He pressed Williams on the Supremacy Clause, which gives the federal government exclusive authority to enforce federal laws. Mohamed noted several states have passed laws wading into immigration enforcement and it hasn’t gone well.
“There’s about five to seven different bills that were passed in other states that were all struck down,” Mohamed said.
Williams insisted those other measures gave local authorities policing powers or made federal violations state crimes as well.
“There’s no federal statute, there’s no constitutional revision that prevents an individual from, especially a judge from considering immigration status as it comes to bond conditions or sentencing,” Williams said.
Mohamed asked about the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, which applies to “any person” within a state’s jurisdiction.
“It doesn’t make any distinction with U.S. citizens, green card holders, noncitizens,” he said. “So essentially, if this will directly lead to judges that are imposing harsher sentences, how do you reconcile that with the 14th Amendment.”
Williams didn’t deny the provision would subject immigrants to greater scrutiny.
“I think it’s reasonable that individuals that are here, legally or illegally, are held to a high standard, just like individuals that are facing parole, probation or bond conditions in another case,” he said.
Instead, Williams contends treating immigrants differently isn’t an issue because immigration status is not a suspect category under the 14th Amendment. He pointed to analysis by state legislative researchers which draws a distinction between immigration status and the race, ethnic background, gender or religion protections found in state law.
Researchers point to an Ohio case where the appeals court upheld a lower court considering a defendant’s immigration status when imposing a felony sentence.
“Courts have done it before. It’s been upheld before,” he said. “I think it’s reasonable to use that classification, because it’s not a suspect classification that gets protection under the equal protections clause.”
But notably — and Williams acknowledged as much — judges already have the discretion to consider a defendant’s immigration status. State law includes a catch all “any other factors that are relevant” in its instructions to the bench.
To Williams, though, that flexibility is treacherous.
“I think it can lead to sentencing disparities where in one jurisdiction, an immigrant would have been seen — viewed more harshly, (and) in another jurisdiction, they will be seen, more lenient,” he said. “I think we need to have consistency across the state of Ohio.”

Ohio’s official regulator in 2023 allowed a huge increase in the fixed monthly charges Columbia Gas could collect from all residential customers. 
They all have to pay the same fees, no matter how rich or poor they are, and no matter the size or density of their dwellings. The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio accepted Columbia Gas’s claims that it needed the money for infrastructure improvements even though its parent company is turning nearly $800 million in annual profit and its CEO makes $33,000 a day. But next month the question of whether those increased charges are in the public interest is headed to the Ohio Supreme Court.
The cost of utilities — what you have to pay to light and heat your home — have been exploding in Ohio. 
Some of that is attributable to increased electricity demand from the AI boom. But the PUCO has also been criticized for being too quick to OK upcharges requested by electricity and natural gas providers. As of 2020, it had granted more than $1 billion in increased charges to utilities only for the Ohio Supreme Court to later declare them illegal. Even so, the utilities got to keep the money.
With 1.5 million customers, Columbia is the largest natural gas supplier in the state. Its service area includes Columbus and Cleveland.
In 2023, the PUCO allowed the utility to increase its fixed charges by 50% — to as much as $57 a month by 2027. As of July, that amount was $53 a month, according to a de-identified bill viewed by the Capital Journal.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXControversially, the charges are shouldered by all customers equally, whether you’re a millionaire living in an 8,000-square-foot mansion on a five-acre lot in New Albany, or if you’re a single mother in a 500-square-foot apartment in North Linden.
Karin Nordstrom of the Ohio Environmental Council said high, one-size-fits-all fixed charges also discourage conservation.
“High fixed charges are bad for consumers because they remove their ability to control their bill,” she said. “They can’t reduce how much they get charged every month by reducing usage. It removes an incentive to reduce usage and it puts more overall strain on the household budget.”
In their appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Citizens Utility Board of Ohio said the PUCO ruling is not in the public interest because it allows Columbia to get 70% of its revenue from fixed charges and just 30% from the gas it actually delivers.
“The result of such a significant imbalance between fixed and variable charges is that the potential savings for customers through either energy efficiency measures or otherwise reducing usage are minimized because only thirty cents on every dollar spent on bills correlates to the actual gas they use,” the appeal said.
It also cites “the manifest unfairness in charging customers over $50 per month before they use the first therm of gas” as a reason why the charges are not in the public interest. It adds that “a low-volume consumer in a 500 square-foot house does not drive system costs in the same way as a customer in a 5,000 square-foot home.”
For its part, Columbia Gas asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the appeal. It said it hadn’t raised fixed charges since 2008.
It also said energy efficiency doesn’t figure in determinations of whether a change in rate structure is in the public interest. 
“Similarly, this Court has heard, and rejected, arguments that Ohio’s energy policies require the (PUCO) to approve some arbitrary level of funding for energy efficiency programs that matches an appellant’s policy preferences,” Columbia Gas argued. 
And it quoted expert testimony in an earlier proceeding saying it was actually more fair to charge everyone the same amount in fixed charges for infrastructure, regardless of how much of a burden they placed on it.
The witness said “‘fixed charges promote fairness to all customers because the customer’s bill reflects the actual average cost of providing gas delivery service(,) rather than being based on the volume of gas consumed,’” the Columbia Gas filing said.
A spokeswoman for the company was asked whether Columbia would commit to spending all the additional revenue it collects from the increased charges on service to the people who paid it. She was also asked whether the company needed the money, given that parent company NiSource collected nearly $800 million in profit last year and paid CEO Lloyd Yates $12.8 million.
“Columbia Gas does not comment on ongoing litigation,” the spokeswoman replied.
Oral arguments in the case are set for Oct. 29.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)Growing up, Salem Carmicheal’s family lived paycheck to paycheck, so she never considered college an option. She had always been interested in early childhood education, but didn’t think she’d be able to pursue a degree until she discovered that through the state program she could attend Eastern Maine Community College for free.
“If I didn’t go to community college for free, I wouldn’t be able to afford to go to any college,” she said.
“For a while there, it kind of saved me as a person, because I was living in my car for a little bit, but I still didn’t have to worry about college being free.”
Carmichael is now preparing to graduate after completing internships in daycares and classrooms and working at the Bangor YMCA.
“Now that I’m in a better place, I’m actually thriving,” she said. “Free college is an amazing thing, I’ve been thoroughly impacted by it positively.”
Students throughout Maine have similar stories as Carmichael. Students who were not considering college as an option, or planned to work directly after school, or were considering taking on debt to attend a four-year university when they learned about Maine’s free community college program, according to several interviews and public testimony submitted by students to the Maine Legislature. 
Free college, flexibility help drive increased enrollment in Maine’s community colleges

Since its establishment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022, the scholarship has allowed all recent high school graduates to attend one of Maine’s seven community colleges for free, even if they don’t qualify for federal financial aid. The program has led to increased enrollment in community colleges and even contributed to an increase in transfer students attending the University of Maine System. 
But the future of that program, which is only guaranteed to include those who graduated high school in 2025, is uncertain.
Legislative ‘limbo’
When crafting the two-year budget earlier this year, the Maine Legislature was wrestling with a sizable deficit, which it made several cuts to address. Among those, the budget committee rejected Gov. Janet Mills’ proposed language to fund the free tuition program on an ongoing basis and codify it in statute, instead giving the Maine Community College System a reduced amount for the current biennium, which will help the system continue to offer free college to the high school graduating class of 2025. 
The community college system is concerned that means the scholarship is effectively over. But several members of the Legislature who have been supportive of the initiative have said they intend to continue prioritizing funding it for future years. 
The heads of the budget committee, Sen. Margaret Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) and Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), told the community college system in a July letter that the Legislature needs more information from the system to evaluate the impact of free community college. They asked for detailed cost estimates for the current and following budget cycles, including how much it costs to include nonresidents and students who didn’t graduate from a Maine high school. They also sought data on graduation rates, how many graduates stay in Maine, and potential economies of scale.
“The committee votes did not reflect a final decision on the value of the program so much as a desire for additional information and study of the relative costs and benefits of the program to the state and the participants,” Rotundo and Gattine wrote.
That information, which is due by mid-December, will be considered by either the education or budget committee as they weigh changes to the two-year budget in a change package next session, the chairs said.
Rep. Mike Brennan (D-Portland), who sits on both committees, said free community college “has been enormously successful and has been a big benefit to students in the state of Maine.” 
“There’s no intent to end the program, and there was never any intent during this last legislative session on either the education committee or the appropriations committee to discontinue the program,” he added.
A spokesperson for House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) also said the Legislature’s actions do not mean the program is ending, and that “the Speaker is committed to working with lawmakers to review the program with the goal of continuing to fund future graduating classes.”   
However, the lack of ongoing funding means the community college can’t promise free tuition to  graduates beyond the class of 2025, according to David Daigler, president of the Maine Community College System. The system sent out a press release at the end of the session saying the program had ended, which was widely reported throughout the state. But Daigler also said he’s continuing to work with lawmakers and is interested to see what they do next session.
“I think they understand that by not having an ongoing funding mechanism, and by not having language that says, ‘This is our intent,’ after the class of 2025, there really isn’t a free college program. But then they say, ‘We don’t want it to end,’” Daigler said.
“Right now, we’re sitting in limbo.”
Maine alone is walking back free college
Approximately 35 states have some version of free college, but Maine is currently the only state to walk back the initiative, according to two national researchers. 
Since 2014 when Tennessee became the first state in the country to offer free community college, many states have started their own programs, either focused on high school graduates, adult learners or both. 
In addition to Tennessee, California and  New Mexico have established a permanent funding mechanism for the program and don’t require annual legislative approval. But in most states, tuition-free community college programs are funded annually, or semi-annually by the legislature, “which definitely is a problem when you’re trying to create predictability,” according to Michelle Miller-Adams, a senior researcher at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a professor of political science at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.










In every study that I've seen, it takes time, but it pays for itself. It's just a matter of fronting the cost.


– Ryan Morgan, CEO of The Campaign for Free College Tuition


“We’ve seen states create and continue free college programs over the last four or five years. Maine seems to be the only state right now going in the opposite direction,” said Ryan Morgan, CEO of national non-profit The Campaign for Free College Tuition.
When states offer free college, it boosts the economy and helps create a more educated workforce which results in higher tax revenue for the state, studies from other free college programs have shown. 
While Maine’s program is too new to be studied, Morgan said, “It’s a no-brainer. A more educated workforce is going to have economic benefits, increase tax revenues, support businesses and also make a significant impact in the lives of the students.”
“In every study that I’ve seen, it takes time, but it pays for itself. It’s just a matter of fronting the cost,” Morgan said.
Since most other New England states have some version of a free college program, Maine also risks losing students to neighboring states if it does not continue its tuition-free community colleges, Morgan said.
Miller-Adams also emphasized that while many community college students would likely qualify for a Pell Grant or other state or federal scholarships, by simplifying the process it makes it more accessible to those who may not otherwise apply.
“It’s the message that gets delivered that says: ‘You might think college is unaffordable, but guess what? Tuition is going to be covered.’”
Free community college helped broaden options
Tom McNeil, a high school counselor at Winslow High School, also said he’s noticed more students and families opening up to the idea of college.
“Changing the discussion around college affordability, which is what I think free community college has done, has made it easier for people to decide to go to school,” McNeil said.“It’s less scary from a financial perspective, so the kids and their families are a little more ready to take a risk.”
The rate of Winslow High School students continuing their education has been relatively stable for the last eight years, he said, but more students took advantage of the tuition-free community colleges, in lieu of either attending a four-year school or just trying out a few classes.
It’s too soon to tell how the class of 2026 might be impacted if the program ends, but McNeil said his biggest fear “is that it lets an old, unhelpful narrative take hold, that college is not affordable or no longer worth it.”
“This initiative has been a great way to combat that.”

Current and former students vouch for free college
Sam Parker had no plans of going to college, and was working in carpentry when his brother sent him a link to the free college program website. 
Parker, who grew up in Newfield, decided to enroll in Southern Maine Community College’s automotive technology program. He now has a job working for a Subaru dealership, and said he’s on a career path because he was able to go to community college for free.
“It just gives people another option,” he said.
Similarly, South Portland native Abby Steinhagen took a gap year after graduating high school, unsure whether she would apply to a four-year institution. But upon hearing about tuition-free community college, she also decided to start at the automotive program and is working at Arundel Ford as she finishes her degree.
“It’s taken a lot of stress from having to pay student loans,” she said. “I already work two jobs, but I would not be able to work the jobs that I need to be able to finance something like this if it wasn’t free.”
The automotive technology program was originally set up by local dealerships who were in need of technicians, said Ruth Morrison, who runs the 90-student associate degree program. Because free college helped enrollment grow, there were 25 new technicians working at shops last summer, she said.
“There are so many specialized fields nowadays that you really need those extra two years of education to get a job that’s going to sustain you and in the economy,” she said.
Jordyn Balicki had committed to attending a four-year nursing program at Husson University when she learned about free community college, and ended up changing her mind last minute and enrolled atEastern Maine Community College.
“I would have been hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt at Husson, so this was huge stress relief,” she said. She added that being able to work as a Resident Assistant her second year to cover room and board costs while doing externships at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor “helped me actually make money while going to school.”
Balicki now works as a nurse, and appealed to the Maine Legislature this session to continue free college for future high school graduates. 
“It was something I definitely didn’t think I was going to do and now I urge everyone to go to a community college,” she said.
“Really, not offering free college from now on is only harming the workforce in Maine.”

Former Kansas poet laureate and Reflector contributor Huascar Medina has signed up for “Prairie Fool,” described by the press as “a lyrical meditation on politics, class, and culture.”
My contribution will be a volume with the provisional title “In the Shadow of Trump,” examining how Kansas politics has been shaped (and misshapen) throughout the past decade thanks to the influence of a certain president. I’m not interested in writing about Trump, mind you — more how the shockwaves from his persona and politics have changed this state’s formerly sedate politics.
“That trio from the Reflector really speaks to another reason behind why we felt like we could pull this off, and there are really, really incredible writers here in Kansas and in the Midwest,” Loganbill said. “There are award-winning journalists, there are New York Times bestselling authors, there are nationally recognized poets and creative writers. We really have just a lot of literary talent in the Midwest. And so not only did I feel we had the importance of story to build this out, but we had the literary talents to tell those stories, and the Reflector was an obvious first door to knock on.”
When fully up and running, Plainspoken Books should issue about 12 books a year, the editor said. As a whole, UPK publishes about 50 books a year, working out to roughly one a week. Spend some time with their catalogue and prepare to be overwhelmed.
Loganbill still wants to find great writers and manuscripts, too. While many people imagine writing a book one day or another, not many actually sit down to do it, or sit down to do so in collaboration with an editor.
“I’m always looking for projects, for pitches, for ideas, for really any stage,” he said. “If there’s a talented writer with a story to tell, I’d love to talk.”

(Hollie Adams/Getty Images)Elections have consequences. So do Senate confirmations. Never has that been clearer than a recent warning from the government about pregnancy, another indication that science apparently no longer counts in regards to public health.
More on that below. First, some recent news in which Nebraska’s two U.S. senators — principals in the aforementioned confirmation process — were prominent: one with her take on free speech, the other to announce his intention to keep his job. Both were stories of some import but paled when we consider that at about the same time the republic was lurching further alist in an unruly, fact- and science-free sea.
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., told Nebraska Public Media in an interview earlier this month that she’s on board with the First Amendment in the aftermath of activist Charlie Kirk’s murder. She said, “Oh, I’m a strong supporter of free speech, but reactions like we’ve seen in some cases, where they are celebrating an assassination, celebrating a murder, that is not free speech, and those people need to be held responsible for the disgusting, horrible things that they are saying. It’s not free speech to celebrate the death of someone or to encourage attacks on other people. That’s not free speech. There, there is no issue that that kind of talk should be supported in any way whatsoever.”
The senator’s notion that such “talk” should go unsupported surely has plenty of support. That said, “disgusting, horrible” discourse, speech you and I might abhor, is nonetheless protected speech according to a long line of legal precedent such as Skokie v. National Socialist Party of America. Any speaker is open to the consequences of such speech, but unless it falls within the narrow confines of defamation, obscenity, threats or fighting words, incitement or fraud, the speaker has the Constitutional right to utter even the most heinous words without the government (Looking at you, FCC.) preclusion, censorship or punishment.
For his part, U.S. Sen Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., announced his intention to run as an incumbent in 2026. He touted his work in the Senate, his support of the current administration’s economic and immigration policies and his belief that his opponent, Dan Osborn, was a “fake” independent. Osborn responded by calling Ricketts a “fake senator.” 
Discussions about free speech can be enlightening. Plus, we could raise the civics conversation bar if more of our informed interactions centered on constitutional rights. 
I suppose back-and-forths over who’s real and who isn’t can temporarily entertain us — maybe even provide some comic relief from the drudgery of a political campaign — but one hopes the candidates raise the level of debate going forward. 
Speaking of raising the level of discussion, we’ve watched a verbose scolding of world leaders, an inexplicable summoning of our top military brass and, as of this writing, the readying for a government shutdown (followed surely by a blame game). Meanwhile, the president and his confirmed Secretary of Health and Human Services, without qualifying evidence, officially told pregnant women they should avoid an over-the-counter medication that has kept mothers-to-be and their children safe for years. They insist, without offering proof, that the medication increases the chances of a child being born on the autism spectrum.
They are objecting to acetaminophen, which most of us know as Tylenol. While the president and secretary offered no studies that would underscore the importance of avoiding Tylenol during pregnancy, the FDA responded the next day. It said “a causal relationship has not been established, and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature. It is also noted that acetaminophen is the only over-the-counter drug approved for use to treat fevers during pregnancy, and high fevers in pregnant women can pose a risk to their children. Additionally, aspirin and ibuprofen have well-documented adverse impacts on the fetus.”
The secretary has his job in part because of our aforementioned senators’ votes. If you’re keeping score at home, the final tally in the Senate was 52-48 for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation. His hearing was not without contention, although his history as a vaccine skeptic was front and center, not acetaminophen. His promise at those hearings to keep vaccines accessible has dimmed, too, with HHS’s recent policy changes pitting its recommendations against those of medical provider associations.
I’d be curious if either of our senators, supporters enough of the current HHS secretary to give him the department’s corner office, feel any responsibility toward their constituents to explain why a potentially dangerous public health policy is being created without the proper science to support it? 
Surely Nebraskans would want an explanation of those consequences.

But the new map excludes race, ethnicity and language data, leaving advocates scratching their heads.","A new iteration of the Maryland Department of the Environment's environmental justice map has drawn concern from advocates, who say that some communities facing pollution concerns are seeing lowered scores despite continued burdens. (Screenshot by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A state map showing “environmental justice” communities is back online, after the state lost access, in a Trump administration purge, to federal data about communities considered overburdened by pollution and underserved by government services.
But the Maryland Department of the Environment removed race, ethnicity and language data from the calculus that determines an area’s environmental justice score on the updated map, leaving some environmental advocates scratching their heads.
Brandywine — a majority-Black Prince George’s County community surrounded by gas-fired power plants, a coal ash dump, a Superfund site and more — has long been considered a poster child for environmental injustice in Maryland. After being ranked above the 75th percentile in the previous map, a qualifier for more careful scrutiny in environmental permitting, it now has a score of 63 out of 100.
“It’s just a map change. It’s not a reality change,” said Brandywine community leader Kamita Gray. “It just appears to me that MDE blatantly does not want to be accountable in the massive pollution and the overburden of these heavy industrial industries.”
Industrial facilities applying for a permit must list the area’s environmental justice score, and Gray worries that Brandywine’s lowered score will make it even easier for polluting facilities to win new or more flexible permits, despite the fact that residents already feel inundated, particularly by air pollution.
In a statement, MDE spokesman Jay Apperson said the agency redesigned the map after the federal data loss “with pre-downloaded federal data and Maryland-specific data from our agency and the Maryland Department of Health.”

The agency website containing the map warns that race and other categories are not included in the environmental justice score calculation, but adds that the data is still available on the site “for informational purposes only.”
“Collecting and displaying this data allows users to evaluate the relationships between demographics and pollution burden, and can be used to better understand issues related to environmental justice and racial equity in Maryland,” reads the message. “MDE cautions users against using the ‘Underserved’ map layer, or its subcategories, in any manner that would be considered discriminatory under applicable law.”
MDE, which handles environmental permitting, argues that it “consider[s] the overburdened nature of all communities when evaluating the adequacy of permit conditions,” particularly when it comes to communities over the 75th percentile on the map, Apperson said.
With an overall score of 63, Brandywine falls out of that percentile, but it has scores above 75 for at least five key indicators, so it still receives a more careful review, Apperson said.
MDE also argues that the updated environmental justice map, called MDEnviroScreen, also includes a number of beneficial new features, including a new climate change vulnerability score and a more user-friendly design.
Sacoby Wilson, a University of Maryland professor focused on environmental justice issues, said he believes that the racial data was removed from the Maryland map in response to President Donald Trump’s (R) crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion programming, which he codified in an executive order on his first day back in office.
“They’re trying to shy away from that kind of scrutiny. So, I get that,” Wilson said. “Now, what it’s done is, it’s a less-inclusive tool by excluding race.”
Wilson believes that, even if MDE continues excluding race, there are ways to strengthen the map with “race-proximal” indicators that show whether an area has suffered from racist policies, such as redlining, for example. He points to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development’s “Just Communities” tool, which takes into account homeownership rates, residential vacancy rates and more.
“We are working to explore race-proximal, race-adjacent indicators that are not race specifically, but capture the experience of racism,” Wilson said. “We are engaging with MDE to provide them with guidance and input on the types of indicators that could be really useful.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
MDE did not respond to questions about whether the map change came in response to anti-DEI pronouncements from the Trump administration.
During a July news conference in Baltimore, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that a loss of access to federal data at the beginning of Trump’s administration forced MDE’s map offline originally. The Trump administration removed the Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental justice map shortly after taking office, spurring a lawsuit from environmental groups.
At the July event, Moore touted the fact that Maryland brought the tool back online without the need for federal inputs.
“Just because we no longer have a willing partner in the federal government does not mean we just sit there now and take it,” Moore said. “We mobilize, and we step up, and that is why we are updating our environmental justice map to operate independently from our federal sources.”
Moore then signed an executive order requiring state agencies to reference the map during decision-making and produce reports on their efforts to uphold environmental justice, among other requirements.
After the MDE map was taken down, Jennifer Kunze, the Maryland organizing director for Clean Water Action, said she waited “on pins and needles” for its return. The result was disappointing, she said.
It isn’t just Brandywine, Kunze said. She said that the tool seems to struggle to account for environmental justice concerns in the state’s rural areas, lowering scores for areas near Eastern Shore poultry houses, and the former Luke Paper Mill site in Allegany County.
Kunze is among a group of advocates working on the next iteration of the CHERISH Our Communities Act, a bill that failed in the last legislative session, that would have set new requirements for pollution permits in environmental justice communities, and expressly let MDE deny permits on environmental justics grounds. Last year’s bill included all Census tracts with a score at or above 75 — and a 1.5-mile radius around them.
“Folks doing EJ organizing on the ground and living in frontline communities know what communities need to be covered by protections like the CHERISH Act and this tool — the way it’s currently calculated — leaves some of them out,” Kunze said.
Moore signs environmental justice order, amid federal government’s anti-DEI push

Wilson, who has also worked on the bill, said the group is considering alternatives for this year’s bill, including lowering the threshold, using a different measurement, or allowing communities with a score over a certain level to opt in to receive additional scrutiny during environmental permitting.
In August, Gray sent a letter to MDE leadership on behalf of the Brandywine/TB Southern Region Neighborhood Coalition, urging them to publish the rationale for dropping race, ethnicity, language and age data from the environmental justice score, and conduct an audit assessing the scores rendered by the new map. She said the previous EPA environmental justice map put Brandywine in the 97th percentile.
Gray was among the advocates who filed a 2016 federal civil rights complaint, arguing that an effort to place a new power plant near the community violated anti-discrimination law. The complaint resulted in a settlement with Maryland agencies.
Gray said that while the Moore administration has been more vocal about upholding environmental justice, including by signing its recent executive order, she continues to see be frustrated by permit decisions and potential new facilities, including a proposed concrete batching facility.
“It’s stopping nothing on the ground,” Gray said.
Greg Sawtell, a community advocate in Baltimore’s Curtis Bay, agreed. That community abuts the Curtis Bay coal piers, and is close to a number of other industrial facilities. A medical waste incinerator, which paid a historic fine for pollution in 2013, sits across Curtis Creek.
Sawtell, the zero-waste just transition director with the South Baltimore Community Land Trust, said the community has continued to track pollution events with cameras and air monitors, including puffs of dark black smoke emitted by the incinerator and clouds of coal dust from the piers.
“While we have greater willingness to acknowledge that Curtis Bay is overburdened, and talk about it, talk about it quite a bit … Those events haven’t stopped. The government hasn’t done the things that it must do in order to prevent that,” Sawtell said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-08-26-at-resized-scaled-e1759142998650-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-29 07:58:47.292917

Many of those cuts were averted, but the DDA now faces a challenge of determining recipients' eligibility for services. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)A group of Medicaid recipients has sued the Maryland Department of Health for a “dysfunctional” system of determining eligibility for services that they say has denied services to those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The failure of the department’s annual “redetermination” process has already caused a number of recipients to lose coverage, the suit says, and has the potential to expose thousands of disabled Marylanders with disabilities to institutionalization or homelessness as they lose the services that allow them to live independently.
The lawsuit was also brought by The Arc Montgomery County, a service provider, which says it has provided $9 million in care to clients since January 2024 for Developmental Disabilities Administration services that have not been reimbursed by the state.
The suit, filed Thursday in Montgomery County Circuit Court, seeks to be certified as a class action on behalf of all 18,000 state Medicaid recipients
“The breakdown of Maryland’s Medicaid redetermination process threatens to a have a disastrous impact on Marylanders with intellectual and developmental disabilities,” Kevin Docherty, the lead attorney in the suit, said in a statement from The Arc Montgomery County.
A spokesperson for the health department said Friday that the agency “does not comment on litigation.”
People with developmental disabilities seeing Medicaid coverage lapse more often

The named plaintiffs in the case — Ursula Battle, Constance Farrell, Frank Lee and Yolanda Puzzo — are all participants in the Community Pathways program, one of three “waiver” programs offered under Maryland’s Medicaid system, along with Community Supports and Family Supports. The services are jointly funded by the state and federal governments.
The suit says Community Pathways is “the most comprehensive waiver, paying for residential services, such as group homes; support services, including behavioral support, environmental assessments, caregiver training, and education; and day services, including employment support.”
Community Supports is similar, but does not include a residential component. Family Supports is for care of children from birth to age 21.
Participants in all the waiver programs have to prove eligibility annually. Recipients can earn up to three times the monthly Supplemental Security Income payment — currently $2,901 a month, according to the suit — and still be eligible.
Annual redeterminations were suspended in March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when states were prohibited from canceling Medicaid coverage for most recipients. But redetermination was restarted in May 2023 and advocates, and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, say the department has struggled to keep pace with applications since then.
“Redetermination should be a straightforward process, but, for Marylanders with IDD [intellectual and development disabilities], it is not,” says the lawsuit. “Since May 2023, MDH has disenrolled people with IDD from DDA waiver programs in violation of the due process rights they are afforded under federal and state law. Many longtime participants in the waiver programs have been disenrolled without notice, a meaningful opportunity to be heard, or a reasoned decision from MDH regarding their eligibility.”
Among the problems since redetermination restarted, the lawsuit says, are notices sent to the wrong address — in many cases, an address that The Arc Montgomery County has not used for more than five years — and a failure to notify recipients that their services are in danger of being cut off. The department routinely fails to acknowledge receipt of redetermination paperwork or says it did not receive an application — sometimes by sending a notice to the wrong address — and applicants’ phone calls and emails to the department are not returned.
Hundreds of recipients who did receive notice that they were being disenrolled got letters citing a part of the Maryland Code of Regulations that “does not exist, and has never existed,” according to the suit.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When they appeal their disenrollment, recipients do not get a decision within the required 90 days and often go months without a hearing, the plaintiffs argue. And even though the state is supposed to continue services while an appeal is pending, it will “consistently terminate benefits upon MDH’s issuance of a disenrollment notice, leaving participants without benefits while they are seeking to correct MDH’s arbitrary and erroneous actions,” the suit says.
“On the whole, Maryland’s redetermination process is so opaque, dysfunctional and arbitrary that disenrolled DDA waiver participants, and even long-established provider organizations like The Arc Montgomery County are unable to navigate it,” the lawsuit said.
Advocates said this summer, as the problem was becoming more evident, that the issue might be the result of a loss of experienced staff at the health department as it was hit with the Medicaid “unwinding” in 2023. That’s when it was forced to determine if everyone on the Medicaid rolls, which had ballooned to 1.8 million during the pandemic, was still eligible.
By summer 2024, state officials had reduced Medicaid rolls to 1.69 million, and that number was down to prepandemic levels of about 1.5 million as of May 2025, according to the department.
There is no exact count of the number of of Medicaid recipients who may have been accidentally disenrolled. But, after complaints from advocates and caregivers, the department acknowledged in July that it had restored coverage for 263 people who had been erroneously disenrolled and said it was in the “process of continuing to do a full review of all the particular circumstances of which the disenrollments occurred.”
The Arc Montgomery County said that at least 30 people it supports, including the four named plaintiffs in the suit, have been erroneously disenrolled during redetermination, even though they continue to be financially eligible.
“We stand with our co-plaintiffs and all Marylanders with intellectual and developmental disabilities in this fight to secure the rights and benefits to which they are entitled,” said Daria Cervantes, CEO of The Arc Montgomery County, in a prepared statement.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_dda_advocacyday_fy26cuts-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-29 06:56:30.226729

The University of West Florida is being run by Manny Diaz Jr., a former social studies teacher (and ex-Commissioner of Education) but, given that he’s Ron DeSantis’ choice, he’ll likely get the permanent position.
Florida Atlantic and Florida International have had undistinguished former legislators imposed on them; and USF president Rhea Law has announced her resignation, creating an opening for another DeSantis-friendly politician.
At the University of Florida, our supposed flagship institution, the provost is interim, the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Law, and Arts are being run by interim deans, and 30 chair or director positions are vacant.
This obvious dysfunction has not gone unnoticed: The best and brightest academics are not exactly enthusiastic about working in Florida.
I’ve been teaching for more than 30 years; I love my job at Florida State — for now, at least. The students are wonderful (most of them), and I admire, even like, my colleagues (most of them).
Ron DeSantis hasn’t gotten around to trying to trash our reputation and cripple our academic freedom the way they have at New College, UWF, and UF.
Not yet, anyway.
The state’s “post-tenure review,” in which professors (who already undergo yearly reviews) must further justify their existence to the Board of Trustees, has driven some of the most productive academics out of Florida.
Nearly a third of Florida’s faculty want to leave the state.
If I were a young professor looking for a job, I’d avoid Florida.
Churn at UF
Our state government is authoritarian and proudly ignorant, hell-bent on destroying what makes universities great — freedom of expression, critical thinking, creativity, exposing students to ideas that may challenge them (or even upset them), unfettered research, scientific rigor, and advances in knowledge based on data.
Why would a scholar want to pursue a career in such a fact-resistant, small-minded, censorious state?
As has become its habit, the University of Florida has changed presidents. Again.
University of Florida Interim President Donald Landry. (Photo via UF X account)
Dr. Donald Landry has become UF’s interim president, replacing Kent Fuchs, the former interim president and one-time actual president who stepped back in when Ben Sasse, the unqualified spendthrift former president resigned under a cloud, and then had to stay on when the trustees’ choice, Dr. Santa Ono, who’d resigned as president of the University of Michigan to take the job at Florida, fell foul of the Board of  Governors’ anti-DEI hysteria.
This is not how serious institutions of higher education conduct themselves.
But then, Florida is not a serious place.
Enter Landry, late of the Columbia Center for Human Longevity and a medical doctor with “elite” Ivy degrees.
Landry seems positively giddy at becoming UF’s latest interim, calling it “the culmination of my career” and “the opportunity of a lifetime,” and demonstrates an Olympic-standard talent for sucking up, calling UF “a preeminent university in what one could argue is the preeminent state in this nation at this moment in time.”
He obviously wants the permanent job. The trustees obviously want him to have it: They’re paying him $2 million for this year, with the possibility of a $500,000 bonus.
If they don’t give him the permanent job, they have to pay him another $2 million.
Purge of academics
While the fact-based community knows Florida is Ground Zero for the climate crisis, Landry told UF’s right-wing trustees what they wanted to hear, insisting the science is “not settled,” even though the science is indeed settled: 97% of climate scientists agree on anthropogenic causes of global warming.
Maybe they should have asked him if the Theory of Gravity is sound or if the sun orbits the earth.
Or if he’ll defend professors’ freedom of speech.
DeSantis and his anti-education squad have passed laws banning anything that smells of DEI, clamped down on the honest study of American history, pitched hissy fits over pro-Palestinian campus protests, and railed against so-called “woke” professors who have the temerity to recognize that gay people exist, trans people exist, systemic racism is real, and science doesn’t care what you believe.
Now they’re going after educators who dare disparage Charlie Kirk.
Let’s stipulate that Kirk did not deserve his violent death. No one does.
He was a human being. He had as much right as the rest of us to speak his mind.
Which is the whole point.
A University of Miami neurologist was fired for posting, “What was done to Charlie Kirk has been done to countless Palestinian babies, children, girls, boys, women and men not just over the past two years of the ongoing genocide, but decades.”
A retired University of Florida law professor was stripped of his emeritus title for saying, “I did not want him to die. I reserve that wish for Trump.”
At FAU, three professors have been placed on administrative leave. One, a tenured professor of art history, didn’t comment on Kirk’s death, but re-posted others calling Kirk bigoted and racist.
It’s not illegal.
As the great Rick Wilson says, “tastelessness is not treason.”
‘Outrageous things’
Kirk identified as a “free speech absolutist,” declaring, “You should be allowed to say outrageous things,” even if you upset people.
Among the outrageous things Charlie Kirk said:
On journalist Joy Reid, the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, former First Lady Michelle Obama, and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson being “affirmative action picks,” he said, “You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.”
On women: They should “submit to a godly man,” marry early, and have babies.
On Jews: “The philosophical foundation of anti-whiteness has been largely financed by Jewish donors in the country.”
On guns: “I think it’s worth [it] to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”
As offensive, stupid, prejudiced, or karma-inviting as you or I might find what Kirk said, we live under a system of laws that protect his right to say it.
‘Civility’
The question is whether the DeSantis administration and Florida’s education establishment, including UF’s new president, understand that freedom of speech applies to all of us.
Donald Landry says he’s big on civility: “I will be locking in a culture of freedom of academic expression tempered by civility.”
Christopher Rufo via Facebook
Landry enjoys the support of Christopher Rufo, who calls him “a principled leader who will reverse ideological capture and restore truth-seeking within the institution” at UF.
In case you’ve forgotten Rufo, he’s yet another pious conservative who likes to claim he cherishes free expression on campus, telling PBS News Hour in May the DeSantis administration has “expanded the range of discourse in higher education,” and boasting, “At New College of Florida, for example, where I’m a trustee, we have probably the widest range of discourse of any public university in the United States.”
A habit in Florida
Getting rid of a visiting professor who focuses on Black history contradicts Rufo’s smug assertion.
No one at New College accused Erik Wallenberg of incompetence or bad teaching or any other malfeasance.
But Rufo called him “a pure left-wing mad-lib” and sniffed, “New College will no longer be a jobs program for middling, left-wing intellectuals.”
Firing a professor because you don’t like his politics is not evidence of a wide range of discourse.
It’s also likely illegal.
Landry should take note and someone should alert him to Florida’s long, shameful history of McCarthyite attacks on academics.
In the late 1950s, the Legislature started investigating universities, determined to search out communists, biology professors who taught evolution, English professors who assigned “The Grapes of Wrath” and the poetry of Allen Ginsberg, and especially gay people in the student body or the faculty.
Scores were fired or expelled.
Perhaps former president/former interim president Kent Fuchs can tell Donald Landry about the time he, and UF trustees head Mori Hosseini, tried to ban four law professors from signing onto an amicus brief opposing a state law making it hard for former felons to vote, and stop three other professors  from testifying as expert witnesses on the ground that their actions might impede Ron DeSantis’ agenda.
Landry’s UF contract stipulates that a number of important decisions, including hiring, must be approved by Mori Hosseini — which means a highly partisan political appointee will exercise even more control over how the university works, what’s allowed, what’s censored.

H.B. 5002 could be better named the “Democrats Hate Small Town Life in Connecticut Bill.” Among other things, it’s an attempt to mandate far left DEI housing policies into every city and town across the state. Many Democrats appear to believe that all local zoning ordinances are racist and discriminatory. Their solution for increasing the amount of low-income housing in Connecticut is to force the cities and towns to comply with state-issued mandates.
Democratically elected planning and zoning commissions determine local zoning ordinances. They reflect the needs of their municipalities and residents in accordance with current laws. H.B.5002 would sideline local commissions and put the power to decide where, what type and how much low-income housing will be built in the hands of state lawmakers. Compliance with the first version of this bill would have been devastatingly costly to small communities. Even the later, slightly watered down version would be financially problematic for many small towns.
H.B.5002 is nothing but a power grab for Democrat lawmakers in Hartford. It’s a crack in the door Democrats will use to push DEI policies into small communities with limited resources. Unaffordable housing is an inflationary problem of government’s own making. Homelessness is a combination of economic and social problems. But more regulations are not the answer.
Household income in Connecticut did not keep up with the housing market because we lack better job opportunities for our people. Why don’t Democrat lawmakers work to bring back the good paying manufacturing jobs they drove away with high taxes, high-energy costs and excess regulation? Then more people could afford to buy homes again. Governor Lamont was right to veto this bill.
Senate Bill 8 should have been called the “Taxpayers Funding Endless Strikes Bill.” S.B.8 aims to give unionized workers taxpayer funded unemployment benefits while out on strike. This is the second time Governor Lamont vetoed this bill.
If any company needs another reason to not do business in Connecticut, here’s one more manufactured by none other than our own legislature, with the help of public employee unions. How will employers react to the State of Connecticut injecting themselves into private labor negotiations? Would public funding of protracted strikes stifle job growth? You bet it would.
Try to imagine the effect it will have on state, county and municipal union contract negotiations. Public employees can go on strike against their employers, we the taxpayers, and we taxpayers must pay them unemployment benefits until they get what they want from us? Sounds more like legalized extortion than fair labor negotiations.
And all of this to be financed by an overtaxed population of Connecticut workers who (according to a 2022 Nutmeg Research Study) earn on average 40% less in pay and benefits than a State of Connecticut employee who does similar work. Governor Lamont was right to veto both of these bills. In this instance he stood up for the taxpayers, which is something Democrats in our legislature almost never do. Thank you, Governor Lamont.

Franklin understood that the great experiment of republican democracy requires action, and that people must work diligently to maintain such a precious form of self-government. Unlike the authoritarian governments of his time, where citizens were subjected to the demands of a ruler, democratic practices must be taught. Consequently, the civic education and engagement of an informed population are imperative in order for a democratic system of government to sustain and thrive.

State Rep. Kevin Brown
In 2023, Connecticut took a major step towards ensuring that our future generations are well-versed in the function of government and the importance of participation within their communities. Created in statute, the Civics Education, Civics Engagement & Media Literacy Task Force was formed to study the level of civic knowledge and engagement in our state, as well as our ability to navigate the ever-changing media platforms that exist in the modern 24-hour news cycle.  The bipartisan and diverse task force membership spent nearly a year checking the civic pulse of our state, only to find that while a variety of programs are working to increase participation in civic life, we fall short of truly preparing our youth to take the lead in their communities as they come of age.
As task force co-chair, a legislator, and most importantly a high school civics teacher, the dearth of civics education in our state causes me tremendous concern.  After decades of marginalized social studies instruction, due largely to a reliance on standardized testing to measure school performance, many students who enter our classrooms have little understanding of how their government works, or what their role in the process might be. 
In 2022, only 24 percent of U.S. students reached the “proficient” standard on the NAEP Civics Assessment. Volunteerism, which has seen a slight improvement since a major drop during covid, has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. Voter turnout in the last Connecticut municipal election cycle sat just above 30% statewide, and even lower in some of the communities with the greatest needs. 
With so many major issues facing our state and nation, it is easy to look past what many of us take for granted. Recent events, however, including assassinations of political figures on both sides of the aisle, should serve as a warning that a lack of civic knowledge and the ability to discern credible information can lead to an unhealthy distrust of the institution of government, vitriolic rhetoric, and a breakdown of democratic practices as we know them.


All hope is not lost, however. One simple way to encourage our youth to engage in their communities is to reward them for it.  In the 2025 legislative session, there was an opportunity to do just that with the passage of HB 7009, which included the establishment of a state seal of civics education, allowing graduates to earn a seal on their diploma certifying that they have shown proficiency in civic skills and engagement over the course of their high school career. 
While this bill passed overwhelmingly in the state House of Representatives, it was not taken up in the Senate. As a state, we must make a commitment to our future and the future of democracy.  While there are many important legislative priorities each year, our ability to address these issues through the democratic process rests upon our ability to educate and engage the public in the practice. 
If children grow up learning how democratic government works, along with the impact their participation can have, they are more likely to engage in their communities as adults. If they can identify credible sources, they will develop opinions that are supported by hard evidence and be able to take meaningful informed action. 
We must put a high level of emphasis on civics and media literacy in the classroom throughout the K-12 experience. Partnering with organizations like the Connecticut Democracy Center, Connecticut Bar Association, and CT Humanities, among others, school districts can develop engaging curricula and provide opportunities for students and adults alike to see the value of civic participation. 
As the Constitution State, let us take the lead on this Constitution Day by paying democracy forward, prioritizing civic education, engagement, and media literacy, and guaranteeing that these subjects are prioritized in schools and communities across Connecticut.

Dover, Del. – Delaware has completed its first comprehensive property tax reassessment in over 40 years across all three counties: New Castle since 1983, Kent since 1987, and Sussex since 1974. This process was mandated following a 2018 lawsuit by civil rights groups, including the NAACP, which argued that outdated valuations led to inequities in school funding reliant on property taxes.
The reassessments, conducted by Tyler Technologies, revealed that residential property values surged, often by 400-500% or more, while commercial values rose more modestly or declined. The reassessment process aimed to be revenue-neutral, with tax rates adjusted down to result in no change in revenue for either the county or school districts. However, the shift in valuations between residential and commercial/non-residential properties significantly altered the tax burden. This disproportionately affected homeowners, with many facing tax increases of hundreds to thousands of dollars annually, particularly in New Castle County where the residential share of the tax burden jumped from 67% to about 76%. School districts in some areas also captured a 10% “windfall” in revenue allowed under state law, exacerbating the outcry.
Public frustration peaked in the summer of 2025, prompting an August 12 special legislative session where seven bills were passed for short-term relief. These included HB 242, which allows New Castle County school districts to reset and split tax rates for residential vs. non-residential properties for the 2025-2026 school year, reducing homeowner bills by shifting some burden back to commercial properties. HB 240 and HB 241 establish payment plans for residential taxes without penalties, interest, or liens if complied with, extending protections through 2026 for longer plans. SCR 122 mandates a statewide review of the reassessment process to ensure future ones (next in Kent 2029, New Castle/Sussex 2030) are fairer and more transparent. Other measures include quarterly reporting on payment plan data and protections against aggressive collection.
These were stopgap fixes; long-term reforms, including broader tax framework changes and exemptions, were deferred to 2026. In response, Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola (D-Newark), announced committee assignments on September 3, 2025, saying “The special committees… [are] tasked with investigating Delaware’s first statewide property reassessment in more than two generations… to evaluate the process, its impacts on property taxes and education funding, and possible legislative responses.” Democratic leaders have emphasized the committees as a transparent, bipartisan effort to review the reassessment process, gather public input, and develop long-term reforms, building on the August special session’s short-term relief measures.
Republicans have criticized the effort as lacking true bipartisanship, claiming their input, such as on bills like HB 73 to double senior credits, was sidelined. Per House Republican Minority Leader, Tim Dukes, and Minority Whip, Jeff Speigelmanj, “Democrats hold overwhelming majorities in both chambers… And they’ve used these numbers to dictate the reassessment debate in an entirely partisan fashion… Republicans [were] not given input or advance notice about the new committees.”
The special committees are structured as separate but coordinated House and Senate committees, each with bipartisan membership. They focus on valuation methods, tax impacts, education funding ties, exemptions, and equity. The committees aim to probe Tyler Technologies’ methodologies, assess homeowner hardships, compare Delaware’s protections to other states, and develop a “roadmap” for equitable future reassessments and targeted relief, such as for seniors and fixed-income households.
The format includes four public hearings in the Senate Chamber at Legislative Hall (411 Legislative Avenue, Dover). All are open to the public, with in-person attendance and livestreaming available at legis.delaware.gov. No registration is required, but agendas and witness lists will be posted closer to the dates.
The updated meeting schedule as of mid-September 2025 is as follows:

Hearing #1: Tuesday, September 30, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. – The Recent Reassessment: Overview of the process, methodologies used by Tyler Technologies, lessons learned, and initial inequities identified.
Hearing #2: Week of October 6, 2025 (Exact date TBD; likely Monday/Tuesday) – Property Reassessment and the Law: Legal background, compliance issues, and guardrails for future cycles.
Hearing #3: Week of October 20, 2025 (Exact date TBD) – Delawareans and Their Property Taxes: Impacts on residents, comparisons to other states’ programs, and updates to exemptions post-reassessment.
Hearing #4: Week of November 3, 2025 (Exact date TBD) – Property Reassessment and Education Funding: How reassessments affect school revenues, the 10% windfall rule, and balancing equity in funding without overburdening taxpayers.

The committee hearings will be open to public attendance at Legislative Hall and streamed on the General Assembly website, www.legis.delaware.gov. Post-hearing, the committees will compile findings and propose legislation for the January 2026 session.

Justin Taylor/The Current GA/CatchLight LocalPrivate schools in 102 Georgia cities received $5.4 million in state voucher funds this fall, as parents took advantage of the state’s newly expanded program aimed at helping students from low-performing public school get private education.
Private schools in McDonough, Covington and Conyers received as much money as schools in in more populous places like Columbus, Savannah and Atlanta.

 
Of the total $7.1 million program funds distributed so far, most have gone to educational organizations predominantly affiliated with Christian churches, according to data from the Georgia Education Savings Authority, the state agency set up to manage the program.
The private school with the largest amount of funds from the voucher program was Newton County’s Covington Academy with $120,701. It is the only school to have received more than $100,000. Tuition there runs $5,500, plus fees.
The remaining program funding spent this fall — $1.7 million — went to 153 companies, including giant retailer Amazon, that sell school supplies such as computers, tablets and books, records show.

Christian schools, Amazon attract most Georgia voucher school dollars

Under the program’s guidelines, families receive $6,500 per year for each child to pay for the switch to a private school or homeschool or other educational supports.
It will take at least 15 months before Georgians will have metrics from GESA’s first review to evaluate whether the promise of the sweeping policy — better quality education and more competition for public schooling — is fulfilled.

Rick Cleveland
Back to 2014.
Remember?
For a while there, both Mississippi State and Ole Miss both ranked among the nation’s top three football teams. State, coached by Dan Mullen, was No. 1. Ole Miss, coached by Hugh Freeze, was No. 3. At one point, both teams were a perfect 7-0. The college football world was astonished. Actually, so were most of us Mississippians. No, it didn’t last, but wasn’t it fun while it did?
Fast forward to Saturday: Ole Miss surely did its part, earning a solid, not-as-close-as-it-sounds 24-19 victory over previously No. 4 LSU to move to 5-0. After a slow start, the Rebels dominated LSU, nearly doubling the Tigers in total offense. In one of the most amazing stats you’ll see this year, the Rebels were penalized for nearly twice as much yardage (109) as LSU was able to gain (59) running the ball.
The Rebels, previously ranked No. 13, soared to No. 4. Trinidad Chambliss should enter the far-too-soon discussions of who might win the Heisman Trophy. And it is not in any way too soon for Chambliss to enter any discussion of the most interesting story in this, or any, college football season. From Division II Ferriss State and the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference to Ole Miss and the SEC. From the D-II national championship to the FBS national championship contention. More on that later.
Meanwhile, in Starkville, Mississippi State did everything but knock off 15th ranked Tennessee. If State isn’t the most improved college football team in the nation, the Bulldogs are in the first sentence of any paragraph written on that subject. Southern Miss might be in the next sentence, and we’ll get to the Golden Eagles, too.
State led for much of the game and battled the Volunteers on even or better terms throughout. Watching the Bulldogs these days, it is hard to fathom that just a season ago they lost 10 games, nine by double digits, and defeated only one FBS team. But then, that’s the way it goes in today’s college football world in which if you have the money — and spend it wisely — you can turn over your roster and turn around your football fortunes in one offseason. State and head coach Jeff Lebby clearly spent wisely. 
Same goes for Southern Miss, which spent most wisely, it seems, on Charles Huff, the head coach who last year led Marshall to the Sun Belt Championship and brought with him to Hattiesburg 21 of the players who helped him win it. Clearly, the most critical of those Marshall transfers is quarterback Braylon Braxton, who has thrown for 11 touchdowns and run for another. In Saturday night’s 42-25 pasting of Jacksonville State (which clobbered USM 44-7 a year ago), three for two scores and ran for another and did not turn the ball over.
But let’s get back to Ole Miss, which appears to have all the necessary ingredients to make a run — not only to the FBS playoffs but in the playoffs, as well. Those ingredients include:

A special player at quarterback. Chambliss reminds me most of Kyler Murray, who won the Heisman Trophy in 2018, throwing for 42 touchdowns and running for 11 in leading the Oklahoma Sooners to an 11-2 record. What’s more, the Rebels have Austin Simmons, who opened the season as the starter, in reserve.
A balanced offense that also features running back Kewan Lacy and a host of speedy receivers. Lacy, who runs hard but can also make people miss, has run for 445 yards and eight touchdowns. He is what Ole Miss did not have – or at least did not utilize – last season.
Speed, speed, speed on defense. The Rebels run to the football and hit hard when they get there. Pete Golding continues to do a masterful job. LSU ran the ball 21 times for 59 yards.
Inside stoppers on defense. This was a perceived weakness with the Rebels losing first round draft pick Walter Nolen and also JJ Pegues. But Ole Miss looks at least as proficient with gargantuan tackle Zxavian Harris and Will Echoles promoted to fill the void. LSU couldn’t block them.
A sound kicking game. With the Ole Miss offense, the Rebels punter is often much like the Maytag repairman, but Australian Oscar Bird has been excellent when called upon. Placekicker Lucas Carneiro has hit 11 of 12 field goals, including three of four beyond 40 yards. 

The Ole Miss schedule, by SEC standards, is doable. The Rebels don’t have to play Alabama, Texas, Texas A&M, Missouri or Vanderbilt (yes, I just wrote that). They do play both Georgia and Oklahoma both on the road and back-to-back. South Carolina is no gimme and neither is Mississippi State for that matter. But again, in the SEC, it could be a whole lot worse.
The Rebels have a week off, before Washington State, a 59-10 loser to North Texas, visits for homecoming. Then, it’s at Georgia and at Oklahoma, back to back.
Will the bubble burst? Or will Trinidad Chambliss, the best story in college football, add to seemingly tall tale? We shall see.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/28143349/AP25271000675535.jpg,,,2025-09-28 15:56:57.711039

(Photo by Emily Elconin/Getty Images)Authorities say 10 people were shot, at least one fatally, and a fire broke out Sunday morning at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, about 50 miles north of Detroit.
Grand Blanc Township police said on social media that the suspected shooter “is down” and there was no ongoing threat to the public, with Chief William Renye later telling reporters that the incident began at 10:25 a.m. when a 40-year-old Burton man he drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church.
“He then exited his vehicle, firing several rounds at individuals within the church. Ten gunshot victims have been transported to local hospitals at this time. Including one who has been deceased,” Renye said.
Officers, including with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Grand Blanc Township, arrived on the scene a short while later and “engaged in gunfire with that particular individual, neutralizing that suspect,” Renye said, adding that the fire is thought to have been deliberately set by the shooter.
Multiple law enforcement agencies have responded to Sunday’s incident in Grand Blanc, including the Michigan State Police, the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office and the Genesee County Sheriff’s Office.
FBI Director Kash Patel said on social media that the bureau was monitoring reports of the “horrific shooting and fire” and was assisting in the investigation.
“Violence in a place of worship is a cowardly and criminal act,” Patel said. “Our prayers are with the victims and their families during this terrible tragedy.”
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also shared a statement on social media, saying her “heart was breaking for the Grand Blanc community.”
“Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable,” Whitmer said. “I am grateful for the first responders who took action quickly.”
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based  in Salt Lake City, issued a statement, saying they were “deeply grateful” for the outpouring of support from around the world. 
“In moments of sorrow and uncertainty, we find strength and comfort through our faith in Jesus Christ. Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved,” Doug Andersen, a church spokesperson said.
The shooting occurred less than 24 hours after  the death of the church’s president, Russell M. Nelson, who died Saturday at 101 years old.
The Grand Blanc Township incident follows another church-related shooting in late June when a man wearing tactical gear and carrying multiple firearms entered the CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan before being fatally shot by church security. 
The shooter’s mother in that incident was reportedly a church member, and he had attended services several times over the past year.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — After South Dakota Democrats heard appeals to organize, recruit and raise money, the keynote speaker at their Saturday night fundraiser urged them to do something else: hope.
Jaime Harrison, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told a story from his earlier job as floor director for the U.S. House Democratic Caucus. He recalled how a woman who was cleaning his Capitol office picked up a picture frame, recognized his mother in the photo, and said she went to high school with his mom and remembered when she dropped out of high school to give birth.
Harrison said the encounter brought them both to tears.
“And she came over and she hugged me and she said, ‘I would have never guessed that Patricia Harrison’s son would be right here. You give me hope.’”


Election 2026

Harrison said the story is a reminder that success is possible “no matter where you start.”
South Dakota Democrats are starting the 2026 campaign season with nobody in a statewide elected office. They had nine of the Legislature’s 105 members until earlier this month, when one of their members defected to the Republican Party and left them with eight.
One of those eight, Rapid City Rep. Nicole Uhre-Balk, told the crowd Saturday night that “I cannot begin to tell you how good it feels to be in a room of more than seven Democrats.” 
There were actually about 200 Democrats gathered in the DoubleTree hotel ballroom for the party’s annual western South Dakota fundraiser, which featured socializing, speeches and auctions benefitting the state party.
Harrison was the headliner. He chaired the Democratic National Committee from 2021 until earlier this year. Previously, he served as the first Black chairperson of the South Carolina Democratic Party and worked as an aide to U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn. Harrison also founded the Dirt Road Democrats political action committee, which works to engage rural voters, and he hosts a podcast called “At Our Table” that features conversations with guests about the nation’s challenges and hopes.
In his Saturday night speech, Harrison highlighted Uhre-Balk’s success. Last year, she became the first Democrat in 18 years to win a seat in her legislative district. According to her, if she wins again, she’ll be the first Democrat in 30 years to win two consecutive races in the district.

Harrison said the party needs more candidates to follow her lead and ignore the naysayers.
“She didn’t listen to them,” Harrison said. “She listened to all of you, and she stood up and she spoke out and she won.”
The prescription for more results like that, according to Harrison, includes a focus on recruitment.
“Do not leave any seat in South Dakota uncontested in 2026,” he said. “Not one.”
Democrats have a start toward that goal with declared candidates for offices including U.S. Senate, U.S. House and secretary of state. But their only declared candidate for governor so far is a 20-year-old college student, and they face a challenge recruiting candidates in legislative districts that lacked Democrats on the ballot last year.
Fundraising, meanwhile, has been a bright spot. The state party’s reports to the Federal Election Commission showed $341,000 of income from January through August. A July fundraiser in eastern South Dakota featuring Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz drew a crowd of about 1,000 people. 
The same period’s reports from the South Dakota Republican Party, which has undergone staff turnover including a new chairman in February, showed $41,000 of income.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-28 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi Museum of Art displays rare portraits of enslaved people,"Sophie Bates, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/28/mississippi-museum-art-rare-portraits-enslaved-people/,The only known pre-emancipation paintings of enslaved people in Mississippi are on display at the Mississippi Museum of Art.,"With powerfully haunting eyes and an enigmatic expression, “Portrait of Frederick,” an image of an enslaved man painted circa 1840, stares out at visitors of the Mississippi Museum of Art.
A little further into the museum is Delia, a Black woman dressed in red and wearing a headscarf who bears a similarly unknowable expression. The pair of portraits are the only known pre-emancipation paintings of enslaved people in Mississippi.
Now, for the first time, they are on display together for the public to see.
“I was mesmerized by the painting,” museum visitor Staci Williams said. “The colors, the expression. His humanity seemed to jump off of the page.”
The portraits evoke questions about who Frederick and Delia were, why they were painted and what went through their minds as their faces were captured stroke by stroke for generations to see.
“We don’t know, for example, if either of these people had the choice to sit for the portrait. We don’t know if they had the choice of what they were wearing when they were painted,” said Betsy Bradley, the Laurie Hearin McRee director of the museum. “They certainly weren’t allowed to own their own portrait.”
The museum bought “Portrait of Frederick” in partnership with the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. The museums will pass the portrait back and forth, each displaying it for several years at a time.
Bradley said purchasing the portrait brought up complicated feelings. Until emancipation freed him, Frederick was considered property. Now, more than 150 years later, his portrait is property, bought and sold to the highest bidder.
“If it enables us to have important conversations with each other about the human cost of slavery and why it mustn’t ever happen again, then having it in a public place can be meaningful,” Bradley said.
Since the 1860s, “Portrait of Frederick” has been displayed at Longwood, an antebellum mansion in Natchez, Mississippi, that belonged to the family of his enslavers. There, Frederick’s likeness was used to whitewash history.
According to research by the Neal Auction Company, which sold the painting to the Mississippi Museum of Art, tour guides in the 1970s informed the public that Frederick had grown up alongside his enslaver Haller Nutt, and the two were best friends. They claimed Nutt freed Frederick and referred to him by the belittling moniker “Uncle Frederick.”
In reality, Frederick oversaw other slaves on the plantation. He collected data on field production, analyzed growing conditions and acted as a manager. His role was important, and he and his family may have received better living conditions as a result.
Frederick was about 70 when the Civil War ended. He took the surname Baker and became ordained. Prior to emancipation, Black people were not allowed to marry. Frederick conducted weddings for at least 69 couples after it became legal.

Less is known about Delia. Her portrait was painted between 1840 and 1849. She appears to be sewing, which leads some to believe she worked inside her enslavers’ home. Delia’s portrait was kept by the descendants of her enslavers until the Mississippi Museum of Art bought it 2019.
Both portraits are unique in that Frederick and Delia are the sole subjects of the works. Oftentimes, Black people were painted alongside white people, likely as a way of underscoring the white person’s wealth.
Frederick is dressed in regal garb — something he likely would not have worn in his everyday role on the plantation. Both are depicted in a three-quarters composition, which was used for dignified and important subjects.
Upon looking at “Portrait of Frederick,” Williams said she felt a surprising mixture of pride and sadness.
“I wonder about what he’s thinking,” Williams mused. “He doesn’t seem to give anything away.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25154934/AP25256728817578.jpg,,,2025-09-28 09:56:31.964701

WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — The Veterans Affairs Healthcare System this week celebrated the completion of a $16 million, 24,000-square-foot renovation of a medical surgical unit at the White River Junction VA Medical Center.
The upgrade aims to provide accessible, modern health care for veterans, and make “the actual experience of being in the hospital as pleasant as possible,“ said Dr. Brett Rusch, the executive director of the White River Junction location.
While the unit, which covers the second floor of its building, previously looked and felt like a “40-year-old dormitory,” it now is a “state-of-the-art medical unit,” Rusch said.

Except for trauma, open heart surgery or open skull surgery, staff on the floor provide most types of specialty medical and surgical treatment, Rusch said. The facility performs an average of around 1,700 to 1,800 surgical cases per year, spokesperson Katherine Tang said in an email.
Beginning in December 2023, the Colchester-based Engelberth Construction company took the building “down to (the) studs,” optimizing square footage to maximize beds while creating space for movement around the unit, Rusch said.

As part of the renovation, the number of total beds in the unit decreased from about 42 to 37, Greg Auch, nurse manager of the medical surgical unit, said.
“Sacrificing a few beds, to reach the 37 beds now, allows us to break things apart to single rooms and a couple double-occupancy just to create a better experience,” Auch said.
The increased space also allows patients to receive more of their care within their rooms.

For example, there is space for in-room chest X-rays and bedside cardiograms, Auch said. Additionally physical therapy and fold-out couches for family members are moving into rooms, Rusch said.
Each individual room now also has its own temperature controls, Auch said.
Four nurse stations are now distributed across the floor to be as close to veterans as possible, in contrast to being centralized in two centers as they previously were, Rusch said.
Additionally, ceiling lifts that carry patients and could previously only go the length of certain rooms can now maneuver across the entirety of each room and into bathrooms, VA interior designer Kaitie Gillespie said.
Throughout the nearly two-year project, the facility was able to keep beds operational by working on one half at a time, Rusch said. Half of the beds moved downstairs during the construction, which was originally office space, Tang said.
The first half opened about six months ago, Rusch said.
The unit will fully open for patients in about two weeks, Gillespie said.

It is wrong to ask city residents to vote yes on a bond before other economic factors are known.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Zachary Pratt: Vote no to Rutland City’s $3.9 million tax bond.","Dear Editor,


It is irresponsible for Rutland City to ask its voters to approve a $3.9 million tax increment financing bond at a time when the future of healthcare and other economic factors are unknown. Watching the Senate Finance Committee questioning the Secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. earlier this month makes me believe that Vermonters are being put in harm’s way by his leadership as the “Big Beautiful Bill” strips Medicare and Medicaid benefits.
Open enrollment for health coverage in Vermont runs yearly from November 1 to January 15, so for me to vote to approve a $3.9 million project is unthinkable, especially when healthcare benefit cuts, increased prices of homes and automobiles, and tariff increases on other types of products are all yet to come.
Additionally, Rutland City is undergoing a comprehensive property tax reappraisal to update property taxes to bring the home assessments in line with market values that have risen in recent years. It is wrong to ask city residents to vote yes on a bond before all of these are known.

This story by Patrick Bilow and Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Sept. 25, 2025.
After a long day of pedaling from Swanton to Morristown on the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail, Paul Arthur of Vail, Colorado, didn’t have to look far for a quiet place to lay his head.
As the sun set over the Lamoille River, Arthur had pitched his tent on a soft patch of grass just steps away from the trail he’d been traveling. His bike, mounted with bags bursting at the seams with gear, was propped up by a strong stick, and Arthur was basking in the last sliver of sunlight available to him.
He’d found what he was looking for after dropping his son off at college a few days prior — something smooth and flat to pedal and reflect. The river murmured as it moved, and Arthur hadn’t seen another rider in hours.
“This is one of the best experiences I’ve ever had,” Arthur, 68, said. “Vermont is a biker’s paradise. I can’t believe no one else is out here right now.”After repeated floods waylaid its completion, towns are starting to see the full impact of a complete Lamoille Valley Rail Trail, which is attracting locals and out-of-town visitors like Arthur alike. Some ride and others walk or run. They come for day trips, launching from several different trailheads in Lamoille County, or they travel straight through Vermont, from New York to New Hampshire, stopping in towns along the way for provisions, repairs and libations.

Data provided by the Department of Transportation shows that, even if most towns along the rail trail only see the same amount of traffic they saw on their sections of the rail trail as they did the second half of last year, most of them are set to well exceed the previous year’s use. Graph courtesy of the Vermont Agency of Transportation
Data from counters installed by the Vermont Agency of Transportation that monitored traffic on the rail trail for the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025 shows that, if trends continue apace, that most stops on the trail are set to see usership far in excess of 2024, which department spokesperson Amy Tatko said reflected last year’s flooding-related closures.
The data also shows how the locally connected portion of the trail that runs through Lamoille County has helped develop ridership in those towns. Morrisville is clearly the most trafficked hub along the trail, while Cambridge, Johnson and Wolcott are also among the most popular access points, as towns like Fairfield have made inroads in the first half of this year.
Every town has benefited from a dry summer, as cyclists were able to travel unimpeded between Swanton and St. Johnsbury on the 93-mile former railway and one of the longest rail trails in New England, passing through five counties and 18 towns, including five Lamoille County towns along the way. Such a season has been a long time coming, even while a 17-mile Lamoille County portion of the trail has been open since 2016.
In 2023, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — who helped secure millions in federal funding to get the rail trail started in the 2000s — and Gov. Phil Scott — who has boosted the project and advocated for annual funding to maintain the trail — were set to walk portions of the trail in mid-July of that year as the complete version of the trail, decades in the making, was set to be unveiled.
But the flood of July 2023 hit just days before the big ribbon cutting, severely damaging portions of the rail trail and causing millions in damages in towns like Cambridge, Johnson, Morrisville, Wolcott, Greensboro and Hardwick.
Despite another flood hitting in early July 2024, which again damaged parts of the trail, the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail quietly opened last year to bikers looking to travel its full 93 miles.
Yva Rose, who operates Johnson-based Lamoille Valley Bike Tours with her husband Jim, has been keeping her own data of rail trail usership. Since 2016, she has seen the number of users steadily increase. In 2020, when the pandemic hit, the surge in outdoor recreation interest gave usership another big boost. The Roses’ plan to provide planning support, shuttle rides and bike rentals to riders along the full-length of the trail was torpedoed in 2023, which pushed potential riders to have cold feet even before the anniversary floods in 2024.
But the relatively dry summer this year has been a bounce-back season for the trail, with usership of the trail by her metrics having “quadrupled,” driven largely by a sector of outdoor enthusiasts that seek out the rail trail experience. Many towns along the trail have seen the cultural and commercial benefits already, even as they try to better position themselves to capitalize on their proximity to this economic engine of recreational tourism.
“There’s a community, a very large community, out there that spends their summers exploring rail trails,” Rose said. “Having our rail trail be 93 miles now and complete, without any flooding, has drawn a huge increase in rail trail tourism.”

Tranquility
Elona McNeil, 13, Shelburne
My funny little friend
appearing at my door,
day in and day out,
to say hello to me.
So intelligent
yet so silly,
chasing after fallen leaves and blades of grass.
Lying on the doormat
waiting for me to appear,
and sometimes,
when I do show up,
you stay sprawled right in front of the door,
unwilling to move,
saying,
Go around me –
you have other doors,
because you’re so comfortable.
The white fur on your stomach exposed as you roll around,
hooking your claws in the mat,
scratching,
pulling,
tugging,
brushing up against me,
wandering around the porch,
rubbing up against the box of chalk…
guarding our front porch
against what?
Only you really know,
pacing and nuzzling,
sitting and staring,
claiming this place as your own,
claiming me as your own.
You are my equal.
Sometimes I don’t understand you,
but most times
I just feel contentment and tranquility,
living in the moment, maybe,
having moved on from the past
and not having to worry about the future,
as the dappled sunlight between the leaves shines on your face,
as you close your eyes…
You never really sleep;
you’re just resting,
basking in the sunlight,
sleepy and calm after an exhausting day.
You know how to live –
can you teach the rest of us?

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-28 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Speaker Jason White wants citizens to be able to vote, but not on ‘school choice’",Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/28/jason-white-school-choice-ballot/,Column: Speaker Jason White apparently does not want people to vote on whether public funds should be spent on private schools.,"House Speaker Jason White says he wants to restore the initiative process to allow citizens to place issues on the ballot.
But at the same time, White apparently does not want people to vote on the important issue of whether the state should expand its so-called “school choice” initiatives, which would provide more public funds to private schools.
His positions on two of what he calls his legislative priorities — restoring the initiative process to allow citizens to vote and expanding school choice options — seem to be incompatible.
White, the Republican House Speaker from West, has established a special committee to look at restoring the ballot initiative process, which allows voters to bypass the will of lawmakers and gather signatures to place issues directly on the ballot.
The state Supreme Court ruled Mississippi’s initiative process void in 2021 because it required a designated number of signatures be gathered from five U.S. House districts to place an issue on the ballot. The Supreme Court pointed out the state has had only four districts since 2000, thus the initiative process was invalid, even though other entities in state government are based on the five congressional districts.
Lawmakers vowed to fix the problem and quickly restore the initiative process. They still haven’t, and there’s no sign of any real movement to seek an agreement.
White has said he believes restoring the ballot initiative is important. But apparently he does not want school choice to be placed on the ballot for a vote of the citizens.
The speaker also has formed a special committee to look at expanding Mississippi school choice. The committee is expected to make recommendations before the start of the 2026 legislative session in January.
Though it may seem logical to do so, the committee does not seem interested in recommending a proposal be placed on the ballot to amend the Mississippi Constitution to repeal language that states explicitly that public funds cannot be provided to private schools.
Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution reads in part: “nor shall any funds be appropriated toward the support of any sectarian school, or to any school that at the time of receiving such appropriation is not conducted as a free school.”
That language is stunningly clear and concise, especially compared to some of the convoluted legalese often found in historical governing documents.
Multiple states have language in their constitutions prohibiting public funds from being spent on religious or sectarian schools. The courts have struck down that language, saying religious schools could not be discriminated against. But only the South Carolina Constitution has language similar to Mississippi’s restricting public funds from being spent on any private school — religious or non-religious.
If White and his special committee were serious about expanding the state’s school choice programs, they would start with amending Section 208. That could be done by the Legislature approving the proposal by a two-thirds vote of each chamber and then placing it on the ballot for voters to approve or reject.
Therein is the problem for the pro-voucher, school choice crowd. They know they cannot garner that two-thirds vote in both chambers of the Mississippi Legislature, and furthermore they cannot convince the public to pass such a proposal.
If they thought they could, they already would have placed such a proposal before the Legislature.
Instead, if the Legislature ever passes a proposal expanding school choice to private schools, they are counting on the Mississippi Supreme Court ignoring the plain language of the state constitution and ruling that public funds can be spent on private schools.
Of course, another option would be for the Legislature to finally restore the initiative process in Mississippi and allow voters to place a proposal on the ballot to repeal Section 208 language banning public funds from being spent on private schools.
But that is not likely to happen even if the Legislature restores the ballot initiative, which is also not likely to happen.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/31115625/3X0A0245.jpg,,,2025-09-28 07:56:57.728551

As drought intensifies, depleting water levels are forcing towns to conserve water, harming aquatic ecosystems, and impacting recreational activities

In Berlin, an elder care facility that serves about 150 people saw all of its wells go dry. Now the town — which is getting 50% less water from its own wells — has to jury-rig a system to make sure Berlin Health and Rehabilitation Center stays up and running. 
“I run a fire hose over to their storage tanks,” said Craig Pelletier, the town’s public works supervisor. 
Berlin isn’t alone. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, almost 94% of Vermont is in a severe drought, while almost 24% of the state is in an extreme drought, with Orange County, Windsor County and Rutland County being the most impacted.

Though many residents hoped recent rain would provide relief, any solace will be piecemeal. Rainfall throughout the week of Sept. 21 is “mostly going to be a drop in the bucket,” said Robert Haynes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Burlington. 
After Sept. 28, warm temperatures accompanied with a high pressure system are expected to exacerbate the drought, Haynes said. 
One effect of climate change is that it often leads to a “swing between extremes,” Haynes said. In 2023, Vermont had its wettest summer on record, while this year’s summer has been extremely dry — a huge change in just a matter of two years, he said. 
According to the National Integrated Drought Information System, this past August has been the driest on record in Vermont since 1895.
With scientists predicting that drought will persist in the coming weeks, Vermonters say low water levels around the state are prompting towns to conserve water, affecting aquatic ecosystems, and creating barriers to recreation.
‘It’s just that bad, I guess’ 
In Berlin, one of the town’s four industrial-size wells recently went dry, Pelletier said. He estimates that the town’s overall water production is down by about 50%, he said.
The significant decline in production prompted Pelletier to issue a water conservation notice last week. The town issued the mandatory notice to its approximately 115 connected users, most of which are commercial businesses, Pelletier said. 
“This wasn’t a ‘pretty please’ thing. It was kind of, we need to do this to get through this drought together,” Pelletier said, referring to the notice.

Pelletier is working with state officials and well-drilling companies to see if the town can find a stopgap fix and reach some untapped aquifers underground to keep everyone up and running. 
“They’re drilled really deep. You know, they’re supposed to have plenty of storage — and it’s just that bad, I guess,” Pelletier said. 
Until then, he said, the town is carefully threading the needle. 
Neighboring city Montpelier issued a similar conservation notice on Sept. 18 after water levels in Berlin Pond, the city’s primary water source, dipped below the threshold for conservation. The city asked businesses and residents to cut back on water use and be mindful of when they’re turning on their taps. 
Another Washington County town, Plainfield, issued a conservation notice on Sept. 16. The town gets the majority of its water supply from a number of springs nearby, but those springs haven’t been able to meet the town’s demand in recent months, said Tristan MacGregor-Stewart, the town’s chief water system operator. 
Luckily, the town has a number of backup wells that it’s begun to draw from periodically since August. But pumping water from the wells is more expensive, MacGregor-Stewart said. The notice is a preliminary measure, to start conserving before the town has a big problem, he said.
One of Lunenburg’s fire districts is also under a water conservation notice. “Our water resources are depleted and the daily usage of customers needs to drop immediately,” said the town’s notice from Buddy Ball, the chief water systems operator.  
Since Aug. 22, the state has received 398 reports of drinking water supply shortages or outages, mainly from private homeowners, according to Ben Montross, with the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, who said this is the worst drought he has seen statewide in 12 years. Of those reports, 77% represent shallow groundwater meaning a spring or a dug well, and 20% represent drilled wells.
Residents in Orange County, in the driest part of the state, submitted the most reports, making up 21% of all reported shortages. 
At least five water systems across the state have also reported using alternate sources of water, according to Stephanie Brackin, a spokesperson for the Agency of Natural Resources. Those neighborhoods range in location from Pownal to Newbury. 
It’s possible that more towns and cities are operating under water conservation notices, but municipalities aren’t required to alert state officials when they issue the local warnings, Brackin said. 
In Corinth, an Orange County town that was one of the first in Vermont to see extreme drought conditions, residents are suffering.

People who live in town have been going to the town hall for water because their wells have gone dry, said Martha Brough, the town’s clerk. Margaret Loftus, who owns a farm in town, said she’s heard of people showering in local schools. 
Low water levels 
While sources of drinking water are drying up around Vermont, lakes, rivers, and streams have also been drastically impacted.
“A number of them are recording their lowest value on record,” state climatologist Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux said. 
Vermont is experiencing at least five types of droughts at once, according to Dupigny-Giroux. A meteorological drought, driven by scarce precipitation, has dried out soil and led to agricultural drought. As conditions worsened, lakes, rivers and streams were hit by a hydrological drought, while the impacts on food production and prices pushed the state into a socioeconomic drought.
“A lot of the impacts that we’re seeing were exacerbated by how quickly the summer drought kicked off, which is a flash drought,” Dupigny-Giroux said. The flash drought — a rapid onset drought that deteriorates quickly — began between June and July but then ramped up in August, she added. 
Although Vermont has experienced droughts in the past, what’s unusual this time, Dupigny-Giroux said, is that the state has been experiencing a flash drought coupled with the hydrological drought since last year. 
“I spent most of my life in and around Lake Champlain ever since I was a kid, and I really have not seen water levels like this before,” said Julie Silverman, Lake Champlain lakekeeper with the Conservation Law Foundation. 
During her monitoring activities in the lake, Silverman said she was struggling to paddle to Law Island in Lake Champlain due to the lower water level. “People are actually able to walk to islands and other parts of Lake Champlain that they’ve never really had access to before by foot,” she said.
The fluctuations the lake has experienced between floods and extreme drought impact the entire ecosystem, Silverman said. “These are really dramatic extremes that put a tremendous amount of stress on animals as well as plants.”
“The lake is so low that we’ve lost a lot of shallow water habitat,” said Jason Stockwell, director of the Rubenstein Ecosystem Science Laboratory at the University of Vermont. “The decrease in water level will affect the availability of such habitat for young fish to find food to eat and also to hide from predators.”
As the water level decreases, and the water temperature rises, different species are forced to share a shrinking band of livable habitat, with surface waters too warm and low-oxygen areas at the bottom of the lake expanding, according to Stockwell. 
The phenomenon intensifies competition among species, Stockwell said, leaving fish such as rainbow smelt, which would normally be in cold waters at the bottom of the lake, more vulnerable to predators and exposing spawning sites to anglers, wind storms and waves.
According to Dupigny-Giroux, the state climatologist, collecting data on drought impacts can help determine if Vermont is also going through an ecological drought, in which the landscape changes and cannot be reverted to what it once was. If some streams become permanently dry or some species leave and don’t come back next year, for example, the state would have experienced an ecological drought.
For this reason, Vermont officials encourage people to report drought impacts they notice across the state. 
“Reporting impacts, reporting any observations are so critical for us to be able to piece together all of the parts of this jigsaw,” state climatologist Dupigny-Giroux said.

Limits to recreation
While Vermont’s water bodies run low, Vermonters are seeing their aquatic activities limited around the state. 
In Burlington, “several weeks ago, we actually started to move boats that were in more shallow areas,” said Robert Peterson, the city’s Parks, Recreation and Waterfront’s marina manager.
Peterson said they had to move 10 or 12 boats from Perkins Pier to the Burlington Boathouse Marina, which is deeper, and pull some boats at the Boathouse Marina further back into the water or move them to deeper slips. 
“We’ve certainly had low lake levels before, but just not to this extent and not this early,” he said.
Joe Tyson, state parks regional manager for the Northwest region of Vermont, said park staff have been contacting people with reservations at the park to inform them that, with water levels so low, it may be challenging to access the parks by boat or launch a boat from there, especially with motor boats. 
“At Grand Isle State Park and Burton Island State Park, we proactively reached out to folks to let them know that it’s going to look different this year than it has in the past,” Tyson said.
Victoria Edwards-White, coach of the rowing team at the University of Vermont, said the team generally heads to Lake Champlain from the Lamoille River, but lately they have been facing some challenges due to the low water levels. While the boats used by the athletes aren’t very deep, the coaches drive boats with outboard motors that go deeper into the water, which are needed to reach the athletes in case there are any problems. 
“We’re getting to the point where, if we don’t see any rain in the next few weeks, we are at risk of not being able to operate at all,” Edwards-White said, adding that a lower water level would risk damaging their equipment. 
With low water levels, weeds and reeds are getting stuck in the oars and the engines, Edwards-White said, and the team hasn’t been able to access part of the river because of that.
On other bodies of water around the state, anglers are feeling the impacts of low water levels on their local fishing spots. 
Nick Mahood, who oversees the fly-fishing program at the Woodstock Inn & Resort, said his guides usually lead groups on fishing trips into the Ottauquechee River, the White River and smaller tributaries near Woodstock. But this year’s low water levels have completely changed the game. 
“The water levels are so low, we’ve had to pretty much completely stop any sort of small stream creek fishing for brook trout or native wild trout. That’s been really challenging,” Mahood said. 
His guides no longer consider smaller rivers suitable for fishing, and the program hasn’t been able to fish the Ottauquechee River in the last five or six weeks, Mahood said. 
Fishing for trout is usually a big part of the inn’s program, Mahood said. But when water 
runs low, its temperature rises faster, even in large rivers. 
Trout don’t do well in water above 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and this year, water temps surpassed that marker early in the summer, leaving anglers to fish mostly smallmouth bass in the White River, he said. 
Northeast of Mahood is Bob Shannon, who owns the Fly Rod Shop in Stowe, a business that also takes anglers out on guided trips. In the fall, he mostly books trips to fish brook trout on mountain streams. Usually he takes groups out to Miller Brook, Ranch Brook, Notch Brook and Gold Brook — but this year those streams are so low there isn’t enough water to fish in them.
Shannon has adapted by mostly taking groups to ponds and lakes nearby, but sometimes that isn’t the trip more experienced anglers want — and he’s seen it affect his business. 
“Most of our fly fishing clients would rather fish in moving water on, you know, a beautiful fall foliage stream,” Shannon said.

Rising costs have defined the past six years for Dayna DePalma.
It wasn’t something she thought much about growing up in New Jersey with parents who both worked good jobs, who lived in a beautiful house. But in 2019, while in rehabilitation recovering from a drug addiction, she found out she was pregnant with her daughter. As a single mom, she moved back in with her parents and eventually started working at her child’s day care just so she could get the 50 percent discount that made it affordable. After six months, she left that job for a better one and now works in logistics.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network. 

But it wasn’t until this month, after months of looking for a place to live, that she was finally able to rent her own apartment. Her daughter just started kindergarten. DePalma has been sober for six years.
“Just being a single mom, it’s really hard to have a savings in general. I feel like I live paycheck to paycheck just with basic needs supporting her and myself,” said DePalma, 28.
Costs only keep creeping up, and she’s not sure what comes next. Saving enough to make the move was several years of work. DePalma has no savings, nothing squirreled away for retirement. Homeownership feels like a farfetched dream.
“I just feel like it’s going to be impossible to be able to own a home,” she said. “My anxiety levels have been through the roof regarding money.”
That’s a familiar story for most women these days, not just DePalma. The rising cost of living is squeezing women much more than men, and they report more concern about how they’re going to pay their bills, according to a new 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll.
In every category surveyed — groceries, housing, child care, medical bills and retirement — women are more likely to say they are worried about covering those expenses. About 67% of women said they are worried about the cost of housing, compared with 60 percent of men. More than two-thirds of women are worried about the cost of groceries, while just over half of men are. Among parents, 52% of women are stressed about the cost of child care; 45% of men said the same.
SurveyMonkey conducted this poll online from September 8 to 15 among a national sample of 20,807 U.S. adults, with a modeled error estimate of plus or minus 1.0 percentage points.

In recent months, prices for most necessities have again been rising, and changes from the Trump administration could make affordability more out of reach: Last month saw the largest rise in food prices in nearly three years; costs are up 29 percent from the start of the pandemic. Upcoming cuts to SNAP, the food stamps program, will make accessing benefits that lower that burden even harder. And housing costs, though they are starting to level out from their post-pandemic peak in 2022, are still outpacing inflation. Rising tariffs, which took effect last month, are only expected to worsen both.
The cost of child care is also outpacing inflation, averaging $13,128 annually in 2024, a 29 percent increase from 2020. And medical bills are soon expected to increase for those on Medicaid — the lowest-income Americans — and especially women and children after Congress cut more than $1 trillion from the program over the next decade.
On retirement, a spending package that passed Congress this year will provide a tax break to Americans 65 and older, but it will also make the Social Security trust insolvent by 2032, meaning retired women — the majority of Social Security beneficiaries — could see cuts to their incomes in the coming years.
If Americans are worried, it’s easy to see why. It’s also no mystery why women may be worried even more: Women make the majority of consumer purchases for their families and face rising grocery costs head on. Those costs are going to make it harder to pay for other needs, like rent; women are more likely to be renters, less likely to be homeowners and more likely to be spending over a third of their earnings on housing alone.
If they’re parents of young kids, their other big line-item expense is probably child care, which for those with two or more children now exceeds the cost of the average rent or mortgage in most states. And if child care falls through, women are the ones most likely to have to leave work to stitch together care or leave the labor force altogether. Perhaps they’re missing work because their child is sick. Women are more likely to shoulder health care expenses for kids because they are primary caregivers, while also themselves facing higher health care costs on average because they go to the doctor more frequently for things like prenatal and reproductive care. After all of that is tallied up, what is left for retirement? Thanks to historic inequality, about 30% less than men.

“The shift in who does all the bill paying over the last generation — it’s not just that women do the shopping, they are also frequently the ones handling the mortgage check, paying the credit card bills, definitely looking at the after care bills or the child care bills,” said Mike Madowitz, the principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank.
And while men tend to view the economy more individualistically, women are making decisions across the whole family’s bank account, Madowitz said, while also taking the kids to the doctor and drawing up the grocery list.
“It’s both like women are in fact the accounting department and the manufacturing floor,” he said.
That view into household finances has made it so, historically, women have consistently felt worse about the economy than men. Because they tend to have fewer earnings and more caregiving responsibilities outside the home, they feel the impact of higher costs first.
Women of color feel it most of all.
In the 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll, Latinas, especially, consistently reported higher rates of worry than any other group across nearly all categories except retirement. On groceries, 77% of Latinas reported feeling worried about growing costs, compared with 69% of White women. It was the same for child care (47% versus 28%), housing (77% versus 63%), and medical bills (73% versus 69%).
Black women also had far higher rates than their White counterparts, especially when it came to food and housing costs. Since early this year, Black women’s unemployment rate has been rising far quicker than for other groups, from 5.1% in March to 6.7% in August. It’s currently at its highest rate in four years.
Now, the arrival of higher tariffs on most countries is adding a new stressor to the mix that is already showing up in the inflation data.
“There are things like groceries where we know it’s gonna show up really fast and that’s obviously stressful because you’re seeing it right away, and also you’re seeing it right away in places where it’s not particularly easy to cut your spending,” Madowitz said. “But then there’s all this stuff where it’s not showing up right away, and on some level that also produces anxiety because you’re like, ‘Well, I know this is coming.’”
That feeling of uncertainty has been hanging over Nicole Taetsch and her family of four in New Jersey. Taetsch has her own consulting business focused on marketing and business development, and her husband works with real estate investment properties. They have a 4-year-old and an 8-year-old and make a pretty good living, “and still, it’s tight,” she said.
“Everything post-pandemic has gone up, and then the uncertainty of everything: Costs have never really come down, then tariffs have only added to it. There’s all sorts of different pressures,” said Taetsch, 43.
If they had another child “what would we do?” Taetsch said. “There is nowhere to move in our area. We couldn’t buy anything here.”
Even recently, as she did the kids’ fall shopping at Old Navy, she noticed those prices had increased. The same is true at the grocery store. Taetsch hosts a podcast on parents and politics, and her most recent episode discussed exorbitant grocery prices for healthy food items. It was inspired by a LinkedIn post from food importer Greg Santollo about a bowl of cut fruit at Whole Foods with a $35 price tag.
She and her husband, Taetsch said, “are just very cognizant of the fact that prices are going up, there is absolutely no social safety net, the government isn’t making any policies to help the average American, they are only making it harder through taking away people’s health care, not doing anything to improve our health system, not doing anything to invest in our schools or public education or child care — the things that parents need.”
Taetsch grew up with a single mother and feels like “there is no way that, today, the lifestyle of a single mom raising two kids is anywhere near how my mom was able to raise us.”
For women of her generation, she said, “I feel like the cards are so broadly stacked against us.”

Health security means that we get care that’s effective, competent, quick, and kind—with no more than tiny co-payments and no worry about medical debt. To redeem the promise of plastic insurance cards, health security requires having enough good doctors, dentists, nurses, hospitals, and other caregivers where we need them.   
That doesn’t make health security for all easy to win—just easier than housing, education and job training, global warming, personal and national security, decent living standards, or the other huge challenges we face. Because we already spend enough on health care to get the job done.  
Unfortunately, we won’t get even one step closer to affordable health security for all by nibbling around the edges of the problem. That includes following the well-intentioned but deeply flawed recommendations that the CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Sarah Iselin, set out in a recent CommonWealth Beacon commentary.  
Her proposed remedies are modest. Even so, they are not likely to be implemented. If they were, they would do little good because they don’t attack—or even identify—the causes of high costs, weak access, and caregiver shortages. How can a problem be successfully treated if it isn’t correctly diagnosed?  
Blue Cross’s imaginary world 
Iselin asserts that “Our state has a chance to make big changes in our health care system right now—the kind of transformation that can only come about in a crisis.”  
But who in our state will take that chance? Most politicians mean well but none yet face strong political pressure to fix health care. Our governor wasn’t elected because she knew a lot about health care. Our legislative leadership knows less—apart from a few terrific committee chairs.  And the Health Policy Commission’s two new members are the head of the state hospital association and a drug company executive, each an informed insider who seeks not transformation but simply higher revenue for their sector.  
Many citizens and caregivers are suffering already, but their crisis hasn’t translated into political pressure for serious change.    
When it comes to lobbying in Massachusetts, it’s no surprise that health insurers, hospitals, and others in health care are eight of the top 12 spenders, as reported earlier this year.   
Iselin claims that “We have an excellent track record in our state of collaboration between health plans, clinicians, business, labor, and policymakers.” Sure, but that happy harmony has been lubricated by ever more money each year for business as usual. The throats of that harmonious chorus will go dry after the last remaining dollar is pumped out of the financial aquifer.  
State government has for decades refused to put its arms around health care and understand our cost or access or caregiver problems—or their causes. It did pass a law in 2012 requiring an assessment of needed hospitals and other caregivers, but then simply walked away from implementing that law. So state government still doesn’t know which hospitals are needed, or how many doctors we need or even have. And it has refused to forge the financial and legal tools to sustain needed caregivers. 
Still, it’s encouraging that so many smart and knowledgeable and dedicated people already work in health care in state government and elsewhere. They will be able to help fix our health care, once the people at the top face political pressure to get serious.  
For now, though, we have good reason to worry. Many insured people couldn’t afford out-of-pocket costs of needed care before the cuts from Trump’s big tax and spending bill. About a dozen million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage owing to the budget bill. Up to another dozen million could lose Affordable Care Act coverage if Congress refuses to extend Biden’s extra subsidies, which expire in December.  
Most Massachusetts hospitals are already losing money. Many nursing homes are in bad financial shape. Many people—even with insurance through the job—can’t find a family doctor who takes new patients.  Or afford high deductibles and co-pays and co-insurance.

Bad as this is, it isn’t the crisis. It’s the storm clouds and heavy rain that precede the hurricane. The health care crisis is probably a few years away—when Congress does something drastic—like freezing all federal health spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and ACA subsidies.   
Why might Congress do that? Because it will face a massive federal budget crisis—one fueled by international tensions, reckless tax cuts, a $2 trillion deficit in good economic times, discord between two dysfunctional political parties, and the many competing demands for public dollars.   
That very real crisis could politically galvanize health care reform, but sudden pressure for change will be worthless without advance preparation.   
The remedies advanced today don’t help us prepare.   
Iselin bemoans higher costs for medical care and medications, and the high share of our citizens who delay care owing to its cost.  
One of her proposed remedies is greater reliance on value-based payment. This is tied to rewarding health outcomes, not volumes of care. Both notions have been wildly oversold. They simply haven’t saved any serious money, as both the Congressional Budget Office and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have finally admitted.  
One big reason value-based payment doesn’t work is that payers find it very hard to devise trustworthy ways to measure the value of doctors’, hospitals’, and other caregivers’ services. Especially since the caregivers control the evidence and can game the payment method if they wish. Financially incentivizing caregivers to pursue “value” induces them to think more and more intensely about ways to maximize their own incomes and less about us as patients. For-profit Medicare Advantage plans respond the same way.   
More important, high volumes of care aren’t America’s problem. Doctor visits here are only 60 percent of the average across all rich democracies, and hospital admissions are 80 percent of that average. 
Care volumes are low here partly because high out-of-pocket payments deter many of us from seeking care. But the high out-of-pocket costs have been fostered by federal and state policies that try to turn American patients into kamikaze pilots in the war against high health care costs.  
Relying on patients—the least powerful and least informed group in the health care universe—to shop wisely for health care is a sick joke. It’s wrong to rely on suppressing access to care as a main cost control technique. Doing so manifests public and private payers’ unseriousness about cost control. And their stunted empathy for people who can’t afford high out-of-pocket costs.   
Another proposed remedy is finally enforcing the state’s “benchmark” for spending increases. In 2012, the Legislature created the Health Policy Commission and charged it with setting a yearly benchmark for the percentage rise in health care spending. But the HPC’s statutory authority is feeble. It took years, after the fact, to even try to recoup heavy overspending by Mass General Brigham. With health care spending increases widely disseminated, enforcing the benchmark on dozens of hospitals and others would be an administrative and legal nightmare.  
Other proposals call for a medication affordability board, hospital price controls, shifting surgery to allegedly cheaper ambulatory surgery centers, greater emphasis on primary care, and finding ways to ensure that for-profit groups like Steward play nicely.  
Yes, negotiating affordable drug prices is a good idea. But do individual states have the willingness, the buying power, or the political support to leverage lower prices?   
Even federal action on drug prices has been feeble. It took two decades for Congress to require Medicare to negotiate prices for its 10 costliest drugs. But the resulting prices remain almost triple the Western European average. There’s still little political will to take on the drug makers.   
Only one state has acted effectively to rein in hospital spending. Step by step, over five decades, Maryland has established a small, uniquely powerful and experienced state agency to set adequate budgets for all needed hospitals.   
This requires learning which hospitals and which services are actually needed, and how much it should cost to efficiently deliver care. Politically, the Maryland arrangement was possible partly because hospital trustees—who cared about their hospitals but also about costs of health insurance—controlled the state hospital association. A few other states have been taking baby steps to follow Maryland, but Trump may stop them in their tracks.   
Also, in response to Maryland’s success in slowing hospital spending, considerable care has been shifted from hospitals to ambulatory surgery centers. This doesn’t save money—it simply sorts the dollars into different boxes. Worse, ambulatory surgical centers have very high profits and underserve Medicaid patients. The lesson? Individual reforms must be coordinated.   
Primary care? It’s been like the weather: Everyone talks about it, but no one does anything real about it. A big reason is that no one is accountable for making sure we have enough primary caregivers to serve all 7 million Massachusetts residents. Not Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, or other payers. Not medical schools. Not teaching hospitals that train residents. And not state government.   
Sadly, reforming for-profit hospitals or insurance companies simply isn’t possible. The problem isn’t Steward, its deleterious and disgraced former CEO, or private equity. Focusing on them is like the French army preparing to fight the last war. Complete market failure in health care means we can’t trust greedy profit-seeking to give us the innovation, efficiency, and cost-cutting—or the provision of needed and effective care—that real markets would deliver.  
The real world 
US health spending this year will be $5.6 trillion. That’s six times defense spending and triple all education spending. In Massachusetts, health care spending this year will total about $140 billion, or roughly $20,000 per person—about one-third above the US average.   
This should be enough to pay for the care that works for all of us who need it. Most of the world’s other rich democracies have worked this out. We can, too.  
Massachusetts and US health care have become financially addicted to more money each year to finance business as usual. The grave health care crisis—the actual hurricane—will arrive when the new money stops flowing. The freeze in federal health spending, mentioned earlier, is one of the possible sparks for explosive changes. It will threaten caregiver bankruptcies and much greater suppression of needed patient care.

The first response by hospitals, doctors, and drug makers to the freeze will be to try to raise the prices they get from insurance companies, money supplied by the employers who pay insurers’ bills. But with family premiums already over $30,000 yearly, private employers and also state and local governments will say no to higher prices.  
Their second response, discussed shortly, will be very different.   
But why isn’t current spending enough? Because up to half of what we spend on health care is wasted.  

On care that isn’t effective or isn’t needed or has enormous cost but low clinical value. Or that lacks continuity and coordination owing to shortages of primary care and the loss of lower-cost community hospitals.  


On vast paperwork that stems from deep mistrust between payers and caregivers—and the resulting upcoding, downcoding, prior authorization denials, and litigation—and from the astonishing complexity of coverage and error-prone bill-paying.  


On very high prices for needed drugs, devices, and other things. (Americans are 4 percent of the world’s people but we give the world’s drug makers 50 percent of their worldwide revenue, and an even greater share of their profits. That’s not affordable and it’s not right.)  


And on outright theft. Complex payment methods, market thinking that applauds greed, belief that health care theft is a victimless crime, and short-handed prosecutors who negotiate no-contest plea deals all help sustain theft.  

Overall, we waste so much because we rely on free market competition to contain cost and on government action to regulate our way out of problems. Neither works. 
The conclusion that competitive free market simply does not work in health care is a pragmatic assessment, not an ideological one. (I think free markets are a good idea, where they actually exist.) Not one of the seven requirements for a genuine free market is—or can be—remotely well-satisfied in health care. 
Market failure means that we don’t get innovation, lower costs, or the care we need and pay for. But we waste time and effort by trying to shoehorn size-12 health care realities to fit into size-5 market fantasies. This is a bipartisan problem. Both Democrats and Republicans talk about anti-trust suits against hospital mergers but neither does much. Both parties push caregivers to post prices on web sites, but the numbers are generally useless—and unused.   
At the same time, government’s energies have been diverted into trying to regulate to clean up the many messes that the failed market leaves in its wake. It acts like the worker with the wheelbarrow and shovel who follows the circus parade.  
Steward is the latest acute example. The state’s cost benchmarks’ failure to limit spending is a chronic example. Low-quality nursing home care is a third. Widely disseminated theft in health care is a fourth. Governments write regulations that are hard to enforce; failed enforcement undermines confidence in competent public action.  
Failed markets and incompetent government mean health care anarchy. Anarchy means weak accountability for financial coverage, for actual access to care, for cost control, or for securing the right doctors, hospitals, and other caregivers in the right places.  It means more waste.   
In a few years, the explosive health care financial crisis will provide the energy to blast loose most of the vast dollars now wasted inside Massachusetts and US health care.  
Hospitals and doctors will support reform when their alternative is bankruptcy or deep income cuts. Patients will support reforms that guarantee needed care that’s affordable. Employers will finally recognize that they can’t rein in their own costs. Politicians will try to catch up.  
Real reform requires crafting an alternative to markets that can’t work. And to traditional reactive government regulations that can’t work. We can look at the arrangements prevailing in most of the world’s other rich democracies—nations that successfully, though not perfectly, protect all their people, give more health care, spend one-half as much per person, and live longer.  
Here’s what that would mean.  
First, an insurance card for each person, one requiring no more than nominal out-of-pocket payments. Back the cards financially with the dollars already available. Give up on trying to save money by suppressing patients’ use of care by making out-of-pocket burdens unaffordable or doctor appointments unavailable or waits for mental health care intolerable.  
Second, redeem the plastic cards clinically with adequately financed budgets for needed hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and other institutions. And for the right types and numbers of doctors in the right places. If we want more primary care doctors, we have a choice between drafting them and paying them more money.  Much more.  And slashing their paperwork.  And supporting them with NPs and PAs.   
This means careful public action to identify needed caregivers and pay them enough to finance efficient delivery of needed care. It also means paying caregivers in ways that allow us to trust them to spend our huge but finite dollars effectively, equitably, and frugally. That’s a tall order.    
Third, a yearly cap on national and state-level health care spending. This means putting health care on a budget. Making that work requires caregivers and managers who are accountable for spending our vast—but inevitably finite—health care dollars as well as possible.  
The first three actions require strategic legislation. Making the big strategic decisions well can set health care on a path to affordable self-regulation by caregivers. If governments don’t make the big decisions well, they will be pressured to continue to make lots of micro regulatory decisions. It will remain impossible to make those competently or efficiently. Or enforce them. 
Fourth, recognize that free markets and government regulatory micro-management don’t and can’t work in health care. The resulting anarchy means that no one is accountable for ensuring good care for all people, containing cost, or sustaining the right caregivers in the right places.   
To assure good and affordable care for all—to balance access and cost—there’s probably only one workable alternative to failed markets and incompetent government regulatory micro-management.  
It turns out that individual doctors’ decisions about how to diagnose and treat us control and spend almost 90 cents on the health care dollar. So we have to put our money in doctors’ hands under arrangements that allow us to trust them to spend it as well as possible—to do as much clinical and human good as possible.  
That means paying doctors well, but in financially neutral ways that don’t incentivize them to give unneeded care or deny valuable care. This means seeing physicians as fiduciaries, not MBAs. It probably means salaries (large ones) for doctors working in hospitals and other trustworthy arrangements for doctors working in ambulatory care.  
Greater physician altruism will help. So will a simple bargain: Doctors, we will get rid of almost all of your payment-related paperwork, including prior authorizations. And we will even end medical malpractice suits—and craft alternative ways to compensate patients who are harmed by bad care. But only if you agree to serve as clinical and financial fiduciaries for your patients.  
Doctors’ better decisions will weed out clinical waste. Especially when supported by hospital trustees and managers who also act as fiduciaries—helping doctors get as much clinical value as possible for patients out of finite hospital budgets. That will require making better evidence available on effective and affordable ways to diagnose and treat illnesses and injuries.   
Paying doctors and hospitals in simple and trustworthy ways will slash administrative waste.  
Capping drug prices or negotiating deals with drug makers will make needed meds affordable for all. This can be matched with big dollar prizes for competing labs that develop effective and safe new meds.   
Simplifying the flows of money inside health care will cut opportunities for theft. Health care theft and fraud are not impulsive. They are calculated. Catching more crooks and imposing serious jail time on those who steal will help deter further crime. Capping spending will make it clear to everyone that theft kills. This will spur more whistle-blowers to come forward.  
Fifth, since market failure means that profit-seeking isn’t legitimate, outlaw for-profit caregivers and insurance companies. Buy up owners’ equity by floating 20-year bonds.  
You may not think a crisis is coming. You might be right.  
US and Massachusetts health care might continue to muddle through. Some hospitals will close; others will lay off nurses and other workers. And cut money-losing services. ER delays will grow. Access to care will get a little worse each year. More paperwork and private insurance companies’ denial of care will drive us a little crazier each year, but only slowly. AI will automate the job of making us crazy. Employers will boost out-of-pocket costs to slow premium increases. Anxious not to upset organized lobbies of caregivers, drug makers, and insurance companies, politicians will continue to do as little as possible.  
But you might be wrong. If a grave crisis does arrive, and political pressure for reform becomes irresistible, will we know what to do? It’s a bad idea to defer sewing parachutes until the plane’s engine has stopped.   


The best insurance policy we could craft for our health care is to begin right now to plan what to do if the crisis hits. Crisis means an opportunity to fix all that’s wrong with our health care. But only if we prepare in detail.   
Broad and deep planning is vital because health care itself is so complicated—and because reform is even more complicated. Also because it’s essential to minimize disruption to patient care and to conserve the valuable and intricately organized networks of caregivers we rely on.   
The premium for this policy would cost a few million dollars yearly for five years or so. That  money would establish a state government office to plan the responses to the many challenges that a health care financial crisis will present. Some of the jobs entail preparing state government to make essential strategic decisions. Others involve orienting doctors and other caregivers toward balancing the financial and clinical books—the pressures to care for all citizens of Massachusetts effectively, equitably, and efficiently—with the vast but finite dollars available.   
Some of the individual jobs include:  

Sustaining the flow of revenue into health care, to protect access and to keep all needed hospitals, doctors, dentists, nursing homes, hospices, and other caregivers out of bankruptcy 


Assessing the current availability and locations of care—from hospitals, doctors, dentists, nurses, nursing homes, mental health, and other caregivers 


Learning how much hospital inpatient capacity we require, where it should be located, and how much it should cost to deliver efficiently  


Learning which types of doctors we need, how many, and in which locations 


Designing ways to fill gaps between current capacity and need—and of implementing those designs  


Starting today to rapidly rebuild primary care capacity—and also dental care capacity 


Learning how to cap cost of care at affordable levels—and securing revenue commensurate with that cost  


Crafting ways to pay doctors, hospitals, and other caregivers that are financially neutral, adequate to keep caregivers reasonably happy, simple to administer, and affordable to all of us to provide the money 


Promoting an altruistic and fiduciary outlook for all caregivers 


Designing a financial-clinical-political deal with caregivers, one that lifts today’s oppressive and time-consuming administrative burdens, pays them well, and liberates them to spend our health care dollars to do as much good as possible 


Addressing prescription drug prices and incentivizing development of valuable new meds 


Assuring worried patients that health care is working for them—since pathology is remorseless but resources are always finite, how to build citizens’ trust—such that the only reason one patient doesn’t get certain costly care is to liberate doctors’ time and hospitals’ nurses and dollars to deliver care that’s more valuable?  


Developing ways to identify and respond to problems and complaints from patients, caregivers, payers, and politicians 


Integrating the pieces so they fit by developing timelines for each activity and coordinating revenue, budgets and other caregiver payments, access and equity and quality of care.  

Affordable high-quality health care for all of us should be the easiest aim to attain because we already spend enough.  Nations that are realistic about health care—and that don’t tolerate wasting one-half of their health care spending—cope continuously with the challenges a deep crisis would mean. It’s time Massachusetts state government took those challenges seriously. It’s time to begin to organize the efforts of the many competent and smart people working in and out of state government to plan to respond to the crisis—if, or when, it hits.  
The alternative will be to accept that a health care crisis would hit us like a Pearl Harbor attack—unready to respond.   
Preparing to fix health care will help us win a victory for compassion and competence—one that will liberate money and attention to address the tougher problems that confront us.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-28 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,This Ukrainian family fled war in Odesa and found a foothold in CT,Shahrzad Rasekh,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/28/ct-ukraine-odesa/,Evgenia Natsevych fled Ukraine with her family in October 2022. A twisting path brought them to Connecticut more than a year later.,"On a cold, rainy day in late March, Evgenia Natsevych lifted her daughter Angelina, allowing the 7-year-old to peer through the waiting room window of a New Haven dentist’s office. 
“I want her to see the ocean,” she said, pointing to Long Island Sound. “We had the sea in Odesa.”
Angelina began experiencing tooth pain in the days leading up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Three years later, her mother was finally able to get her care through Connecticut’s Medicaid insurance, known as HUSKY.
Caught in the whirlwinds of war and migration, Evgenia and her family are just a few of the 120,000 Ukrainians who arrived in the U.S. through a program known as Uniting for Ukraine (U4U). Created under the Biden administration, the program has been paused indefinitely by the Trump administration. As the intensity of the war escalates, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Ukrainians to seek refuge in the U.S.
Evgenia’s story, like many Ukrainians’, transcends borders. The war opened up her family photo album and scattered its pages. 

As Evgenia resettled in the U.S. on October 2022 with her husband and children, her mother and stepbrother resettled in Germany. Her father and stepfather remained in Ukraine. Her father is his ill wife’s caregiver, and her stepfather is a hospital director and a first responder to airstrikes.
It was in the midst of these changes and the uncertainty of their family’s residency status that Evgenia and her husband Vitalii finally began to find steadiness — in Connecticut.

War at home
In the early morning of Feb. 24, 2022, Evgenia was sleeping with her 3-year-old daughter Emma in their home in Odesa, Ukraine, when she was woken by a loud noise. She called her husband Vitalii out of bed. 
“It’s a firework,” she recalled him saying. Moments later, as they stood in front of their bedroom window, a missile flew by, close enough for them to discern its shape. Then the sky went white with another bang. 
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine had begun.
Later that morning, Evgenia’s phone glowed with messages pouring in from the WhatsApp group chat for Angelina’s nursery.
“Is anyone going to day care today?” asked one mom. “We are operating as usual,” answered a teacher.
Evgenia and Vitalii’s home had no basement, and it was near a military station, which they worried would be a target. They decided to leave. 
“I had one hour to pack everything. So I got my plant, I got my camera or something like that, a few books, and that’s it,” Evgenia said. “We didn’t realize what’s going on. We thought we would just take some stuff, but it’s not forever.”
It was one of many moments, at the time and since, that residents of Odesa have had to weigh whether to leave. And it wasn’t a clear call.
Just a few evenings earlier, Evgenia’s university friend Julia Abramova had come over for dinner. They prepared burgers, and Julia had sat between Evgenia’s two daughters, little Emma and Angelina, whom she adored. 
As Evgenia was considering her options, Julia was panicking, pacing around her apartment. After a few hours of indecision, she began throwing things into a suitcase. “It’s hard when you can see all of your life in one luggage,” Julia said. 
Ultimately, Julia decided to remain in Odesa — and she’s still there, living through the frequent drone strikes that have only grown in number. She and Evgenia haven’t seen each other since that evening they made dinner together.

Evgenia documented her thoughts on social media as she and her family made the drive north to her inlaws’ house. “We took the most valuable thing — the children,” she said in one Instagram story. “There are many other pieces of life left.” 
Those physical remnants of memories can’t be replaced: her late grandmother’s strawberry plants and tulips, which Evgenia had planted in her home. Or the piano, which she had had shipped across the country after her grandmother’s death so her daughters could learn to play. 
“What if I don’t come back,” she continued in the social media story. “Or there’s nowhere to come back to.”
The family thought they’d be safer with Vitalii’s parents, farther north in Ukraine. But soon after they arrived, they discovered they were just over a dozen miles from the Kyiv battle lines, where Russian and Ukrainian forces were fighting for control of the capital. By the third day of the invasion, the house shook and sirens wailed. 
The three generations took shelter in the unfinished basement, where Evgenia continued to work remotely as a marketing manager. Then she began to develop sensitivity to certain odors. She was pregnant. 
“Oh god,” she thought. “Why now?”
Evgenia’s belly grew as Russia’s military bombed hospitals and maternity wards. She read reports of pregnant women moved to hospital basements and didn’t want to become one of them.
“I decided that I have to go out (of the country) somewhere, at least to have my baby. Because I was scared.” She left for Chemnitz, Germany, with her mother and daughters, while Vitalii stayed in Ukraine. He had no choice. 
Ukraine had already mobilized its men of fighting age, but fathers of more than two young children were exempt. This baby would be the couple’s third.
After two months of trying, Vitalii was able to leave and join his family in Germany. They then connected with a university professor in Arkansas named Ken Olree, whose church helped a number of Ukrainian families through the U4U program.

At the edge
Like countless other Ukrainians, Evgenia and her family thought their stay in the U.S. would be temporary. 
“I was living the wonderful life in the house of my dreams,” said Evgenia of her life in Ukraine. Three years later, the war shows no signs of stopping, and Russia continues to pummel Ukraine with ever-increasing drone attacks.
The third most populated city in Ukraine, Odesa is a seaside city known for its architectural heritage and its inhabitants’ distinct sense of humor. Its historic downtown is peppered with lush parks, coffee shops with bustling terraces, boutiques and rooftop restaurants with unobstructed views of the Black Sea.
The city’s proximity to Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014, and the magnitude of its port make it a target for Russian airstrikes. While Ukraine’s air attack alert system can successfully warn civilians of an impending air strike in places like Kyiv, drones can cross the distance to Odesa fast enough to leave little to no time for cover.
The port, near the city’s historic center, was where Evgenia and her husband dated, got engaged, and were married soon afterwards. Today, it is closed to the public, partially burned and damaged by strikes.
Evgenia had bathed in the sea’s calm waters during her first pregnancy and later would take leisurely walks by the water on workday lunch breaks. “It felt like the sea was where we drew strength,” she said.
Just months after her family’s emigration, sea mines, both Russian and Ukrainian, forced Odesa to close its coast for some time after a few swimmers died from explosions.

The seashore was also where Evgenia would go on walks with Julia, who works for a maritime employment agency, and where they had partied as single women, dancing at the upscale Ibiza Beach Club. 
Strolling through Odesa’s Lanzheron Beach on a warm Sunday in June, Julia thought back to the time she had spent there with her friend, tears gliding down her cheeks as she recalled when they’d lived mere minutes apart. Life in Odesa had changed so much since that time.
Now the days were punctuated with air alerts signaling potential incoming drones. Even a visit to the mall could turn into a waiting game, as it had for some the day before. Shoppers filed down escalators to the basement-level parking garage, standing among cars as they waited for threats to subside.
A robotic voice announced the all-clear through the mall’s loudspeakers, and shoppers quickly lined back up outside stores, waiting for the security gates to lift. Outside, people resumed evening walks and happy hour chats on restaurant terraces. It was like pressing “play” on a paused movie.
Just hours later, a Russian drone struck a high rise across town. Alarms wailed on and off into the early morning.

But the new day brought renewed energy. Children splashed around in the waves, the water’s green tint a reminder of ecological warfare resulting in algae. Elderly women chatted on lawn chairs, basking in the sun. A man sporting a bandage down his arm pushed a wounded friend through the sand, his leg propped up on his wheelchair. 
The whiplash between the mental toll of Russia’s psychological warfare and residents’ grasp on a ‘normal’ life was palpable.
Russia’s invasion, Julia said, made her “realize that life will never be the same.” By the time she had calmed down that first morning, the military activity made it too risky to leave the city. She decided to stay in Ukraine to be near her parents, even as her friends left the country one by one.
The last time Julia saw Evgenia, in early 2022, she had two cheery toddlers. “I don’t really know when I will feel or touch them, hug them,” Julia said in June. Now, Angelina is 7, Emma is 5, and Olivia, whom Julia never met, is 2. Evgenia is 38.

Resettling
Olree picked up the family in October 2022 and welcomed them into an extra home he owned in Searcy, Ark. The house was furnished, there were clothes for them, and the refrigerator was stocked with food. 
“He’s our angel,” said Evgenia.
She gave birth to their third child, baby Olivia, soon after, and Vitalii began looking for a job. (Under the U4U program, Ukrainians received humanitarian parole, which automatically grants the right to apply for work authorization.)
The main challenge in his job search was the language barrier because his English wasn’t strong. Back in Ukraine, Vitalii had worked for the same food company for 10 years, where he was a regional manager, and had dozens of people reporting to him. In Arkansas, he settled for changing tires.
Believing they would soon return to Ukraine, the family left Arkansas after three months to see more of the country before returning home. For more than a year, they lived in Florida — alternating between a rental home belonging to an acquaintance of Evgenia’s in Delray Beach and a hotel when the rental was occupied. 
They were still hoping for the war to subside so they could return to Odesa. “We see the war getting worse. And I tell my husband we have to stay,” Evgenia said.
 
 

Evgenia cleaned houses to earn an income. 
After a few months, the couple began looking for a home to rent more permanently. But they didn’t have a credit score, among other standard requirements for housing applicants in the U.S.
“I was trying to find something. They said, ‘No, no, no, no, no, no.’” Eventually, one Russian-American couple responded to her husband’s Facebook message on a housing post in Lake Worth, Fla. 
“She says, ‘We don’t need any documents. We want to help you.’ So we got house, we rented it. So the house was very bad, very bad with cockroaches, with mice, rats. Living in a zoo, but it was a house. I was not homeless anymore. At least I was happy.”
The house was a small source of relief from the violence and heartbreak they were following from afar. “I missed home. I was watching all (the) Ukrainian news, every bomb, every house, and they killed a lot of kids. I was crying all the time,” Evgenia said.
To stay afloat, the couple picked up odd jobs, with Evgenia eventually cooking in a daycare and Vitalii working as a handyman. Then one day, a job listing in Evgenia’s Telegram app stood out. It was for a sales manager at a food company in Connecticut.
“I immediately call them and say, I have my husband. He was a top manager in Ukraine. He’s very good in sales. He knows everything. Your company will benefit.”
Vitalii got the job, and the family of five moved to New Haven. It was February 2024, two years after Evgenia fled her homeland.

Stability in New England
In Connecticut, the family began to find their footing. 
They fulfilled their dream of purchasing an RV, which they found discounted on Facebook. That allowed them to make summer road trips to places like Hammonasset State Park and Cape Cod. “This would have been great when we were homeless,” said Evgenia, pointing to the camper parked in their backyard, near a small trampoline for the girls.
Their sun-drenched home in New Haven’s Amity neighborhood echoed with the girls’ joyful squeals as they chased each other. Their drawings, taped to the walls, brought life to the kitchen. Outside, a white picket fence.
Their living room was decorated with hints of their heritage, and a Ukrainian flag hung proudly in the window. Back in Ukraine, Evgenia said, “We didn’t need to think about identity. We just were there.”
Being removed from their homeland pushed Evgenia, Vitalii and their three children to seek out others in the diaspora. 
“We met a lot of Ukrainian people and Ukrainian Americans who were born here,” she said, “but they keep the traditions.” She began studying Ukrainian embroidery and architecture. “I understood that it’s important. I want to know it, and when I know it, I can share it with my kids.”
The eldest, Angelina, now speaks English, but her mother says she struggled through kindergarten and first grade. “I was sad about that, because I feel like she’s stressed all the time.” Her limited grasp on language impacted her confidence. “She didn’t understand English, and it was hard for her,” Evgenia said. “She’s good in math because math, you don’t need English for that.”
Beyond raising three daughters and working as a home aide for the elderly and people with autism, Evgenia took on the role of art director for an event organized by the New Haven Ukrainian American Humanitarian Aid Fund. Tapping into her past experience working at an art gallery, Evgenia named, priced, and categorized the pieces that will be sold at the Wounds to Wonders event on Oct. 26.

The event will take place in St. Michael the Archangel Ukrainian Catholic Church, the same church where Angelina recently received her First Communion, and where the family attended events as some of New Haven’s newest community members. 
As the weather warmed up last summer, Evgenia began to take the girls on highly anticipated trips to beaches along the shoreline. On one excursion in mid-August, the girls splashed in Long Island Sound’s gentle waves. Later, they took turns on the swings and shrieked as they played with other children in Lighthouse Point Park’s splash pad in New Haven.
Summer was coming to a close, and so was their chapter in Connecticut.
On Sept. 9, the family made one more move, leaving New Haven for Duncan, South Carolina, where Vitalii took on a new role in his company. 
The plan was for Evgenia to stay back with her daughters for the academic year, as they had gotten off the wait list for their desired schools. But when Evgenia’s car was stolen in front of their home in August, she decided the family should stick together.
“I will always be grateful for Connecticut and for the people there, and I think [Connecticut] is the best,” Evgenia said. “I could get a counselor from CIRI or from IRIS, they’d help me,” she said, referring to two refugee resettlement organizations whose services made her feel supported during her move to Connecticut. Evgenia placed her children in IRIS’ summer program during their first summer in New Haven.

Both CIRI and IRIS have been forced to cut back on the services they offer following funding freezes by the Trump administration, and more recent refugees to Connecticut can no longer access the type of help that was available to Evgenia and her family.
The status of Ukrainians across the U.S. remains in limbo following the pause on the U4U program. And high-profile meetings between President Donald Trump, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin have failed to bring about a solution to the conflict. That has left Ukrainians at home and abroad in a holding pattern. 
Evgenia is taking life day by day, but amid the precarity of her family’s situation, she is certain of one thing: “Connecticut gave us jobs, insurance, school, and community,” she said. “Connecticut saved me.”

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Not long ago, I was haunting the alleys downtown and noting all the infrastructure you don’t see from the storefronts. The utility poles and power lines and electric meters reminded me of the work of R. Crumb, the underground cartoonist most famous for the anthropomorphic, sexually charged “Fritz the Cat” comics. It wasn’t an oversexed feline I was thinking about but Crumb’s urban drawings, especially “The History of America,” that render in painful detail the things we have trained ourselves not to see, such as the web of power lines strung from utility poles overhead.
One alley in the center of Emporia is packed with such infrastructure, including “One Way” and “Do Not Enter” signs and Dumpsters and pooled rainwater and about a billion feathers from the pigeons that make their homes in the nooks of the surrounding multi-story buildings. I don’t know why, but I find the feathers particularly repulsive. It’s not that there’s a particular problem in my hometown with the birds, not more than any other downtown, or that the alley is filthy or otherwise unclean. The feathers just get to me like some things get to others — like knife on glass or listening to the president trying to pronounce “acetaminophen.”
We all have something that makes us cringe.
I was thinking about these things that drive us individually or collectively to distraction, and it occurred to me the alley was a metaphor for our current political landscape. Behind the marquees of either party, past the storefronts jammed with tired slogans, past the back rooms where the real work is done, either with cigar-smoke influence or cold hard cash, there’s the alley of American political life. This is where the absurd and the unpredictable occur, the place where drunken shouting matches take place, the band smokes reefer and you notice all the hidden things that keep the whole show powered, except it isn’t electricity moving through those lines overhead.
The power that moves through our political high-tension wires is made of money and attention. The money is like volts and the attention is like current. You can’t have one without the other, at least not when there’s flow in the line. There’s nearly an unlimited supply of volts available, thanks to Citizens United, but the amperage is driven by how many eyeballs and ears are on a particular post or podcast or television program.
Right now, an incredible amount of wattage flows through our political infrastructure, enough to make your hair stand on end if you get too close to one of those lines. Say the wrong thing — which in some cases is simply stating a truth — and you might get zapped with a billion watts of blind outrage. Here in Kansas, MAGA toadies have called for the firings of state employees over social media posts. The First Amendment insulation has frayed under the stress to the point where a reasonable citizen might question how much, if any, speech is safe.
We’ve experienced strain on the system before, most recently in the 1960s, and we eventually strengthened the political infrastructure. Some of that super-duty equipment included the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Both were pillars of the modern civil rights movement. The former outlaws discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The latter prohibits racial discrimination in voting, including racial gerrymandering, but it has been gutted by the U.S. Supreme Court through the past 12 years.
We are now in territory that would have been unrecognizable to most Americans just a few years ago. Even though some of us could see it on the horizon, we have arrived in a new country with unexpected urgency, accompanied by political violence. The latest to die, of course, was a 31-year-old MAGA ally, shot Sept. 10 in Utah. Other political assassinations include a former Minnesota speaker of the house, a Democrat, and her husband, in June. These deaths are tragic. I will not attempt to describe the political beliefs of either Charlie Kirk or Melissa Hortman. No postmortem commentary should add or detract a whit of what they had to say in life.
When bullets silence speech, democracy is in grave peril. It was already in trouble, considering the rush to authoritarianism and the repeated stumbles of Democrats, but on this month an American tradition was made new again. Political violence is a habit we must break, or it will surely break us.
My earliest media memories are television coverage of assassinations in the 1960s. I felt the fear radiating from my parents and other adults as television beamed into our living rooms news of the assassinations of a president, a civil rights leader, and a presidential nominee. John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Robert F. Kennedy. There were more. The killing of revolutionary Black separatist Malcolm X, the attempted assassination of presidential hopeful and white segregationist George Wallace, the executions of Mississippi Freedom Riders Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner.
We are at another turning point in American history at which we must ask: What now? How much more can we endure? Where is the country we once knew?
No matter our discomfort, we must not surrender to whatever heated inclination to mayhem may surge through us. No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, a violent response would power more violence. There’s been a lot of talk in the wake of the shooting earlier this month that political violence is never the answer. That, of course, is the only proper reaction. What also needs to be said is that retaliation for political violence is not the answer, either.
While the manhunt was still ongoing for the Kirk shooter, the president was quick to blame political enemies for the shooting. He declared Kirk a martyr and promised a national crackdown on political violence, including nonprofits and others he accuses of funding organizations that support it. Since that declaration, Trump suggested some broadcasters should have their licenses revoked for engaging in speech critical of his administration.
A TV talk show host, Jimmy Kimmel, was suspended by Disney-owned ABC for his remarks on the Kirk killing. The Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, had said Kimmel should be suspended and “we could do it the easy way or the hard way.” The threat of regulatory action was clear. Kimmel has since been reinstated by ABC to a surge in ratings, although the program was still boycotted by the Nexstar and Sinclair station groups, effectively removing Kimmel from about 20% of markets. In his returning monologue, Kimmel called the censorship threat by the FCC chair “un-American” while tearfully mourning the loss of Kirk as someone whose life was cut short.
Freedom of speech is among the foundational principles of the American experiment in democracy. It goes all the way back to before we were a nation, to when colonial printer John Peter Zenger’s newspapers were burned by the governor of New York in 1734. But the Kimmel case may be the most high-profile modern example since police raided a small-town newspaper two years ago — here in Kansas.
The Kimmel firing also appears to be a textbook case of censorship, when a government official (in this case, the president and his FCC chair) attempt to suppress speech based on content. This is prohibited by the First Amendment. From the president all the way down to your town council and school officials, the law is meant to restrain government actors from trampling your expression.
But as troubling as the government suppression of speech is, there’s a related stifling of expression we must now talk about. It’s self-censorship. If you’ve caught yourself thinking twice before sharing your political views with others, you’re suffering the chilling effect of political violence and the government’s retaliatory crackdown on dissent. You may not be suffering immediate effects, such as the loss of a job, but there is a cumulative risk, like secondhand smoke.
Back when I was a student journalist, I once had a piece of mine challenged at the last minute because a school official thought it was obscene. In those days I briefly drew a comic strip for the campus newspaper at a public university in Kansas. I was heavily influenced by Doonesbury and other, less mainstream comics, and it was the second or third installment of the strip. It involved somebody asking where the nearest bathroom was on campus and a communication major being unable to answer the question clearly. By the end of the strip, the character doing the asking was turning into a kind of human pretzel to keep it all in.
Not great stuff. Did I mention I was still a teenager?
But when the newspaper sent the pages to the printer on campus, a question arose. Somebody thought the strip was obscene. They imagined they saw an exposed private part in the drawing. A dean was alerted and I was summoned to the print shop. I never did see what the shop supervisor thought he saw. But I remember how uncomfortable it was to stand in a group of older adults — of authority figures — and try to explain there was no penis in the cartoon.
It didn’t matter, they said, they weren’t running it unless I changed it.
I was handed a grease pencil.
I didn’t know enough then to understand that even if I had drawn something a bit naughty, it wasn’t enough to qualify as obscene. If it had been obscene — and that is quite a high bar — it wouldn’t have been protected by the First Amendment. But it wasn’t that, it was just a sketch, a silly attempt by an aspiring cartoonist. I yielded to the pressure and used the grease pencil to change the offending part of the drawing on the page composite. The bowdlerization was completed using some black tape and an X-Acto knife.
I recall how I flushed with embarrassment.
Had I been in the campus newsroom, I might have had the courage to refuse. But I was across campus in the print shop, with angry authority figures telling me they couldn’t run my strip because it was improper. Afterward, I kept the incident to myself.
I was ashamed and desperately wished I’d never tried drawing a comic strip. I vowed never to do it again for publication, and I didn’t. I abandoned drawing comics forever as soon as I put the grease pencil down.
I censored myself.
It may have been one of the reasons I so desperately fought for the rights of my journalism students when I became a college publications adviser decades later. That old cartoon strip was something I’d tried to push out of my mind. I didn’t think I was angry about the incident at the time, just ashamed. Did I have any promise as a cartoonist? Probably not. But the next Art Spiegelman or Alison Bechdel may be thinking twice about putting thought to paper or pixels because of the Trump era attacks on free speech.
There is only one Kimmel, and his suspension and reinstatement has dominated the news. We are right to be concerned about the future of free expression in America, for journalists and cartoonists and late-night talk show hosts. But we should also be concerned about the chilling effect all of this has on the rest of us.
The most effective tool to silence dissent is not force, but shame.
If your views don’t match that of the current administration or its favored political movement, you may have had an uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach. I know I’ve had. You might think your views might be offensive to some of your friends and neighbors. I know mine are. Your cheeks might sometimes become flushed when trying to explain yourself. I’ve been there too.
But the thing is that disagreeing with somebody isn’t the same as wishing them harm. Neither is refusing to act with what government officials and influential others may regard as the proper deference. If they take offense at your rational and nonviolent opinion, the fault is theirs and not yours.
You may not think your opinion counts for much, that you don’t have anything to add, or that engaging in the sober debate over the deep issues that divide us is important. You might even feel that saying what you feel is right might be disrespectful. Or you might just want to tell a joke a draw a comic with a political bent. But it is all the kind of free and unfettered exchange a functioning democracy requires.
We’ve all felt so much political cringe and stepped-up outrage that our collective hair is standing on end.
But don’t let a bullet fired in Utah make you silence yourself. Speak out against political violence, always. But don’t allow others to make you so afraid of retribution, so deferential to power and authority, or so ashamed of your own beliefs that you stifle yourself.
In other words, Keep on Truckin’.

But here are a few tips for making your next ride frictionless.  These tips are mostly about riding Acela, but many hold true for slower Northeast Corridor trains.


What’s a NextGen Acela? These are the new trains built by Alstom, previously known as Avelia Liberty.  They hold 25% more passengers than the existing Acela trains and can, at least for 32 miles with fast, straight track in New Jersey, travel up to 160 mph compared to the old Acela’s 150 mph.
Just a few of the new trains are running so far but 26 are more on the way, replacing the older Acelas which will be retired.
Book early:  We booked our Acela tickets about two weeks in advance and scored senior fares (10% discount) of “only” $204 one way from Stamford to Washington D.C.  Waiting at the station to board I heard the ticket agent startle a younger passenger seeking a ticket to DC by quoting her the same-day walk-up fare of $402 one way.  A minute later the helpful agent said she could make the same trip a half-hour later (on the slower train) for half as much.
Reserved seats: Seats on all Acelas are now reserved.  But don’t trust the seating chart you’ll see online.  When we boarded the train we found our seats faced backwards (not in the direction of travel) and had no window.  But a helpful conductor found us better seats right on his phone.  Consult a third-party seating chart to make sure you get the seats you want.
If you want the Quiet Car, be aware there’s only one such car with 59 seats.  Otherwise you’ll be enjoying the “finance bro” across the aisle making deals enroute by phone.
Boarding advice: The cars on the NextGen Acela are much shorter than the regular trains, so position yourself carefully on the platform to minimize walking once the train arrives.  I noticed Amtrak staff at each station helping minimize “dwell time” for the train by getting passengers off and on as quickly as possible.
Use the Red Caps: If your train originates at your station, like our return from DC, get priority pre-boarding with the help of the Red Caps.  Avoiding the throngs queueing to board is worth a tip, even with reserved seats.
How’s the ride? In a word, spectacular.  All the Acelas run no faster than Metro-North in Connecticut, but south of New York City it’s a whole different railroad.  True to its promise our train hit 159 mph on the straightaways in New Jersey and the ride overall was very smooth, unlike the 25-year-old Amfleet cars or the 50-year-old Amfleet cars on the slower trains.
Service: Enroute the cabin cleaning staff came around to collect trash and Café Car items were available (credit cards only) from a cart moving between the cars.  The Café Car itself looked great with self-serve windows displaying the food items. But there are no tables to sit down, just some counters where you can perch and munch.  The food offerings were “premium” and priced accordingly.

The on-board Wi-Fi was spectacular… truly 5G.
On time? Like many Amtrak trains, even the super-Acela tends to run a few minutes late in Connecticut because of Metro-North traffic.  We departed about ten minutes late from Stamford but, because the schedule is padded, were on time out of Penn Station and arrived early in Washington D.C.
Is it worth trying?  Yes, at least once.  Amtrak has a lot riding on these new trainsets, so try one soon and you’ll see what the future will be like.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Acela-Engineer-runwaygirlnetwork-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-28 04:57:22.305214

Sean Bagniewski's annual fish-fry fundraiser in Des Moines on Sept. 27, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Democratic presidential nominating process may not begin in Iowa during future presidential nominating cycles, but politician Rahm Emanuel told a crowd of 400 Iowans Saturday the state will play an important role for Democrats in 2026 and beyond.
“I want you guys to have some confidence,” Emanuel said. “People bet on winners, and Iowa is where winners are made.”
Emanuel, who has served as former President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, a U.S. representative, former mayor of Chicago and U.S. ambassador to Japan, spoke at a fish-fry fundraiser for Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines. The longtime Democratic operative has not officially said whether he plans to run for president in the next election cycle — although he has made several comments indicating he is considering a run — and he did not bring up the future role of the Iowa Democratic caucuses in 2028 or beyond.
However, Emanuel did speak about his vision for national policies while answering questions on issues such as President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, Medicaid and education. Emanuel said he has spent more than 30 years trying to “unrig a system that is rigged” while working on issues such as gun regulation and health care access.
“I’m here to tell you, in confession, I’m done unrigging it – I’m going to rig it for the people that work hard and play by the rules,” Emanuel said.
Iowa lost its first-in-the-nation status beginning with the Democratic presidential nominating cycle in 2024 due to concerns with the reporting of results from the 2020 Democratic caucuses and Iowa’s use of the caucus process rather than primaries. While the Democratic National Committee is reconsidering its presidential nominating calendar for 2028, it currently seems unlikely that Iowa will regain its position.
This has not stopped Democrats like Emanuel, as well as other potential presidential hopefuls like U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego and former U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg from visiting the state in 2025.
On Saturday, Emanuel also said he believes Democratic candidates are in a good position heading into the 2026 midterms, highlighting the state’s gubernatorial, U.S. Senate and state auditor races, as well as congressional races. Emanuel joked that “I don’t want to put on my old Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee hat, but I see two (competitive seats) … Okay, I’m not going to tell you which two, but I see it” — likely referring to Iowa’s 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts, which have been rated by political forecasters as potential flips for Democrats.
He also brought up the victory of Iowa Sen. Catelin Drey, D-Sioux City, who won with 55% of the vote in an August special election against her Republican opponent Christopher Prosch for a seat formerly held by Republican Sen. Rocky De Witt of Lawton.
“I want the rest of America to know what Iowa’s doing, not the other way around,” Emanuel said. “You guys are leading the way. So, congratulations.”
Drey also spoke at the event, calling for Iowans who are upset with the GOP-led state and federal government to speak out, run for public office, and support Democratic candidates.
“Together we can do extraordinary things, but not if we are focused on playing nice and following the rules and waiting our turn,” Drey said. “So, this is our turn, and I would like for us to take it together.”
Bagniewski begins event with acknowledgement of DMPS superintendent arrest

Bagniewski began the event by making a statement about the detainment Friday of Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Ian Roberts. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said Roberts entered the U.S. in 1999 on a student visa and was not authorized to work in the country, in addition to being charged with illegally possessing weapons in 2020.
The DMPS school board placed Roberts on administrative leave during a special meeting Saturday. DMPS officials held a news conference Friday speaking about the incident, though they did not comment on the validity of DHS claims.
At the fundraising event, Bagniewski said his thoughts and prayers are with Roberts right now, as well as with teachers, parents and students across Des Moines. Bagniewski said after his son, Teddy, came home from school yesterday, he had a “hard conversation” about what occurred.
“Our community is grieving right now, and I hope we get to a better place on the other side of all this,” Bagniewski said.
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a statement earlier Saturday on the arrest where she spoke in support of enforcing immigration laws.
“The arrest on Friday of Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts was shocking, particularly his attempt to evade authorities, and the loaded gun, knife, and large sum of cash found in his vehicle,” Reynolds said in the statement. “The investigation is still underway, so I won’t comment on details of the case at this time. But I want to be clear: We are a nation of laws that must be enforced. Those who believe immigration laws are optional are dangerously wrong. When laws are ignored, or when people are led to believe there will be no consequences, our communities are at risk. Iowans won’t stand for that. We must enforce the law, every time, to protect our families and our future.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/emanuel.9.27.2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-27 22:57:01.718909

(Undated photo courtesy of Arkansas Department of Corrections)After pushback from members of her own party, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders late Friday changed the date of the general election to fill the vacant District 26 Senate seat from November 2026 to June.
The new general election date still comes after the end of the Legislature’s 2026 fiscal session, giving rise to complaints from Republicans and Democrats that citizens of the district will be unrepresented in next springs legislative fiscal session
Republican candidate Ted Tritt of Paris posted on Facebook Saturday: “Any step to shorten the time our people go unrepresented is encouraging,” but the new date remains “unacceptable.”
Tritt is one of three Republicans who have announced their intent to run; the others are Brad Simon, also of Paris, and former state Rep. Mark Berry of Ozark. No Democrats have entered the race so far.
The special election is being called to replace Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who died Sept. 2. 
State law requires a special election be held not more than 150 days after a legislative seat becomes vacant, unless the governor determines it is “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so.
Tritt, Simon and Arkansas Democratic Party Chair, retired Army Col. Marcus Jones all criticized the election dates as unfair to residents of the district, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties.
Stubblefield was a vocal opponent of a proposed 3,000-bed state prison in rural Franklin County supported by Sanders, and Simon and Tritt expressed concerns Friday that the area’s residents will be left without representation during likely discussions of prison funding in the fiscal session.

In her original and updated proclamations Friday, Sanders declared that holding the election within the 150-day window would be impractical and burdensome.
She originally set the special primary for the District 26 seat for March 3 and the general election for Nov. 3, 2026, dates which coincide with the state’s regular election schedule.
The revised election schedule kept the primary election on March 3, but moved the general election to June 9.
In a press release announcing the revised election dates, Sanders said that “after receiving feedback from the community and getting confirmation from election officials that a change while difficult is doable, I have decided to move up the general election date to expedite representation for the River Valley.”
Arkansas Democrats, in a Saturday press release, said Sanders is still “ignoring the law.”
“This is nothing but a bandaid to the serious bipartisan backlash she’s receiving, but she is still openly and scandalously defying Arkansas law,” Jones said in the release. “The Governor has a legal responsibility to fill this vacancy within 150 days, and the updated election date is still 130 days after that deadline.” 
“This general election date still leaves more than 85,000 Arkansans without representation in the Senate for 280 days: not only does that take away their say in the 2026 budget, but that means there is no one to reach out to when they need resources or assistance from Arkansas’s highest legislative body,” Jones said.
Tritt wrote on Facebook that “the reality remains: District 26 will still go through the spring fiscal session without a senator and clock over 250 days without representation. That’s well beyond what the law calls for, and far beyond what our families deserve.”
“Budgets will be written. Priorities will be set. Votes on the Franklin County prison project will be taken. Decisions will be made that affect our schools, our hospitals, our farms, and our jobs. And through all of it, the people of District 26 will not have a seat at the table,” he said.
Simon posted on Facebook Friday that letting the seat remain vacant for so long is “unconscionable, unacceptable, and unconstitutional.”

(Creative Commons CC0 1.0) A gunman shot and killed an employee at Eastern State Hospital early Saturday morning, according to the Spokane County sheriff’s office.
The suspect exchanged gunfire with police and was also pronounced dead on the scene, the sheriff’s office said. He was reportedly wearing tactical-type gear, and a rifle and handgun were found near him.
Eastern State Hospital is one of two state-run psychiatric hospitals for adults in Washington and is located in Medical Lake, Washington, west of Spokane.
“Preliminary information indicates that this armed suspect is believed to have been acting erratically in Medical Lake and possibly involved in three incidents that occurred in the same general time frame,” the sheriff’s office said.
These reports described a man making “wild statements,” including about aliens.
Firefighters responded to a brush fire around midnight and encountered a man yelling and acting aggressively. They requested police assistance, but the sheriff’s office said the man left the scene before deputies arrived.
Around 1:40 a.m., police received a call about a man with a rifle who entered a home and fired several shots as uninjured occupants hid.
About 15 minutes later, a caller reported the Eastern State Hospital employee had been shot in the hospital’s parking lot. The suspect took the employee’s radio and began transmitting messages over it about “an army coming,” police said.
“We grieve the tragic loss of life of an Eastern State Hospital employee who was murdered by an active shooter overnight at work,” Washington Federation of State Employees President Mike Yestramski said in a statement. “Senseless acts of violence like this have become an all too common reality these days.”

Tim Walz call a special legislative session to consider a ban on assault weapons.
The rally came more than a month after two children were killed and 21 other people injured, all of them children and senior citizens.
Brittany Haeg, whose six-year-old son David was injured in the shooting, urged lawmakers to act quickly and decisively. “I’m here to tell you as a Catholic, as a mother, as a human: prayers in place of action when you have the power to act are a betrayal of prayer itself.”

She described her experience testifying before a state Senate gun control working group, where she told lawmakers about her son’s injuries, “about the bullets that lacerated his spleen, about the shrapnel still scattered through his side, about the bullets that grazed his skull. Then I listened to other parents, to the doctors who saved David, to their anguish and their grief, to their fear.”
She then called out Republican Sen. Jeff How of Rockville.
“And then I listened to Sen. Howe tell me he couldn’t support a ban on assault rifles, or high capacity magazines,” she said, “because shooting guns with a 30-round magazine, like the one that nearly killed my son, is fun. Fun, he told us.”
Boos and hisses erupted from the crowd.
“Listen closely,” Haeg said, “Your silence is not neutral. Your silence is a choice.”

Republicans say an assault weapons ban is a violation of 2nd Amendment gun rights and won’t stop motivated killers from acquiring weapons.
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter spoke about the bittersweet feeling of dropping his children off for their first day of school, saying that his wife made note of where his daughter’s seat was in relationship to the windows and doors. “We are being robbed of our peace,” he said.
Tess Rada, whose 8-year-old daughter survived the shooting, spoke about the trauma of hearing the 116 shots inside of the church where her daughter prayed.
She read the names of children killed in recent school shootings in the United States, ending with Harper Moyski, 10, and Fletcher Merkel, 8. It took more than a minute to read the whole list.

(AP) — Sixteen states and the District of Columbia sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Friday, alleging that its threats to pull sexual education funding over curricula mentioning diverse gender identities were a violation of federal law.
The complaint filed in federal court in Oregon says the department is attempting to force the states to “rewrite sexual health curricula to erase entire categories of students” and describes the action as “the latest attempt from the current administration to target and harm transgender and gender-diverse youth.”
HHS did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
In a press release Friday, the Connecticut attorney general’s office said the Trump administration’s threat puts more than $1.6 million in funding, awarded through the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP), at risk. The state has used this funding to provide about 800 to 1,200 students a year with education programming aimed at reducing teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted infections, the office said. 
“Censorship and political propaganda will not protect teens from unplanned pregnancy or preventable disease,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “Teens deserve accurate, honest information to stay safe, and we’re suing to make sure they get it.”
Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, his administration has sought to recognize people as only male or female.
[RELATED: HHS orders CT, other states to remove gender from sex education]
HHS wants to prohibit the inclusion of what it describes as “gender ideology” in lessons funded by the PREP and the Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) program. The federal grants are used to teach about abstinence and contraception for the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
The plaintiffs say the grant conditions HHS is seeking to impose violate federal law, the separation of powers and Congress’ spending power. The termination of funding under the two federal grant programs could result in a loss of at least $35 million to the plaintiff states, according to the complaint.
HHS warned states in August that they had 60 days to change lessons or lose their PREP grants. California was warned previously, and its $12 million grant was stripped Aug. 21.
The states of Oregon, Washington and Minnesota are co-leading the lawsuit.
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement that HHS threatened to cancel PREP grants if his state didn’t remove language from a high school curriculum that says: “People of all sexual orientations and gender identities need to know how to prevent pregnancy and STIs, either for themselves or to help a friend.”
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said the “choice between losing funding and cutting sexual health education programs or excluding the transgender community from those programs is unacceptable.”
The other plaintiffs include Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Wisconsin.

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)County election officials are required to accurately report when  voters’ mail-in ballots have been set aside because of disqualifying errors and allow their votes to be counted on provisional ballots, Pennsylvania’s highest court ruled.
The state Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision Friday upholds lower court rulings that Washington County election officials violated voters’ rights by misleading them about the status of their mail-in ballots. 
This prevented voters from challenging the board’s decision to disqualify 259 vote-by-mail ballots or casting provisional ballots as a backup to ensure their votes were counted, the courts said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We must interpret the Election Code and its statutory procedures in a way that ‘favors the fundamental right to vote and enfranchises, rather than disenfranchises, the electorate,’” Justice Kevin Dougherty wrote for the majority, quoting the court’s 2020 decision resolving issues surrounding the then-new vote-by-mail law. 
“Reading the Code as allowing county boards to withhold readily available information from voters does not serve that goal,” Dougherty wrote.
Mimi McKenzie, legal director of the Public Interest Law Center, which represented voters and voting rights advocates in the case, said the right to vote is fundamental and the foundation of the nation’s democracy.
“Yesterday’s decision is a win for voters. Boards of Election cannot segregate mail-in ballots with disqualifying envelope errors and then withhold that information. Voters should be afforded an opportunity to cast a provisional ballot if they make a paperwork mistake on their mail-in ballot envelope,” she said.  
The Republican Party of Pennsylvania, which filed the appeal along with the Republican National Committee, and the Pennsylvania Democratic Party did not respond to the Capital-Star’s requests for comment.
The decision stems from a decision by the Washington County Board of Elections days before the 2024 primary to rescind a policy of notifying voters about disqualifying errors on their ballot declarations such as missing signatures or dates. 
The policy allowed voters to correct errors, request a fresh mail-in ballot or vote provisionally at their polling places on Election Day.

Instead, elections office workers were instructed to stamp ballots with the date and time they were received and make a decision whether to set aside ballots with obvious disqualifying errors such as a missing signature or date. All ballots were also scanned into the state’s electronic voting system and recorded as “ballot received,” regardless of whether they were segregated for errors.
This prompted the system to automatically generate an email stating that the ballot had been received, and that if the “election office identifies an issue with your ballot envelopes that prevents the ballot from being counted, you may receive another notification.” Otherwise, the email stated, voters would not receive any further messages and would not be able to vote at their polling locations on Election Day.
It also caused the poll books at voting locations to indicate that a voter had cast a mail ballot, preventing those whose ballots were set aside from casting provisional ballots.
A group of seven disenfranchised voters backed by the Center for Coalfield Justice and the Washington Branch NAACP filed a challenge in July 2024, claiming the board’s new policy violated voters’ constitutional rights to due process of law. A Washington County judge ruled in their favor and a 2-1 Commonwealth Court panel affirmed the decision on appeal.
In his opinion for the Supreme Court majority, Dougherty said the RNC and Pennsylvania Republican Party’s arguments that the board of elections should be allowed to “hide the readily ascertainable status of electors’ mail-in ballots” would punish voters for common errors. He added that their positions are at odds with both the Election Code and the commonwealth’s longstanding practice and policy of protecting the right to vote.
While the courts have affirmed that the Election Code does not provide for voters to “cure” defective ballots, Dougherty scolded the Republican Party for characterizing voters who make minor mistakes as “noncompliant” and “fingerwagging” that the legislature has “forbidden do-overs.”
“But this case is not about do-overs. It is not about correcting a defective mail-in ballot return packet. It is not about a “second bite” at the proverbial apple, and it is not about double-voting,” Dougherty wrote. 
“It is about allowing a voter who made a mistake on a mail-in ballot return packet — the kind of mistake that will likely disqualify the ballot and invalidate the elector’s attempt to vote — to avail herself of the remaining “fail-safe” attempt to exercise her fundamental right: completing a provisional ballot on Election Day,” he wrote.

Dougherty added that in that case, the state voting system is designed to ensure that only the provisional ballot would be counted, or if the mail-in ballot is counted, then the provisional ballot is thrown away.
“In both scenarios, however, the only way the elector gets her single vote counted is to be given the easily accessible information that was intentionally withheld in this case,” he said.
Justice Kevin Brobson issued a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice David Wecht, in which he cited a fundamental disagreement with the majority on whether a mail-in ballot with missing signatures or dates is actually void and whether provisional voting is allowed. He also expressed concerns about a lack of consistency across the state in whether voters should be allowed to correct such errors. 
“Like existing county-by-county “notice and cure” practices, the Majority’s decision here provides another data point upon which electors can reasonably question whether our elections meet the promise of equality and uniformity guaranteed by our state charter,” Brobson said.
Justice Sallie Mundy issued a separate dissenting opinion in which she added her concerns about the fairness of the state electronic election system notifying voters their mail ballots are disqualified because providing an email is optional when registering to vote.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7447-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-27 11:57:27.993073

(Photo by Ken Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Current reporter Alexander Castro won a first place A-Mark Prize at the New England Newspaper & Press Association (NENPA) fall publishers conference for his reporting on the RIBridges data breach. 
The prize for investigative journalism came with $5,000 cash for Castro and an additional $2,500 for Rhode Island Current. Funding comes from the A-Mark Foundation.
The awards ceremony occurred on the second day of the NENPA conference at The Hotel Northampton in Northampton, Massachusetts. This year’s conference was jointly hosted by the New York Press Association, and A-Mark Prizes were given to three reporters in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont. There were not enough entries for A-Mark Prizes from Maine and New Hampshire news outlets, according to the event program, although NENPA hopes to award A-Marks in these states next year. 
“The Prize will reward ambitious, well-researched reporting that may expose a wrong, hold powerful individuals accountable, or explore a complex problem, issue, or subject,” the prize application read. The judging panel for each state consisted of journalists, editors, journalism educators, and investigative reporters. 
Castro’s winning entry on the RIBridges data breach spanned reportage published from December to May, when the state’s public benefits systems was hacked and the data leaked online. Around 650,000 residents were affected, according to state officials. After the initial wave of reporting on the breach had subsided, Rhode Island Current coverage revealed that a state request for proposals posted months before the hack contained a system architecture diagram — a blueprint for possible intrusion. Castro notified officials and Rhode Island Current delayed publication until after the documents were taken down. 
Providence Journal writers Mark Reynolds and Jack Perry placed second and third, respectively, in Rhode Island’s batch of A-Mark prizes. 
Rhode Island Current content partner Connecticut Mirror won first and third place A-Mark prizes in its state.
At last year’s fall publishers conference in Providence, NENPA named Rhode Island Current the region’s Online News Publication of the Year. That competition was judged by New England readers. NENPA announced there is no Online News Publication award for 2025 because judges did not receive enough entries to consider.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)During the last legislative session, lawmakers passed Gov. Larry Rhoden’s bill designed to help homeowners get relief from the high cost of paying property taxes. Don’t expect that to be the last word on the subject.
Dramatic increases in property taxes have given rise to some strident calls for change. Owner-occupied dwellings, in particular, have seen their property tax bills increase. While the Legislature is certainly listening to those complaints, as yet it is still struggling to find relief for property owners who say they are seeing the ability to keep living in their homes slipping away.
The property tax problems in South Dakota were neatly summed up during an educational panel at Dakotafest, as noted in a story in the Mitchell Republic. South Dakota Retailers Executive Director Nathan Sanderson said that when the subject is property tax relief, the state has three choices: shift the burden to another class of property, ask schools and counties to spend less, or find another funding source.
None of those solutions have many backers, though finding another funding source is part of the solution offered by Rhoden. He has proposed allowing counties to voluntarily impose a sales tax of up to half a percent with the funds to be used for relief of residential property taxes. This is a stopgap measure at best and sure to have its detractors in the Republican-controlled Legislature, because it calls for a new tax.
From property to purchases: Task force considering fundamental tax shift to reduce homeowner burden

Rhoden already has one property tax win, with the passage of a complex law designed to offer homeowners some relief. The new law, which took effect July 1, limits the increase in owner-occupied residential assessments to 3% countywide for five years; sets a five-year, 3% cap on the amount taxing districts and school capital outlay budgets can increase as a result of new construction; exempts some home improvements worth less than 40% of a home’s value from affecting assessments; and expands eligibility among disabled and elderly people for property tax assessment freeze programs, including an increase in the multi-person household income limit from $45,000 to $65,000, and an increase in the maximum value of an eligible home from $300,000 to $500,000.
While that legislation has many moving parts, it represents only a portion of a tax system that lawmakers were admonished to study by another Dakotafest panel member. Former state senator Mary Duvall said lawmakers should do their homework, learning about the state’s tax system so they know what they’re talking about and have the expertise to assess the impact of their legislation.
The need for expertise in how the system works can be seen in a proposed constitutional amendment offered by former legislator Julie Frye-Mueller, among others. That amendment has not yet been approved for circulation to gather signatures.
If approved by voters, the amendment would scrap property taxes and instead levy a $1.50 fee on transactions of $15 or more and a 10% fee on purchases of less than $15. These fees would be charged over and above the sales taxes that are already on the books.
The Legislative Research Council, which has to review all proposed constitutional amendments, said its passage would change everything as it relates to the funding of counties and schools. Passage of the amendment would also rely on the Legislature to design a way to collect the tax, establish a distribution formula and manage a new property tax replacement fund.
Those blank spots in the amendment will certainly ask voters to take plenty on faith if they were to vote for the new system. The next step in the process of approving the amendment for circulation is creating a fiscal impact statement which will show if the new tax, at a buck-and-a-half a purchase, could actually generate enough money to keep schools and counties afloat.
The proposed amendment shows the folly of trying to fix the state’s tax system in a piecemeal fashion. Like the 18 property tax bills in the 2025 legislative session or the dozens that will likely show up in 2026, they only go to show that there’s no one solution to revamping the system.
As Sanderson pointed out at Dakotafest, the Legislature has been “schizophrenic” lately when it comes to taxes, cutting the sales tax and considering elimination of the sales tax on groceries. Lawmakers do this, all the while proposing legislation that’s supposed to “fix” property taxes, often without including a way to replace the funding.
According to Sanderson, the Legislature has conducted summer studies of property taxes three times in the last five years. With summer winding down, let’s hope that this year’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force can decide on a way forward that makes sense for the state.
That may be a lot to hope for since past summer studies apparently haven’t alleviated the pressure felt by the state’s property taxpayers. The scope of these studies is too narrow. It would be best for the state to widen the study and take on all taxes, rather than just property taxes. A comprehensive study is needed because it’s obvious that a change in property taxes is likely to have ramifications for the state’s entire tax system.

Alex Padilla visits San Diego immigration court: ‘This should not be a trap’,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/09/alex-padilla-visits-san-diego-immigration-court/,Sen. Alex Padilla observed immigration court in San Diego this week in order to get a better understand of the issues that people face in proceedings.,"In summary
Sen. Alex Padilla observed immigration court in San Diego this week in order to get a better understand of the issues that people face in proceedings. 


When Sen. Alex Padilla attended an immigration hearing at the federal courthouse in San Diego Wednesday, there were no confrontations with federal officials and no public arrests of people attending immigration check-ins. 
Instead, the visit revealed the confusion involved in legal proceedings conducted in multiple languages, over virtual platforms, amid a federal campaign of mass deportations.
Padilla, a member of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship and Border Security, said he wanted to observe the issues that people face in immigration proceedings.
“In that capacity as part of our oversight responsibilities in the Senate I came to see firsthand what we’ve been hearing for months and months now,” he said at a press conference after the visit. “Not just the stops, the detentions, the arrests on the streets through this immigration enforcement activity by this administration, but even people who have been in the system coming in from periodic check-ins, trying to comply with the conditions of their status.”
In May, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested 11 people after their hearings at San Diego Immigration Court and placed them in a process called expedited removal, as part of a nationwide effort to fast track deportations.
This month, a San Diego law firm challenged courthouse arrests in a lawsuit filed on behalf of two asylum seekers. The complaint argues that those arrests are unconstitutional and erode the integrity of the asylum process.
There were no such detentions on Wednesday, but Padilla said he wanted to make sure no one was arrested while complying with the immigration process.
“Whether people are quote unquote ‘playing by the rules,’ they should not be penalized for them,” he said. “This should not be a trap.” 
Padilla made headlines in June after he entered a Los Angeles press conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and was tackled by her security officers and forcibly removed. 
Noem said he barged into the room and interrupted the event, but Padilla said he attended peacefully and properly identified himself. Videos of the incident illustrate the tension between President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration raids and California officials’ efforts to oversee enforcement action within the state.
On Wednesday, Padilla highlighted his low-key appearance at the San Diego court hearing.
“I sat quietly in the back,” he said. “I want to make sure I emphasize that, because I was not disrupting, not recording, was not interfering with the procedures, and saw multiple people who were scheduled to be before judges today in person. The judge was not in person. The judge was remote.”
While the judge’s appearance over video is legal, Padilla said, it can limit their ability to observe and communicate with defendants.
“When a judge is not present in person to be able to read body language, and is remote and virtual, that also is not ideal,” Padilla said, adding that immigration courts need more judges to handle the volume of cases generated through increased ICE enforcement.

The first defendant Wednesday was a young Haitian man. Although the Wednesday hearing was simply an intake procedure that did not cover the substance of his immigration status or case, it included multiple miscommunications.
Judge Olga Attia appeared on screen, introduced herself and learned that he needed a Creole interpreter. The interpreter also logged in remotely, but poor audio quality made it hard to follow the discussion.
Attia learned that the defendant had recently moved, so she ordered a recess while he completed a change of address form. 
While he filled that out, she called the second defendant, who confirmed that he spoke English and Bengali, but did not need an interpreter and did not have legal representation. It turned out that he too had recently changed his address and needed to fill out the form.
Shifting back to the Haitian man, Attia tried to establish the basic details of his residence, educational status and guardianship. But the attorney representing him said the client had been “unresponsive and uncooperative” and had not returned calls. Because of that, he and his co-counsel asked to withdraw from the case. The defendant said his phone wasn’t working, so he couldn’t receive his attorneys’ calls or messages.
“I guess if I share a couple of takeaways it’s in some ways the inefficiency of the process, whether it’s the need for additional access to counsel in person, or whether it’s the need for translation services,” Padilla said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092425_Padilla-SD-Court_AH_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-27 10:59:00.898233

WILMINGTON — Sussex Central lined up in punt formation on their own side of the field trailing Salesianum by ten early in the third quarter. The Golden Knights appeared ready to punt the ball away after their first drive of the second half was halted by the Sallies defense. Instead, the snap went directly into the hands of senior William Harmon, shocking the Salesianum special teams unit.
Harmon flew down the right side of the field all the way to the Salesianum 24 yard line before he was taken down by a few Sallies defenders. The fake punt paid off a few plays later when senior quarterback Josiah Cannon connected with Harmon down the right sideline for a 20-yard score to draw within three points. That’s the closest the score would be the rest of the night.
Sallies scored 21 unanswered points following the Golden Knights’ successful third quarter drive defeating Sussex Central, 31-7, Friday night at Abessinio Stadium.
Sallies’ defense was strong throughout the evening holding a powerful Golden Knight offense under 30 points for the first time this season. Sallies was able to slow down Sussex Central’s mighty running game and force a couple of turnovers to earn their first regular season victory over Sussex Central since 2021.
One of those turnovers was a pick six from junior Jett Healy that he ran back 28-yards for his second of two touchdowns in the game. Healy’s pick six occurred with less than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter capping off a streak of three straight drives ending with Salaesianum points.
Healy’s first touchdown of the game started the scoring streak.
Following the Golden Knights score at the start of the third quarter, Sallies began their drive at their own 38 yard line. Salesianum marched down the field all the way to the Sussex two yard line where Healy took a wildcat snap into the endzone to restore Sallies’ lead to ten.
EstherVell Cotton followed Healy on Sallies next offensive possession, running outside the right tackle for a 23-yard score in the fourth quarter. Senior Devin Hasan was the only other Sallies player to record a touchdown catching a nine yard throw from quarterback Brady Nabb on Salesianum’s first possession of the game.
Sallies’ win boosts their record to .500 after a couple tough losses to two out-of-state powerhouses in LaSalle College High School and Malvern Prep High School. Sallies is undefeated this season when playing in state competition, beginning the year with a win over Red Lion.
Sussex Central’s loss is its second in as many games. The Golden Knights started the year with two straight victories over West Philadelphia High School in Pennsylvania and Woodbridge, but lost to Hodgson a week ago. The road doesn’t get easier for the Golden Knights as they head home for a matchup with Middletown next week.

By Paul Draus, University of Michigan-Dearborn
Watching the space between two nations shrink became a regular pastime for Detroiters over the past decade as the segments of the Gordie Howe International Bridge gradually grew, extending meter by meter from Ontario on one side and Michigan on the other.
The gap finally closed in July 2024 with the two halves coming together in a long-awaited kiss.
The official grand opening of the bridge was originally scheduled for fall of 2025, but it seems now likely to be delayed into 2026.
I’m a sociologist who has worked alongside neighborhood revitalization projects in Detroit for the past 15 years. I’ve observed the bridge project – and the many tensions around it – from the perspective of adjacent communities of Delray and Mexicantown, communities that are largely home to low-income Latino, Black and white residents.
The costs and benefits of this binational behemoth are complex and intertwined.
 Clearing a chokehold

Boosters on both sides of the border have spoken frequently of the bridge’s expected benefits.
Detroit and Windsor would finally be free of the perpetual chokehold produced by the privately owned Ambassador Bridge.
Auto parts will flow more freely over the border, according to the Cross-Border Institute at the University of Windsor. And the Detroit Greenways Coalition is celebrating that its advocacy led to the inclusion of free pedestrian and bike lanes.
People living close to the existing bridge will gain some relief from truck traffic and pollution. But this burden won’t simply disappear – it will be shifted nearby, where others will have to cope with increased traffic flowing over six lanes 24 hours a day.

 A political football

The costs and benefits of the bridge were contested from the beginning.
In the early days, the debate concentrated on who would own the bridge and who would pay for it.
Once just a concept known by the acronym DRIC, or Detroit River International Crossing, the project became real under former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder. In July 2018, representatives from both Ottawa and Washington broke ground on the bridge situated in an area of Detroit empty enough to contain its significant footprint and bear its weight without fear of sinkholes from underground salt mines.
“Every Michigander should thank every Canadian,” said Snyder at the time, alluding to the agreement that Canadian taxpayers alone would pay for the bridge’s construction in exchange for collecting all the tolls.
The bridge’s designers attempted to honor the cultural and natural history of the region. It was named after the legendary Canadian hockey player who was also a longtime stalwart for the Detroit Red Wings. The bridge’s towers are adorned with murals by First Nations artists.
But serious questions remain.
Today the debates center on whether the Trump administration’s increased tariffs and trade conflicts with Canada could negatively affect the value of the bridge – and if it will ever pay for itself. Even before President Donald Trump took office for the second time, truck traffic on the Ambassador Bridge was down, falling 8% from 2014 to 2024.

 One bridge was always a bad idea, (nearly) everyone agreed

Residents and politicians have long agreed that having a single, privately owned bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor was a bad idea. This felt especially apparent after the 9/11 terrorist attacks laid bare the possibility of suddenly losing critical infrastructure.
For many years, travelers’ only other connection between Canada and Detroit has been a tunnel that runs underneath the Detroit River. However, the tunnel doesn’t offer direct access to interstate highways, making it less suitable for commercial trucks.
Adding another bridge makes it harder to disrupt trade and transport.
But the project has had one stalwart critic. Matty Moroun, the trucking billionaire who purchased the Ambassador Bridge in 1979, ferociously protected his asset against potential competition. He actively sought to thwart the construction, launching numerous lawsuits against the state of Michigan and the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, the entity managing construction of the new bridge.
Those lawsuits continued even after Moroun’s death in 2020, as his heirs asserted significant damages to the value of their property.
 Was enough done for nearby homeowners?

Others have criticized the attempts to compensate the residents of Delray, a once-vibrant neighborhood that has been impacted by industrialization since the 1960s.
Benefits negotiated for residents and homeowners affected by the construction have not increased as the project’s costs ballooned and the timeline to complete it stretched out.
The cost of the Gordie Howe bridge is now estimated at around $6.4 billion Canadian – or about $US4.7 billion. That is $700 million more than the original projected cost. The project is at least 10 months behind schedule.

Simone Sagovac, director of the SW Detroit Community Benefit Coalition, said they did not anticipate the immense scale of the development and its continued effects on the community.
“That scale affected health and quality of life significantly every day, with years of continuous industrial dust causing sinus problems, headaches, and increasing asthma, and then there will be thousands of daily truck impacts to come,” Sagovac wrote to me in an email.
A baseline health impact assessment, issued in 2019 by University of Michigan researchers working closely with the coalition, expressed concern about the heightened airborne pollution that would likely activate asthma, especially in children. Matching the findings of so many other epidemiological studies, the assessment found that residents living within 500 feet (152 meters) of a truck route reported a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing asthma or allergies affecting their breathing.
Sagovac wrote that the project took 250 homes, 43 businesses and five churches by eminent domain, and “saw the closing of more after.” One hundred families left the neighborhood via a home swap program funded as a result of the benefits agreement administered by a local nonprofit. Two hundred and seventy families remain, but most businesses have left the area over decades of decline.
The families that remain are often long-term residents wanting or needing a cheap place to live and willing to put up with dust, noise and smells from nearby factories and a sewage treatment plant.
“They constantly face illegal dumping and other unanswered crimes, and will face the worst diesel emissions exposure and other trucking and industry impacts,” Sagovac wrote.
Heather Grondin, chief relations officer of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, wrote in
that they have taken steps to minimize impacts from construction and that they regularly meet with the community to hear concerns.
“Construction traffic is using designated haul routes to minimize community impacts, traffic congestion and wear and tear on existing infrastructure while maximizing public and construction safety,” Grondin wrote.
According to Grondin, cars will be forced to follow a “no idling” rule on the American side to minimize pollution. Other aspects of the Community Benefits Plan included $20,000 in free repairs for 100 homes, planting hundreds of trees and investing in programs addressing food insecurity and the needs of young people and seniors, Grondin wrote.
An updated Health Impacted Assessment is expected to be released later in 2025.
 History lost

Lloyd Baldwin, a historian for the Michigan Department of Transportation, was tasked with evaluating whether local landmarks like the legendary Kovacs Bar needed to be preserved.
“Kovacs Bar was one among many working-class bars in the Delray neighborhood but stands out for its roughly eight-decade association as a gathering place for the neighborhood and downriver Hungarian-American community,” Baldwin wrote in one such report.
The bar was nonetheless demolished in November 2017.
This was not MDOT’s only loss. While the agency made some sincere efforts to leverage other benefits for residents who remained, dynamic factors at many levels were out of the agency’s control.
For one thing, the numerous lawsuits filed by the bridge company over parcels of contested land limited MDOT’s ability to talk openly to the public about the land acquisition process.
In the period of legal limbo, Baldwin said, “the neighborhood imploded.”
Baldwin gave the example of the Berwalt Manor Apartments, built in the 1920s and located on Campbell Street near the bridge entrance. MDOT committed to preserve the historic building and proposed to mitigate the environmental impacts on mostly low-income residents by paying for new windows and HVAC units once the bridge was built.
But the speed of development outstripped the pace of community compensation. The building passed through probate court in 2018 and has since , so it is now unclear whether there are any low-income residents left to benefit from upgrades.
 Benefits yet to be measured

On the brighter side, environmentalists have pointed to the expansion and connection of bicycle trails and bird migration corridors as long-term benefits of the Gordie Howe bridge.
On the Canadian side, the bridge construction falls largely outside of Windsor’s residential neighborhoods, so it caused less disruption. As part of the project,bike lanes, enhanced landscaping, and gathering spaces were added to an approach road called Sandwich Street.
Cross-border tourism spurred on by a proposed system of greenways called the “Great Lakes Way” may provide new opportunities for people and money to flow across the Detroit River, improving the quality of life for communities that remain.
But if the trade war between the Trump administration and Canada continues, observers may question whether the bridge is a graceful gift of infrastructure to two nations or one of the world’s longest and skinniest white elephants.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Gov. Bill Lee’s Friday press conference about deploying the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis was long on spectacle but short on substance. 
Troops are set to arrive as soon as next week, but the public was given no clear sense of what success is supposed to look like. Will crime fall by 5%, 10% or 15% in the next two weeks, two months, or two years? Without concrete metrics, there is no way to hold the governor, local law enforcement or federal partners accountable.
The lack of clarity stretched across every level of leadership. When the police Chief C.J. Davis and the representative of the U.S. Marshals Service were asked who would lead on the ground, their answers were evasive. Neither the governor, Mayor Paul Young nor Davis offered a straightforward response. 
Lee didn’t even specify how many National Guard members will be deployed. Will it be 5? 15? 50? 150? This basic question, which is central to any credible plan, was left unanswered. Vagueness became the theme of the entire press conference, leaving Memphians in a dangerous position: our city is being reshaped by policies that lack definition, direction or accountability.

This is not public safety! This is what the civil rights lawyer and author Alec Karakatsanis calls “Copaganda.” 
Copaganda is the performance of policing and punishment designed to give the illusion of safety while avoiding the work of justice. It’s a press conference without a plan, a parade of uniforms without a measurable goal, the deployment of soldiers without a clear mission. It reassures some in the public while distracting from the deeper failures of leadership. And too often, it leaves Black communities carrying the burden of mass incarceration.
The problem is bigger than one press conference. Earlier this year, the Trump administration redirected federal funds away from local intervention programs that were making an impact on the ground in Memphis. Instead of supporting community-based organizations working to stop the violence, those resources are now being shifted into heavier-handed law enforcement tactics. 
And in May, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division announced it would close its investigation into the Memphis Police Department and retract a December 2024 report addressing constitutional violations by police. 
What we are witnessing now is the outgrowth of that failure: an overreliance on police and military muscle while underinvesting in the people and programs that actually reduce crime.
Even the language being used is misleading. When elected officials refer to  the National Guard “resources,” they distort the truth. Memphis doesn’t need more armed patrols in our neighborhoods; it needs jobs, counselors, after-school programs, trauma care and sustained investments in our young people. Calling soldiers “resources” is the kind of rhetorical trick that Copaganda thrives on — it makes people believe help is on the way, when in fact the wrong kind of help is being forced upon us.
Lee’s maneuvers also reek of political calculation. Memphis — a majority Black, majority Democratic city — is being used as a pawn to appease President Donald Trump and bolster the governor’s national ambitions. Instead of addressing poverty, underfunded schools or inadequate healthcare, we are handed a militarized stunt with no exit strategy and no clear measures of success.



				The vagueness of Gov. Bill Lee’s press conference leaves Memphians in a dangerous position: our city is being reshaped by policies that lack definition, direction or accountability.			


And make no mistake: when the cameras leave, it will be Black Memphians left holding the bag. The likely outcome of this so-called “test case” is more police contact, more arrests, more incarceration — and none of the long-term safety or justice our city desperately needs. Copaganda creates the appearance of urgency while avoiding the accountability of results.
If Memphis is truly the stage for this experiment, then those responsible must be required to state plainly what they are testing, how they will measure progress, and who will take responsibility when the results fall short. Until then, we must call this deployment what it is: not a strategy for safety, but a spectacle of Copaganda.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The phrase ‘government shutdown’ is younger than most members of Congress.
Fifty years ago, government shutdowns didn’t exist. But now, each fall, the nation groans as Congress turns one of its most fundamental duties — passing a budget — into a manufactured crisis. As the deadline approaches, Congress stalls, and shutdown threats dominate the headlines until a stopgap measure is slapped together at the eleventh hour.
The calendar is no secret, yet Washington repeats the same frustrating cycle as though the budget deadline appeared out of nowhere. It appears to be high drama, but it’s a failure of legislative responsibility and an executive misstep that traces back to the Carter administration.
Trump threatens mass firings of federal employees in a government shutdown

Shutdowns were never meant to be part of our constitutional system. They emerged in 1980, when a 19th-century law was unilaterally reinterpreted by the Carter administration to allow distinctions between “essential” and “nonessential” services and require agencies to close when appropriations lapse.
For nearly two centuries before that, the federal government continued to function during budget gaps. The founders designed a republic where Congress — through open debate and compromise — would set priorities and authorize spending, not one where the threat of chaos could be wielded as leverage.
A proposal is on the table to get us off this embarrassing and costly budget shutdown merry-go-round. The “Prevent Government Shutdowns Act” (S. 2721/ H.R. 5130) would ensure that the government remains open while forcing Congress to stay in session until the budget work is done. This puts budget pressure where it belongs: on Congress, not on families.
Services would continue uninterrupted, but no new business would be funded. Worker furloughs and backpay bloat would no longer be an issue. Ending shutdown brinkmanship removes the distraction of manufactured crises and requires lawmakers to fulfill their core duty: deliberate, transparent budgeting on behalf of the people they represent.
States have already shown the way. Rhode Island, Wisconsin and North Carolina have automatic continuing appropriations that keep last year’s budget rolling until a new one is passed. Just this year, Kansas joined them. If statehouses can manage it, Congress can too. This isn’t just about protecting programs from disruption — it’s about restoring accountability to the branch of government constitutionally charged with the power of the purse.
Why does this matter? Because the budget isn’t just another bill. The budget drives all policy.
Every decision, from defense to Social Security to small grant programs, flows through the appropriations process. Failure to pass a budget undermines public trust, disrupts services for veterans and families, and rattles the economy. It also leads to “continuing resolutions” that freeze priorities in place instead of encouraging thoughtful decisions about where taxpayer dollars should go.
The shutdown prevention bill would restore predictability, protect taxpayers, and reinforce the legislative branch’s constitutional role. It would also remove the leverage small factions currently hold when they threaten shutdowns. For those who value limited government, this is exactly what we should want: a Congress that does its core job of budgeting responsibly.
This is why Mountain States Policy Center recently joined an open letter led by Americans for Prosperity urging Congress to pass these reforms. It reads, in part, “Automatic continuing appropriations advance inclusive, effective, legislature-driven budgeting. We urge Congress to enact the Prevent Government Shutdowns Act as soon as possible. It would strengthen America’s fiscal democracy, help Congress succeed, and support a more timely and effective appropriations process. Americans deserve a government that works.”
Shutdowns are a modern invention that weaken public trust and create unnecessary turmoil. Theatrics make headlines; statesmanship makes history. It’s time Congress chooses wisely.
